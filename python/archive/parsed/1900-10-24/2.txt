DEMOCRATIC VERSION oF THER
“ODELL" LETTER RUN DOWN,
McGuire Says, Ask ‘Marphy Marphy Says,

Ask James Otis Woodward Meanwhile Re
publicans Track the Keal Letter, Which
| Bears No Resemblance to the Forgery
The chief oceupation of the Democratl

campaign managers since Friday of last week
haa been to dodge the responsibility for the
forged letter which was given out for publica-
tion by Chairman McGuire of the Democratio |
State Executive Committee This letter, it
will be remembered, purported to be addrexsed |
to a Republican of Greenwich, Washington |
county, and to be signed by Chairman Odell |
ef the Republican State Committee Mayor |
MoGuire furnished to the preas a typewritten
manuscript which he said was
by ex-Senator Murphy, and which purported
to be a verbatim copy of a letter asking the
Washington county Republican to send to Mr
Odell the names of ten independent Demo-
orats in his district who could be “influenced”
to vote the Republican ticket,
Mr. Odell of the expense involved Aas sor
| as Mr. Odell was aaked about the letter he de-
| nounced it as a fraud and a forgery. When
this information was taken to Mayor McGuire
he said that the letter was furnished to
| by Senator Murphy and that afMidavite would
| be provided to back it up
