The Hon, Richard Croker spent yesterday it

Tammany Hall and did not get away from there
until after § o'clock Mr. Croker has @ great
many things to think about these days. The
Tammany chieftain is directing personally
the activities of his Leutenants, who are holding
meetings in every Assembly district in the
city every evening. Hie is overseeing planus
for the demonstration in favor of free
silver which Tammany is to make on
the evening of Nov. 8 Mr. Croker has been
nformed that there is a good deal of dissatis-
faction among Tammany workers and leaders
throa@ghout the city over the result of the row
between Street Cleaning Cotnissioner Nagle
and President Haffen of the borough of The
Bronx in the Twenty-first Senate district
Mr. HafYen had a majority of the delegates,
but Nagleheld .nother convention and the Po-
lice Board's decision in favor of Nagle's can-
didate was rendered on Saturday, the last day
for getting on the official ballot, at an hour
which made it impossible for Haffen to appeal
to the cours with apy practical chance of suc
cess, Haffen is said to be much disgusted,

and his friends declare that he is going to quit
Tammany Hall and that it would not take inuch
to induce him to join in @ light agalust Mr,

Universally Imitated.

The
Steinway
Piano

differs from all others not only

in degree but in kind, Univer.
sally imitated, it has never been
reproduced. When you buy a
Steinway piano, you buy a
quality of tone that can be had
under no other name and for
no smaller price.

It is the supreme merit of the
Steinway, that years of use do not
destroy its characteristic quality.
