advantages under any form whatever,”"

The clause of the agreement to which we
have referred intimates in a diplomatic
way that, ifon any pretence Russia should
j try to keep Manchuria, the two contracting
j parties will consider the advisability of con-
| atraining her to respect China’s territo-

the Berlin Government, Itis idle to deny
that, since Germany's despatch of a large
military forceto the Far Kast and since the
material enlargement of her fleet in Chi-
nese waters, there has been a good deal of
uneasiness touching the nature and extent
of the claims which she might ultimately
press upon the Pekin Government,

It is certain that, had Germany upon any

would have been generally recognized that

McDermott Kicks Two Great Demo-
cratic Issues,

The Hon. ALLEN McDermott, Demo-
cratic candidate for Congressman in the
Seventh New Jersey district, knows which
side his bread is buttered on. New Jersey
cannot be lured into consenting to the free
coinage of silver. New Jersey, as sensible
as she is rich, is hospitable to the Trusts
and makes money out of them. So Mr
McDermott, standing on a platform that
calla generally and specifically for 16 to 1
and the destruction of the Trusts, told the
Elizabeth Democrats Saturday night that
neither the money question nor the ques-
tion of Trusts is an issue in this campaign.
He jauntily tossed away two great Demo-
cratic issues, both of which are fanatical
and dangerous attacks upon business;
and he only dared to talk about imperial-
ism, a harmless phantom, what the Malays
call a “ ghost tiger’

Mr McDenmorrt's standing as an ortho-
dox Bryanite will not be impaired by his
rejection of much of the Democratic plat-
form, Hide this fasue here; make most
of that issue there; suppress anything
that you think the voters wont swallow
that is the Bryanite polley in this cam-
paign. Still, it bea little irritating
to the sincere Worshippers of the Chicago

to see a Democratic

gress ina district that is, or at least was tn
isu8, absurdly and hopelessly Democratic,
denying two main Bryanite tenets and
calmly kicking away not only the special
Bryan issue of silver, but also the Trust
ixsue, about whieh tn this campaign Me

Bryan has bellowed more and louder than
about except his tiger

Col. Lawton quotes from the late Jonn

We shall now combat
that except so far as to say that
under it no officer's oath to support
United States would be of any worth, No
man holding any such theory of obliga-
tion to a State superior to obligation
to the Union could honestly take such an
lie would take it with a reservation
with an to “bear true
faith and allegiance to the United States
of America” and “ obey the orders of the

“The American Cotton Company with which Iam

You're right, Mr. Jones. But why tn the
name of verity don’t you keep onand gay that
no“ Trust” of the many denounced by Bryan
is any more a trust than the “ American Cot-
ton Company?”

Few similar organizations have during their
Irst vear's existence displa) ed so much activity
as the Automobile Club of America, At its
firstannual meeting, held on Monday night, tt
was shown that the conception of three men
in 1800 has resulted in the association and co-
operation of nearly 300 men for the purpose of
advancing their interests as automobilists, and
at the same time the interests of drivers,
cyclists and all other people benefited by good
roads

Ihe club's history, although brief, oontains
the record of several entertaluing events and of
much substantial and praiseworthy work
toward improved legislation Ihe club is likely
in the near future to exert strenuous efforts to

remove the restrictions upon the use of motor
vehicles in parks and driveways, and to secure
the pussage of laws intended to simplify
the conditions affecting chauffeurs, without

ony degree rendering their machines ob-

tionable to other persons, The sentiment
of the members against the excessive 8) eed of
automobiles in the streets was clearly mani-

fested, and it is to be hoped that the club's de-

tires in this regard will be respected by auto-

mnobilists generally

did as Gen, Lee did and nobly sacrificed thetr
interests for their principles, you would
promptly reply by charging him with the same
biassed sectionalism which prevents you from
judging the character of any man who differs
or has differed from you on Constitutional or
other questions. It is easy, however, to quote
high authority whose standpoint of construc-
tion is the same as yours, Thelate John Cod-
man Ropes of Boston, a New Englander of New
Englanders, stands firstin the list of careful
and thorough students and critics of the Civil
War and all questions growing out of it, In hts
“story of the Civil War," Vol. L., page 108, he
says’

The right of anoMerrin the regular army or navy
toresign his commission and take service under the
flag of his State, as so many of the officers from the
seerding States did, has been very often questioned
It has been urged against thelr conduct that they had
sworn allegiance to the United States, and that what
ever mightor might not be permissible for civillans,
they, at any rate, were bound tn honor to stand by the
flag of the United States,

Hut. when It ts recollected that each of these men
believed that his State was his country, and that the
United States was only a number of separate nations
(of which bis State had been one) which had united

themselves together by 4 treaty which one
of them had as much right to terminate as any
nation has to terminate any treaty, it 18 plain

that he was Justifed fn regarding his obligation to
remain in the service of the United States as de
terminable by the decision of his own State to remain
