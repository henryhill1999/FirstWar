HOW TO HIRE AN APARTMENT
OR A PRIVATE HOUSE
AT THE LOWEST RENTAL.

There never was a time in the history of New
York when there was sdch a large and aban-
dant supply of housing to let tn proportion to
the demand as this year, The result ts that
hundreds of owners are offering rednced
rents, while others, though nominally main
tatning the old rents, make concessions tn the
way of free occupancy, No tenant can be sure
that he is obtatning the terms he is entitled to
according to the actual condition ef the mar-
ket without an extended tour of investigation
and of diplomatic negotiations with nts.
Save yourself the necessity of @ perso aroh
and of useless debates by toserting a
