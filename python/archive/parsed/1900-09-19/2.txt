arvre, Mon, Sept. 18.—After leaving Helena

Gov, Roosevelt went over the Rocky Mountains

to-day to Butte, Besides greeting a clam-

orous assembly of citizens from the upper bal-
copy of the Butte Hotel, the Governor talked
to 10,000 persons at the Columbia Gardens
where the only hall in this vicinity big enough
to bold the people who wanted to hear him
is jocated. The Columbia Gardens are several
miles from the city and the trip thither in hacks
wagons and trolley cars waa in no way 4 pleasant
oue, between cold winds laden with fogs and
winds laden with thoking sulphur fumes from
the smelters, During the day the Governor
talked to small gatherings at three mining
mmunities in the mountains and met a great
yper of miners on different levels of the West
isa mine down to 1,200 feet below the sur-

Helena was so thoroughly exhausted after

the rip-roaring time it made over the Repub-
oan candidate for Vice-President last night
that there were very few people stirring this
moming and Gov. Roosevelt's train passed
through the eity unnoticed. The campaign-
g party spent the night on the train near the
adwater Hotel, which has been closed for
years. The great plunge bath, with a
big as a football fleld filled with water

while he was coming over the Divide The
special pulled out on a awitch for them just the
other side of Wickes and as the trains passed
there was a great interchange of cheering
aud waving of bannera. Roadmaster Burke
of the Great Northern, who is generally known
here as a astanch Bryan man, had dined with
Gov. Roosevelt in the Minnesota. When he
eaw the Democratic special passing he went
out and took a prominent position on the rear
platform of the Minnesota. The trains passed
very slowly.
“cet off that train! get off that train! that's
not where you belong!” his Democratic friends
yelled at hf,
“Yes, it is,” Burke anawered eturdily, “and
it is where Lam going to stay this campaign,”
and after that the Democrats did not yell quite
so mich
At about 4 o'clock the Governor was taken
to the West Colusa mine by Mr. Batterman,
the superintendent, The entrance to the shaft
) oad been decorated with flags and bunting
1 and the outgoing shift was waiting there to
greet the Governor. He had a little informal
| talk with them and shook hands with all of
those who came forward, Only two or three
of the miners neglected the opportunity, The
Governor and his friends then put on overalle
and rough caps. The Governor, when he had
his overalls on, was the subject of admirin
cormment by the miners. They said he coke
as though he could do his share with any shift
that ever went downa shaft

Stops were made at the 100, 200 and 900-foot
levels, and the Governor stepped out onto
the floor of the levels, flaming candle in hand,
and greeted the sturdy Cornishmen who had
come out of the galleries to get a look at him
Rach time, when the car shot down into the
| lower darkness it was followed by shouts
{ of “Three cheers for McKinley and Roosevelt!”

from out of the blackness above. Once the
shout was answered by 4 great bellow of “Hur-
rah for Bryan!” from a sturdy pair of lungs
hundreds of feet below, An opportunity was
given the Governor to go clear out to the end
of a gallery and see a drill working and the
visit was made to the lowest level in the mine,
1,200 feet from the mouth

Gov. Roosevelt, after dining with an old
hunting friend, John Willis, who had come from
Thompson's Falls, Mon., 500 miles away, to see
him, went out to-night to the Columbia
Gardens on a gloriously decorated trolley car,
The Alice Band was in front and another band
| behind. It did not seem at the time he left
that there could possibly be any people out at
| the gardens, for Main street, all glowing with
| red fire and surging with people, seemed to
hold nearly all the available citizens of Butte
but the Governor found the great wardens full
of a roaring and enthusiaatic mob of Republi-
‘cans. tle addressed them on the trust issue
| as defined by the Democrats and especially
' as defined by the New York Democratic Con-
vention He told them what New
York had done in its efforts to
secure justice for the State and tor the core
poration in the taxation of franchises and said
that he thoughta party which had been fair to
both the people and the corporations inoneState
|} was capable of evolving a system that would
| work satisfactorily in the nation but_ he said
and reiterated again and again that he knew
of no way in which any good could come out
of a party which was as hypocritical as that
represented by the platform of the Democrats
of the State of New York, who had the impu-
| dence and the {nsincerity to parade themselves
| as trust destre rs when their bone and sinew

HIS DODGING TACTICS AMUSE THE
REPUBLICAN CAMPA/ONERS.

Mr. Manley Belleves That the Nebraskan Is
Weakening—First It Was Imperialism That
Was ‘Paramount,’ Now It Is Trasts, and
No One Can Tell What's Coming Next,

Chairman Hanna of the Republican National
Committee is to arrive in New York on Monday
morning. Senator Nathan Bay Scott, who
is in charge of the Speakers’ Bureau at Repub-
lican National Headquarters, 1 Madison avenue,
said last night that every effort would be made
to have Senator Hanna remain here and in
this request Joseph Hh. Manley and other Eastern
campaigners may join

The Bryanites like to comfort themselves
these days by saying that they know of no
Democrat who voted for Bryan tn 1896 who is
to change his voto this year. The Republican
National Committee at its headquarters in
this city is in daily receipt of lists of Bryan
Democrats who will not support Bryan this
year. These lists come from Michigan, Call-
fornia, West Virginia, Massachusetts, Con-
necticut and other States,

Mr. Manley had something to say yesterday
about Bryan's letter of acceptance. Mr. Man-
ley believes that Bryan is weakening.

“More than a month ego,” said he, “we called
attention to Mr. Bryan's progressive euchre
atyle of campaign, He has been going from
one issue to another, at the rate of about one
iasue to each fortnight Now, to continue the
figure, he and his party are put to their trumps,
and they are getting rid of them pretty fast,
Their imperialistic suit is played out,
and they feel mighty weak on the silver suit, #0
now they are trying for a few tricks with truste,

This sort of thing always looks forcible,
but sometimes it ian't ao effective as it promises
to be. That is the way it will work with the
Democratietrustissue. Inthefirat place, trusts
have nothing to do with polities, anyway, any
more than copartnerships have they are not
new. They are an outgrowth and de-
velopment of the partnership idea, which is as
old as the hills Chey enable law,
fustas Joint stock corporations are, and so far
as they operate injuriously to the body politie
they will be restricted and punished by law
that they will be in case the Republicans
have the making or the enforcing of the laws
Che trusts flourished in Cleveland's Admints-
tration as much as they do now, and the Demo
crata who were in power made a great show of
{Investigating and curbing them, but nothing
came of it. The Dernoeratic trust hunters
couldn't even make their witnesses testify

OTTO KEMPNER INDORSED.

He Pays His Respects to Croker and Shevitn,
“Divvycrats."’

A meeting of the Bryan and Stevenson Club
of the Twentieth Assembly district in Brooklyn
was held last night, in Muller's Hall at Wyckoff
avenue and Grove street. Former Assembly-
man Otto Kempner, the sole delegate from
Kings county who stood out for Coler in the
State convention, is one of the leading mem-
bers of the club and that it approves of his
action at Saratoga was clearly demonstrated
last night. At the outaet of the proceedings

Franz Bock offered this resolution

Whereas, Our esteemed neighbor and fellow citizen,
the Hon. Otto Kempner, acting as a delegate from thts
district to the Democratic State Convention at Sara
toga, defied the allled bosses of ‘Tammany Hall and
Wiioughby atreet and advovated and voted for the
nomination of Comptrotier Bird S Coler for Gov
ernor, therefore,

Resolved, That we tender him our heartfelt thanks
for his manly and honorable course, whereby he cor-
rectly represented our sentiments,

Resolved That we hereby +a pease our pride and
confidence In Mr. Kempner's ability and integrity,
and that we pledge ourselves to support bim in his
fight against cogtading machine rule in the Demo-
cratic organization of Brooklyn

Several members spoke in support of the
resolution and it was adopted with a hurrah.
Mr. Kempner in response to this indorserent
of his course said

“The contest at the Saratoga convention
marks the beginning of a battle that must be
waged to the bitter end between two forces
in the Democratic party. When the election
is over we will be confronted with the task of
cleaning up the Democratic household {n Greater
New York. The two forces I refer to are the
Democrats who stand by their party because
they believe in its traditions and principles
and the Divvyerats who only use the organiza-
tion of theparty asa means to exploit their
greed for spoils

“The latter have the Democratic party of
thie State at their merey, as they have shown
at Saratowa, This state of affairs is intoler-
able, and if the Democrats ever hope to be
restored to power in this State they must first
crush the Divvyerata. You cannot expect an
intelligent, self-respecting community to allow
itself to be ruled by a combination of two auch
characters as Richard Croker and James Shev-
lin, whose only concern about government
is fo make it yield as richly as possible for their
own pockets,

There is’ no Democratic organization, fn
Brooklyn: no more than in Manhattan he
will of one man dominates in each of the bor-
oughs, When | stepped from, the platform
at Saratoga James Shevlin asked me, ‘How
much did it eost? That. remark showed me
that there is but oneguide to the public con-
duct of our bosses and that is the almighty
dollar. When the election is over decent men
will wet together and purge their party of Its
evil forces, Our campalan ery will be ‘Down
with the Diveverates” ~

The Demoeratic managers had slated Mr.
Kempner for the Assembly nomination in the
Twentieth district, but he had been “turned
down” in consequence of his demonstration
at Saratowa. The enthusiastic Bryan men
of the district have urged him to accept an
independent nomination, but as he {a goin
to Europe at the close of the month and wil
be absent during the campaign, he has de-
clined

BICYCLE ICE TRIP,

Dawson Alaska, by

EF. P. Leroy, anewspaper correspondent, was
the first one to make the trip successfully from
Dawson to Skagway, 550 miles, over the ice, on
a bieyele. He was eight days on the way and
encountered one of the heaviest snowstorma of
the season Iie comments on the universal
fact that men in the Arctic climate have seurvy
and stomach trouble because of poorly cooked
food,

He says when he first went to Alaska he had
a good stomach, but it finally gave out; and one
day in his search for something that a man
without an appetite could eat, he came across
some packages of Grape-Nuts food. He knew
of the food and its value and was willing to pay
\% of an ounce of gold dust ($4.00) for one pack-
age.
» Heaays: “Tecan assure you the satisfaction
of getting something I could eat and digest
without suffering was well worth the price. As
soon as it had proven to be just what I wanted,
I bought the whole lot and, from that day to
this, Grape-Nuts food has constituted my chief
article of diet

‘I find that Grape Nuts is quickly pieked up

as soonasa new lot comestocamp. There is
nothing known that gives the miner and fron-
tiersinan the strength, with so litde volume, as
Grape-Nuts food, and it is always ready for
use, being perfectly cooked, and can be eaten
dry or withalittle cream, milk, or water, hot
or cold, justas aman likes. I could not have
taken any food that would have carried me
through my long journey on the ice so well as
Grape-Nuts."'—Adv,

It ia proposed to put a complete State ticket
in the fleld. :

Chairman J. F. Jones of the State Populist
Executive Committee is here and has had several
informal conferences with Republicans looking
to a fusion of the two parties on a State ticket,
it being proposed that the Ke put licans indoree
the eandidaey of Col, Jerome Kearbs, the Popu-
jist nominee for Governor. Chairman Green
and other Republican leaders will not favorably
consider a proposition of fusion, as it would
tend to decrease the vote to be cast in Texas
