Chief Arthur Says They Will Probably Haul
Coal Mined by Non-Unton Men,

CLEVELAND, Sept. 18—Grand Chief PM.
Arthur of the Brotherhood of Locomotive En-
wineers said to-day he did not think it likely
that the engineers would refuse to hau! anthra-
cite coal mined by non-unionminers

“The strike, if it continues, will undoubtedly
soon result in many railroad men being thrown
out of employment,” said Mr. Arthur, “This
will, of course, lead to dissatisfaction and tun-
rest among them Under such conditions the
| engineers might become involved in the strike
Kut it is not probable.”

Grand Master Morrisey of the Brotherhood
of Trainmen isat present 'n Denver. Secretary
King of the brotherhood said to-day that 60 far
as he knew no official action had been taken by
his organization looking toward the trainmen
refusing to haul non-union mined anthracite
