FOOTBALL.
Second Day of Practice by the Collese
Players.

CAMBRIDOB, Sept. i8.~Harvard’s seoond day
of football practice brought out eixteen new
candidates, many of whom were of promising
quality for the line positions. Despite the loss
of Reid and Ted Kendall, Harvard is seen to
have a wealth of back field material and it |s
now painfully apparent that the positions left
vacant by Maloolm Donald, Capt. Burden and
Boa! of last year's eleven will be those hardest
to fill. This afternoon Capt. Daly collected a
number of the biggest of his linemen and ranged
ther opposite each other for practice in breaking
through, With the exception of Jim Lawrence,
tackle on last year’s eleven, and Graydon, tackle
on the freshman team last fall, (he candidates
for line positions were without great promise
J. G. Jones, a sturdy player from Phillips Exeter
Academy, where he made the eleven last year,

showed up well this afternoon. Morning prac-
tlee began to-day at 11. It was short aud
light, comprising the rudimentary stages of
football exercise and a two-lap sprint around
the gridiron. In the afternoon five minutes
were spent inten-yard starts, and then the can-
didatea were divided into squadsa for presing
and falling on the ball under the coaching of
Hallowell, Eaton, Kendall, Ellis and Sawin.
Punting practices, with the candidates ranged
{uto squads of si

An exceptionally large entry list, in which

break between the plungers and the layers

Barbera Frietohle was the only withdrawal
from the Albemarle, a stake with selling con-
ditions, for two-year-old filles, at five furlong#

Fremont’s handsome little daughter Ashes

looked to be the best of the ten left In and she

was played heavily over Cherries, Screech
and the rest ‘Turner took Ashes to the front
in the scranible from the barrier and keeping

her there, won with something to spare by a

length frou Cherries, who beat Candle two
lengt for the place

his was the order all the way, the others
being tiptoed from fagfall

The card bousted of three handicaps, the first
beinw the Kings Highway, for three-year-old:

and unward at one mile and three-quarters
over hurdles. All the eight named over-night
acoepted, both d. W. Colt and P. It. Lume being

a lara@e following at 13 to5. ‘three Bars made
moet of the running with Einer in close attend

any of the lot until they turned for home. iu
fact, they ran so closely bunched that the alight-

est mistake might have wrecked the race
Kiner outran Three Bars in the final drive,
but Klondyke proved too fast for either and

won easily by three lengths from Einer, whi
beat Tiree Bars by half a length,

WW. 8. Vesburgh hag allotted the weights so
closely in the t year-old handicap that the
talent failed to pick a positive favorite. Silver
Dale and Six Shooter went to the post equal
choices at 4toil, Feau Gallant ana Gold Heels
carried « jot of money at 4 to 1, Basuto waa
played fram isto lto8to 1, and Beau Ormonde's
odds ware cut three peints When it came to
racing there was ne thing in it but Silver Dale

 

 

 

and Gold Heel&, who ran as named throughout
and fintehed three lengthea apart. Dr. Barles
aprinfed over the others In the airatch and
beat Basuto a neck for the short end of the

puree

the third handicap was for mares of all ages |

 

at one tnile and seventy yards, with Hardly

wasalsoa pronounced plunge on Sparrow Wing

When they settled down Hardly took the lead
while Sparrow Wing and Belle of Troy were

POULADELPHIA, Sept. 18.—The Pennsylvania
football team has now been officially practi.-
A large number of men are out,
ti tv-four in all, and the material is the best
that Pennsy|yania has hac for several seasons.
Teas, guard: Wallace, tackle; McCracken, full
back: J, Gardiner, half back; Potter, haif back
and Capt, Mare, tackie, all of whem played
in Pennayivanias big games last year, are back
and in harness. (Oglesby, W, Smith, Hodge
Davidsen W. Gardiner, Zimmerman an

  

Mecioskey, who played in a few games, have
nian returned to college This is a good nu-
cleus for a team, and the prospects are bright
as the new material is 80 promising,
Graves, a candidate for quarter back, looks
like a find, as he is a good punter and
drop kicker and just the right build
for @ quarter back. Horner, who is trring

for centre, is already considered as aimost
acertainty for this position because of his weiaht
and speed. Johnson, Mitchell, Bennett and 4
score of others look like comers, so the result
lies with Coach Woedruff. He should be able
to mould the meninto a fast aggregation. The
practice to date has been very easy, consisting
of kicking, catching, running down the fleld on
fi much light work practicing the quar-
terback kick. No lineup will be taken for an-
other week. The feature of the work so far has
been the improvement in Flare’s punting and
place kicking, the punting of Graves and his
drop kicking and ( ardiner’s improvement in
the kicking line As this is a department in
which Fentey\venia has been weak for years,
the showing of these men is doubly acceptable.
Pennayivania should have a good team.

Athietes’ Annual Squarbbles.

The local associationa of the A. 4. T. are
ving up to their records for aquabbling and
internal dissensions whieh have marked the
deliberations of nearly all the district ergan-
Plenty of bad feeling
was evident after the election at the annual
meeting of the Metropolitan Association
Monday night, and the leaders of the two
factions which have been warring for veare
over the handicapping plum refused to shake
hands after the meeting. This is follewed by
& report of an even more stormy annual see-
sion of the New Fngland Asseciatien held on
Monday night. The Atlantic Association has

on

not yet reported its doings, but local athletes |

asaume that it may be depended upon te fur-

nish a renewal of the characteristic bickerings.
The New England Aasociation went so far

/ as to turn its President, Secretary and delegates

of several influential clubs out of the meeting

on the flimsy pretext that they had not pre-
sented their proper credentials. The men held
an indignation meeting in the corrider. Dele.

gate Mansfield of the Boston A. A.. one ef thease

| avicted, said he was positive that his club would

resign from the association, andthe Hon. Joseph
B. Maceabe. who represented the Fast Boston
A. A., started for lis home

After an hour of deliberation the men at
the meeting discovered they were helpless
without the official minutes of the association,
which the Secretary-Treasurer, Kilburn Adams,
took with him when he left the room and the ex-

elled members were recalled. The mischief
Pad been done, however, and after returning
Secretary Adams presented the resignation
of his organization, the Newtowno Club of
Cambridge, which was accepted. E. F. Babb,
who has been President of the association for
six years, declined to act again, and in con-
sequence an entire new set of officers were
elected the ticket not containing one of last

ear's names. The new officers are: W. F.
Vinston, St. Josephs of Lynn, President; W
B. Mansfield, Baston A. A., Vice-President;
W. F. Murphy Francis. Mathew T. A. 8., Seo.
retary-Treasurer.

Although so particular in requiring creden-
tials the association practically vielated the
A. A. U. constitution with regard to A A. U.
delegates, electing only three Instead of six,
This leaves the national organization no choice
as to the men to represent the association
on the A. A. U. board, as each district is an-
Litled to three members. The delegates elected
were E. F. Babb, T. Riley and W. F. Winston.

W. A. Dumbrisky of the Gloucester A. C,
poured hot shot into the Registration Com-
mittee for not insisting on the rule requiring
prizes to be inscribed

WITH THE FAAUNGSS HORSES,

Andy Welch's Opinion of the System of Every
Hieat a Race.

Refore starting for Hartford o1 Mon’as
Andy Welch said he was greatly pleased with
the result of the Empire City trotting meeting
last woek He also expressed gratification

at the success of the three-heat events, in which
every heat was a race
“IL believe it will be the popular style of racing

of the future,” he said, “and will probably
lead to dash races being put on the pro-
grammes of the big aasociations Many of
those who strongly opposed my idea of try-
ing them when we were making up the pro-
gramme for the Empire City meeting, have told

en! yed the three-heat

the old three-in-live

me sinee, that they
events far better than
style and that the racing was better and more
ratisfactory 1 felt confident the
would meet general approval, although !t was

eyetern

an experiment that the Eastern ssociqtion
have not cared to try Now that vt has been
shown that such good racing is the resuit, I
believe that all the leading tracks will pro-

granime toore or less of them beat sea on

There is no question but the drivers try
fo win every heat If they lose one, they lose
ust one third of the prize money and thes

rott
every one

at that style, and for the benefit of those who
etlll fa the old three-in-five, one event at

 

could be given With such

2 o'clock and the card finished in time for the
crowd to Ke! back to tov carly ana in a good
