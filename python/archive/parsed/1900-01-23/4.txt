Casey's Work was satisfactory toward the close

n, os the lithe third baseman took
e great brace. But Hanlon believes that he can
make an improvement by placing Dablen on
third base and throwing out Hines for a short
stop. Jennings will play first base, so there is
no chance of seeing Bim im his old place. De
Montreville of the Baltimoses could easily be
shifted to the Brooklyns if Hanlon should sce
fit to make the move, He is fast player, but
unsteady and erratic, He was traded to Chicago
tor Dahlen and proved @ failure in that city, but
wheu he was sent to Baltimore in exchange for
Magoon he played wonderful ball, which was
probably due to McGraw's influence, Hanlon
had De Montreville in 1898 and did not like his
work, so nobody can tell whether the youngster
will come to Brooklyn or not. If the New York
club should decide to take McGraw, as many of
the maecnates predict, Hanlon might waive 4
cash bonus of great size and stipulate that George
Pavis be handed over & the champions.

linalon was willing at one time last year to pay
a big amount of money for Davis's release, ub
qatters did got come around right for him to make
te offer. The Boston club probally can be tn-
cuced to part with Herman Long, but in euch an
erent the latier would be traded to the New York

gers alfecons lt is practically admitted by the
champion club's officials that the organization
will ba greatly bolstered in pitchers by the addition
of Nopa, MeGinnity, Howell and Biwon, Ken-
nedy will likely be waded, as he has not lived up
to certain requirements while Yeager and Dono-
van ara not considered fast enough to keep w

that Quin is here to talk matters over with the
men who are anxious to place an Association

The best proof that there was nothing fraud-
ulent about 18 MeCoy-Choynski fight was
furnished the other night by 4 man who has been
in the sporting business for years and who knows
every trick of the trade,

“In order to pull off afake Tat be said,“there

of last sea

 

must always be a motive, motive is gen-

erally baged upon & desire to get the money. If

the Broadway A. C. officlals were trying to per-
yetuate a fraud the other night, they certainly

Dave sent out agents into the crowd with kinds
of money to piace on Choynski Then, wit

the cash down, they could have had it arrang
to rob McCoy, by having him disqualified on
@ foul, and in that way they wowd have reaped
e harvest. It is better to pull off a good thing
when you are putting up a dolar to win five than
when you are betting up five ‘cases’ to win one,
That is the best evidence in the world that Choyn-
eki was not purposely deprived of victory.”

All contests in the Hroadway AA. C. are governed
bv a revised set of Marquis of Queensberry rules,
which was prepared some time ago by Tom
(Rourke, “Parson” Davies, Billy Madden and
J. Tk Angle, the noted English referee. The
rules are printed on the back of the club's articles
of agreement which all contestants are compelled

tosign There ts one rule, however, that appears
to be a dead letter, Lt reads as follows

In all contests the referee shall award a max-
fiign number of ive marks at the endof each
round apd a proportionate number to the other con
teetant. The decision shall be given in favor of the

contestant who obtains the greater number of points,
The points shall befor attack—direct, clean hits with

NEW CYCLE TRUST PRESIDENT.

 

A. G. Spalding Retires and R, L. Coleman
Steps In,

It was announced last night from tne head-
quarters of the Bicycle Trust that at a meeting
of the Board of Directors, held in the afternoon,
A, G, Spalding retired from the presidency of
the American Bicycle Company and that KR,
Lindsay Coleman had been elected to fill the
vacancy. Tho nows was like a bursting shell
in its effect upon the trade, A few who pretend
to wiseness, however, said ‘I told you so,”

The announcement was accompanied by the
statement that A. G. Spalding, who organized
the company and was elected only a few
months ago, had retired in conformance toa
determination formed long ago to take the
leadership and keep it until it was in good
working order and thon retire in favor of some
one completely identified with bicycle manu-
facture, Spalding will, however, retain his ine
tereatin the company and continue on the
Board of Directors, The only other chango
made was the election of Col, Albert A. Pope to
the chairmanship of the board and the Execu-
tive Committees,

Measrs, Coleman, Spalding and Pope, who
are the recognized leaders of the company,
were found at the Cycle Show last night,

For atime they stood chatting together, then,
as a crowd began to gather, they formed,
accidentally, into a row, with Coleman in
the centre, and atood in the matn aisle shaking

hands with friends. Coleman reoelved
congratulations, but had. not a word
of comment. He talked about the show,

Spalding sald that he had many responsi-
bilities and needed a rest and that now he
was going to get it. Pope talked about trade
matters, Theodore F, Merseles, Third Vico-
President of the A. B. ©, and considered as
Coleman's right-hand man, when questioned
begged to be excused from replying.
ere have been rumors of an impending
ghgnge in the truet for as much aa two weeks,
ore the first prestagat was elected Coleman
was talked ofas arival candidate, He was cons
sidered to be the leader of the Western makers
ang Spalding of the Easte rms. Thecareer
of the new president n typical of the
self-made American. He wae born in Vireiois
and still maintains a fine homestead there. He
launched out for himself early and had a taste
of many diverse businesses, including that of

BILLIARDS,

 

 

Proprietors of Schaefer's Academy Decide
to Dissolve Partnership.

David O’Connor, the well-known sporting
man, and William H. Myers, owners of the
billiard room at Broadway and Forty-second
treet, known as Schacfer’s Academy, have had
a falling out, and as a reault they will apply to
the courts for a dissolution of partnership.
O'Connor acquired an interest {n the place Inst
November and it was soon noised about {no
Dilliard cireles that things were not running
smoothly. On Saturday night there was an
open rupture,

Jacob Schaefer, the noted billlardist, was en-

gaged by the frm and received an interest as
well as 4 salary for the use of his name, Besides

to play another one with the veteran Tom Gal-

jlagher. Last night, however, Schaefer aai 1

believes that affairs will be straightened out
before the week ends.

Schaefer and Morningstar resumed their

against his opponent’s 1,600 at fourteen-ineh

AFTERNOON AND EV 1LNING,

Souvenir Hunters Get Well Jammed—What
the Coaster Brakes Look Like and the
Part That They Play in the Exhibition
-The Freak Wheel of the Collection’

There was an invasion upon the bicycle
hamlet at Madison Sauaro Garden last night
that was characteristic @f such shows. Hun-
dreds chose to sit in the galleries and enjoy
the spectacle, Tho lesson was that those who
want to honestly study the wheels and new
features should go in the morning or after-
noon. The souvenir hunters were out in force,
The choicest things were hard to get, but the
men and women seemed to be inspired by the
actions of the boys and girls and followed
them pell mel! at any place where there wos a
button, stick pin, pink, glove buttoner or other
bauble to be obtained. The only souvenirs
really worth the while that are distributed in-
diseriminately are the cards on which to write
your name and hand it back for achance to win
a wheel or acoaster brake, keeping for refer-
ence anumbered coupon, One young woman
had an experience in this game that is likely
to be memorable. She was heard to say to her
companion, an elderly woman:

“Well, the more tickets you get into that bar-
rel, the more chance you have of winning. I
am just going to stay hereand take turas until
I get in six anyway.”

She was swallowed up then in the human
maolatrom. A few minutes later, before she
had got in hor six tickete, one at a time, she

was out in the aisle with a hat all awry anda
torn ekirt. She waa accommodated with pins

much worth stu a by riders in the back-
pedalling affairs. There hae been muoh ims
provement in them since the first one appeqred
and there will probably be much more. Une
of the best-known on the market last year may

be mechanically described as follows:
A specially conatructed hub te enlarged at
he Hunt-hand end, 80 as toform a drum that
and a bow! in shape,

ft a droas between a bell Mea

with the concave side outward,
extends from this to the near fork and is
clamped about it. Within the drum is seta
disq of indurated fibre, semi-conical in shape.
To force this piece of fibre againat the walls of
the drum a pair of came, that are built
with reversely inclined planes, 80 thas
when they are forced ggainst each
with a rotary motion they require
more room, the same as A pair of wedgea,

hen one i# pushed on top of the other, points
ret. One of these cams is attached at tho
outer edge by a toothed surface to the back of
the chain sprocket, which is tov athed to mate,
As long as the pedaia are yushed forward these
toeth are interlocked and everything {s held
stationary. Back! pedalling action releases
these cog teeth and the cams are forced toslide
one upon the other and push the dise of fl! re

inst the drum, which, with the hub
end wheel to which it belongs, Is
brought to a_ standstill, When only

a slight backward pressure is exerted the cam
{s treed from the sprocket, but the dise ia not
made to grate on the drum andthe wheel ts
“free.” It was much questioned whether @
coaster brake could be applied to a chainlese,
but the show has settled that. Of the nine dif-
ferent styles of coaster brakes shown, only
three permit of the wheel being trundied back-
ward go as to be placed in a rack without being
lifted. Only one of tho three was specially de-
signed go as fo allow this always, while the
other two, both on chainless whoels, permit of

variety of choice in these devices and should
examine all of them ;

other is perched over the rear forks)ust behind
the diagonal strut or slat post mast, Through
thia second one runs an axle to which fs at-
tached an ordinary front sprocket, which Is
connected with the usual rear sprocket by an
ordinary chain, On the sprocket is a
crank only two inches lon This is revolvably
attached to a driving rod seven inches long
the further end of which is eimpilarly connected
with asmall triangular case, folded double, in
the lower part of which is keyed and brazed an

revolves, Meanwhile, the cranks to which
the pedals are attached have only an up-and-

British Chess Club's Dates Cannot Be Ac-

of the Brooklyn Chess Club, he has received a
Jetter from the Secretary of the British Chess
Club, London, stating that the latter would bo

on Mareh’16 and 17. The Brooklyn Chess
Club cannot possibly accept, as the assembly

club proposed to play on either Friday and
Saturday, March 9 and 10, 23 and 24, or 3)
and 31, and theso dates were duly submitted

Lyons Knocks Cain Out,

Tom O’Rourke sprung a surprise party on
quite a large crowd of sports at the
Hercules A. C., Brooklyn, last night. It came
in the shape of acolored boxer named Henry
Lyons, from Chicago, The latter met Joo Cain
of Brooklyn and not only outpointed the
local man, but knocked Cain out in the last
round. The pair were scheduled to go
twenty-five rounds at 126 pounds, but at
the outset Lyons’s superlority was manifest.
His style and looks suggest Joe Gans, and
his defence {s marvellous. The only weak
thing about him is his inability to stand a
thumping in the wind. Cain gave him stiff
body punches andth{s made him wince often,

The opening bout introduced Tommy Feltz
of Brogsl yn and Kid Walsh of Phiiadel-
ppia. Feltz, who {is a pupil of Terry
MeGovern, weighed 104 pounds, while
Walsh — scaled at 118 pounds. Feltz
knocked Walsh out in the second round with a
right-hand awing. They wera to have boxed
ten rounds. Touy Moran of Brooklyn tackled

oung Horney forten rounds, at 118 pounds.
Moran won {n the third round, Horney's
seconds stepping into the ring.

A New Boxing Law for lowa,

Des Mores, Jan, 22,—The last State Legta-
luture passed a bill against prizefghting, but
{t has been practically inoperative because
it has permitted exhibitions of sparring
and boxing skill Several minor fights
have taken placo in and near this city
and Gov. Shaw in his meseage to the
Legislature recommended that a law bo passed
to prevent such oceurrences in the future. A
bill to that effect was introduced to-day b
Senator G, W. Lister of Osceola county. tt
provides that any two persons, who agree and
wilfully fight or box at fisticuffs, or engage in
any public sparring match or boxing exhibl-
tion, withor without gloves of any kind, and
whoever alds, assists or attends such ex-
hibitions or fights, and any owner or lessee
grounds, lots, buildings, hall or
structure of any kind, permitting the same to
be used for such anexhibition, shall be deemed

guilty of a misdemeanor and fined not more |

than $500 or imprisoned in the county Jaf] not
more than 150 days, An oscepton is made
in the case of ath-etic clubs and wymnasiuing,
such receiving permission to hold exhibitions
in ease a license fs secured from the Sheriff.

 

Duane Whips McKeever,

Srawvonrn, Jan. 22,—In a sparring bout before the
Stamford A, C, to-night Dan Duane got the decision
over Jim McKeever in # rattling fifteen round go,

While no fault. can well be found with
the ruling, Wyet McKeever put up a plucky
fight and Duane had to do the hardest kind of work
to ontpoint him, Two other bouts were pulled off
Howard Smith of Glenville knocked cutdoe Mulve-
hill in tworounds and “Shep Walker knocked out
Jack Barrett in three rounds,

Youngs Knocked Out, but the Blow was Foul,

Brrvaco. Jan, 22,—Joe Youngs of Duffaloand Tom
Conhig of Dunkirk, lightweights, met at the Olympic
Club to-night in what was to be a twenty-fve-round
contest, Inthe fifth round, when both men were
fivhting lively, Couhig knocked Youngs out with a
fol blow below the belt, The referee awarded the
fight to the Buflalo man,
