Agalnat Flagrant Vice Only Cross Says,

What the police are now doing to improve
conditions in tho Red Light district in the
lower East Side was seen yesterday when
eeven disorderly women who had been in cus
tody since Mriday last were arralgned Inthe
Jissex Mi arket police court on charges of soliel-
ting, and five landlords of the premises In
whienthey live were summoned to answer
complaints of letting apartments for Immoral
purposes, oe Devery, Assistant District
Attorney O'Reilly, Inspector Cross and Capt,
Herlihy of the 1! dpkg street station wero in
court topress the eases and detectives from
Headquarters appeared as complainants
against the women, There were present In the
court room as interested spectators Prof. Felix
Adler, the Rey, Dr, John P. Peters, reetor of
St. Michael's Church; Mrs. Josephine Shaw
Lowell and the Rev, Dr. I L. Paddock of the
Pro-Carhedral in Stanton street, members of
the Reform Committes through whose instru-
montality the police have been {nduesed to tako
active measures in weeding out vicious
inmates from the tenement houses of the

   

lower East Side.

“We aro not starting on a erusade,” said Dr.
Paddock toa Sus reporter, “We are not mak-
ing any move agaist houses which are wholly
given overto view, Weare not anxious for any
fireworks, This movement Is directed solely

against the flaunting of vice in the faces of |

respectable people and is intended to weed out
immoral persons from tenement houses in
wh ch respectavle families dwell.”

The seven women Were arrested last Friday
night. When they were arraigned in court on
Saturday Inspeetor Cross had them remanded
t the police » stitionus us suspicious persons,
Yhey were arraigned again on Sunday morn
ing and at the Insper ‘tor's request were avain
tn inded until yesterday atternoon, Several
jondsmen Were in the court room ready to give

pond orthe women, but Magistrate Deuel re-
fuse i toucceptthem and the prisoners were
locked up until yesterday atternoon, i

In the meantime a sort of “third degree’
was Worked on the Women and three of them
made confessions to Inspector Cross) in which
they told who were the owners of the premises

they rented and agreed to make affidavits |

ugainst these panes. On their statements
these landlords ere summoned to court;
Michael Goldberg of 212 Chrystie street, Louis

  

Levy of 63 Stanton street, Jacob Fe idleman of |

170 Chrystie street, Simon Kaplan of 178
Chrystie street and Louis Bulletasky of 182
Chrystie street. At the request of Lawyer
Henry J Goidsmith the cases against the land.
jords were adjourned yesterday until next
Thursday afternoon, :
When the women were arraigned Magis-
trate Devel announced his intention of parol

ing two of them until the cases against the | 3

landlords were tried, Chief Devery interrupted
him

“Your Honor,” he asked, “ean’t you remand
these women back to the station house again?
If these women get out of court We cannot get
them agata Be

“They have been locked up since Friday,”
senidthe Mogistrate, “and it would be an out.
rage to send them back there again,”

 

Phree of the women who failed to respond to |
ve’ oand furnish information |

the “third degre
fwainst their
vail wach to k

     

dlords were held in $1,000
sep the peace for six months.

 

Ywo of them were paroled and the others were |

held in $500 bail each for examination next
Thursday, when they are expected to testify
against the landiorda, The threa who were
held to keep the peace will probably have to

serve their term on the Island, ag several |

bondsmen who tried to bail them out were
prompuy rejected by the Mugistrate

The forty policemen from The Bronx who
Nave been specially detailed to patrol the
Fidridge street precinet, according to Inspec
tor Cross, are only the advance guard of the
number to be put in that section of the Bast
bide ifthe present te of things continues,

‘Chief Devery and I had a song talk,” said
Inspeetor Cross last night, “and we decided to
begin with forty men If the streets are not

    

cleared of soliciting Women we shall send |

eighty men over there, or 180 if need be, I
have spoken. very plainly to) the men
and explainel to them their duties, We
have the suranee of the District Attor-
ney and the police magistrates — that
they will give us their eoOperatio Every
portion of the Bowery, Orchard, Allen and
Chrystie streets that is troublesome will be
watehed by some of the new men during every
one of the twenty-four hours. The eondi 8
in the East Fifth street vrecinct are entirely
different from those in. Eldridge street, The
women around bast bifth street are so well
Cressed, and there is so little open solicitation
that we have not dared to put new men there
for fear of their making mistakes and arrest-
ing respectable people

 

 

 

 

 

“T’mnot speaking of disorderly houses, I |

think that all that good people can ask is that
we put vice behind cartained windows and
closed doora, The social evil i something

1 YOUNG PASTOR'S TROUBLES,

Ho Avoided the Matrimonial Snares Set for
Him Until Me Was Porced to Resign,
Huson, N.Y., Jan, 22.—Poth morning and
evening services at St. John's Evangelical
English Lutheran Church were omitted yestor-
day. Forsome time past the pastor, the Rev
Charles T. MeDanie}, and the major part of the

 

congregation have been at loggerheads. The |
estrangement culminated yesterday, when the |
trustees nailed up the church door, so that the |

pastor could not enter the church

The Wey. Mr, MeDaniel camo here from |

Frederick, Md., several years ago. He was
young antunmarried. Day dreams of becom.
ing the minister’a bride filled the maidens’

heads, while the intriguing mammas dreamed
of being mothers-in-law. Several times, ifthe ,

stories are trne, the pastor narrowly escaped
the matrimonial snares that were laid for him,
And as each one was “turned down" by the
mastor she became his enemy for lite, At
last théir opportunity came, The minister be-
came smitten. “The minister was making a
fool of himself,” they said, It the trustees
are riglit he was, for he had fallen in love with
a young iady who yet wore dresses that barely
reached the topof her shoes, One day, so say
his detractors, the girl encouraged. his love-
making, andthe next day repulsed him. His
conduct was likened to that of a sehoolhoy,
It was voted undignified and unbecoming to
his cloth and such as to make a laughing stock
of him,

The Rey. Mr. MeDaniel handed in his resig-
nation, to take effect. in February, At the
pravor meeting on Friday night it is said that

we used very fore:blo language to express his
opinion of some of the congregation, mention-
ing them by name, Thereunoa the action of
bunday followed, The pastor says he will
never take another charge until he is married,
Ttis rumored that he is to marry the youn?
Jady who has caused so much envy and spoil od
the dreams of so many of the floek,

tection, but the Pight Isn't Over,
