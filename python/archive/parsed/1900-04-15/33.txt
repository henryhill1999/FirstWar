Sound Association Making a Scale of Pointe
for Raceabout Contests,

The raceabout class this year promises to be
the most popular in these waters, and the
Long Island

of Jenning’s defection by supplanting Hugh} Sound ts making arrangements by whioh @

with Capt. Joe Kelley on first base, The latter
has improved so rapidly in playing the position
that it le thought advisable to keep him there
go that he may be better able to direct his
men, A team captain i® more eMcient,
as a rule, in ono of the diamond
positions than upon one of the three points in
the outfleld. Kelley is a competent leader, but
hitherto his value has been practically nulli-
fled becaure of hia location in left feld, With
Kelley on first base, therefore, there is bound
to be just as much ginger and encouragement
dealt out to the pitcher and tho other Inflelders
ee was the case last year when Jennings was
on the bag.

It would not be fair, however, to say that Jen-
pings is not missed. He is one of the finest
players in the profession and an expert at “in.
aide” playing. If he should come in time be-
fore the race begins, Hanlon would doubtless
receive him with open arma; but, of course, if
Jennings remains outside the fold, the placing
of Kelley on frst base will keep the strength of
the champions up to the standard, Kelley can
be taken from the outfeld without leaving a
hole. Hanlon has some rattling outflelders In
Kovler, Sheckard, Jones and Holmes. With
Kelley out, Sheckard, Jones and Keeler make a
fast trio, about the best in the League
when it comes down to comparisons,
Jones has #0 far shown a big improvement
over hia work of last year. His ankle, which
was sprained at Augusta twelve months ago,
{es once more strong and his sprinting and base
running have been tho feature of the cham-
pions’ play inthe South, Hanlon pred! sted jast
winter that Jones would como around, so that
{n case Jennings returns to first base, thereby
putting Capt. Kelley back in left fleld, 1¢ will
be nip and tuck between Jones and Shockard
for the right to play centre.

Tho question of supremacy wil! depend prob-
ably upon aggressiveness and hittag.

Bheckard showed superiority in almost every | g

reapect last year, when he was playing under |

champlonship pennant can be won the same
as in the Massachusetts Association. Each
club in the unfon will hold races, and a scale of
points will be mapped out for the yachtsin
each race, which will ba allotted according to
the way they floish. Atthe end of the season
the percentage will be figured out and the
bout that has the largest percentage of wins
will be declared the champion of Long Island
Sound for this class and will receive @ pen-
nant,

This scheme is going to work well for the
clubs In the association and it will operate
against those that are not members. If there
are two regattas in one day owners will doubt.
less choose to race in the regatta of the club
enrolled in the association, because in addi-
tion to his chanoa to win the regatta prize he
will also seore points in the struggle for the
championahip, The olubs in the association
have arranged a schedule so that each has a
separate date for {ts races, and the only con-
fiction willjbe with clubs that are notin the
association, It{s prebable that after this sea-
son championships may be arranged for all
the classes that All well, and sothe {nterest In
raving will be greatly increased.

pleted its work. A report will be @at ihe

beoatse it is realized that whatever changes

There is a growing sentiment améne@ yachts-
menthatthe present rulo of measurement is

THE ANNUAL SESSION FIXED FOR THE
METROPOLITAN Cl.UB ON TUESDAY,

 

Plans to Be Settled Regarding an Inter-
national Team -A Suggestion for a Sem!-
monthly Championship — Schedule of
Handicap Tournaments to Be Fixed.

On Tuesday evening the polo players from
all parts of the country will meet at the Metro-
politan Club for the annual meeting and
dinner. The Polo Committee will meet in the
afternoon to pass upon some suggested re-
visions {n the rules, but the main Interest
centres in the general meeting in the evening.
It will be in many ways the most important
annual meeting yet held, forthe matters to be
acted on are in some ways of international im-
portance. The cluba entitled to representa-
tlon and the official delegates follow:

Buffalo, N. Y., Country Club, Robert K. Root;
Country Club of Westchester, N. Y., E. C. Potter;
Dedham, Mass., Polo Club, Samuel D. Warren;
Devon, Pa., Polo Club, C. Randolph Snowden; Jack-
eonvi!'s, Fla., Polo Club, D. PF. Mitchell; Lakewood,

 

N. J.. Polo Club, George J. Gould; Meadow
Brook, N. Y., Club, Oliver W. Bird; Mor
ris County, N. J., Country Club, Benjamin

Nicoll; Myopia, Mass, Hunt Club, R. 1. Agassiz;
Onwentsia, Il., Club, W. Vernon Booth; Philadel-
phia, Pa, Country Club, John C. Groome; Point
Judith. BR. 1, Country Club, W. A. Havard; Rocka-
way, L. L, Hunting Club J. E. Cowdin; Somerset
County, N. J., Polo Club, Charles Pazer; Southam p-
ton, L. L, Polo Club, Robert J. Collier; St. Louls,
Mo., Country Club, Charles Hodgman; Staten Island,
N. Y., Polo Club, Morton W. Smith; The Couutry
Club, Brookline, Mass,, F. Blackwood Fay; West-
chester Polo Club, Newport, R. I., Thomas Hitchcock,
Jr; Washington, D. C., Polo Club, Hugh Legare;
Saratoga, N. Y., Polo Club, John Manning, Jr,;
Alken, S C., Polo Club, E. L. Smith.

In addition, the Atlantio City Country Club,
which has laid outa polo fleld near its horse
show grounds, and is to be elected to mem-
bership at the meeting, will be represented by
G. Jason Waters.

One of the most important features of the
meeting will be to decide whether the Polo
Association will give its official countenance
to the teame that may enter for the open
events to be hold during May on the Bagatelle

eld at the Paris Exposition. It is concoded

at members of any club or clubs in the
loagee may entorat Paris as teams on their own
account, but when it comes formally to repre-
seat the Polo Asseviation, it Isavother case ulto-
gether. Some weeks ago the way seemed clear
to having a representative team in the Paris
matches, for Foxhall Keen», who brought a
strong team of polo ponies to Engiand last
fall, bad arranged to play in the Lagateile
events with L.andJ. M. Waterbury, Jr, and
J. F Cowd pn. For various reasons this pan
aveme t pve miacarried, but there {3 no
doubt that Mr. Keene can make up a good
team frem the players who are now abroad,
many of whem funt each winter in England or
Ireland. There is mere than appears on the
eurfase regarding the imppriates of backing
up such a team with the official stamp of the
Pole Asseciation. For instance, on the shield
ofa fine allver oup that adorns the sideboard
atthe Hurlingham Club, London, is the fol-
lowing inscription:

The Challenge Cup, won at Newport, U S. A., in
1863, by a team seat out and duly accredited from
the Hurlingham Club, captained by Mr. J. W. Watson.

This cup must be duaty by this time, but ft !s
held by the Hurlingham Club under the con-
dition that any international team may
challenge apd play forit on the Hurlingham
greunds. Rie ho.dere ure looking forward
to the day, sooner or Jater, when an American
team wilt put in an appearance, and, shoulda
Polo Association team pley at Paris without
challenging, the Hurlingham Club would feal
slighted, Sin the other hand, should a seratch
team be beaten at Furlingham under the Polo
Aasooiation’s cognizince,

 

our home clubs
wou'd ba jarred, Thia matter will be threshed
out at the meeting ‘

There iano doubt but thatthe broad fleld at
Prospect Park ja the best for the grand annual
chainplonship for the Astor Gold Cup, but the
players in other quarters are objecting to the
monopely of such attractive eventa by New
York. While no club would care to see the
Prospect Park meeting canes)led except under
the unusual caneea which led to its abandon-
ment Jaat fall, {t/a proposed to have an early
season championship each yearata club near
Boston, Phi'adelphiaor in the West in turn,
OMcers for the year will also be elected, put
there ja no opposition to the re@lection of FH, L.
Herbert as chairman, a piace that he has filed
since the orgarization of the Polo Association,
He is sometimes called the “Father of Ameri-
ean Pole,”

Aachedale of the season's handicap tourna-
ments will also be arranged, Usually these
eventa do not begin until May, but this year
the Aiken Polo Clu has already hel a tourna-
mentand another one is dated for Lakewood,
beginning on next Saturday
will be held on the three polo flelds iaid ont by
Georgo J. Goul?, oprosite his resent'y con-
structed Georgian Court, the finost private
ri¢iog stables and ring fn America. Fight
taama will take part in. this tournament,
and there are now over three hundred polo
ponies at Lakewoed, The St. Louts team
{8 to come on by a special train. This
wil bo tho first tournament ever he'd
at Lakewood, Next year it is expected that

Jacksanvi'!o and Atiantic City will fall inte
line. Then the spring tournaments will be as
important as the midsaumer ones, The prizea
in the Lakewood Polo Ciub events will be the

Georgian Court cups, for teams of four ugder
the regular handicaps, presented by Mrs.
George J. Goald, and the Herbert trophies,

for teams on whieh noindividual shall have a)

handicap exceeding five goals and whore ag-

Entries for the First Indoor Championships
of the Metropolitan Association of A. A. U.

The committee in charge of the firet indoor
championships of the Metropolitan Association
met on Friday to pass on the entries for the
games to be held at the Forty-seveuth Reg!-
ment armory next Wednesday. Although the
Now York A, C, was entitled to enter all the
undergraduates who won national champlon-
ships last year they refrained from taking ad-
vantage of the strict interpretation of the rule,
and have acted in accordance with the spirit
of the new rules by only sending in the names

of those athletes who reside in the metropoll-
tan district. As MW, Long, the champion
sprinter, is still on the Injured list from the
sprained ankle received in Boston the club
which, has scooped nearly all the champion-
ships {n recent years, will be represented by
one national champion, R. Sheldon, and several

and he induced anumber of men to try forthe
team, with the result that. Faton, formerly of
the Boston University, and McLintock of Law-
renceville School made the team. Faton isa
