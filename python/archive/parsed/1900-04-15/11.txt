REAL ESTATE NEWS,

 

The realty market in the past week—in spite
of the fact that little attempt was made to do any-
thing on Good Friday and that Saturday ha.e
come to be practically a half-holiday, the real ea-
tate traternity folowing the Wall Sireet example
~—bas been far more satisfactory than any week
this year. I¢ has upheld the predictions of some
brokers who looked for a boom at Easter time,
and it came a litte before Easter. There tr litile
doubt that the end of the scssion of the Legisla
ture restored confidence.

The principal sales of the week occurred in
the Fifth avenue section, Joseph Pulitver buy-
tng on East Seventy-third street and two sales
being made by the Barney-Shelden syndicates
plots in the old Roman Catholic Orphan Asylum
property. The last portion of that property has
been eold, Bryan L. Kennelly making the an-
nouncement yesterday.

The auction market also furnished a couple
of sales of magnitude, although the really big
offerings at auction are to come {n the remain-
ing two weeks of this month, The sale of the
Fifth Avenue Hotel property will occur on April
26. During this week one of the large offerings
will be that of the estate of John S. Young, which
will be sold by Herbert A. Sherman on Wednesday.

A notable real estate sale will be held under
the direction of Peter ¥. Meyer & Co., auctioneers,
on Tuesday, when the properties which, during
their lifetimes, were held jointly by Duncan C.
Pell and Walden Peil, will be disposed of at pub-
Ho auction. These joint holdings comprise two
parcels, the sale of which will be of especial in-
terest to real estate men.

The largest parcel is that located on the east
aide of Broadway between Forty-first and Forty-
eecond atreets. It ty flanked on either side by
@ large hotel, the one on the north, the St Cloud,
being owned by the Astor estate, and the one
on the south, the Stewart House, being owned
by Sire Brothers. This Pell parcel has a frontage
of 56 feet 11‘, inches, and tw designated by the
numbers 1456, 1458 and 1460 Broadway; {tts 197
feet 6 inches deep on one side, and 92 feet 5*,
inches on the other; in the rear it is 54 feet and
*, inch in width.

The extraordinary development of this portion
of Broadway through recent years will render
the sale of this parcel very interesting, the land
being ready for devolopment and at present occu-
pied by wooden shanties, which will be removed
on May 1 by the present tenant, whose lease ex-
pires then. It is understood that an attempt was
made last year to purchase this property for 8275,-
000, but the transaction could not be completed
owing to the imposethility of giving good tile
by any other means than a parfition anit on ac-
count of the great number of outstanding interests
tn the property.

Another very interesting eale belonging to the
fame estate will be that of No. 840 Sixth avenue,
‘This {9 on the northeacet comer of Twenty-first
street and Sixth avenue, and in the heart of the
ratail dry goods district. It ls opposite the estore
of Adams & Co,

A «mail bi ding at the junotion of Broadway
nod Sicth evenue, adjoining the Thirty-third
etreet -tat.on ef the Sixth avenue elevated road,
ta expected to produce lively bidding. The buiid-
i g ts old, but the land situated next to the corner

| nosseases, it te supposed, great value in view of

the rentals whfch are being obtained in this local-
ity and the central character of the locality, The
other parcels are situated on Sixth avenue above
Forty-second street, It is expected that this sale
will bring out many representatives of the older

ew York families, by reason of the conservative
character of the properties that are to be offered
tor -ale, and on account also of the interest which
attaches to the disposition of the estates of men
who were go well known in their dey ee were Dun
oan ©, Pell and Walden Pell.

Joseph Levy & Son, with the cooperation of
Schrag & Richtberg, sold the property at! o, 808
Weat Twanty-cighth street, repurted yesterday.

Nos, 65 to 69 Fourth avenue have been trana-
ferred to Abbott L. Dow fora nominal sum. Har-
ria C. Fahnestock passed title in Nos, 802, 304
and 306 Fast Twentieth street yesterday to the
New York Post-Graduate Medical School and
Hospital

Plana were filed with the Building Commission-
er yesterday by W. C. Dickerson, architect, for
four four-story brick flat houses to be built for
James T. Barry, owner, at Franklin avenue and
