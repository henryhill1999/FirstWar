with rience of inn-keeping gained in

poston, started The Stu lio, People said that

there woul be no custom there, but Ingalls

had looked overths ground and concluded that

there was room for a good eating house in that

region, being, as it was, just off the line of re-
ty} busines#on Broadway, At that time Pfaf's,

It wus no part of Ingalla's scheme to make

tgot so tl atthe irtist’s -clal quarters on
e second floor had all the characteristics of a
eub. William M, Chase was at that time the
‘ eading spirit of tue artistic element of the

ehophouse and his taste and Judgment were
atthe service of the host in the matter of his

 

coveeting. On the lower floorthe lute-at-night
crowd of hewapaper men, musieiins and actors
net to discuss, over their chops aud ale, the
topics of the day, Discussion was often ani-
mated, but always decorous. The habitues of |

the Studio felt it to be @ home to an extent
that enlisted their interest to the point of es-
tat lishing certain unwritten Jaws of behavior
which none might transgresas with impunity

Undoubtedly Ingalls might have extended
the chophouse and made of it a regular res(au-
rapt with profit to himaelf, but he preferred to
keep it as he had founded it. The times
ehanged but the Studio did not change with
them, A succeeding generation found the
same quiet, the saine good fare aud old-
fasiioned courteous service. Tha Studio's
walters were the best trained in the city,
ahete was an atmosphere of restfulness pre-

ling that held the old customers loyally to
their tables, A writer in the Vollector for July,
185, gives his view of the Studio while [ngalis
ran it.

“We have plenty of chophouses still but
they are not of the old kind and the names

that adorn. their sign boards are not
of the old-time friendly flavor They
aspire to the pretentious character

of restaurants and disdain the less ostenta-
tious and more intimate and genial quality of
the inn, The Studio obtained its original rep-
utation as a rarebit house, but the knowin

ones were well aware that. such substantia
regalements as fatchups and juicy steaks and
savory kidneys were equally aceessible. | It
served nutty old ale from the wood, * * *
and in the way of breakfast there was no other
such place in New York for rashers of bacon
and ham, for newlald eg@s, Yarmouth bloaters,
toast and strong tea, * * * From tirst to last
the Studio was an inn and not a mere eating
house, and the landlord wasa visible person-
ality who knew his guests and how to serve
them, not a mysterious capitalist represented
bv a head waiter and a cashter.”

The writer goes on to speak of the charac-
teristic decorations of Browne's place, of tha
chop houses of the Cliftons, Harry and Charley,
and of Rolfe’s, and continues:

‘But none of t these, or any othera,
touched The Studio in the high quality and

erfect harmony of its decorations. * * *
The proprietor had some natural predilection
for beautiful things, encouraged no doubt by
the strong artistic character of his customers
and he indulged hia hobby. He bought old
masters and modern pictures, weapons of the
middle ages and of the last century, antique
bronzes and ones ofour own time; so it was
also with his porcelains, his bric-A-brae, his
very furniture. The place waa fitted up like a
studio, even to its very fenderatthe grate, its
Dutch clock in the corner, the old decanters in
which your wine and spirits came upon the
table, The title by which it was known
thr oughout the town, if not the country, be-

MORTON STATUE ACCEPTED,

 

Addresses in the House in Eulogy of Indiana's
War Governor.

Wasninaton, April 14.—The House at 1
o'clock to-day considered the Senate soncur-
rent resolution accepting as a gift from the
State of Indiana the statue of Oliver P. Morton,
Governor of and Senator from that State

Addresses were delivered by the several
members of the Indiana delegation and by
Messrs, Cannon (Rep, Uh), Grosvenor
(Rep., Oblo) and Alexander (Rep., N.Y), who
hod spent part of their lives in Indiana, ‘

Mr. Steclea, the dean of the de.egation,
reviewed the career of the subject of Mr
Morton, dwelling with emphasis upon his
record as “Indiana's War Governor.” He
called attention to a declaration made by
Morton in a sneech at Fort Wayne, in the
campaign of INO, Upon a topic of engrossing
national interest at the present time, Stephen
A. Douglas had given tothe Demorratic party
its shibboleth of State sovereignty. Mr.
Morton attacked this as a catch phrase, said
Mr. Steele, designed to covera hateful doctrina,
and proved by close logie that Congress and
Congress alone bad the Constitutiona) power to
make neediul ru’esand regulations for the
Territory. He suid: “The Territories are the
property of tha General Government, and the
n@bt to acquire them will not be disputed,
Would the right to acquire, without the power
to govern the thing acquired, be of any value?
The right to wovern, theretore, isan incident
of the right to acquire. ‘The Territories belong
to ail the people ofthe United States and not
toany particular partofthem, They belong
to them in their corporate, national and gov-
ernmental capacity, This being the case, how
shali the people, the nation, express them-
salves or make manifest their wishes respect+
ii their property, thease Territories, excepung
through Congress?”

In conclusion Mr. Steele said: ‘In 1807 the
General Assembly of the State of Indiana, com-
posed for the most partof men who were un-
r rn when the War of the Rebelion was bewun,
and who were but lads when Morton died,
passed a resolution authorizing the Governor
of the State fa appoint a commission to pro-
cure @ statue of Indiana's great War Governor,
to be placed in Statuary Hall, thus recog nizing
him as a man ‘ilustrious for his historic re-
nown, for distinguished service to the State,’
and as ‘most worthy of national ecommemora-

tion, Aa citizens of Intiana we are proud to
know that inthe years to come the statue of
Oliver PO Morton will standin that great hall

among those of the emiment men of other
States-an evidence of our supreme apprecia-
tion of hes great and glorious service to the
State and nation He was @ courageous
patriot, a loyal friend, an honest man.”

Mr. Miers (Dem, Ind. said: As a representa
tive of the St Indiana T take pleasure in

More Talk of Steel Company Consolidation,
