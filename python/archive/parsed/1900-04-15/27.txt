Loxpon, April 6.—That most dramatic of

quoting phrase jof Mr, Pinero’s, that fever
would be the only heat which would permeate
his body. Ho does not go about freely, since
he is tied to his office through the multitudinous
onres of his command, and he is chiefly happy
when he can anetch the time to escape upon
one of those nocturnal, silent expeditions,
which alone ealm and assuage the perpetual
exoitement of his present existence, Oute

personally watched.

«WHEN YOU ARE iN DOUBT FOLLOW THE MAIN
TRAVELED RCAD.”

TAT is what the farmer said when he was directing a stranger on his journey. “When you come
to the crossroads keep to the main traveled way.” There’s a sound logic in that advice which
those who are starting out in search of health might well heed. “Stick to the main traveled

road and you will como out all right.”

Many hundreds of thousands of people have marked a path for you to follow. It has led them
to health, This path which they have trodden leads to the Invalids’ Hotel and Surgical Institute, of
Buffalo, N. Y., whero Dr. Pierce, the chief consulting physician, and his staff numbering nearly a score
of experionced and skilled specialists, are every day engaged in the treatment and cure of chronic
diseases. Much of tho treatment is by correspondence. Any sick person is invited to consult Dr.
R. V. Pierce by letter absolutely free of charge and uncer the promise of absolute privacy.

There is hope for everyone who begins the use of Dr. Pierce's treatment. Out of the many
thousands treated, nincty-cight per cent. have been absolutely cured by Dr. Pierce and his statf of
physicians A great number of these were the “hopeless” cases for which the home doctor said nothing
could be done. People with weak lungs, obstinate cough, bronchitis, and other forms of disease which
if neglected, or badly treated, lead on to consumption, have been positively cured through the advice
of Dr. Pierce and his staff of skilled specialists, and the use of that marvelous medicine, Dr. Pierce’s
Golden Medical Discovery.

"Sarah E, Taylor, of Eureka, Greenwood County, Kansas, writes: *I
wish to say to you for the benefit of suffering humanity, I had been a
sufferer for fifteen years nearly all the time; and in Angust, 1896, was
taken with severe cramping pain in my stomach. The doctor here said it
was due to gall stones, He relieved me for a short time, and then there
was a hard lump about the size of a goose egg formed in my right side.

It became so sore I could scarcely walk about the house, and I had no
appetite. I consulted two of the best doctors in town and they said

had not taken more than half a bottle of each when my appetite came
back. Now it is a little over a year since I began to do my own work.
I have taken seven bottles of Dr. Pierce’s Golden Medical Discovery and
seven vials of the ‘Pellets,’ and am stronger than I have been for five
years,”

"I was taken sick in July, last year, and was not able to do any kind of
work until November,” writes Mr. Noel W. Orvin, of Langley, Aiken Co.,
S.C. “Had been coughing up small, hard lumps of phlegm for about
a year before I was taken down; I then called on a doctor who attended
me for two months, and said that one-half of my left lung was gone, and
advised me to leave my home (Charleston, S. C.), and go to the country,
but did not say what sort of disease I had. I thought it was consump-
tion, and wrote to you for advice. I took fonr bottles of Dr. Pierce’s
Golden Medical Discovery, which I sincerely believe has done me more
good than any other medicines I -have ever taken.”
