the

Drese assumes fresh importance at the opening
festival of spring fashions on Kasver morning
when woman casts aside her metaphorical cocoon
of seckcloth and ashes and appears again in all
the glory of new attire. Atleastitis one of her pet
Prerogatives to blossom outin a new hatand gown
and join in the procession which parades Fifth
evenue on Easter day. Hut if she wishes to
acquire real elegance and be quite distinct from
the motley throng she will meekly don her ac
C@tomed costume and avoid the appearance of
being clad in new finery. The elements are @
prime factor in the success or failure of the dress
display, but however few or many new gowns
there may be in sight this annual pageant is the
dividing line between winter and summer fashions, |
and serves to launch the new modes |

The season's plan in regard to clothes is defined, |
the theme is given oul to the multitude, and while |
there may be additions and endless variations |

Gemmer Novelties Now on Display Very
Tempting tothe Feminine Mind—Machine

later on, fashion has become a visible demon-
stration much to the joy of the woman who has
kept Lent as a season of self denial. Considering
the early display of summer novelties flaunted
tempting|y in her face it would seem asf there must
be a genuine trust conspiring against ber Lenten
principles of abnegation and her failure to rest
must be jndged only as a sort of tribute to her
femininity. A wholesome measure of the love
of dress is « part of woman's charm, and if she
does not possess it she is lacking in one of her
most fascinating possibilities of social success.
Very attractive elements of the new fashions
are the daintiness of the new fabrics, their ex-
quisite harmony of coloring, and the wealth of
handwork employed in the finish of the gowns,
“Seven maids with seven needles stitching seven
years” could not accomplish the intricacies of
detail which this one season offers to the modish
world. Machine stitching, too, has a large place,
end iw value as a means of decoration t# more
fully appreciated than ever before. A whole
volume might be written about the bountiful
use of lace which even amid all the other modes
of trimming is decidedly the ruling motif, with

Wedgwood bue in a soft bit decided tint is one
of the popular colors and is very effective in the
pew veiling Canvas veiling is indeed one of the
leading fabrics of (he season, and while it i¢ un-
usually plain there is one pretty variety striped
with fine white cords half an inch apart. In pate
gray made over white oilk tt is mot charming,
eapecially with the white chiffon flounce at the feet
This flounce is gathered. finished with a narrow
ruche, and ik foundation

tucks extending down ty twelve inches
of the hem, whieh is trimmed with lave set di-
ectly on the edge, the chiffon underneath add
ing much to the effect Lisertions with the deep
acalloped edie are very eft dive for this purpose,
and so are the festooned designs, and a very ele-
gant skirt is made by adding medallions of lace
down the spaces between the groups of tucks

A decidedly novel mode of trimming ia seen

on @ome of the new foulard gowns with white
grounds. For the cloth bands which were used
on the foulards jast season woo! canvas veiling
fe substituted. A bias fold of the veiling match-
ing the color in the figured design and fully
two inches wide is covered with rows of stiteh-
ing and used to edge the shaped flounces on the
skirt. Shaped fiounces are still in sight, adding
variety to the many ways of trimming skirts, but
they are cut with very little flare. Another unusual
trimming on a foulard with a white ground pat-
terned over with a blue design js a rather narrow
flounce of blue mousseline finished with two
narrow bias folds of the mushn with blue silk
Tom Thumb fringe on the lower edge of each.
