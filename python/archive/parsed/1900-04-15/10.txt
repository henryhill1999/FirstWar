GOLFING AT ST. ANDREWS.

JOHN REID, JR, WINS THE FIRST
MONTHLY HANDICAP.

W. K. Fowler Scores Mis Third Successive Vic-
tory at Dyker Meadow-—A Start at the
Martne aad Field Clab— Results at Lakewood

There were twenty etarters {n the first
month!y handicap of the season at the Ht,
Andrew's Golf Clab yeeterday. It was the
opeoing of the clad's twelfth year and two of
the competitors at least, H. O. Tallmadge and
J.B. Upham, could trace thetr golfing careers
back to the earliest match of the elab on the
old “Apple Tree” course at Yonkers, The
winter greens were used, which kept the
scoring on the hizh side, but the fair greens
were in fine order. The President, J. B.
Thomas, who has been journeying on the
Continent and tn Egypt, was one of the
onlookers, Among other visitors were
J. Nevitt Steele and Frank Simmons,
both from Natley, who had a private match,
Steele, who was quite a prominent Agure in the
open tournaments two years ago, ia now
located (n Georgia and is only hereona fying
trip. Allthe regular greens were uncovered
and they wil! be in use withia @ month, They
are in beautiful turf, both oo the high and the
lowlands, and it will no longer be possible to
St. Andrew's a links lacking [n perfect
greens. Oneof the best-known players of the

e'ub, by the way, after getting onto one of tha
closed greens vn the approach shot yraterday,
ca.miy played the ball of with amashie. Fort.
unateiy the turf wasnot cut, but al who saw
the stroke were horror-etricken

“The chances are that he wou! ld deny thea ‘t
the bystands:

 

 

   

it ed dowa,” said one of
L many enthusiasts he is in a trance until
each ho e ig made.”

“Trance of not,” was the retort of ancther
oker, “at any of the links abroad anid
many here be woaid be fined ‘or Using any
thing core & putter on the greens. aa‘ that
he played froma cloxed greeu should aggre-
vate the enorm'ty of the offence.”
