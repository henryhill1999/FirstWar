N he said, “I haint no impossible things
to speak of as T recollect I should only be able
to give a runnin glance at what I know as the
true West. ‘To me, the true West was Iinterestin’
‘ough It was in 1854 that I enlisted fn the
Vnited States Navy, being set at duty on the
sloop of war Decatur T was just 17 years old.
We left Hostonin November and went to the West
Wa were in search of the San Francisco,
I think it was, that had been lost, We were at
St. Thomas and Santa Cruz, We putin at Nor-
folk. Va, where | shipped on a Government lighter
and wentto Texas [left seafaring at Indianola
and hired out as a Government teamster, | drove
from (« hristi southwestward to Ringgold
barracks, about 130 miles, and from Corpus Christi
to Sap Antonio, 150 miles, and from San Antonio
to Fort Davis in Presidio county, western Texas,
850 miles.

That country was pretty rough In them days,
prairie dogs, coyotes, rattlesnakes, greasers,
Indians,and as farasthe eye could reach, rollin’
plains My team consisted of six mules an’ I
drove the whole kit with one lina It took ua
many weeks to make our way up to San Antonio
and on to Fort Davis an’ back. NO road, only
asortof trail, an’ always had to be keepin’ a sharp
eye out for the cussed Indians, We had generally
about fifteen wagons in a common mule train,
sometimes as many as twenty-five went along
and seldom less than eleven. We usually drove
from sun up to about noon or 2 o'clock, Then,
we'd halt for camp, always, of course, lookin’
out to get as good a place as possible for water
an’ grass, We'd herd out the mules to graze
‘till next mornin’, each teamster takin’ his turn
at the herding Them teamsters was of about
all kinds of humanity, Yankees, Kentuckians,
Mexicans and fellers from all over creation We
got 830 « month and rations,

“From teaming, I went over to Gollad, north of
Corpus Christi, an' hired out toa Yankee, named
Stowe, He had aplace right tn the settlement an’
a couple of mighty good lookin’ daughters,
so my Job there of a sort of general functionary
was kinder agreeable. Stowe had @ contract
for carryin’ the mails. I used to carry the mail
on one of them contrary devils known as ‘broncos.’
They waa trickier than the greasers, but tougher
n biled owl. My route was from Gollad to Vic-
toria, twentyelght miles, an’ back. There was
one trip & week made between the two places,

“There was about three thousand fn the herd,

the cattle have to be looked after mighty careful

miles a day, for they had to hava plenty of rest

was ordered to Salt Lake an’ we at once set oil
over the mountains When we reached the river
Jordan, forty miles west of Salt Lake, Brigham
Young sent a messenger warnin’ the troops mot
to cross that river inte the Mormon country, Our
Colonel told the messenger to tote back word
that “twould be crossed ff ‘twas al the gates ©

we could sweep the whole Mormon insututiona
We had a twelve-pound howitver and them (alt

A guard for provost duty was stauoned at the
gates o' the Tabernacle. What did the Mormons |
do but close up the gates an’ make an’ opening
on other side! ‘They was so afraid the caze
o’ our troops would harm their pretty Mormon
maids, I s'pose

“There was & Mormon come into camp one
day an approached a sergeant about buyin’
arms. It appeared he wanted a Jot o rifles an’
was willin’ to pay for ‘em, part in money an’
part in vegetables \ job was put upon him,
an’ when he come in next day with the cash an’
4 load o' vegetables, he was given some guns
from which the springs bad been taken an’ after
he'd got off about three quarters of a mile, A posse
set out after him an’ arrested the eritter, A
trial was held an’ he was putin the penitentiary
There was a private another ume that had a
pistol that had been in the Mountain Meadow
massacre an’ he set great store by it. ‘Thera
was 4 Mormon hangin’ around his tent one day,
an’ the soldier steppin’ out for @ minute, the

 

Mormon sneaked in an’ stole the pistol. The
boys finally ketched the eritter an’ the Colonel
ordered him put in the sweatbox, ‘This was

a room just big enough for a man to stand up
in an’ an as pitch, with only a little openin’
at the top to lectin air. Livery five minutes water
Was throwed over Mr. Mormon, but he never
flinched, though the water the boys used was
taken from the river an’ the ice had to be broke
before they could get it. We never saw that
varmint around the camp again

In the spring of '63 there bad been two fami-
lies of emigrants, consisting of thirteen persons,
killed, and forty men of Troop K, with Capt Sam

over Goose Creek Mountain an’ the first might we
camped we had six feet of snow for @ change.
We had no tents nor nethin’, but we cut willow
an’ stuck ‘em in the snow, bendin’ ‘em over like

Sketch of Charles M. Schwab, Head of the
Greatest Stee! Works in America,
From Casster’s Magasine,

The ranks of those who have won diatino-
tion in developing the American fron and
steel industry to its present high state hold as |
one oftheir youngest, and yet one of their
most prominent, members Charlos M, Schwab,
the President of the Carnegie Steel Company, |
Limited, of Pittsburg. He is a native of the
State of Pennsylvania, and was born on Feb, |
18, 1862, at Williamsburg, Blair county, His
remote ancestors were Germana, but hia pare |
ents were native Americans. His father wasa |
woollen manufacturer at Williameburg for |
many vears, In 1872 the family removed to
Loretto, Pa, a littia mountain hamlet on the |
crest of the Alleghanies, famous as the cradle |
of Catholicity of the western slope of the Alles |
whanies, and the place where the Princes |
Priest, Dametrius Gailitzen, kin to the present |
house of Russia, struggled 100 years ago to |
plant the cross and spread civilization. Loretto
is the oldest seat of religion and learning In
the United States west of Philadelphia, and
there, under the tutelage of the Trancisonn
friars, young Schwab received his set. |
entifie education, When bnt a boy. before his |
college days, his time was employedon the
farm and in driving the coach which carried |
the mails and passengers from Cresson
station up to Loretto. his father having at that
time the contract forcarrying the mails ha- |
twoen these points:;and there are many who
yet remember the President of the great Car-
negia steel Company as the smiiing, courteous
lad whose intelligent conversation entertained
them onthe four-miladrive from Cresson to
Loretto

In July, 1880, he was graduated from college,
and {mmediately set out to earn bis Jivellhood,

Falling Off in Receipts Because the English
Stay Away--Prince of Monaco’s In-
creased Demands—Bank Runs the State,

From the j.ondon Standard.

The apnual meeting of the Monte Carlo
Gambling Company was held this afternoon at
the Casino. The company during the year has
been seriously embarraseed to meet the demands
of the Prince under the contract, because they
had to pay him down a year ago 10,000,000 franca,
or £400,000, Now the total receipta this year
have only amounted to 28,000,000 francs, tn
stead of 24,600,000 francs last year With the
rent for the hotel and cafe, the Paria, amounting
to 760,000 fraues, or £30,000, the wtal receipts
reached £050,000. The company, therefore, te
only able pay this year a dividend of 200 franca
