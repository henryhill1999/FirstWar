REVENGE OF MARY ELLEN. |

CUMMIAKEY SOUNDS THE |

KAIST SIDL LOVE,

Mary Ellen Loved Geraninms and Also |
Cheesey—When a Crisis Came She Sacri-

ficed Her Flowers to Show Her Devotion |
to the Man Who Mad Driven Her Wild.

Geraniums were Mary Filleas fad
a rich @irl might take one corner of the conserva
tory for a miniature violet plantation or a fermery,
Mary Bllen took the front window will of the Casey
home, overloohing Mulberry streets
block. She had arranged eight species of her |
favoriie flower in a row, raised from slips = Four |
had achieved the dignity of pots, while the others |
were still in the tomatycan preliminary stage
awalting their development

Three were scarlet, one a double variety that!
was the pride of Mary Ellen's heart ‘Then there
was a verbena geranium with its ornate fragrant
leat and a darling Hive pink baby that waa com-
ing on Gnely The others were yet possi bili des,
Mary Ellen had bought them as 4 marked down
lot from a street pedier who gave them t& her
for # song on account of the broken off flower

most select

stems

Mary Ellen worked in a big factory uptown.
Before 6, each morning, she went to her work
in a Second avenue car and came home by the
game route each night Hor life was extremely
monotonous, hard and without color except for
her two joys the geranium farm and Cheesy
Cummiskey

It cannot be said that Cheesey Cummishey
resembled Mary Ellen's other fad in the least |
There was nothing floral in his personality. He
was the assistant barheeper in a Mulberry street
saloon, and mornings, as Mary Ellen passed
on her way to work, he was engaged with @ hose
and & mop and 4 broom in washing off vanous
gratings rubber mats and bric-wbrac thes made
part of the interior furnishing of the Mulberry
street wetgoods emporium where he worked

Mary Ellen, who in her way was dainty and
sweet as her flowers, blushed rosily at the sight
of Cheesey's remarkably flue, white arias from
which the Sleeves of his sweater were rolled back
almost to the shoulder. If Mary Ellen had ever
visited the galleries abroad she would have com-
pared him mentally to a Greek gladiator done in
marble As it was she only thought inarsticu
lately that he was as strong 44 she was little and
weak. So she blusued red as the big double
peariet bloom on the window at home. Cheesey
appreciatively said, “Ab dere!’ And thus tie
romance, so nearly tragic, dawned

In Ume, they spoke to each other in the light
badinage of the Mulberry street soclal code.
Cheesey chirruped as Mary Ellen tripped by
and she very properly wid him to @wan and give
her none of his funny bizpess

“Abh-b. fergit it,’ said Cheesey, leaning
on bis mop socially barring ler way Will
youse come wo the Friendly Sons Muoanlight Soiree
on de eight”

“What do youse take me fer
fodignanuy. “I'm no pick up!”

“Abb h!" said Cheesey, “don't I know who
VYouse are? Don't yer father, Mickey  ( asey,
tome in here every Satuday’ Ask him who
i heesey Cummiskey is, dat’s all!”

In this simple yot circumspect way Mary Ellen

acquired Cheesey Cummiskey as a steady. ( heasey
wilh Lis sweater sleeves rolled back WAg s'atuesq ue,

but alter working hours on his nigbw of ne
was resplendent Ny et n he swaggered down
the block to Mary Fille) s, silence ie on groups

at doors and it was whi pores

“Phere goes Mary Hon Casey's gen'l’man
friend."

‘The girls in the bor
for him in ingenuous N
for the first time Cheesey expesjenced the delig bt-
ful thrill of a genuine Indy killer, ‘or Cheesey,
until now, had had no dailiance with the vendet
passion, His ambition had been in the sporting
Ene to the exclusion of any weakness fot femi
hinity. He was wont to swing padien chibs and
puneh a bag in the cellar of the saloon, secreuy
fitting himself for an entrance to the profession
he worshipped.

But Mary Hllen's eyes, mutely breathing her
admiraven for him, had touched some vulnerabie
spot in his makeup. Her pale pretuiness and
grace were in such contrast to most of the young
woinen in C heesey's set that be told his associates
at the various picnics and balls to which he ea-
corted her that she was a lady, and that the first |
man who forgot that fact would be jabbed inthe

” sald Mary Ellen

began to set their caps
ulberry street styie, and

slais by him, Cheesey. And the young men,
cognizant of ¢ ‘heegey’ s muscular arms, desisted.
Now Mary Kkilen had her limitations. She

|
was, 4s the young Jades at the factory said, wo |
danin pertickler t6 live She abtected to a gteat j
many things that are considered srnictly up te cate
in low as well as high circles, and waa even called | 81
@ stuck-up thing by some of the girls, nowbdly
Liz Roscoe, who gaye imitations of Mary Isllen’s |
prim behavior at balls and mixed ale patties to |
which she was biiden as Cheesey's gir)

Mary Klien had nowbeen out long hat was
easily seen as she returned from various fun
tions in late horse cars when every other girls
head rested in holy slumber on the cheat of her

wort, Mary Edien aloge sitting stifly upright,
owing « heesey to hold ber hand only under pro-

 

test. but as tle boys said, she had him dead
and he only seemed to wax mor constant under |
her harsh treatment of lim. atis, until | iz

Roscoe began to guy him openty, at the same |
time luring him with an invitation in her beld
black eyes \t first he laugied at her, then he
swore and in each case she got back at him in like
manner with interest

Liz toseoe and her married stvter lived on the
floor below the Caseys, On the nights that( heesey
called on Mary illen Miss hitce WAs Wont to
array herselt in ber best and to plant herself at
the door, where she greeted him with jeers, Cheesey
chasing her on these occasions down the ball :
screaming with Laugliter, all of which penetrated |
to the floor abowe where Mary Fillen waited for |
Cheesey, her eyes upon the cleek. Mary Ellen

was one of those girls who do not believe in enter
taining one's steady on the deorstep,

Not content with this strategy, liz Roscoe
now began to lie in wait for Cheesey when he left
the Casey home about lO 6 clock, On these ocea
sions Mary Ellen and Cheetey came cut upon
the landing to utter their fareyella And to the
ears of the girl waiting in the dim!y lit ball below
were borne sounds thatindicated that Mary Ellen
was chary of her catesses, more so than’ heesey
wished, and again Liz Roscoe twitted him at
the foot of the stairs, until one night, maddened
by her fun making, his chase through the ball |
was successful and Mary Hllen, waiting to hear
hin leave, learned that Miss Hoscoe s ethics aa
to the extent of a gen'l'man friends farewells
were practically limitless

Next day Mary Ellen went by Cheesey in tha |
golden summer sunrise, passing y on the other |
side Had he been a symt<list or a problem
jay crank, be would have likened her to the
Soiit of Good whose ministrations he had for
feited by hisown evil deeds As it was he merely
whistled through his teett

(in his nextp ight olf Laz Roscoe # black gypsy
eyes met his atthe door This time there was
no Jeerin them but a tender appeal to his memory
Choesey gave one glance up to the ge fanium
crowned window above and loitered, intogicated

with his triumph Liz Roscoe in her red shirt. |
waist was like a full-blown rose compared to the }
pale, mid lide girl upstairs. Up there Mary !
Milen's heart was breaking, as girls’ hearts break |
at is She had felt that this night would mark |
a crisis, Cheesey would appear as usual She |
would greet him freezingly until he fully ex-

plained and promised to atone for his faithless

 

ness by taking n tice of the siren that lurked |

in the sha lows below |
but Cheesey was only human and he bad an !

idea that Mary Ellen would weaken and come

down, Or be would break away and go ip laver. |

He counted not on the arts by which girls with
black eves may enchain captives ii their glance. }
At the window crouched fary Lilen kneeling |
by her beloved plants ‘They were all that were |
left her now Yhe bitterness of an Octavia who
beholds her Antony ino the arms of a Cleopatra

consumed her Hot ch i ‘dtike ears came to her |
eyes What o humiliation’ Before the whole ts
block And their voices caise up to het

Why don't ye go up and see yer girl, Cheesey*”
asked Liz

“Ahhh! Wot'er ye givin’ us” said Chaesey

‘T’'ve no use fer ye,” said Laz with her lips while

of shooting at a brakeman on the Hurliogton

ovived his pay afew days before and was engaged |
at the time of the shooting in the picturesque |
red |
denied apy intent to pers |
He wild that
while it was true that he did take out his revolvet |
and shoot after the brakeman had pushed hin |
off the train, he was merely giving a prearranged
signal Teanda friend had been down Wer vad
a few miles and wanted to ride back t the nearest
station to the ranch Realizing thatif they were
found by any of the train crew they would be put |
off, they had arranged that jf one wes put olf |
the train he should notify his partner by firing
his revolver once
The trainman, with visions of what he firmly
believed was @ narrow escape from death, shook
bis head and the Judge looked unbelieving
Vance's cowboy friend corroborated the story,

but seeing that his tale failed to receive credence
the defendant asked the (court to please step out

of painting the count)
Vance velemently

back to the mark and drove each tack into the
wood Without a miss

Tie brakeman bad been looking on tn open-
