TORMENTS THE HAUGHTY OWNER
OF A BIG OFFICKL BUILDING,

Also Causes the Dismissal of an Agent- All
Came Through @ Story That the Owner
Made His Tenants Work « Pump When
They Pushed Around a Turnstile D 5

In the course of events it happened that young
Bixby of Wall street fell foul of the management
of the building wherein he is an office tenant ‘The
fmmediate cause wos some difficulty about an
elevator, the conductor of which was asleep or
otherwise engaged when icby signalled him to
stop. Then too, there had been a certain laxity
on the part of the caretakers In the cleaning of
Bixby’soffice, Consequently he had been ar nused
to the point of writng a letter to the agent for the
building. Now In epistolary literature Hixby's
forte \is a certain directness and forceful sim
plictty. Probably the agent didn't care much
for the gone of the communication, At any rate
bis reply was unsausfactory. lilxby promptly
wrote to the owner. The owner's secretary re
piled coldly referring him to the agent

*Thia is the mit,” said Bixby and he said tt
without wasting any breath {n assorted profanity

—with him asign of serious portent. “I will make
that gentleman think ho owns a hornet’s nest
{instead of building in the heart of New York.”

How to do it was a matter over which he pondered
with the ald of many drinks. Not that he took
the many drinks at one time, for that is a process
faconducive to proper thought What he did
was totake onodrink and go away and ruminate
each day. Ly the tenth day or thereabouts he
had evolved several plans which he discarded
ene by one, elther because they would have brought
him within the reach of the law, which was no part
ef his programms, or because they weren't suffi -
dentyvicious. Then he hit upon his grand {dea

he stranger in coming through the turnstile
doors which are atthe front entrance to the build-
fag got caught and was somewhat battered aa
te oil hat and temper

“Infernal nuisance those cattle doors are any-
way,” sald the trate stranger. “No use on earth
except to make a man doextra work.”

Then ho marvelled greatly for that a youth
standing close at hand accosted him with a beam-
{ng smile saying “Eureka” in Greek, and “Come
and have « drink” in English, and all the time
they were drinking the stranger alred rainbow
eptaions about the obstructive door and the youth,
who was Bixby, chuckled Mephistophelean chack-
lee in a deep tone after the manner of the younger
de Reszke, patting himself the while upon the thigh
ina highly approving manner. Hy the following
moming he had fully matured his plan. At noon
he stood Just ontsids the door and collected half
@ dozen of his acquaintances who had offices in
the building by repetition of the simple formula

“Come and have one with me.”

And there were present at that drink Perkins,
one of the most notorious gossips on Wall street,
Beodel of the tribe of kickers, both partners of the
firm of Schimmelsni{f & Mutthet!mer; Wiggins the
lawyer, and Bixby’s particular chum, Col. Waugh,
who doesn't belong in that building but had
Deen invited previously to play @ part in the game
and had cheerfully accepted. Bixby had chosen
his company well for his purposes. While the
drinks were mixing Col, Waugh, at an eloquent
wink from Bixby, remarced in off-hand tones

“That's a pretty slick agent the owner of your
Building has.”

“Tlow's that?” asked Bixby unconcernedly.

“Why, he's getting a lot of work out of all you
fellows.”

“The deuce he ts! I'd like to know how.”

“That turnstile door game. It's the slickest ap-
plication of an old principle I've seen this many 4
year. Wonder js that somebody hasn't thought
of it before.”

“What's that” asked Scobel, the kicker

“Just a little scheme of the agent's tomake you
fellows work out your own salvation,” explained
the Colonel. “He's run that turnstile shaft down
fnto the cellar and attached it to @ sort of pump
ing arrangement so Nhatevery Ume the door ts
turned it pumps water. Mighty ingenious game,
I call it.” ;

“Hahaha!” cried Bixby !
Bure enough No labor wasted there

“LE don't see where the | ymes In,” asserted
Scobel sourls Seems to me we're being worked,
all of us :

“Oh, well, [use the rear door mostly and as that’s

“Yes; but | use tie front door
Schimmelsnit! & Muttheimer in
dol come in”

“Come in the same place ¥
@ome good work pumping every time you turn

he little wheel,” said Bixby. "Oh, Lord, isn’t it

vely to think of the flyest Mrm on the Street be
ing done in that way” :

I call it an outrage.” said Wiggins, the lawyer.
"J believe we could sue on that.”

“What right has the agent got to make us do
work for him?” demanded Scobel. |

“And we don't get anything for it,” added Mutt

fmer, his partner, shaking his head dolefuhy

consonance with the sad thought =

“You don't suppose that it's the agent, do you
paid Bixby scornfully

“Who else would it be?” demanedd a full chorus,

“The owner, of course, He's one of the smooth
@at articles on the Street at putting up games.

“Probably it was the owner's idea,” agreed
Col Waugh, playing up nobly, “for I notice they
have a bie wooden partition around the place
@0 You can't see into it unless you are in the base-
ment when it is open, as I happened to be the
other day in search of a boothlack who wasn't

re atall. The agent wouldn't be likely to be

ilding partitions on his own motion.”

“That's so,” said Wiggins. “The
fly old poy.”

“May he wont have such a notion of his
flyness when he gets through with this," de
dared Schimmelsniil, “There's others that are
fly too.”

“You've been taken fn this time all right, though,

d man,” sald Hixby industriously fanning the

mes, “He's got the laugh on you."

“T bet the firm has putin a hundred dollars of
work on that door,” mused Muttheimer sadly

“Couldn't we get an expert to fleure ont how
many ‘feet pounds, or whatever they call It, are
worked on that door per day?” asked Perkins, the

sip. .

“L could work that out approximately myself,

“That's me, too,” declared Wiggins

Thaywer, don't let me in for any row,” said
Bixby. “I'm not interested, you, know, but its

Then the convention broke up and Bixby and

Uprising of the Natives,

The British are now sending a few hundred
troops from the coast to Cumassi, the old capital
of Ashanti, to punish the natives there who have
taken up arms against their white rulers, killed
and wounded @ number of the Uritish police and
prevented the missionaries and other whites
from leaving the town. An official report re
ceived at the coast says the uprising is due to
the efforts of the British ow obtain
of the golden stool of Ashanu At the time King
Prempeh surrendered to the Dritish expedition
which defeated him four vears ago, it was asserted
that the hing had buried the golden stool with
thousands of dollars worth of other valuablo
property, hoping tat ume he might be
able to regain these treasures and use them to
his own advantage

The golden stool was the Ashanti substitute
for @ throne, and it was reputed
the most part of gold. It
furniture and was perhaps worth souis thousands
ofMfdollars. Tho irish have been searching
for this valuable relic and in fact have been d
ging holes far and wide around Cumas

» of unearthing other treasures

A great deal of gold was produced in As
for many years and most of it fon
the hands of the hing and the 1
cious metal was worked up inte rus

MONTANA TO GO REPUBLICAN,

Potent Reasons for That State’s Complete
(Chavge ot Heart,

Borre, Mon, April 11.— The returns from
the recent municipal elections in Montana show
the greatest political landstide known to the his
tory of the State, Indeed, the Democratic press
as yet has not recovered its equilibrium further
than to attribute the overwhelming defeat in all
seetions to overconfidence and to declare that
local issues were respansible, One Clark paper
ventured the statement that a Daly oretor's speech
in Helena cost the tieket hyndreds of votes, Yet
in Butte, the Democratic stronghold, the City
Council is equally dividedé or a gain of two Re
publican Sidermen, Hutte is Senator Clark's
home city. while Anaconda, Mareus Daly's Mon
elected three Republican and
three Demoeratie Aldermen, Great) Falls, for
the first time in seven years, will havea Republi
can city government Livirygston,
Sheridan, Miles City, Glendive and = Dillon, the
Republican ticket was successful, In) but one
city Bozeman did the Democrats gain and the
net result of that vietory was one Alderman,

But the greatest surprise came from Helena,
Edwards, Republican for Mayor,
received the largest) plurality on) reeord — 877,
‘This achievement is all the more remarkable
from the faet that his opponent was no less 4 per
sonage than ex State Auditor James Suilivan,
a former Mayor of this city, a8 well as @ promin
ent business man, The balance of the Republi
can ticket was elected by lance majorities, as
were also six of its seven aldermanic candidates,
The Republicans will thus have entire control
of the city’s affairs, which has not been the case
for many years

‘The Republican press in advancing reasons
for the radical change in sentiment, appears auite
unanimous In attributng it to the prosperity
so plainly visible throughout the State since the
inauguration of President McKinley, together
with the favorable manner in which his “keep
the Philippines” polley has been reevived; the
methods in vogue in both factions of the Demo
cratic party as disclosed durng the Wellcome
aud Clark disbarment cases, and the furhter
fact that while Montana, eliminating the silver
issue, is normally Republican by 5,000 majority,
unprecedented prosperity has enveloped the State,
although every silver mine has been closed down
for four or five years, Then again, it is con

tended, the Democrats are showing less devo
tion to silver aud may even throw itlover in the
hope of gaining prestige in the Fast ven
would 16 to 1 be made a cardinal plank in the
Demoeratic platform, the Republicans, while
a'mitting that municipalelections do not ab
solutely forecast the result of the more important
one to eome, feel extremely hopeful, and even
vome Democratic papers (among them the Butte
Mowr, Senator Clark's personal ongan) have
placed the State din the doubtful column
There are seve reasons for this. Four years
age the three silver parties were solidly for Bryan,
while at present the Populist party has virtually
erated, and the Silver Kkepublicans, Leaded
Lee Mantle, bave returned to their former
Nitical fant Then ogain the Clark Daly fight
In the Democratic ranks is being carted to an ex
treme never before witnessed and bids fair to dis
riupt it enitrels The formers, iystead of having
eat thelr sheep aud make the wool into home
jothing. as Was predicted by the Democratic
unless ryan was elected, are receiving
twenty to twenty five cents a pound for the want
as compared with SIX and seven cents under
toe Cleveland regime, and judging from the tone
of the country press, they are decidedly averse to

That the voters would indicate by an expression
at the polls this fall a desire for a change from
these conditions seems most improbable As one
paver expresses it, “Uryan js having a bard time
of itwiking calamity to people ail of whom have

The Dermoeratic press of Montana is almost
nanimeonsly opposed to Dewey as a Presidential
didate, holding that Bryan is, by reason of

Blink heard that the insurance business wag
a ood thing, that since the introduction of pole
icles which made for men without ang
special effort on their part, business men were
falling over one another in their anwiety to take
out insurance link finally got the idea thas
there were not half enough inserance sobettorg

| in the city of New York to attend to all the people
who wanted to take out insurance, and he mace
up his mind that if anything of a commercial
nature was ever proimge to suit him, it was this,
So with a package of credentials which vouched
for his reputation as a good fellow, but judic ously
aveided saying anything about his business
experience, Blink deseended on the general mana.
ger of a big lifeinsurancecompany, andinformed
him that he thought he had just the properamouns
of nerve and skill to makes good solicitor hin
expected a pleasant reception but he was not pre
pared for the lavish display of cordiality made
by the general manager The man fairly fell
over him in excess of wlee at bis arrival and Blink
began to believe that he had come around at @
Most opportune time. He did not know thas
insurance solicitors last only a short time, end
that new ones are always welcome hie did nos
know that because the discouragements of the
business make the solicitors fall one after the other
by the wayside, itis the policy of the general
manager to encourage the new

Blink'’s che
was conducted te

possible Consequently t began to

come out, when he a nice des

of polished oak and told that it was to be his a@
long ashe remained with the companys Blink
began to feel that he had indeed emt arked on
his business life, and he wondered why he hadn't

done it before He bevan to be disgusted with
himself because he had wasted se mueh of his me,
Ishink didn't kuew that the niece polished Gesk
Which had given rise tothis train of thought bad
had ten ocenpants during the preceding year
and that scarcely ten minutes before he took pos
session, 4 pale, (rightened looking young manta
removed the last of his effects from it Lf he
only bappened to mertthis young man, the ele
are that the experiences of the next few
might have been spared Lim
Mlink’s first duty as an insurance solicitor
was to dig oin and studs \ big pile of dex
ments was placed in front of him and he was told
thathe must feniiarize himself with them They
had to do with the various forms of insurance
dealt in by the company and at the expiration
of five hours of the toughest kind of seratehing
link mastered the details and reported to the
general manaver that he was ready for the next
step. The manager examined link and found
that he was fairly well informed
"Now go out and hustle, my hoy,”
| “Tackle & man as though sou were
life ke him feel as though life was not worth
living: before you came ino Tf he's cola, warm
him up with a joke If he continues cold throw
the terms of our twenty year endowment policy
at him so fast that he cannot answer you Above
all, keep ata oman, and don't pet discouraged
If you can only make aman who is married think
that he ts liable to fail dead atany ume, you have
got him. Keep this ino mind;” and then after
4 few stock tales about how the President of the
company and the other high-salaried officials
had started out in the business in the same way
that he was doing at that moment, the manager
bade Blink a fond farewell, and the new soliettor
wentoutin the world to poine outto men the dane
gets that menace thom daily
The first ten men that Blink tackled didn't
want insuran< Two of them declared that the
wouldn't take a one year's endowment police
for $50,000 as a gift, a couple of others laughed
at him, while the rest simply returned jey stares
to his questions and se discouraged him that
he forgot the stock arguments furnished him by
the general manager §
In the corridor of a big oMece building Blink
stood irresolute, He was trying to stick to the
e and it was a tough serap with himself He
mad about made up bis mind to quit, and go back
and ask the general manager if he bad a salaried
place to offer him, when he elanced to glance
through the open door ofanofiee It was a law
office and Blink's eve lighted on the face of aman
who was leaning over a desk writing, The mine
ute Blink saw that face, he remembered it, Three
years before, when he was at Harvard, he went
| Inte Boston on a little toot lle was going to his
hotel at 3 o'clock of a very eold morning. The
show was coming down pretty fast and already
there were huge drifts along the side of the road
Blink sull had his “bun with bim, but was not
In such poor shape but what he could see that
the man in frontof him was worse off than hime

along through the gale, and when he finally
Missed the man entirely he bad sense enough
to know that the man had fallen into one of the
snowdnfts, and findings it comfortable, had des
cided to stay there for the night Blink plunged
fhoad, and after some prospecting, located the
missing man. He dragged him forth, deenite
protests, and rabhed snow in his face until signs
of returning intelligence appeared. Then Blink
acting under instrucuons from the ways ward
one, carried him up the stepe of a nearby house,
rang the bell and banded him over to the man
in a dressing gown Who cane te the deur

islin od completely forgotten this incident
in his college career, but the sight of the man
at the desk brought it all baek to him, for the
man was no other than the one whem he had
pulled out of the snowdnft When link went
Into the office he had no idea of obtruding: him-
selfoon the man oon the seore of gratitude It
siniply struck him that here was a man who ought
to give him a fair hearing, if anybody should
end Pink was really ambitious to teil at least
one man what he knew aboutinsurance policies

The man retumed a stony glare to Blink's
introduction of himself but he didn’t tell him ta
