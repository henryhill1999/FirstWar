ee} does is to drop her intellectual im pedimenta
. es door of a social entertainment and to enter

into the spirit of the hour without thought of

‘ol. gies OF ‘sms.
rhis was the particular point made in the toast

Miss Josephine Dodge Daskam, '98,
ist published a volume of Smith stories,
was therefore particularly welll qualified
to keep to the text of her subject, “The College
Girl in Fact and Fiction.” She gave a humor
ous picture of the college girl as she is supposed
to be aud as she ts, and summed up her view of
the situation by an account of 4@ con roqnaiien
with a graduate of another woman's college.

“The disunct characteristics of our girls are
* said this graduate; “they have such
and such qualities, they differ from other women
in this and that, ow what are the special
characteristics and qualities and differences of

Smith girls?”
“i this enestian Miss Daskam shook her head.
"They have none,” she replied. “Smith girls
are just like other girls, only @ little nicer.”

These occasions of sel! congratulation ' are
allowable in all colleges and other insutuuions,
aad though Smith girls may take their own busi-
ness with a grain of allowance, they thoroughly
agreed with Miss Julia H. Caverno, one of the
Smith professors, in all the pleasant things she
had to say about the college. Her topic was
“Democracy 4t Smith College,” but in the elucida-
occasion to tell a few of her

out the college, which prob-
ly the understanding

given by
@ho has!
and who

ao and 89,

tiun of it she wok
own impressi ue at ;
bly ighteued conmsiderat !
Pie ol the older alumnae, who are necessarily
out of close touch with the college. It was ru-
mored she said, that Derweracy atthe college was
a vanishing quanuty, that the spirit of the col-
lege was changing. When she entered in the
fall of (88 she heard the same thing, she said,
and she knew on the authority of a member of
the first class that was ever graduated, that in
her sophomore year, the lament of a change in
tne college began Li

Ihe re was as little foundation, Miss Caverno
thought, for the apprehension about the increase
aud elaboration of social life As to the amount
of social lite, naturally 1,000 girks needed more
social funetions than 800, As to the charge of
more elajorateness, she thought it was only in
proportion to that outside, Entertainments were
inore elaborate, she acknowledged, than they
had been in her freshman year, but 60 hey were
in the town from which she came

Having reheved the minds of those who feared
that the college had become 4 Babylon of social
engagements, Miss Caverno turned her attention
) the status of the poor girl, which was, she felt,
the great proof that the democraue spirit, the par-
ticular characteristic of the old college, bad not
become ineffective or obsolete in the new. ‘The
poor girl is ag much 4n object of interest and pride
as ever, Miss Caverno declared. She could have
# good time between '83-'87. She could have a
good time between '93-'97 Likewise, Miss Cav
erso said, she could havea good time now,

Smith is sometimes called the rich
logs,” the speaker continued with a smile, “And
| suppose there are some rich fie there, Just
forconventence, we will take a millionaire odeney

\ta party {t would be very hard to pick her

it, atchapel quite impossible.” In earlier mes,
‘someone wanted to give a german, the college
wassosmall that{t was necessary to call {nto requl-
sition girls rch and poor, those well versed
in the ways of society, and those whose knowl-
edge of the waltz even was theoretical. Hy the
vory nature of things, the latter had to be dragooned
and steered through the german, or there cc uld
be none. Now there are enough ro to dance
dozen germans at once, but ell the poor girl
s not neglected

“Ifa “bs girl does not have a good time, {t 1s
because of the consciousness of her own poverty.
She perhaps feels sensitive and uncomfortable
becatise she has not sultable clothes to wear to 4
given entertainment; butif she doesn't mind it,
no one @lae does, From the testimony of any
number of poor girls, the concluston is established
thatitisin finitely easier to wear shabby clothes
or do the other things that poverty implies at
Smith and be happy than anywhere else in the

 

irls’ col-

World

At this all the 102 Smith people in their seats
clapped their hands heartily, for Smith democracy
is one of the dearest joys of their hearts

Prot. Tyler, the head of the Greek department,
who has been connected with the college 23 years,
conveyed to the alumna the greetings of the col-
lege in place of President Seelye, who was unable
to ba prevent. He then gave a few reminiscences
of is recent trip to Greece. The association also
had the pleasure of listening tw an animal story
by Ernest Seton’ Thompson

The Rey. Amory H. Bradford of Montclair was
the only other outside guest, and though bis sub-
foct was “Neglected Wonders,” he did not forget to
acknowledge his relationship with Smith, gained
by virtue of his two Smith daughters.

When Mrs. Grace Jane Adams, '88, President
of the association, as toastmistress had made the
Closing spee Miss Bertha Herrick '96, sang’
*The Road to Mandalay” and the Smith parody
of it’ With shis flavor of Undergraduate Smith,
graduate Smith ended itsluncheon. The alumne
went their several ways, with chatand laughter,
gene of them at least feeling that a Smith college
luncheon is the best demonstration there is that
aSnith student is neither 4 butterfly nor a blue
stocking, but a sensible normal girl, with a capa-
city for work in its time and for play it its season.

NOTES OF LEGAL EVENTS,

 

The first important decision of the Court of
Appeals construing the Factory law of this
State, in so far as it requires machinery to be
provided with safeguards, was rendered on the
Oth inst. in the case of the Glens Falls Port-
land Cement Company againat the Travelers’
Insurance Company. The statute declares
that all vate, pans, planers, cogs, gearing, belt»
ing, sbafting, set screws, and machinery of
every description in a manufacturing estab-
lishment shall be properly guarded, The ine
jury in the case mentioned was caused by a
projecting set screw on a revolving shaft
fifteen or eighteen feet above the floor,
to which a workman had ascended by
means of a ladder for the purpose of
olling the shafting. There was no protece
tlon about this machinery, and the question
was whether it was “properly guarded”
within the menning of the Factory law. The
Court of Appeals, speaking through Judge
Haight, holds that the Legislature cannot have
intended that every piece of machinery ina
large building should be covered, for that
would be impracticable. It is enough If those
portions which are dangerous to the servants
required to work near them are so guarded as
to reduce the danger to a minimum, In view
of the fact that the appliance by which the Ine
jury was inflicted was so far removed from any
place where persons were ordinarily expected
to work, the Court refused to hold as matter of
law that the employers had violated the Fao-
tory act by failing to guard it.

One of the most interesting criminal cases re-
cently considered by the Court of Appeals is
that arising out of the murder of a policeman in
this city in the autumn of 1897 by a burglar
who had just robbed the poor-box of the
Church of the Most Holy Redeemer on East
Third street and Avenue A. The police officer
was named Frederick Smith and the murderer
was named Fritz Meyer. Objection was
made to the constitution of the trial jury be-
cause, under the Special Jury law, 2,500 of the
most highly qualified jurors are withdrawn
from the general body of jurymen and were
therefore not available for service in this
case. Inasmuch, however, as al! that the Con-
stitution guarantees {s the right to be tried
by acommon law jury of twelve men, and as
the defendant was not deprived of that right
by the operation of the Special Jury law, the
objection was pronounced untenable, The
opinion was written by Judge Werner, one of
the new members of the Court of Appeals, and
contains an instructive discussion of the law
of confessions in criminal cases, While it may
be so clear that aconfession was voluntary as
to justify the trial Judge in declaring it to be of
that character, it is said to be the better rule to
permit the jury to determine that question,

 

There is a bill before Congress providing for
amuch more general distribution of the Su-
preme Court reports than is accomplished
under existing laws. Its enactment will
furnish the Federal courta with theese reports
{n many places where they are not now accea-
eiblatothe Judges. In a report on this sub-
ject on behalf of the House Jndiclary Commit-
tee by Mr. Littlefleld of Maine, the new
member who distinguished himeelf so
croatly im the debate on the Mormon
Roberts case, truly says: “The Government
in the transaction of its business is penny
wise and pound = foolish when it fails
to provide {ts officers with those books abso-
lutely easential to the proper discharge of thelr
duties, The reports of the Supreme Court of
the United States ought to be at band in every
Government building where United States
Courts are held. The Judges cannot take the
reports with them when holding court, and it
entails vast expense te suspend proceedings
and send out into the town or city for such re-
porta when required by the Judge during the
progress of a trial.” Mr. Littlefield is an ex-
perienced lawyer who would naturally appre-
ciate the evil to be remedied. He was Attore
ney-Geueral of Maine from 1889 to 1893,

Tn the case of the retiring pension of Judge
Charles L, Benedict of the United States Dis-
trict Court for the Eastern District of New
York, the Supreme Court makes a distinc.
tion between salary and compensation. At
the time of his retirement Judge Beneaict, in
common with all the other District Judges of
the United States, was in receipt of » salary of
$5,000 a year. He had also long been inthe
habit of holding six criminal terms of the
Circuit Court in this district every year, for
which the Revised Statutes allowed him
compensation at the rate of $300 a term,
thus amounting to $1,800 per annum. A
Federal Judge who resigns after ten years of
service, having attained the age of 70, is
entitled under the law, during his natural |ife,
to “receive the same salary which was by law
payable to him at the time of his resignation.”
The Supreme Court decides that Judge
Benedict Is entitled to only $5,000 ayear under
thia law, the additional $1,800 being really
extra pay for extra work, and not salary at all.

The rule that a preliminary injunction will
not be granted where greater substantial in-
jury will probably be done to the defendant
than would be suffered by the plaintiff, if he
were denied the desired order, was applied to
an amusing controversy on Wednesday by Mr,
Justice Bischoff. The litigation involved the
rights of the partiba to empioy the title “In-
dian Maidens” in reference to a certain atyle of
entertainment which the Judge saya is not a
literary work, but which he does not
more particularly describe. The platntif
claimed an absolute property in “Indian
Maidens,” while the defendant asserted an
unexpired right of dominfon over the title
under a contract with the plaintiff. ‘From the
masa of assertions, denials, vituperation and
recrimination” submitted for the enlighten.
ment of the Court upon the application for the
injunetion, and the “vigorous ‘clash of oaths,”

| Judge Bischoff reached the conclusion that it

was doubtful whether the plaintif?’ would pre-e
vail upon the trial, and he therefore refused to
grant any restraining order In the first in-
etance

 

A fine of £100, with costa amounting to £25
additional, was recently imposed by the Lord
Chiet Justice of England upun a newspaper
publisher named Howard Alexander Gray for
contempt of court. The offence consisted tn
publishing an article containing scurrilous
abuse of Mr. Justice Darling in reference to
the conduct of a case then on trial before him.
The Lord Chief Justice said that of course
judges and courts were open to criticiam, and
if reasonable arguments and expostulations
were offered against any judicial act as being
contrary to the law of the public good, no court
would treat {tas acontempt, The defendant's
publication went far beyond that, however,
and he himself acknowledged that it was im-
proper, ungentlemanly, intemperate and de-
void of respect for the judicial oflce. ‘Had it
not been for this admission,” said Lord Rus-
sell, ‘weshould have thought it necessary to
send Howard Alexander Gray to prison fora
not inconsiderable period.”

The sult against the proprietors of the Inns
of Court Hotel, to recover damages for having
been poisoned at dinner there, was recently
tried in London before Mr, Justice Grantham
and resulted in a verdict of £140 forthe plain-
tiffs, a gentieman and his wife, who were din-
ing with a guest at the hotel! on the occasion of
the alleged poisoning, The dinner proved
fatal to another guest, and the evidence

showed that his death was due to the develop-
ment of ptomaines in some of the food taken.
There waa expert testimony to the effect that
ptomalnes could be generated by lack of clean-
liness {n the preparation of food, and this fur-
nished a basis for holding that there had been
neg!igence In the defendant's kitchen,
