in place, and ailk petticoats are frankly corded
and tasaeled with gold, so there's no knowing
where the craze will stop.

This use of gold is by far the most striking
feature of the autumn fashions, and the effects
obtained are exceedingly good, but one wonders
how the gold galore and entre-deux and em-
broidery wil! stand wear and weather. On
carriage and house gowns it may Le serviceable
enough, but it is fairly safe to predict that
many of he street gowns and coats now being
fashioned will look like relics of the war of
1812 before holiday time. Where it is only
a question of renewing gold braid this defection
my not cause much trouble, but the new gowns
and coats are wonderfully and fearfully made,
animany of them will be ruined beyond repair,
if the gold in their trimmings plays them false.
It is well for the woman of moderate inceme
to bear this phase of the problem in mind
when ordering her autumn outfit, and to use
wold trimming that may easily be freshened
or replaced. Another thing to remember
ith» fact that it is the poorest economy to buy
cheap tinsel trimming. Even the best tarnishes
tadiy enough, a: d the cheap gold is practically
worthless

The new neckwear which is blossoming
out in bewildering profusion just Dow shows
janume gold. ‘lucked stocks
of white or colored silk have a narrow Iino of
gold appliqu’ or braid at the top and a cravat
o° gold ribbon, from whose ends dangle tiny
wold buls or tassels Other atoeks are of lace
outlined with gold and have silk searf
eravats, with ends appliqu’ with lace. Chiffon
and mouss abots and knots are edged
with narrow gold lice, while the accompanying
chiffon stock has a line of gold next the threat
Collars are made entirely of cloth of geld or
gold braid, with a line of velvet around the
tivoat and a narrow strap of velvet
fastening with a gold buckle. Plastrons and
collars of gold cloth ‘embroidered in Oriental
colors are shown in the shops, and are exceed-
neiv eTastive inside dark coat bedices or with
the popular white serge costumes.

Many of the new gowns have a rather severe
pouched bodice laced across a contrasting vest

The velvet Russian blouse shown in the cut
is a popular model becoming to slight faures
The entente cordiale between France and
Russia has led French designers into various
Russian by ways of fashion this season, Just as
sympathy with the army during the Dreyfus
trial, led to the rage for military gold. French
fashions are interesting commentaries upon
administrative policies and popular sentiment,
if one cares to study ther in that light, but
the average student of fashions is of the Peter
Bell persuasion and “a Russian blouse upon a
figure trim A Russian blouse is tohim, And it ts
nothing mure.” Apologies are due to Mr,
Wordsworth, but if he could see the Russian
blouse of the period he would undoubtedly
admit that his primrose was honored by aseo-
ciation with it

The particular Rusiian blouse in question is
of black velvet, lined wth white satin and the
high, straight collar, band down the left side and
wristbands are of heavy gold and gorgeous
hued embroidery on whiteaatin, while a wrought
gold girdle of rather masyive design confines
the pouching fullness. The blouse is suitable
for wear with any handsome gown and has an
air of costly simplicity combined with luxurious
comfort, that is lacking in many of the more
ornate coats

A woman who has figured largely in the

a few words of advice which might be of use
to women in all walks of life, whatever their
particular calling was. “One practical hint
that has been suggested to me by long expe-
rience,” she wrdte, “will help any woman to
develop her faculties. My advice is, be your-
self, or be original.” These words may or may
not contain aa much wisdom as they seem.

They sound rather impressive and they had
enough effect on one woman to bring out flerce
denunciation : ’

“Be original,” she said, “is advice that will
make nine women out of ten intolerable prigs.
‘They are bad enough when they are or «inal
by nature. Then they go through life patron-
izing mentally, if not actually, every other

patrons and many of the former are lamenting
that they opened their shops on the traditional

marked than any of their friends have accu-

anything else in women's athletics to spoil

for three or four summers without a hat has
damaged her skin to such an extent that the
effects will last during the rest of her life

The girl who has most reason to regret the
lingering effects of the summer sunshine ts

she who imprudently cut her bathing dreas
low in the neck for the mere pleasure of being
free in her motions while swimming She

is learning now how slowly a coat of tan may
disappear when one is most anxious to get rid
of it. The coming of the time to wear low
cut and sleeveless bodices will find the marks
of the tan on neck and arms as distinct as they
are now. One young girl who came out last
winter passed the preceding summer in the
hordenish freedom possible because the season
was the last in which she would not be a young
lady burdened with the responsibilitiés of so-
elety. She found when the time for evening
gayeties began that the tan of the past summer
would not go and contrasted most strikingly
with the white skin on the rest of her neck

Something had to ba done because high-
necked gowns were out of the question for
a young woman who was to have her first winter
in society. So a necklace of rls was very
skillfuly arranged by her jeweller to rail in
stich a way that it covered the particular line
whieh marked the ending of the former sum-
mer's bathing suit. The contrast was in this
way concealed. Women not lucky enough
to possess pearl necklaces have been compelled
to cut their dresses with an unfashionable
and unbecoming height merely because the
summer tan would remain. The same trouble
comes when the question of sleeveleas bodices
arises. Arms are as much discolored as neck s
and although there is thought to be a certain
smartness about sunburned arma in the sum-
mer time, few persons would be brave enough
to say that they were equally to be admired
in a ballroom

Women returning to town add force daily
to the theory that few women were ever im-
proved in looks by allowing themselves to get
more than a little bit sunburned = An exagger-
ated rosineas may improve their looks; any
deeper tan will be not only unbecoming in
summer, but also a continuing nuisance in the
winter months until it makes its belated dis-
appearance,

 

Queen Victoria has for the past three years
shown more interest in music than for years
before. The private operatic performances
given at Windsor by the Covent Garden artists

 

have heen one evidence of the Queen's enjoy-
ment of mu#ie and the principal musicians of
the London season have also appeared at the
castle

tailed performances given at Windsor. Now

their eyes, we're all dreadfully humdrum and
conventional. We think about our homes,
our children, dress and other contemptible
subjects which they only touch in a distant
and original way hey are too different from
the rest of womankind to think of these mat-
ters as we do. Their great, broad minds need
a wider range of observation and they have a
sort of mild pity for us

“That has usually been my experience with

the ori tna yomah or the one that tried to be
or’ ont know single particular in
which any wornan could be

improved by
advice to be original. We all Enow an
woman is like if she attempts to be original in
dress. Then she is likely to look ke a fright.
Originality in manners usually makes her al-
ternate between rudeness and gush, became
those extremes seem to her an exhibition of
perfect frankness and truthfulness of char-
acter. When she happens to get outside of
the Usual sphere ofa woman and comes at all
nto public view we again know just
nulsance she is likely to be. ; what 6

“It is only with her own sex, as a rule, that
any woman ever tries to be original. She
knows pretty well that that sort of thing never
appeals to men. They like a conven-
tonal just-like-other-girls sort of woman
and can always provide subjectively
variety and originality. However common-
jace a girl may be, the man who has taken a
ancy to her will discover points in which she is
utterly different from the rest of her sex. That
all comes from the man himself. It satisfies
him, too. He'drather discover marked char-
acteristics in the girl he loves than have t
really in her and apparent to the rest of the
world. So the woman who is original with her
own sex is perfectly satisfied to merely or-
dinary and as attractive as possible to men.

“The other alternative in this general advice
to women seems to me almost as dangerous
although it is likely to make a woman leas of
an amiable fraud. Women who have made up
their minds to be themselves are by no means
a novelty, and | haven't the least doubt that
many of them attain a high ethical and spiritual
plane by aiming at the best development of
their own characters and never pretending
to be what they are not. But most of those
I have known usually impeene every person
who meets them with the idea that nobody in
the world would ever want tohelike them. Aside
from the self-satisfied moral attitude that they
acquire after a short while, there are the awk-
ward results of this uncompromisin,
to truth and their own natures hey are of
course prevented from showing kindness and
sympathy, exeept in the cases where they
really feel it and none of them is Pitted to
say pleasant and agreeable things Tat are not
founded on truth On the other hand, re-
marks that are likely fo make a disagreeable
impression are not to be suppressed for that
reason. It would not be true to one’s character
to hesitate to say all the unpleasant things one
believed. It would be very much like being
somehody else instead of oneself. Altogether,
I don’t think that advice to be original or be
oneself would make a woman especially popular
if she followed it, however great the develop-
ment of her character might he. Most of t
women I have known who prided themselves
on being oricinal must have enfoyed an oppor-
tunity sometimes to be merely theenaelee in
the quiet of their own rooms and take a rest from
the strain of trying to be original. And I'll
wager that the women who were working so
hard all the time to be themselves would have
enlioyed an occasional chance to be more like
the rest of their sex.”

HEARD IN BROOKLYN, {

 

The Montauk Club of Brooklyn, located near
the entrance to Prospect Park, has enjoyed
the vogue of being the most popular summer
club in town during the season past, owing no

| doubt to its ideal situation on Prospect Helght»,

as well as to the attractive methods of its ver
eral management and its chef, Davenel, said
to be one of the best in this part of the countr:
The kitchens of the Montauk are on its rou!
floor in accordance with modern arehitectural
plans and its dining rooms are especially |
vored by the presence of womenat the break-
fast, luncheons and other feasts at which theo

feminine presence is not only admitted |
eagerly sought for. The women ests
the Montauk Club have become enthusiastic

over the various dishes to be had at the cluty
and have sought for information as to” their
preparation. While this may be with a view
to proving to their own satisfaction that ib
cooking can be successfully emulated at home,
one of therm, more ambitious than the rest. re-
cently obtained some of Chef Davenel's own
recipes for some of the most popular dishes
served at the Montauk tables.

First is a potage Vanderbilt, sufficiozn ror
twelve plates, requiring a calf's head and Jaw»
two ponies of Amontillada, one pint of cream,
six ewes (yolks) and boiled rice. Clean the
head and Jawa thoroughly: wash them in cold
water, then put in saucepan with six quarts
of water and a bouquet of bay leaves, also two
leeks, parsley, celery tied in bunches, one
carrot, two ontons and one tairnip. Let braise
for three hours’ then remove the jaws and the
calf's head. Strain the broth through a cloth,
Then put six ounces butter in a saucepan with
four tablespoons of flour. Stir it with the
broth and let heat for ten minutes, Cut the
lean parts of the head and jawain small squares
and add with one half pint boiled rice the
sherry to the broth. Thicken with the creana
and eas yolk and serve.

Pickerel in Montauk style is prepared in
this way. Select five pounds of pickere!l; take
the heads, tails and skin off and place them ina
saucepan with some salt and pepper and two
quarts of water, Let heat slowly for anhour
Then lard the pickerel, same as tendertoin,
season well and wrap in white paper buttered
on both sides. Put two ounces of butter with
the fish and cook for half an hour in a slack
oven. Pound in a mortar a little watercress,

tarragon, chevril, parsley, two anchovies, one
clove of warlic, two shallots and four ounces
of butter. When in a paste pass through a
fine sieve; then put two ounces of butter in the
saucepan with two tablespoonfuls of flour ang
atir with the fish broth, Add half a pinto
white wine, half a pint of cream and the paste;
allow to cook slowly ten minutes, take the
paper off pour the sauce overand serve.
aind chops Menagére are excellent. Select
twelve lean chops well trimmed. Then put in
a saucepan four ounces bacon, one half calves
brain, six chickens’ livers, a little tarragon, a
little parsley, two shallote. Chop them all
together fine; season with salt, pepper and
nutmeg. Then cut twelve sheets of prepared
paper in double heart shape, butter on both
sides and put a little of the paste on each chop
and under as well. Fold the paper around

each chop and twist in shape: lay them
in abaking pan, cookfor ten minutes and
serve

Peaches Cardinal are peeled freestone peaches
split and arranged on a dish with one porti)4
of vanilla ice cream and one tablespoonful
raspberry syrup over. The raspberry syrup
is made with one pint raspberry juice, four
ounces powdered sugar, one gill Maraschino,
Put onthe fire on a saucepan, when nearly
boiling add tablespogntul, arrowroot, dissolved
in a little water. When it is very cold it will
look like Jelly and can be added to the peaches
and ice cream

Montauk sandwiches generally served at
supper are a novelty and are made in this farh-
jon. Pound one pound double cream Ameri-
can cheese and mix with it three whole eases,
a few drops of tabasco sauce and cover @lx
lamb chops pla on toast. Cook for ten
minutes in a brisk oven and serve with a slice
of braised bacon on each and a lace paper
doily under

The Brooklyn clubs have always been far
more hospitable to women guests than those
of New York. While there are ladies’ “days,”
so called, at all the large metropolitan clubs,
these days are rather the signal for a general
departing of the masculine element, and the
clubhouse is turned over to the feminine in-
vaders. At some of the clubs, notably the
yachting clubs, even severer methods are re-
sorted to and certain spaces are lined off from
the intrusion of a woman's foot, and here the
grizzled bachelors betake themselves to read
and smoke until the day is at an end. Brook-
lyn’s clubs have always made a feature of en-
tertainments for their feminine friends. Their
bowling alleys have been turned over to fair
athletes mornings, while on certain days en-
tertainments are provided with luncheons and
musical programmes to encourage the presence
of the fair guests,

This idea has rather prejudiced the Brook-
lyn matron and maid in favor of club life. One
hears little over the tea tables except in antici-
pation of the winter's round of pieture views
and receptions to be given during the season.
As for the Brooklyn girls, they look upon an in-
vitation to one athletic club with a country
house at Bay Ridge as something to be greeted
with rejoicing he Crescent Club also has 4
house in town, but the entertainment there !s
more formal, while at their beautiful countrr
place the scene on summer afternoons is bright
with the color of FY. gowns and the sound of
feminine voices tisthe proper thing to drive
down to thia apot and dinners and luncheons
are served on the piazzas overlook! the bay.
Yachts and launches are anchored off the pler
and far into the evening the music of banjos and

mandolins sound in unison with happy volces.'

 

‘Brooklyn can boast two notable women's
clubs, one the Civitas, formed by the society
girls of the Heights for the discussion of political
matters, and the Health Protective League, an
uptown organization of women whose avowed
object was the healthful management of the
city, the proper cleaning of the streets, the ven-
tilation of the schools and other matters relating
to the hygiene of the people. These clube did
more actual work and gained more lasting fame
than any of the various women's clubs of New
York. The famous Seidl Club was also an out-
growth of Brooklyn, numbering thousands of
the city’s residents who used to fairly swarm
over the old Academy of Music at the concerta
that were given there under the direction of
Mrs. Laura Langford, the President of the As-
sociation. The Brooklyn Women's Club hes
been called the “Sorosis” of that city and has
many feminine celebrities in literature among
{ts members

 

The jokes that are ao popular with the New
York flat dweller at the expense of the Brooklyn
resident are really not so funny as they seem
to be. For the man whose business interests
ato located in New York the journey each dar
acros® Bridge or ferries has its unpleasant
tediousness, but with this exception the Brooke
lynite is by far the gainer in the matter of econ-
omy in living expenses and ina certain position

ment on this side of the Bridge. Very hand-
some latge-roomed apartments ate possible
in the cholcest resident parts of the borough
at rentals that would only provide restricted
quarters oyer a shop in New York. But apart-
ments will newer he jeatured in Brooklyn 4@
they are in this borougn, for the reason, perhapa
that the average Brooklynite’s ideas of corm-
fort seem to include a home and a family 1
well, while the metropolitan flat dweller never
cuite reaches this crude level. Over the Brider,
therefore, far out in the new portions, pretty
houses co up in rows8 that breathe respec -
ability in their every line. These houses are
marvels of modern improvement ir nar
of interior fittings ant are let at renis heles
that paid for the usual cheap flat of New York
where families are sandwiched in for years
wih other humans of whom the y know nothing

the

and for whom they never feel one thrill of old
fashioned nelghborliness. Yet the average
New York man and woman, especially the

woman, hug the idea of their town existence
and continue to smile serenely at Brooklyn
