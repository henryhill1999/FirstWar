to-day. We must make her sing it all through
forus. I wish I could understand the words

And he beat time with his cane aa a tall Cretan
strode by, humming very distinctly;

We can tell you by the lightening
Of your terrible swift brand.

And we know you by the brightening
When your proud eyes sweep the land!

“Panayota will be singing that at this very
taoment, eh?” cried Lindbohm, laying his hand
bs oe Curtis's shoulder; but the latter nade no
reply

Jcecasionally two-wheeled mule carta, laden
With supplies, stormed by over the cobblestones
From the narrow street they passed into a
place of smouldering ruins, and rootless, ragged
walls. Here a party of marines were at work,
assisted by townspeople, throwing water on
fires that wore still burning or in diaging bodies
out of the débris. A cart stood near, and an
awestruck, silent throng lingered by, ready
to identify the remains of possible relatives
or friends The air was full of powdered lime
and smoke, and had a queer, pungent smell

“Come on,” said Lindbohm, “before they
find a body. I don't like to see such things,
and don't let this affect you, my friend) Pana-
yota, vou know, is in the Turkish quarter

Lindbohm urged this cheering assurance
with the insistent frequency of a man who is
trying to water his own hopes

They came into the public square, where
the shells from the Hazard had fallen thick-
est, for here the Bashi Bazouks had fired on
the British soldiers, and yonder, rising pre-
Cipitously to a hei ht of thirty feet, was the
fortified stronghold from’ which the Turkish
guard had poured a rain of bullets upon the
town, Enatish sentries were now pacing to
and fro up there. But the chief attraction
Was a sort of booth in the centre of the square,
for all the world like a Punch and Judy booth,
and in it were hanging by the neck seven flx-
tires with black caps over their heads, with
their hands bound behind them and their feet
tied together

“By George, they've been hanging the ring-
leaders, hanging them higher than Haman!"
cried Lindbohm

Curtia could not realize that those were the
bodies of human beings, there was something
so theatrical about their appearance, they hung
so neatly in a row, and the heads all lolled
one way, like heads of Brownies in an adver-
tisemernt.

“Maybe they have hanged them in effigy,”
he sugested

Tindbohm laughed

Might as well be now,” he replied. .“But
letus ask the guard where we will find the com-
mandant, Then we shall learn something
about Kostakes and Panayolu.”

You go,” said Curtis; “Ul wait for you here,”
He shrank from the ingenuous oneneson
that Panayota was his betrothed, The very
thought made him shudder

Tean't tell him,” he niuttered, as he watched
Lindbohm forcing his way through the throng

breast pocket of the Prince Albert. Here is

One of the marines took the proffered paste-

the Swede sadly But a soldier who disgraces

CAS Is it not so?

Curtis could not take his eves from the hooded
form: before him, nor move from the spot where
he stood As long as he stared at the heal
cavered with its black cloth, he was impressed |
with a sense of unrealityv; so might a row of
wat inquisitors be shown in the Eden Musée
at New York And that pitful, limp tilting of
the head was not at all suegestive of Kostakes,
who wae ever wont to hold his neck stiff and
stand upright with a certain jaunty insolence
But when Curtis's @ves travelled downward,
the unreality vanished The lone row. of
buttons, the dark blue trousers tucked into
the tops of the highly polished boots, the spurs,
the backward bulging of the thick calf of the
leg -all these things brought back to him a
flood of reminiscences He remembered the
fight at Ambellaki, and the long ride across
country He could see those very legs clasp-
ing the side of a horse, and he wondered once
more how their owner managed to keep the
boots spotless Then he saw Panayota
again, the most splendid creature he had ever
seen, denouncing the Turk for the murder of
her tather. and he felt once more the old thrill!
of admiration and chivalrous purpose Ah!
She had touched the Turk, she had made hin
winee, brave girl. despite those insolent eves,
and that sqviare, protruding under jaw Any
one could see that by the wav in which he
stopped twirling the end of the little black
mustache and was nervously nibbling it The
long chase after Kostakes, with those tur-
bulent Cretans, the night tn the square when
Curtis had fired point blank at him and missed
him all these things passed through his mind
like seenes on a moving panorama as he gaped
at those dark blue breeches and the well-pol-
ished boots with their long spurs: but when he
raised his eves again to the black-hooded head,
tipped to one side like a man with a stiff neek,
the whole incident seemed ended, this life
in Crete became a fantastic dream and took
on the wunreality of those faceless puppets,
hanging all in a row, gently oscillating in the
breeze like pendulumes

any longer

They had passed the crowd and were alone
now |' The Swede stopped and looked steadily
at his companion. Curtis glanced up furtively,
There was nothing but inquiry in those brave,
honest, blue eyes

I say, Old man,” he stammered “don't you
think we ought to go and get some hats and
things hefore we go to the commandant’? [|

CHAPTER XI

The Lieutenant found no difficulty in buying
another straw hat, as the booths of the town
were all open again; and another shoestring
was easily obtainable, by which he tethered it
to his buttonhole

An enterprising Jew produced a stock of
ready-made clothing from Vienna, and Curtis
endeavored to persuade Lindbohm to join him
in the purchase of a complete new outfit

The first thing is to find Panayota.” said
the Swede ‘We must not waste a moment
Ah, my friend, you mistake that girl’ She will
be so glad to see you that she will not look at
your clothes ”

Clapping another straw hat upon the head
of Curtis he dragged him away. They found
the commandant's quarters with little diffi-
culty, as every man, woman and child in Canea
was able to direct them. It was an Oriental
house with a garden [wo sentinels stood at
the gate. Lindbohim sent in his card, and a
youthful officer in fatigue uniform came out,
who started with evident surprise, and then
gazed curiously at the two callers

Lindbohm brought the heels of the yellow
boots together with a click and saluted

“Pardon our appearance,” he explained,
“but the fact of the matter is we have been
fighting with the insurgents for the last three
months and we have not yet had an opportunity
to purchase clothing.”

The Englishman laughed and held out his
hand cordially

“Come in,

looking sort of dazed. [ was out with a squad
and came acros4 them myself. Well, to makea
long story short, we're assisting all the Turks
toemigrate from here that feel so disposed, and
we sent off the three women this morning.”
“My God—where to?" asked Lindbohm,
“Why, the Greek, it seems, had some friends
in Athens, She has had enough of Mohammed-
onism and wanted to be put off there. So we
gave her a pass to Athens, The other two go
on to Constantinople.”
“When does the next boat go to Athena?”
asked Curtis, looking up suddenly.
“There's an Austrian Lloyd to-morrow morn-
ing at 10 which stops at Athens,”
“For 4
The Fngltishman accompanied his two callers
tothe gate
“I'd like to hear the story of vour adventures
with the insurgents,” he sald ‘You must have
had some lively experiences, Good day, gentle-
men
By the way,” eried Lindbohm, turning back,
lost there be any mistake, was this Greek giri
very beautiful?”
‘Ye-es, yes, I should call her a very fine wo-
man
What was the color of her hair? Brown?"
‘IT don'tremember exactly I believe it was,”
“Tall, slender, oval face, big, fine eyes?”
“Well, you see, [only saw her for a moment.
She certainly was tall and slender, and—and
a fine, handsome woman, Held her head back
and threw her chest out, and had a sort of inde-
pendent air abouther,”
Lindbohm had no further doubts
Preparations for departure on the morrow
were begun at once, Curtis had no difficulty
in raising some money at Cook's on his letter
of credit His passport and two or three letters
from home were sufficient identification
“How are you off for money, old man’” he
asked Lindbohm. ‘The Lieutenant drew from
the recesses of the ancient, water-warped
vwvketbook a £5 note, badly faded and stained
t came in two at one of the creases as he held

it up

t will puste this together,” he said, “and
it will be just as good as ever, IT have plenty
more in Athens

All right then,” replied Curtis, “I'll get tho
tickets."
But I have plenty"

“We must buy some ri
tickets.’

Luwidbohm assented so far as the tickets
were concerned, but he positively refused to
buy clothing till he got to: Athens He took a
stroll about the town to see what military
preparations were going on, while Curtis
urrayed hunself in acheap and ill-fitting suit
anew pair of tan shoes, for all of which he paid
ahigh price He also bought a leather travel-
ling bag, into which he put a supply of unde
Wear and other necessities The Cretan boots
and the cimeter he tied to the handle of the
bag as souvenifs

So the next morning Curtis and Lindbohm
walked briskly through the kaleidoscopic
square to the wharf and embarked in a row-
boat for the steamer waiting out in the bay

Chere will be no diffleulty in finding her in
Athens,” said Eindbohin as the two stood at
last on the deck of the steamer

had done so, andit had broken out on her after-

disease myself”

The Iieitenant was very pale. When he
apoke his voice was low and unnaturally dis-
tinet, and he divided his sentence into groups
of two and three words, like a man who is mak-
ing a Superhuman effort to control himself

‘And what about this Young woman
who went to Athens?

Oh, she’s somebody else. I couldn't. be
mistaken in Panayota- IT tell you I saw her,
man. Why, I was as close to her as from here
to that mast yonder

But perhaps there's some mistake in the

reason for her being there Perhaps. —’

Why didn't she come out, then, when she
saw me? She clapped her hands in front of
her face and shrunk away. My first impulse
was to go in, and then it fas ed over me it a
minute Besides, you heard what Hassan Bey
said, that the lepers are nearly all Cretans

Do vou mean to say you re just going away
without going back to comfort her or say a
word to her?

“But since she showed plainly that she wanted
to avoid me? I tell you, old man, l'm doing
the kindest thing for both of us It’s incura-
ble. you know, and even if it wasn't: my mother
and my eovernor would never consent T
should have hada circus with them, anyway"

Lindbohm walked to the taffrail and looked
dreamily toward Canea. There was an
pected roar of a great w histle -a boat's whistle
is alWays unexpected and the anchor chain
bewan to rattle and click

It takes a long time to get the anchor up,
don't it?" asked Curtis

Lindbohm made uo reply. but When the
chain finally ceased to rattle, he asked in alow
fone, ind without looking at his companion

sc vou give her up. eh?

Whr. of course, old man
I've made that plain enough"

The ringing of a bell seemed to awaken the
sleeping ship. She shuddered as the machin-
ery started) There was a patter of hastening
feet on the deck and a g@reat churning, as the
wheel made {ts first revolutions in the water
Shore boats were cast off, with much shont-
ing and gesticulating of picturesque Cretans,
standing erect in their tiny craft, violently
rocked by the agitated sea. As the ship moved
majestically away, a few boats clung to her
side like whiffets to a stately stag. One by
one they dropped of and drifted astern
bohm turned and looked about the deck. Spy-
ing his satchel, he niecked it up and walked to
the ladder, at the foot of which one boat was
still tied. Curtis ran to him and seized him
by the shoulder

“Where are you going, old man?”

“To Panayota.” ‘

But this is madness. You can't do any-
thing [tell you the girl is a leper.”

The Swede, muttering “Ull vust take
chances,” continued down the steps and
his seat in the boat

Curtis stood watching him as he was rowed
away, honing against hope that he would turn
around and wave his hand or make some sign
But no. he sat up very straight, his arnos hane-
inw a little out from his body, the back of his
neck looking very broad and red. The straw
hat leaped from his head. He caught it in

THE AMADAN OF THE DOUGH.

Copyright, 1900, by Seumas MacManus,

There was aking once onatime that had ason
that was an Amadan (half-foolish fellow)
The Amadan's mother died, and the king mar-

ried again.

His stepmother, was always afraid of his
beating ber childfen, he was growing so big
and strong, 80 to keep him from growing, and
weaken him, she had him fed on dough made
of raw meal and water, and for that he was
called the Amadan of the Dough

But instead of getting weaker it was get
ting stronger the Amadan was on this fare,
and he was able to thrash all of his stepbroth-
ers together

At length his stepmother told his father
that he would have todrive the Amadan away

The father consenied to put him away, but
the Amadan refused to go till his father would
give him a sword so sharp that it would cut
a pack of wool, falling on tt

After a great deal of tirne and trouble spent
in getting such a sword the father got this and
gave it to the Amadan, and when the Amadan
tried it and found it what he wanted he
them all good-by and set off

For seven days and seven nights he travelled
away before him without meeting anything
wonderful, but on the seventh night he came
up to a great castle; he went in and found no
one there, but he found a great dinner spread
on the table in the hall. So to be making the
most of his time, down the Amadansat (to the
table and whacked awa)

When he had finished with his dinner up
to the castle came three young princes, stout,
strong, able fellows, but they were very, very
tired, and bleeding trom wounds all over them

They struck the castle with a flint, and all
at once the whole castle shone as if on fire

The Amadan sprang at the three of them to
kill them. He said: “What do you mean by
putting the castle on fires”

“Oh, Amadan,” they said, “don't interfere
with us, for we are nearly killed as itis. The
castle isn't on fire. Every day we have to go
out to fight three giantsSlat Mor, Slat Marr
and Slat Beag We fight them all day long,
and just as night is falling we have them killed
But bowever it comes, inthe night they always
come to life again, and if they didn't see this
castle lit up, they'd come in on top of us and
murder us while we slept. So every night
when we come back from the fight we light up
the castle Then we can sleep in peace until
morning, and in the morning go off and fight the
giants again’

When the Amadan heard this, he wondered,
and he said he should very much like to help
them kill the giants. They said they would

be very glad to have such a fine fellow's help
and so it was agreed that the Amadan should
wo with them to the fight next day

Then the three princes washed themselves
and took their supper, and they and the Amadan
went to bed

in the morning all four of them set off and
travelled to the Glen of the Echoes, where the
met the three giants

“Now, says the Amadan, “if you three will
engage the two smaller giants, Slat Marr and
pias Beag, I'll engage Slat Mor myself and hill
iin

‘They agreed to this

Now, the smallest of the giants was far big-
ger and more terrible than anything ever the
Amadan had seen or heard of in his life before,
so you may fancy what Slat Mor must have
been like

But the Amadan was little concerned at this
He went to meet Slat Mor, and the two of them
a the fight, and a great, great fight they
yar

They made the hard ground imo soft,and
the soft into spring wells: they made the rocks
into pebbles, and the pebbles into gravel. and
the gravel fell over the country like hailstones
All the birds of the air from the lower end of
the world, and the upper end of the
world from tle four ends of the earth, came
flocking and all the wild beasts and tame
to see the fight, and in the end the Amadan ran
the Slat Mor through with his sword and laid
him down dead

Then he turned to help the three princes, and
very soon he laid the other two giants down
dead for them also

Then the three princes said they would all go
home. The Amadan said for them to go, but
warned them not to light up the castle this
night, and he would sit by the giant's corpses
and watch if they would come to life again

The three princes hegged of him not te do
this, for the three giants would come to life, and
then he, having no help, would be killed

The Amacan was angry with them and or-
dered them off instantly. Then he sat down by
the giant's corpses to watch their coming to
life again. But he was so tired from his great
day's fighting that by and by he fell asleep

About 12 oclock at night, when the Amadan
was sleeping soundly, up comes a Cailliach
fold hag! and four Badachs (unwieldy big fel-
lows}, and the Cailliach carried with her a
feather and a bottle of locshlainte [ointment
of health), with which she began to rub the
giants’ wounds

Two of the giants were already alive when
the Amadan awoke and the third was just open-
ing his eyes. Up sprang the Amadan. and at
him leaped them all Slat Mor, Slat Marr, Slat
Beag, the Cailliach and the four Bedachs

{f the Amadan had a hard fight during the
day this one was surely ten times harder And
a brave and a bold fellow he was, and not to be
daunted by numbers or showers of blows. They
fought forlong and long. They mace the hard
ground into soft, and the soft into spring wells
they made the rocks into pebbles and the peh-
bles into gravel, and the gravel fell over the
like hailstones All the bires of the
air from the lower end of the world to the
upper end of the world, and all of the
wild beasts and tame from the four corners
of the earth came flocking to see the fight, and
one after the other of them the Amacan ran his
sword through until he had every one of them
stretched on the ground, ving or dead,

And when the old Cailliach was dying she
called the Amacan to her and put him under
geasa [obligation that he could not shirk) to
lose the power of his feet, of his strength, of his
sight and of his memory if he did not go to
meet and fight the Black Bull of the Brown
Wood

When the old hag died outright the Amadan
rubbed sone of the iocshlainte on his wounds
with the feather, and at once he was as hale
and as fresh as when the fight hagan. Then
he buckled on his sword and started away
before him to fulfil his geasa F

He travelled for the length of all that lee-lone
day, and when night was falling he came to a
little hut on the edge of a wood, and the hut
had no shelter inside or out, but one feather
over if, and there was a rovgh, red woman
standing in the door

“You're welcomed,” savs she. “Amadan of
the Dough, the King of Treland's son. What
have you been doing or where are you going?”

‘Last night,” says the Amadan, “I fought
A great flight and killed Slat Mor, Slat Marr,
Slat Reay, the Cailliach of the Rocks, and four
Badachs, Now I'm under geasa to meet and
te fight the Black Bull of the Brown Wood.
Can you tell me where to find him?”

“I can that,” says she, “but it's now night
Come in and eat and sleep.”

So she spread for the Kroadan a fine supper
and made a soft bed, and he ate heartily and
slept heartily that nicht

In the morning she called him early and she
directed him on his way to meet the Black Bull
of the Brown Wood. “But, my poor Amadan,'
she said, “ no one has ever yet met that Bull
and come back alive.”

She told him when he would reach the place
of meeting the Bull would come tearing down
the hill like a hurricane. “Here's a cloak,”
says she, “to throw upon the rock that is stand-
fine there, You hide yourself behind the rock
and when the Bull comes tearing down he wil
dash at the cloak and blind himself with the
dash against the rock. Then you jump on
the Bull's back and fight for life. If, after the
fl@ht, you are living, come back and see me
and if you are dead lwo and see you.”

The Amadan took the cloak, thanked her
and set off, and travelled on and on till he came
to the place of meeting

When the Amadan came there, he saw the
Bull of the Brown Wood come tearing down
the hill like a hurricane, and he threw the cloak
on the reck and hid behind it, and with the
fury of his dash against the cloak, the Bull
blinded hinself, and the roar of his fury split
the rock

The Amadar lost no time jumping on his back
and with his sword began hacking and slashing
him, but he was no easy Bull to conquer, and a
great fight the Amadan had

They made the hard ground into soft and the
soft into spring wells. they made the rocks into
pebbles and the pebbles into gravel, and the
wravel fell over the country like hailstones. All
the birds of the air from the lower end of the
world to the upper end of the world, and all the
wild beasts and tame from the four ends of the
earth came flocking to see the fight and at
length after a lone time the Amadan run his
sword right through the Bull s heart and the
Bull fell down dead. But before he died he put
the Amadan under geasa to meet and to fight
the White Wether of the Hillof the Waterfalls.

Then the Amadan rubbed his own wounds
with the foeshlainte and he was as fresh and
hale as when he went intothe fight

Then he set out and travelled back to the lit-
tle hut again that had no shelter without or
within, only one feather over it, and the rough
red woman was standing in the door, and she
welcomed the Amadan and asked him the news

He told her all about the fight and that the
Black Bull of the Wood had put him under geasa
to meet and to fight the White Wether of the
Hill of the Waterfalls

“Imesorry for you,my poor Amadan,” says she,
“for noone ever before met that White Wether
and came back alive. But come tn and eat and

bade |

| dan to
| Seven Glens

| getting

 

rest anyhow, for you must be both hungry and
sleepy.”

So she spread him a hearty meal and made
him a soft bed, and the Amadan ate and slept
heartily, and in the morning she directed him

| to where he would meet the White Wether of the

Hill of the Waterfalls, And she told him that

no steel was tougher than the hide of the W hite |

Wether, that a sword was never yet made that

| could go through it, and that there was only

a little white spot just over the
where he could be killed or
through. And she told the
chance was to hit this

one place
Wether's heart
sword could cut
Amadan that his only
spot

The Amadan thanked her and set out. He
travelled away and away before him until he
came to the Hill of the Waterfalls, and as soon
as hereachedit hesaw the White Wether coming
tearing toward him in a furious rage, and the
earth he was throwing up with his horns was
shutting out the aun

And when Wether came up and asked the
\inadan what great feats he had done that made
him impudent enough to dare to come here the
Amadan said: “With this sword I have killed
Slat Mor, Slat Marr, Slat Beag, the Cailliach of
the Rocks and her four Badachs, and likewise
the Black Bull of the Brown Wood '

Then,” said the White Wether, “you'll never
killany other.” And atthe Amadan he sprang

The Amadan struck at him with his sword,
aud the sword glanced off as it might off steel
Both of them fell tothe flaht with all their hearts,
and such a flight never was before or since They
made the hard ground into soft, and the soft
into spring walls they made the rocks into
pebbles, and the pebbles into wravel, and the
gravel fell over the country like hailstones
All the birds of the air trom the lower end of the
world to the upper end of the world, and all the
Wild beusts and the tame came from the four
ends of the earth, came flocking to see the flight
butatlength andat last, after along and terrible
flight, the Amadan, seeing the little spot above
the Wether's heart that the red woman had told
him of, struck for it-and hit it, and drove his
sword through the White Wether's heart, and
the Wether felldown. And when he was dying
he called the Armuadan and put bin under a
geasa to meet and fight the Beggarman of the
King of Sweden

The Amadan took out his bottle of joeshlainte
and rubbed himself with it, and he was us fresh
and as hale as when he had begun the fleht

Then he set out again, and when night was
falling he reached the hut that had no shelter,
within or without, only one feather over it, and
the rough, red woman was stunding in the door

Right glad she was to see (he Amadan coming
back alive, and she welcomed him heartily and
asked him the news

He told her of the wonderful flight le had had,
and that he was now under geasa to meet and
flab! the Besgariman of the King of Sweden

She made win come in and eat and sleep,
for he was tired and hungry And heartily
the Amadan ate and heartily he slept, and
in the morning she called him early, and directed
him on his way to meet the Begwarman of the
King of Sweden

She told him that when he would reach a
certain hill, the Beggarman would come down
from the sky in a cloud’ that he would see the
whole world between the Beexgarnan’s legs
and nothing above his head If ever he finds
himeelf beaten,” she said, “he goes up into the
sky ip amist and stays there to refresh himself
You me@y let him go up once, but if vou let him
xo up the second time he will surely kill you
when he comes down ternember that. ff
you are alive when the tight is over come to see
me. Ifyou aredead | will gotosee vou,’

The Amadan thanked her, parted with her,
and travelled away and away before him until
he reached the hill which she had told him of
{ud when he came there he saw a great cloud
that shot out of the sky, descending on the
hill, and when it came down on the hill and
melted away, toere it left the Beggarman of
the King of Sweden standing, and between
his legs the Amadan saw the whole world and
nothing over his head

And with a roar and a run the Beggarman
made for the Amadan, and the roar of him
rattled the staré in the sky

He asked the Amadan who he was and what
he had done to have the imoudence to come
there and meet him

He said They call me the Amadan of the
Dough, and T have ki led Slat Mor, Slat Marr,
Slat Beag, the Cailliach of the Roeks, and her
four Badachs, the Black Bull of the Brown Wood,
and the White Wether of the Hill of the Water-
fais, and before night Ul have killed the Beg-
garnan of the King of Sweden

That vou never will, you miserable object
says the Beggarman. “You're going to die
now, and I'll give you your choice to die either
by a hard squeeze of wrestling or a stroke of
the sword

*Well,” says the Amadan, “if I have to die,
I'd sooner die by a stroke of the «word

All right,” says the Beggarman, and drew
his sword

But the Amadan drew his sword at the same
time, and both went to it And if his fights
before had been hard. this one was harder
and greater and more terrible than the others
put together They made the hard ground
Into soft, and the soft into spring wells they
made the rocks into pebbles, and the pebbles
into gravel, and the gravel fell over the country
like hailstones All the hirds of the air from
the lower end of the world to the upper end
of the world, and all the wild beasts and tame
from the four ends of the earth, came flocking
flaht, and at length the fight was
putting so hard upon the Beggarman, and he
was getting so weak, that he whistled, and the
mist came around bia and he went up into the
sky before the Amadan knew He remained
there until he refreshed himself and then came
down again, and at it again he went for the
Ninadan, and tought harder and harder than
before, and again it was putting too hard on
him, and he whistled as before for the mist to
come down and take himup

But the Amadan remembered what the red
woman had warned him: he gave one leap
into the air, and coming down, drove his sword
through the Beggarman’s heart, and the Beg

to see the

| garman fell dead

But before he died, he put geasa onthe Ama
meet and fight the Silver Cat
The Amadan rubbed his wounds with
inchshlainte, and was fresh and
as when he had begun the feht, and then he
setoont, and when night was falling he reached
the hut that had no shelter within or without
only one feather over it, and the rough red
woman was standing in the door

Right glad she was to see the Amadan coming
back alive, and she welcomed him right heart-
ily and asked him the news

He told her that he had killed the Beggar-
man, and said he was now under ygeasa to meet
and fight the Silver Cat of the Seven ¢

“Weill,” sie said, “I'm sorry for vou, for no
one ever before went to meet the Silver Cat and
came back alive But" she says, “you're both
tired and hungry; come in and rest and sleep

So in the Amadan went and had a hearts
supper and a soft bed, and in the morning she
called him up early, and she gave him diree-
tions where to meet the Cat, and how to find
her, and she told him there was only one vital
spot on that Cat, and it was a black speck on
the bottom of the Cat's stomach, and unless
he could happen to run his sword right through
that, the Cat would surely kill him. She said

My poor Armadan, I'm very much afraid you'll
not come back alive. L cannot go to help you
myself or T would, but there is a well {n my
garden, and by watching that well J will know
how the fight goes with vou. While there is
honey on oe of the well I will know you are

the better of the Cat, but if the blood
comes on top, then the Cat is getting the better
of you, and if the blood stays there I will know,
my poor Amadan, that you are dead,"

The Amadan bade her good-by, and set out
to travel to where the Seven Glens met at the
sea. Here there was a precipice, and under
the precipice a cave. In this cave the Silver
Cat livec and once a day she came out to
sun herself on the rocks

The Ainandan let himself down over the
precipice ly a rope, a'd he waited until the
Cat came out to sun herself

When the Cat came out at 12 o'clock and
saw the Amadan she let a roar out of her that
drove back the waters of the sea and piled
them up a quarter of a mile high, and she asked
him who he was and how he had the impudence
to come there to meet her

The Amadan said They call me the Ama-
dan of the Dough, and T have killed Slat Mor,
Slat Marr, Slat Beag, the Cailliach of the Rocks
and her four Badachs, the Black Bull of the
Brown Wood, the White Wether of the Hill
of the Waterfalls, the Beagarman of the King
of Sweden, and before night T will have killed
the Silver Cat of the Seven Glens.”

“That you never will,” says she, “for a dead
man you will be yourself.” And at him she
sprang

But the Amadan raised his sword and struck
at her, and both of them fell to the fight, and
a great, great fight they had They made the
hard ground into soft, and the soft into spring
wells; they made the rocks into pebbles, and
the pebbles into gravel, and the gravel fell
over the country like hailstones All the birds
of the air from the lower end of the world to
the upper end of the world, and all the wild
heasts and tame from the four ends of the
earth came flocking to see the flaht, and if the
flahts that the Amadan had had on the other
days were great and terrible, this one was far
greater and far more terrible than all the others

ut together, and the poor Amadan sorely
eared that before night fell he would he a
dead man

The red woman was watching at the well in
her garden, and she was sorely distressed,
for though at one time the honey was upper-
most, at another time it was all blood, and
again, the blood and the honey would be mixed
so she felt: bad for the poor Amadan

At lenath the blood and the honey got mixed
again, and it remained that way until night
so she cried for ahe believed the Amadan him-
self was dead as well as the Silver Cat

Andso he was For when the fight had
on for long and lone, the Cat, with a creat lonw
nail which she had in the end of her tail, tore
him open from his mouth to his toes, and as
she tore the Amadan open and he was about
to fall, she opened her mouth so wide that the
Amadan saw down to the very bottom of her
stomach, and there he saw the black speck
that the red woran had told him of And just
before he dropped, he drove his sword through
this spot, and the Silver Cat, too, fell over dead

It was not long now till the red woman ar-
rived at the place and found both the Amadan
and the Cat lying side by side dead At this
the poor woman was frantic with sorrow, but
suddenly she saw by th» Amadan’'s side the
bottle of toeshlainte and the feather She
took them up, and rubbed the Amadan with
the iocshlainte, and he jumped to his feet alive

fight.

He amothered her with kisses and drowned
her with tears. He took the red woman with
him and set out on his Journey back, and tray-
elled and travelled on and on till he came to the
Castle of Fire :

Here he met the three young Princes, who
were now living happily, with no giants to
molest them They had one sister, the most
beautiful young maiden that the Amadan had
ever beheld They gave her to the Amadan
in marriage, and gave her half of all they owned
for fortune

The tarriage lasted nine days and nine
nights There were nine hundred fiddlers,
nine hundred fluters and nine hundred pipers,
and the last day and night of the wedding were
better than the first

one nut in twenty got sawed without breaking
After the sawing the kernel was picked out,
both sawed surfaces were polished with glass and

clean, but leftin its natural darkness, After the

daguerreotype case. The lining and the in-
laving were held in place with glue, which the
locket maker had obtained by saving the bones
of his meat ration for a week, and boiling them
steadily for a day and night

A favorite ring device was a doubleheart

‘Two hands closely clasped ran the double

brooches were various, The commonest ear
ring was a half moon, shaped from a button
edge, inlaid with pearl dots or tiny stars and
finished with a beaten silver wire clasp to go
through the ear. Others had a round black
knob upon the silver ear piece, with a cube
pendant, inla d with stars, moons, hands, hearts
even heads upon its various sides. Round
brooches were high in favor with the whole

were big buttons, earved into delicate open-

So Patrick O'Possum, Gray Mouse and White
Rabbit went running and hopping and laugh
ing to the cellar of the man's house Patrick
O'Possum turned to Gray Mouse and White
Rabbit after he had taken a good Jook around
the cellar, and then he smiled and smiled

“T like sweet potatoes very much,” he whise
pered as he drew White Rabbit and Gray Mouse
close to him, “but I would not give a centa
bushel for all the carrots in the world If I
had white fur and long ears 1 would rather
eschew those carrots over there than chew
them

Then Patrick O'Possum poked Gray Mouse
and White Rabbit in the ribs and laughed inside.
The sweet potatoes were in a large swinging
box near the pile of carrots. Patrick 0 Bowe
sum jumped up and got on top of the box.
He took ouf some sweet potatoes and tossed
them down on the floor { hite Rabbit picked
them up and carried them out of the cellar,
while Gray Mouse stood by There wasa
long shelf above the swinging box where the
sweet potatoes were and on this shelf were
Jars of jelly and jam and spiced watermelon
and all kinds of good things At one end was
abigiarof apple butter. After Patrick O'Pos-
sum had thrown down all the sweet potatoes
that he wanted he crept along the shelf and
wave the jar of apple butter a hard push. It
fell, struck the edge of the sweet potato bin,
broke all to pieces and apple butter and broken
iar and all fellricght on top of the pile of carrote,
There were the queereat sounds which came
out of that pile of carrots that you ever heard
Green Eyes meowed and cried and kicked an
arched up his back He shook up that pile o'
carréts as though there was an earthquake
inthe cellar. Then, all covered over with apple
butter and !ittle carrots and bits of broken
crock, he went up the cellar stairs yelling and
acreaming atevery step

White Rabbit and Patrick O'Possum picked
up all the sweet potatoes that they could carry
and ran away to the barn. Gray Mouse led
the way Ax they hurried along they got a
alimpse of the nan who was coming down
the hall in his night clothes with a gun over his
shoulder Just as the White Rabbit, the Grav
Mouse and Patrick O' Possum seampered under
the barn floor they heard bang-bang from the
porch of the man's house

“That must have been a_shoteun,” sald
White Rabbit, as he stroked his whiskers and
siniled

“Um, um,” said Patrick O'Posaum, “but
these are good sweet potatoes. This fs more
fun than a coon hunt ”

Green Eyes never went back to the man’s
house again. Many of his friends thought
that the man had shot him and the next night

| out on the back yard fence, all the neighbors

cats met together and sang his funeral song.
T think, though, that Green Eves was not killed
One day when I was out hunting in the woods
I stopped to take a drink at a little spring and
a funnv little lizard stood on the edge and
said: “Excuse me, Mr Hunter, but did you
ever see an apple butter eat?”

TOLD BY THE OLD CIRCUS MAN,

The Greatest of All Gilants's Letter Writing
and Its Uses,

“The greatest of all giants,” said the old cir
cus man, “was not what you would call a great
letter writer, but he did write now and then,
and, of course, he had to have suitable writing
materials. The old man provided these more
than willingly, in fact, he never let the giant
he wanted, whether
it was something that he really needed or only
something that he just fancied At the sama
time the old man never hesitated to take ade
vantage of anything that the giant did with
these things to help advertise the show; and one
day when he saw the giant sitting out back
of the main tent before the show began, writing
a letter, and realized for the first time what a
really wonderful sight that was, he made up
his mind on the spot that he'd introduce the
giant writing letters in the show, in a little act
that he'd have made for that purpose. It was
a simple little scene, between the giant and the

clown, just enough to permit of lugging in the
letter writing busidess, but it proved a great
attraction

“The clown acted the part of a boy in the
giant's employ He had been discharged for
cutting up some sort of capers, but he had
nevertheless asked for a letter of recommenda-
tion. The giant being a man of tender heart,

| was willing to give him this, even if he had dis-

ner hour, there was a craning of masculine |

necks, and for a time eating was suspended
and the newcomer was the centre of attraction
She was very handsome and was elegantly
dressed. He was well dressed, fairly good
looking and of good physique: at least the
feminine part of the crowd thought so. The
lady was evidently angry, there was a wrathful
gieam in her brown eyes, and a nervous t witch-
ing of the facial muscles, which denoted a
storm He was also angry

As she sat down, those nearest noticed that
her lips were moving, and then heard: “Brute
1 will never speak to him again.” He was sitting
opposite her, perusing the menu. Several
times he looked around to see if others were
listening to herremarks She gaye her order to
the waiter and so did he, and for a moment
there was silence. Then she began again
“Lhate you, Lwont sit at the table with you ”

Suiting the action to the word, she moved
to another table, at which no one was seated
Ry this time those who had heard the remarks
were ready to tear the heart out of the eruel
villain who would wound the feelings of such
a woman There was a surprised look on his
face when she moved He picked up his hat
and moved to the table with her, taking the
chair directly oppesite He realized that they
were attracting attention, and was annove
She did not care for the attention. She just
kept scolding. She must have said something
pretty bad toward the last, for a dangerous
look appeared in his eye, and, shoving his chair
back, he picked up hjs hat and left) As he
nassed the cashier he paid for one dinner
This was a phase of the situation upon which
she had made no calculations She slowly
Inished her dinner, and as the waiter handed
ver a check a blank look came over her face
She searched through a purse which she held
in her hand, and closed it with a snap Every
man in the house knew what the trouble was,
and any of them would have volunteered to
nay for that meal if she would only have given
them a chance

For a time she sat eyeing the check. Then
she moved back a little and deftly raised her
skirt a little, displaving a neat and sharely
foot, incased in a handsome patent leather
shoe There was a rustling of silk, a flash
of a bit of vari-colored hosiery, and then she
summoned the waiter, handed him a bill, re
ceived her change and fled) And everybody
wondered what if was all about ,

charged him, and it was this letter that the giant
wrote in the ring, When the boy had made this
request the giant would turn to one of the ring
attendants and say ‘
“Bring in my desk and writing materials”
“And the man would gossip, and come back in
a minute ahead of two four-horse teams driven
abreast and each hauling a big box wagon big
as a great big van. They'd drive these two
teams along side by side out into the centre of
the ring and halt ‘em there with the vans stand-
ing hub to hub together. By this time there'd
be a swarm of men around the van, and they'd

| open the rear doors and haul out from the in-

terior of the van three or four timbers and
what looked like sections of board flooring such
as you might build a platform of, and that was
just the sort of thing they did build of them: on
top of the vans ; this platform serving there ag
the top of the giant's desk, of which the two
vans formed the base

“Then from out of one of the vans they got
the giant's travelling inkstand, which was about
like a square trunk for shape and dimensions,
or as much as anything like a vitriol carboy.
They'd hoist this up on top of the desk and
then get out of the vans the giant's pen rack
and pens: the pen rack being a contraption
about as high and as long as a section of a five-
harred fence with folding-in supports at the
back that could be opened out to make it stand
up, and having hooks on the front to hold the

| penholders, these being, | should think, about

| bit more in his seat, all ready to write

ten or eleven feet long, while the pens were
about the size of the blade of aspade. They'd
put a couple of these penholders and pens on
the pen rack and then hustle out for the giant's
portfolio, which was too big to be carried in the
They could take the desk top apart and
fold that up, but they couldn't do that with
the giant's writing paper and portfolio. The
portfolio holder was like a gigantic sawbuck
or like those holders they have in art stores
toput portfoliosof pictures in, only about seven-
teen times as big, and they'd stand that, with
the nortfolio init, up near the desk

“Other men had brought fp, meaniime, @
chair big enough for the giant to sit in, which
they placed in front of the desk, and when every-
thing was ready for him the giant would alt
down in, that chair and twist around to where
he cou:d reach the ribbons by which the two
parts of the portfollo were tied together, give
them a little yank and pull the bowknot untied
and throw the cover of the portfolio back an
take ont a sheet of that paper. Then he'd
reach forward and pick up one of those pena
from the pen rack, and spread his feet just a
little bit more and settle Dimpelf down a little
Ther
he'd turn his head and look down at the clown
standing on the ground and say, holding the
atest penholder with the pen all ready to

p

“‘Hm—m, lemme see, little boy. How old
did you say you was?’

“Well, now, as T tell this to you, it may se@m
like a dreadful paltry thing for people to go
nutty over, but that’s what they used to &
When the clown said ‘12° or 19," or whatever
the answer was and the wianut squared him-
self around again and dipped his pen in the
earboy inkstand and threw his head just the
least little bit te one side and bewan to write
why, the people would just simpl holler’
Of all the odd things the giant did, wee
nothing that pleased them more.” -_
