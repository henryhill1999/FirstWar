CHINA—THE CASE ASIT NOW 8

 

The Proper Course for the Allies to Parsee te
Attain Permanent Results.

To Tur Epitor or THe Aun--Sir: In ad-
dition tomy communication published tn the
Bunday SuN of the 19th ult., suggesting a
lan for speedily settling the Chinese question
to the advantage both of Chinaand of the en-
tire world, and, incidentally for putting an end
to war among mankind by removing its cause,
and to readjust and adapt the same to a change
of conditions which has since taken place, I
would say:

While I believe that settlement upon the basts
of juatioe to China, absolute and complete, la
the only one upon the ground of equity that ts
permlasible, and the only one that will stay put,
I think that because we should be just {t does
not, therefore, follow that we must be weak,

To avold complications as regards the Chinese
and lose of rapprochement as regards the allies,
action should be prompt; to command {mmedi-
ate respect and acquiescence therein by the
Chinese, it should be tnelsive; to settie the mat-
ter wisely and for all time it should be radical—
first, in the direction of justice to the Chinese,
and seoond, of a solution that shall be both com-
plete and final.

I think that retreat from Pekin at this time
would be {n the nature of a backdown—partial,
at least--and would end in compromise that
would leave the question unsettled, or at least
but half settlea, and that {t would tend to a di-
vergence of opinion and interestaamong the
allies, breaking that concord among the Powers
60 essential to permanent solution and to the
peace of the world. Special Commissioner
Rockhill, as quoted in the papers of this morn-
ing, expresses very succinctly my own view in
the words following: ‘This Is the very best op-
portunity to settle for all tine the status of for-
eignersin China. If that matter is not settled
now the Chinese will be encouraged to perai«t in
their present policy, and the Powers will have
the whole trouble to thrash over again every
two or three years.”

Now, as Minister Conger says, and as events
ainoe the writing of my former communication
show, the Imperial Government has lied to the
allies from the beginning, has been tn league
and codperstion with the Boxers, at the last
moment made a most desperate effort to destroy
the legations and kill the Ministers and their
associates before relief could reach them, and,
to escape, In the royal persons, the conse-
quences of its acts, bas fled before the approach
of the allies. Action should lie againat the of-
fending dynasty ae well as against the Boxers.

The position of the allies, and {t should be
made by proclamation unmistakably clear to
the Chinese people, should now be this

*“Wecame to rescue our beleaguered people
and to aid the Chinese Government in suppreas-
{ng what we believed to be an insurrection and
in restoring order. Now that we find thatthe
dynasty, which fs an allen one and has been
ausurping one, has proved false to China as
well as to the world, and has brought upon
China all this trouble, and since we do not be-
lieve {t represents the wishes of the Chinese
people, we have decided to resoue the Chinese
nation from the hands of this dynasty. Upon
this line we now act. Weoall upon the Chinese
people, through their Viccroya,to cooperate with
us, by their civio power and military forces,
shoulder to shoulder, to accomplish this end.
We promise the restoration of order under
Chinese government and Chinese afvil institu-
tions. We will preserve and defend the tnteg-
rity of the Fmptreinevery part. We grant to
China complete independenos to make and to
administer {te own lawe, subject only to the
laws of nations alike with all other nations, and
claiming only for each nation individually
equality of rights and privilewes with all
others in {ts intercourse with China. By eleo-
thon of the Viceroys, or in whatever way
most accords with Chinese ideas and oustoma,
the Chinese people shall select, subject to ap-
proval of the Powers, a sovereign of their own
race to ascend the throne, pending which we
have confirmed as temporary regent -----—,
who has been selected for the regency by the
Vicercys of the Provinces of ———, ~ a&c
We demand only pecuniary Indemnity, which
shall be nefther punitory nor consequential, but

|mited only to reimbursement of actual losses

for destruction of property and suitabe pro-

vision for families of murdered per-ons, to be

determined and provided for by and between

the new Government, when conatituted, and

the allied Powers, by agreement, and we will
rant like indemnity for any wrong committed
vy theallies.’’

The United States Government, which haa be
fore led diplomatically, should continue the {nt-
tiative in thi4, first, because of its successful
leadership hitherto, and, second, hecanss of the

reiter confi ience the Chinese Vieeroys and

aders of the people will have in anything pro-
posed by us than any other Power

Pending a more formal and definite agree-
ment, along the lines laid down tn my former
communication, it should be an easy thing for
our Government to secure speedy agreem nt of
the allies to a modus vivendi upon the eimple

basis of the above assumed trocilamation to |

the Chinese people, and, by the tme auch is
reached, acquiescence by several of the coast
Vieeroys and the naming by then of the tem-
porary Regent. Such baats of action, no doubt,
expresses the existing feellng of several of ihe
Powers, while all will feel on the one hand, the
dancers of a weak poicy, and on the other
hand that, inany coercive policy which has not
the nacquiescence {n and codperation of the
Chinese people, the aliies wil have a y hite
elephant on thelr hands. Ita justice will com-
mend it both to the Chinese pe ple and to the
whole civilized world, and result in a solution
apeedy, complete, permanent Our Govern-
ment has only to take hold of the matter and
to push it along to make it a quick and genuine
BUCOMaR

The modus vivend! agreed to, as above ret
forth, the allies should at ones push alone their
operations, withont awaiting formal agreement
by and between them and the Vicorovs, leaving
them towivein thelr adhesion thereto as they
are reached, one by one, and have time to oon-
sider and act thereupon, the alilesand their
Viceroy consorts treating only as enemies the
Boxer and Imperal! forces, acting under the
direction of the dynasty, and a!! others as
friends. This mode of action will have all the
advantages before set forth, of celerity, in-
efkivenese and that wisdom and equity that
will result in asolution permanent and com-

late
° The Ruropean nations will be unfaithful to the
civilization which they boast of as superior to
thet of the Chinese {f they fail to reoornize two
things: First, the {nnocence of the Chinese asa
people, who have been helpless in the hands not
only of an {naurrection but of 0 wane ping and
reactionary dynasty, whic! has used the tnesur-
rection to carry out a policy not tn the interest
of the people and probably not expressing the
sentiment of the majority thereof. Second
the humane, aympathetic and {ust courre o
the Chinese Ministers to the various courts, the
Vicerors of the
dignitaries at theo pital, some of whom have
paid the penalty with their lives for having
rai ed their voices In pleas for the protection of
foreicners.

And, while pourparlere are passing between
the Powers, let the commanders {rn the fleld lay
their heads together, agree to suttable meas-
ures, find out the worst cases of soldiers and
officers who have taken Chinese life without
warrant and (n violation of the rules of ctvilized
warfare. and begin their operations by hang-

Military Academy Football Schedule.

West Port, Sept. 18 —The football season
at the Military Academy will afford an unusual
amount of pleasure to the followers of the pig-
skin. There will be two games each week, on

Wednesdays and Saturdays. The contests of
Wednesdays will be waged by the second and
third teams of the academy with the minor
collezves. The schedule inclides both Yale
and Harvard, but the Princeton team ia not on
the list This will be a disappointment to
many, as Old Nassau has always been 4 great
drawing card The cadets have already set
the goal posts in place and have indulged in
some light practice, but the hot weather has
prevented any serious work. The team has
secured the services of Prof Carciofini, whose
valuable work in the physical training denpart-
ment was a decided factor in the memorable
vietory last vear over Annapolis. The com-
plete schedule follows

Sept. 20, Tufts: Oct 4, Pennsylvania State; Oct. 16,
Riverview (3d teams); Oct 17, De La Salle Institute
43d teams); Oct. 20, Harvard; Oct 27, Wiillams;
Oct 81, New York University; Nov. 3, Yale: Now. 7

BRISK PRACTICE WITH A VIEW
CHAMPIONSHIP HONORS.

New York and Long Island Teams Settle
Down to Serious Training Talk of Having
Paid Offcials-An Intercity Association
Favored—Fall Games of Bilatr School,

With the opening of the private schools hardly
anything is talked of among the youngsters
of both the New York and Tong Island

Interscholastic Associations but football, the

make-up of the teams, how they will compare

with the elevens of past years, and the ultimate
winner of the champlonship. The candidates

THOMA

|

of most of the echools have begun light prac- |

ties, and it is expected that this year’s strug-
ale for the championship will be much closer
than any that has taken place during the last
four years. Moet of the schools have lost
the majority of their crack players, through

graduation and the weaker achools will have |

an opportunity to develop strong elevens, as
they have not suffered to such an extent as
their more formidabie rivals,

Next to the football situation the youngsters
are interested tn the outoome of the first regu-
lar monthly maeting of the local assoolation,
which takes place during the first week in Oc-

tober. A number of important matters will
be deotded. In the first place a President will
be electe 1. The impression prevails that the

candidate for the position, to be successful,
must have no connection with any of the teama.
In previous years the President has either been
a captain, manager or prominent member of
one of the echoo! teams, but eo many disputes
arise that require settlement by a disinterested
individual that the boy# have concluded that
a neutral President is necessary.

At this meeting will also come up the quee-
tion of forming an intercity {nterscholastio
athletlo association to take the place of the de
funct Bational association, Ita promoters
provide for an organization composed of the
schools of New York, tong Laland, New Jer-
sey and the private institutions situated along
the Hudson River within a reasonable dietance
of New York. The idea har received the in-
dorsement of many prominently connected
with athletics in the achools

Another matter to be settled is whether the
officjula at the football games are to be paid
of not. There bas been a scarcity of com-
petent men who were willing to act. The
majority of the boys favor the idea of paying
@ reasonable sum and in this way securing
the best oMicials available. There are a few
who object on account of the expense, but
it is believed that a resolution will be passed
providing for the payment of officials at foot-
ball games in the championship serica

The schoolboys of this city and Brooklyn
are considering the advisability of forming a
junior intersocholastio athletic association and
having it affiliated with the present organiza-
tion. This, it is said, would give the smaller
schools a chance to enter their athletes in junior
events, which would incite a spirit of rivalry

that would be benefictal to the larger schools,
6iDce When these boys would enter the bigger
in#titutionsa they would be practically trained
athletes

Steps are being taken to hold an {nterscholas-
tie gymnastic tournament this fall, The origi-
nator of the movement is Prof.
Columbia (rrammar School, who has always
been @ warm supporter of this mode of ex-
ercise, Toa reporter of ‘1H SUN he said:

“T am in favor of more attention being paid
to gymnastics by the schools in the Interseholas-

tic Association, especiidiy during the winter
months, and hope ctefore long that some
of the schools will arranze tor @ yearly con-
test, or, AL any rate, a Joint evhibition such

as yAie and Prineeton have. ( olaunibis Gram-
mar Sencol will caways be ready to enter such
& contest,

The tirst real chance to size un the football
material of Manhattan School was had last

Wednesday wien the voungsters assembled
in the gymnasium, The candidates ure not
aa promistig a vet asat the beginning of list
season, From now until the onen! of the
seaton band ractice will be indulged in,
le Roy Franklin, who was elected captain of
the team at the close of the footba!ll sedson
last year, hus decided not to come back to the

sehool, and anew captain mist be elected
Associate Headmaster 1. t.yons of barnard
School was seen last Thursday afternoon and
had this to say: “We will have a fairly strong
football team this fall. Mostly all of the can-
didates for the eleven spent their vacation at
Camp Champlain, among the pine groves of

Vermont, and considerable practice was in-
dulged in every afternoon, The boys are pretty
well seasoned by this time and when they be-

the work fu earnest will quickly round

alk
fito condition, A number of new boys have
enrolled who are wei vered in the game and

taking all Into consideration the school will
be heard from this tall.’
George Salmon, the Cutler School athietio

director, is) preparing the large uumber of
candidates for practice, The students of th
school are in high glee over the announ

 

ment that Charles Warren and Edward Buck }

are likely to be back. Both youngsters are

strong football plavers, besices being clever
athletes. One of them will captain the team.

All of the ( ollegiate Sehvol's football players
have returned he boys have all taken on
considerable welaht and will line up much
heavier than the team of last year, No oaptain

hea been elected nor has it been decided who
will coach the candidates, but in the meantime
practice will go on under the direction of some
of the graduates. ‘The chances are that the
eleven will take a more prominent part in the
game than In previots vears,

Twenty-two candidates arm now on trial
for places on the Normal School football tearn.
Among them are some excelient players, and
a choice will probably be made for the eleven
next week, That theteam when fully organized
will show up well on the gridiron {8 almost
nasured by the interest taken in the game.
The season will open on Wednesday, Sept. 18

Over in Brooklyn the boys are preparing
for a hot and aggressive campaign. A large
number of the candidates of the different schoo)s
have already indulged in some practice and
the ahowing made by sore of the new materia!
that wiil fill the vacant places Is far above
the standard

A moat promising set of players will represent
&t. Paul's School of Garden City. Dr. George
Rov Hare is coaching the boys, and the achool
should have a formidable team, including a great
many of last vear'e stars

The candidates for the “Poly Prep” Schoo!
football team will pean vractice at the parade

rounds, Prospect Par next week. The

rookien Latin School has lost reveral of ite
atrongest players, and their positions will have
to be filled by comparatively inexperienced
boys. The latter, however, are all faithful
workers, and with a good captain and acon-
acientions trainer the school hopes to make a
better show! than ever before. Some thirty
or forty candidates will report for practice at
the Brooklyn High School grounds at Benson-
hurst to-morrow,

Pratt Institute candidates have already
warmed up a little and will get down to team
work ina short while. The eleven will be quite
as strong as last year. All the regular work
will be done at the Pratt grounds. At Erasmus
Hall High School most of last year's players
have returned, and when the team {s fully
organized it will be a strong combination,

“Sues for Damages Dene by Bees."'

To tre Epirorn oy Tas Sun—Sir; My at-
tention has been called to an article with the
above heading appearing in the oolumns of
your paper under date of Aug. 28, from which
it appears that one WH. Utter of the village
of Amity in Orange county has brought an
action against J. W. Utter, his brother, who
{s an apiariet. It further appears that the
plaintiff alleges that his brother's bees are
damaging his ripening fruit by stinging, sap-
ping and boring the peaches eo that they are
rotting and fast becoming of no value to him.
After detailing the methods employed by the
plaintiff to prove the allegations of his com-
plaint, the article closes with the statement
that bees are known to attack and damage

and fruit, and that their depreda-
ons are cory costly and annoying to fruit

rowers, &0.

The article referred to has no doubt

read by thousands of your subscribers an
may have created an unwarranted prejudice
in the minds of many against that very useful
insect, the honey bee.

The question whether the honey bee is fn-
jurious or beneficial is @ very important one,
affecting, as it does, thousands of fruit growers
and apiarista and the general agriculturist
as well, In determin the above question
it may be well to consider @ few known facts:
Nature in the reproduction of species requires
(except in a few notable instances) that fertili-
zation shall take place. In the case of frui
eceds, &0., this is affected by the deposit o

sollen from the male upon the female blossom

he most important agent In carrying this
pollen is the honey bee, In fact so unportant
a factor in the distribution of pollen could not
be stricken from existence without ruini
the fruit-growing industry, and this fact tn
generally recognized by “up to date” fruit
growers everywhere, to the extent that they
offer liberal inducements to bee-keepers to
locate in the vicinity of their orchards, and
in fact many of them purchase bees and go
into the business as a valuable adjunct to fruit
growing

The statement that the bees sting, sap and
bore into the peaches, or any other fruit, eounds
ridiculous to any one acquainted with the
habits and anatomy of the honey bee. The
tongue of the insect ts as soft and pliable as
soft rubber, and for the bee to puncture the skin
of a peach orany other fruit with this organ
is a physical impossibility, and as to the matter
of the bee using its sting for this purpose, it
is safe to say it is never done, as the operation
would not only result in the lo # of the sting,
but in the death of the bee as well.

When ripe fruit is punctured by {njurtous
insects or the skin broken In any way allowing
the sweet juice to exude, then the honey bee
is on hand.to fill ita honey sac, and this Instead
of an injury is a itive benettt to the fruit

rower by removing the juice which, if left
© farment, would cause decay.

Careful experiments have been made by
scientists with the codperation of bee keepers
and fruit wer, and the conclusion has heen
reached that the two Industries are Interde-
vendent Laws have been passed for the pro-
a a of the bees, forbidding the spraring of
frvit treee when in bloom with polsonous ao-
Jutions, thus directly recognizing the beneficial
agency of our friends, the hens

Will you kindly, Mr Editor, give your readers

The Trick of Wearing Evyeciasses.

From the New Orleane Timee- Democrat

A young man who had purchased a pair of
eyeglasses at a local optician’s the other day
was oomplaining to the clerk that he couldn't
keep them on.

“They are continually falling off.” he said,
“and are really getting to be «@ first-class nu!-
sance. Don't you think it would help things
if you tightened up the apring a little?”

“No, I wouldn't advise you to alter the
epring " replied the clerk: “{t's so tight now
that it ia scarring your nose. If you'lf only be
patient for a few days I think you'll learn to
wear these glasses all right. Come Ip at the
end of the week, and !f you are cul havin,
trouble with them I'll fit you out with a pair o
epectactos, by 4

“What do you mean by ‘learnt! to wear’
those eyeg|asses?” asked a man whe ha pened
to be standing within earshot, after the ous-
tomer had walked out; “Is it a trick that has to
be acquired by practice?”
