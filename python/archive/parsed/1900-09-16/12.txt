BROOKLYN.

It’s Our Autumn Opening That’s Paramount.

| The march of events rules and overrules even the elements as well as human action. In spite of the unseasonable weather, every day for the past weeks and
weeks has been made eventful by the steady march of our incoming merchandise from over the seas. And though the warmth may have made laggards of us in
' showing the new autumn goods—there’s been such a constant pressure from you to see the new that now the opening event must even overrule the weather itself.

The New Shoes Better
Than Ever.

\ny maker at all familiar with the real progress of Shoe
building knows that years ago we introduced the most im-
portant improvements in Women’s Shoes, and that year by year
ever since we have kept a step ahead of general progress by
adding features that have always made our Shoes distinctive
and widely different from others. This season again foot com-
fort and good looks are better than ever. Our display, which
opens to-morrow, of Autumn Shoes for Women and Girls and
Boys will be found of much more than usual interest. Every
kind of Shoe that’s needed—the Walking, Dress Shoe—the Out-
ing Boots—the Oxford Ties—the Dress Slippers—Black and
Tan—Kid, Tan, Russia, Calfskin, Enamel and Patent Leather.
The most attractive gathering of Shoes ever exhibited. All the
Shoes have those distinctive characteristics of style, fit and
comfort that have made them so deservedly popular and created
envious yet unavailing competition.

An Event in Men’s Shirts.

To Every Man Who Wears Clothes.
Ready-to-Wear Clothing--A New Departure.

. To-morrow we will open a thoroughly equipped men’s ready-to-wear clothing store, where you may derive every individual advantage that

it is possible to derive from the best exclusive clothiers in New York.
Brooklyn has long demanded such a store. We mean one devoted to the best quality of clothing only, where merit must take first place
in contradistinction to so-called cheapness. We have long contemplated the opening of "such a department, but deferred doing so until we could
unmistakably control the proper clothing.

You will be assured from the first of the best fashions, of the best fit, of the best cloths, of the best assortment, of the best satisfaction,
because the name of the makers alone is a synonym of perfect clothing in this country. :

Our systems of measurement will be quite different from those ordinarily adopted, so that any man, whether he is abnormally stout or
abnormally thin, may be fitted with accuracy,

The clothing will be quite different from that ordinarily sold in a dry goods store. Not made to sell in competition with the so-called cheap,
but really worthy garments, which have lasting merit and may be returned if not in every way satisfactory.

We can afford to sell at a closer margin of profit than the exclusive clothier can for several reasons, one of which is because our other de-
partments (being busy during the clothier’s dull season) maintain the expenses.

A Material Saving to You in Cost

therefore, is one answer to a natural question, ‘* What advantage to buy in a Dry Goods Store P”’

For the man who prefers his clothes made to order, our Merchant Tailoring Department has been entirely reorganized with far better cutters
and tailors than we have had. Every facility to give you far superior fit and finish than anything heretofore.

Conveniently situated on the Second Floor, near fast running elevators, light, roomy and exclusive. Weare sure the general opening to-
morrow will interest you, and especially as it is a new departure in Brooklyn, Come and welcome just for a survey of the department. The fol-
lowing Prices can only tell you a small part-of the story:
