MINERS MADE NO DEMANDS.

 

Official of the Lehigh Valley Coal Company
Explaine the Gitaation.

Wriaxe-Bamre, Pa, Sept i5@ Responding
to the publio demand for a detinite statement
of the present attitude of the operators toward
the threatened strike in the anthracite coal
fields, the following statement was made to-day
by John B. Garrett, VicePresideng, on behalf
of the Lehigh Valley Coal Company, through
General Superintendent W A. Lathrop of this
city

“No demand whatever has heen made upon
this company by its own employees for @ re-
vision of wages er conditions at any time this |
season or' during the agitation leading up to
the present strained relations On the con-
trary, special efforts have been made by our
superintendents and others to learn the actual

thought of the more Intelligent miners with
the uniform result that they claim to be satls-
fled and were averse to a« strike, though they
would feel forced to stap work were Aa strike
declared

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

“There nbeno doubtthat the presen’ threat
ening © Bd tions are due to the young and
irrespons..@ element and t4 the urgent efforts
of a labor union composed wholly of workers
elaewhere than in the anthracite field, whose
work and conditions and basis of wages are
essentially different from those of our em-
jloyees with the purpose of embracing the latter

conviction be well founded, than there is cer- |

SITUATION AT PITTSTON.

Men ie Many of the Mines Qalt Work Some
Will Not Strike.

Pirrston, Pa, Sept 16~ The miners of the
Pitteton district are gradually throwing down
their toola in obe lienoe to the strike order of
the United Mine Workers Only one colllery,
the Mount Lookout, in addition to the three
which suspended yesterday, was completely idle
this afternoon, but several other mines were |
working shorthanded, At the Willlam A
colliery the miners began to leave their cham-
bers at noon, but there was suMctent mined
coal on hand to keep the breaker fotog through-
out the afternoon § All of the other individual

collieries were in operation all day
In Leadville shaft only about twenty miners

were at work. In No. 9 and No. 10 shafts |
nearly all of the mineré were on duty
The driver boys at No 8 colliery
also quit work this morning, and com-

hands were called on to handle the mules
Realy all of the miners in No 8 shaft were
working, but those at No. 1 were out The miners
in Law shaft, which supplies Central breaker,
quit work at noon to-day, but the breaker
as kept in operation thig afternoon with coal
from No. 18shaft. Interest continues to centre
in the attitude of the Pennsy!vania Coal Com-
y's miners toward the strike order, and |
to-day brought no more definite news on this
point than the past few days) That many
of the Pennsylvania miners will remain from
work on Monday morning is certain. As to
whether a sufficient number of the miners will
strike to make it impossible to operate the col-
leries is purely a matter of conjecture. So
fer as the Individual operators’ collieries are
concerned every one will be idle on Monday

THESE MINERS WONT STRIKE.

 

 

Werkmesn in Three ef the Largest Collieries
Decide to Hold Of for Ten Days.

Hagunton, Pa. Sept. 15—The threatened
strike of the anthracite coal miners will go into
effect on Monday morning. From present
indications all the mines south of the city will
shut down, the United Mine Workers being
strongest in that part of the Hazleton region.
It fe not thought that the collieries of G. B.
Markle & (Co. at Jeddo, Highland and Oakdale
three of the largest mines in the district, will
be crippled. The men have decided to hold
off ten days, during which the company will |
have an opportunity to consider and grant |
or reject their demands, which were presented |
by non-union hands.

The employees at Harwood and Lattimer |

will pot etrike either. They are thoroughly
satisfied with cougitions and only the foreign
element talks str™e. All such have been noti-
fled that if they do not report Monday morn-

ing they may consider thernselves go longer
fn the employ of the company ‘ith the
1,975 men at Highland, Jeddo and Oakdale

and the 835 at Harwood and Lattimer at work
the strike will not be general and therefore
not effective. If g sufficient number of men
report at any colllary they will be fully pro-
tected, as the companies are determined to
alice no intimidation or interference on the
part of outsiders,

COAL AT RETAIL UP $1:

LONG STRIKE WOULD BLACKEN OUR
AIR WITH SOFT COAL SMOKE.

No Steam Sizes of Anthracite to Be Had, Even
Now, It Is Reported—-Pienty ef Sto
bat Hetailers Anticipate a Rise and, Be-
sides, May Want te Make Some Money.
By a sort of tacit understanding many retail

coal dealers advanced the price yesterday

of all prepared sizes of coal, including chest-
nut, stove and egg, $1 aton This information
was obtained by a SUN reporter at the coal
office of J. K. Jones and David 8. Wells in the

Washington Building, 1 Broadway, When

asked if the limited supply of coal [n New York

made stich a marked advance necessary, one
of the men in the office replied

"It does not. There is enough coal here to
supply all the demand for the next six weeks

The retail dealers have advanced the price,

in aj! probability, in order to make more money

Resides that, they probably advanced the price

 

 

in anticipation of what they may
have to pay for coal in the near
future. The®result will Le, of course, that

the small consumer will pay the piper It is
by no means certain, hewever, that this ad-
vanoe will hold for @ great length of time. It
all depends on what happens at the mines on
Monday. Nobody knows yet, of course, how
many men will go out. A man who has just
come from there told me this morning that he
would not be greatly surprised ff the threat-
ened strike lasted six months. He said that
things had taken on a serious aspect through-
eut the anthracite region. He added that if
the strike did last that long, the retail price
would go to $14 4 ton, as it did during the great
atrike of 1894

“Thils, of course, has reference entirely to
the larger sizes of ooal. There is practically
no steam sizes of anthracite coal to be had at
These sizes include pea coal and

any price
Nos | and 2 buckwheat There isn't a pound
of th oal to be bad, and there hasn't been

| any for sale for some ‘{me.”

‘If that is the case, what are the manufact-

urera to do when thelr present supplies. run
out?” the reporter asked
They must burn bituminous coal, which

is just what the bituminous people want. Of
course, if steam sizes of anthracite coal can-
not be had, the manufacturers must use aoft
city ordinances or no city ordinances
All businesa cannot stop just because some
Board of Health wont allow the use of soft
coal An emergency calls for emergency
joubt there will be

no trouble should the necessity arise with
| the New York authorities about New York
manufacturers burning soft) coal, Further
| than that there is a combination that may
be used which will not produce the smoke

| that soft coal alone will make.”

Among te retailers there seemed to be a
rather startling uniformity of statement about
for coal on the
of smal consumers. One retall dealer who
was seen in the Washington building, where he
had wone to get any late news he wight find
there from the anthracite region, made this
statement

‘Has the retail price of coal advanced? Of
course it has. Why wouldn't it with the demand
that ja being nade on the retail dealers? Peopie
seem to be fairly falling over one another to
get in orders for their winter supply. The man
who haa usually ordered at this time of year ten
tops plunks down an order for twenty tons,
apd so it has been going for the past two days
At this rate our supply will be exhausted in
three weeks. Why shouldn't the price go up?”

This seemed rather an alarming statan
and the reporter took the trouble to make sor
inquiries on the way up Broadway from the

roprietora of several atores he found open if
hey were purchasers of coal and {f so, if they
had been hurrying to lay in their winter aupply
and ff they had Increased their usual orders
Perhaps two dozen enquirieag were nade and in
not 4 single instance was an Affirmative reply
obtained. In most casas those of whom the
inquiries were made didn’t know of any reason
why they shouldbe {n any hurry to buy ooaland
all of thern hoped that they wouldn't have to
buy as mucy this winter as they did last At
any rate they didn’t know why they should send
in double orders at this time

Another retail dealer whom the reporter
saw had rathera different story to tell

“I have heard,” he said, “that the retail price
of coal has ger anced $1 to-day. But 1 have
also heard that the advance has been made
irindipally by the small dealers. One firm
As pe @ no advance as yet and I have only
heard of three of the larger retailers who have
put up the price. The head of our firm is out
of town and wont return until Monday, What
he will think best to do 1 canuot say, but I don't
believe a great wany of tue large retailers will
advance the price until chey know what ts
really going to pappen in the anthracite region
It is quite natural, however, that the small

eahould make hay while the sun shines.”

obert M. O yphant, President of the Dela-
ware and Hudsop Canal Company, was asked
if he cared to make reply to the open letter ad-
dressed to him 7, John Mitchell of the United
Mine Worlers. In that letter Mitchell eatd that
his telegram to Mr Olyphant informing hin
that astrike would be ordered was sent at 12:15
o'clock on Wednesday afternoon and that it
also stated thatahe strike order would not be
opesative until Monday, thus giving the
° ators time to negotiate At first

r. Olyphant eaid that he didn't care
to be rawn {nto any discus-ion with
Mitchel!. A little later, however, he showed
the orfginal telegram from Mlicbell. It had
been filed at Indanapolia at 420 P.M on
Wednesday and hid been received in New York
at 442. The telegram stated that the strike
would be ordered at 5:30. three-quarters of an
hour later. Mr. Olyphant call attention to
the fact that the tone of the telegram was ex-
tremely arbitrary and that, as an immediate
reply was demanded, Mit hell does not tel. the
truth when he says Olyphant had plenty of
time for consideration

      

| managed to crawl in a fainting condition to

An official of the De‘aware and Hudson, who

came from the coal regions on Friday night,
issued this statement yesterday

"The men have made no complaint what-
ever. There have, been one or two commit
tees of labor unions from other places among
the men, but # is not known what they came

for, as they did not address themeelves to |

any of the companies. Regarding the Dela-
ware and Hudson company, all the men were
at work yesterday in eight of the ten collier-
ies Two others were closed, one because
of a strike among the drivers, who are
mostly boys and easily influenced, and
the other colliery was closed for repaira to
the machinery think T can Say that one-haif
of the miners are opposed to a strike, but many
so opposed will go out because of class sympathy.
I have heard many say that they did not want
to quit. About one-third of the Delaware
and Hudson miners are foreigners, a Jarge pro-
portion Poles, steady-going men, many of
them owning their own homes and op’ d to
lawlessness. I venture to say that but a very
small number will be found on the side of dis-
order.”
The advance of $1 a ton In the sizes of coal
used for domestic purposes makes the new
$6 a ton for chestnut, stove
and eg coal, the higher price being for the
cheatnut.

The Brooklvn retail coal dealers held a meet-
ing at the Clarendon Hotel last night. About
75 ner cent. of the dealers were present. After
adiournment Chairman Joseph Gleason of &}
Atlantic avenue anpounced that it had heen
decided to begin oharging en Monday $5.50
for coal on the sidewalk and 8575 in the bin.
The general opinion Among those present was
that the atrike would be wer: serious and that
other action might be necessary later. It is
caleniated that Brooklvwn has between two and
three months’ coal supnly on hand, ao that
if Judgment {is used in its sale no famine wil)
result for nearly three months. However, if
favored customers are permitted to Jav in big
stocks the shoe may begin to pinch the general
public sooner

RUSSIA’S LEADING ROLE.

CZAR SEEMS TO HOLD THE KBY
TO THE CHINESE SITUATION.

Only Guessce as to His Real Motives and His
Reported Agreement With the Matser
Japan to Be Brought in by Corean Balt?
~England’s Gloomy View of the Freblem.
Special Cable Despatch to THE SUN

LONDON, Sept. 15 -—Another week has served
only to increase the complications of the China
problem. The key to the situation seems to
lie in the answer to two questions What are
the real intentions of Russia, and is there 4
virtual agreement between the Czar and the
Kaiser? No answer ix available to either of
these, and any one of the many guesses is about
48 good as another

There is no disagreement among the British
publicista in their view of the matter They
utterly disbelieve in Russia's good faith in the
proposal for the evacuation of Pekin. They
Argue that while it would perhaps have served
Russia's purposes if everybody cleared out
of the capital three weeks ago, yet the Czar's
well that Great
Britain, and perhaps Germany, would not listen
tosucha proposal, By putting it forward with
the virtual knowledge that it would be rejected
Russia might easily have put herself in an
attitude of friendliness to China and at the same
time have forced Great Britain into a position
of an opposite nature. This manw@uvre, how-
ever, quite failed in ita object, for, according
to the luminous and typical Chinese pronounce
ment by Director Sheng to THe Sun's corre-
spondent at Shanghai, Russia's proposal served
merely to intensify China's suspicion

English opinion {is largely influenced by Dr.
M4rrison's Pekin despatches to the Times,
and he has taken the most pessimistic view
of the British policy and action in Pekin. He
deplores the inferiority of the British military
and naval forces in the Far East, and laments
the leading réle Russia has been allowed to
assume in the Pekin demonstration, He points
out, also, that {t will be as easy now as in 1860
for the Chinese entirely to misrepresent the
nature of the foreign invasion to their own
countrymen

It Is gloomily assumed also that the Czar
and the Kaiser are in complete agreement
for mutual aggrandizement and that the con-
sent of Japan will be secured by Russian prom-
ises In regard to Corea. ‘This would leave
only Great Britain and the United States in
favor of maintaining the status quo in China,
and England does not expect the slightest
active aassistanes from America in upholding
any policy as opposed to the designs of the
other Powers,

‘The foregoing, as 1 have said, is a despondent
view taken by most English observers. Opinion
on the Continent is quite different, though much
leas clearly defined. France has no knowledge
of what her ally is really about, but is quite
willing, apparently, to support Rusata what-
ever her game may be, and is happy in the
assurance which she enjoys that Muscovite
influence in Pekin has entirely supplanted the
British. No French resentment is manifested
againat the idea of the Kaiser working in har-
mony with the Czar, and the only disturbing
element is the underlying feeling that France
is really cutting no figure in the events This
impression will probably grow unless Russia
soon placatas French vanity, but the shrewd
managers at St. Petersburg are quite com-
petent to deal with this difficulty if the allies,
{ncluding Germany, are thoroughly content
to leave everything to the Czar

All Germans consider that they have a special
lair, and in the situation as it stands they have
little to lose and much to gain by any future de-
yelopments. There is little or no public oppo-
sition to the idea of German oodperation with
Russia. The semi-official press continues, how-
erer,to proclaim German good faith in prom-
{sing to respect the territorial integrity of
China, and is especially emphatio tn denying
any secret design in the Yang-tse Valley, con-
cerning which British suspicions are very
strong.

WAITING DEVELOPMENTS IN CHINA.

 

No Steps te Be Takem at Present Toward
Withdrawing Oar Troops From Pekin.

Wasninaton, Sept. 15.—Minister Conget’s
cable message, dated Sept. 12 and received
yesterday, is not considered sufficient for this
Government to act upon just at present in
taking definite steps toward withdrawing from
Pekin. The State Department will not make
public the contents of the message until the
Administration has decided what steps shall
be taken. As long as delay ts not working
any injury to this Government's purposes
the President, it fe said, feels that it would be
inexpedient and inadvisable to be hasty. It
{a gratifying to officials that from the present
outlook Pekin will very soon be within twelve
hours of Washington by cable,when the Presi-
dent can be informed of every new movernent
in China without delay. A State Department
officer said this afternoon that it would be
inadvisable to proceed upon belated tnfor-
mation, and that in the last threedays it ts
probab!e many things have oceurred in Pekin
which the President should know before taking
any definite step.

In the international diplomatic muddle no
nation seems to have any definite plan On
the military occupation of Pekin the several
Powers have declared their differences, but
have not proceeded to act upon their an-
nounced preferences. Russia is most con-
spicuous In advancing forces to Pekin, where
they are reported to be arriving in great num-
bers, while the Czar was the first to propose
withdrawal There are new phasea of the
situation developing daily. To-day reports
came from Shanghai that the German Minister
called upon {A Hung Chang. This looks to
officials in Washington and to Minister Wu,
who was most gratified to hear it, as if Ger-
many, the country which aried loudest for
war, is now playing for advantage in treat-
ing with China's envoys, just as several other
Powers appear to be from reports from the
Far Fast

While such things are going on ft ts said
the President does not fee) inolined to with-
draw from the field. Tt appears that the foreign
officers of the European nations are proclaim-
ing preferences for just the opposite line of
action to that which their diplomata in China
and military commanders are pursuing off-
claias here say that the United States will not be
hasty in withdrawing while this is the case

Minister Wu was an early caller at the State
Department to convey the information that
11 Hung Chang left Shanghai for Pekin vester-
ca After his talk with Mr. Adee a preas
despatch from Shanghai was shown him which
said that Admiral Seymour had objected to
14 Hung Chang's departure on a Russian war-
ship. He said he did not understand why
the Bri®.b were showing this animosity. He
was sure that I.) Hung (hang had always been
friendly to England. The same Shanghai
despatch said that the German Minister had |
called upon Li Hung Chang on the ship in which
he would proceed to Pekin. Minister Wu said
that thie was very gratifying news, as the Ger-
man and British Consuls in Shanghai had been
the only ones who had not called upon Earl Li

4 Government officer said to-day: “Itis very |
evident from cable mesqages that are =

received here from various sources that there
is an international play going on in the Far
Fast for advantage and prestige tn dealing
with the Chinese for settlement. 1 believe
we will see the foreign representatives in Pekin
literally falling over each other soon, atten pt-
ing to make independent and advantageous
arrangements fora settiement for their Gov-
ernments with the Chinese Envoys When this

stage in reached, if it ts. it will give the (hi-
a chance to say tothe Powers

SLIGHTLY USED

Aeolians

At Reduced Prices

We offer, for two weeks only, a complete assortment of Moliane at reduced prices.
This should focus the attention of all intending purchasere—not because it affords a bargain,
but an opportunity.

These instruments are not new—they have all been in use, having been taken in
exchange for higher priced styles, but that very fact is significant of the estimation in
which the Aolian is held by those who have had the instrument in their homes.

They have been putin thorough order,and repolished so that in the majority of instances
they cannot be distinguished from entirely new instruments, and are subject to the same guarantee.

The cost of the Aeolian causes many of ite appreciators to deny themselves the con-
stant source of pleasure which comes with ite possession. It deters othere from inves-
tigating it. Thie sale enables one to obtain an Aeolian at a greatly reduced price. There
will also be included a few Pianolas, which have been loaned to customere while waiting for
special designs of cases. Jt will [as! for two weeks only.

Among the instrumente offered:

The following letter was recently received from a prominent manufacturer ;

“* When I first heard of the Aeoltan I thought it was a hand-organ, sach as we see
lame men and shriveled-ap women playing in the street. My firet purchase was a $600 one,
and tt took me about five minates to get over this idea.

** Within a month I wanted a $750 one, and within twelve months I was glad to be
one of the first parchasers of a $1,500 instrament, and I think it has brought enough harmony
into a home where musical taste was not sapplemented by maeical ability for me to say that
if you get out a $3,000 one to-morrow I shall probably want to bay tt.

‘* Besides this I hawe had the pleasure of making three customers for $750 tnstrements
since I have had mine, and all of my friends are charmed with their perchases.””
