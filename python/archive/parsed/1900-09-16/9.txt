PRESIDENT IN DISPOSED.

Change of @limate Mokes Mr, McKinley
Seek Complete Rest.

CANTON, Ohio, Sept. 15--The usual number
of visitors made their way to the McKinley home
to-day, but nearly all who had hoped to see
the President were disappointed. Soon after
breakfast he retired to his room and all visitors
were informed that he was taking a much-needed
rest’ He was not sick, those about him said,
but was in actual need of sleep and quiet His
condition was largely attributed to the weather
and the experiences of the past few days It
was cool when he reached here on Thursday
evening and remains cool, except in the middle
of the day, when for an hour or two it is
hot This was a decided change from Wash-
ington conditions during the last month. Then,
too, the habite and hours of reat were not regular

during the wedding at Somerset
QGtuers of the housenold have the same
experience as the Presid eb t in greater or leas

degree They all expeet to be reacclimated
in a day or two and pane by Monday Mr
MckKiniey will be as easily accessible as ever.
Among the day's callers were Judge Hosea

REAL ESTATE NEWS.

 

 

A private house renting for less than $800
a year is arare exceptionin Manhattan. Some
miniature dwellings erected on lotsa twelve and
a half feet wide and some others located in the
midst of stables command less. Even at $800
there are few houses to be had of normal sige,
except in badly deteriorated localities. A
three-story ten-room house sixteen feet eight
inches wide containing modern plumbing and
in good repair is a bargain at $900 in the average
mixed flat and dwelling-house nelghborbood.
The rents most frequently quoted by agents
in Manhattan when the question is as to inex~
pensive houses are $900, $1,000 and $1,200, ao
cording to size, condition and location.

Men of family in the middle class of soctety
normally spend from one-fifth to one-fourth
of their income in rent for Uving quarters,
the smaller proportion usually obtaining {n the
case of dwellings and the larger in the case
of flats which provide heat and hot water,
Generally speaking, therefore, a man must re-
ceive an income of $4,500 or, say, $5,000 a year
in order to be able to ltve in a private houses
in Manhattan, a circumstance which explains
why 80 per cent. of the population of the borough
live in tenements and flats

As regards the majority of people of assured
pecuniary position—professional men, trades
people, and salaried employees—incomes
range from, Say, $1,200 to $5,000 a year. People
of this class are for the most part financially
unable to live in private houses in Manhattan,
and, until recently, particularly the last two
years, the supply of available private houses
elsewhere was limited, except as incomes ap-
proached the $5,000 mark. The extension of
trolley transportation and betterments In ferry
and suburban steam rallway service, however,
have brought vast tracts of hitherto {nacces-
sible and, consequently, cheap land within
reach of the metropolitan business centre at
low fare, until now a private house is within
the eoonomic capacity of a larger part of the
population than slnce New York ceased to be
a provincial town. It is not surprising, there-
fore, that, though the real estate market is other-
wise quiet, there is a marked investment move
ment In progress in suburban realty, partiou-
larly in the more favored parts of the city’s
frontier

The popular tnterest in the subject of tnex
pensive private houses which this movement
indicates will justify calling attention to certain
elamentary considerations by which an tn-
vestor should allow himself to be guided in the
purchase of a home. The selling value of real
property, of course, is determined by the {n-
come it will yfeid. Ittsa rule generally accept-
ed by professional operators in the New York
market that the selling price is equal to ten
years’ gross rent. Thus, ife house rents at $500
a year ita selling value will be $5,000 One-fifth
of one’s income is a normal expenditure for the
hire of a private house. A person with an in-
come of $1,200 a year, therefore, will act in
accordance with conservative and approved
principles of investment in buying a home at
$2,400, while a person with an income of $5,000
may make a purchase of $10,000 The applica-
tlon of this principle, while simple enough
where the purchase is made in cash, requires
some modification if it is to be strictly carried
out in cases where only a part of the purchase
price is paid However, a buyer with an in-
come of $1,200, for example, ts reasonably sure
of being able to cope successfully with any
question that may arise in connection with the
average purchase money mortgage on a home
worth $2,400

[In selecting a home, apart from consider.
ations relating to transportation, it should
be remembered that property fn an eatah-
ished and developed community has the great
advantage of not being subject to spectal asseas-
ments for public improvements. Other things
being equal, land values are also leas likely to
be inflated in a community where there has
been little or no recent speculative building. |

 

 

Btaten Island is an excellent illustration of
these requirements. For example, the settle
mente in and about St. George, Livingston
Stapleton, Clifton, Tompkinsville, Snug Harbor,,
West Brighton, Port Richmond and Prohibition
Park have every improvement, Inoluding city
water, electric light and, gas. and the streets

 

  

‘are legally opened, graded, sewered, paved,

guttere!, curbed and flagged. Yet in these
communities, although there afe no special
assesaments to fear, lota range in pricefrom
$1,500 in the best residential section of &
George, reached ata five-cent fare from Man
hattan, to $300 Houses containing
two or three rooms beatdes pantry and kitchan
on the first floor, four bedrooms and a bath on
the second floor and one or two rooms {n tha
attic rent at from $20 and $22 to $50 and gaya
month, and sel! at from $2,400 to $7,200. Private
houses of this description have lawns and fre.
quently fruit, while shade trees invariably
line the etreet. Houses surrounded by four
or five acres in fruit and lawn are common
along the Rapid Transit Raflway, served at
commutation rates equivalent to a tan-
cent fare from Manhattan, and may he
bought at from $800 to $600 an acre. § Along
the trolleys and nearer the centres of popula-
tion similar properties sell at from 8750 to $1,-
600. Farm land in the interior brings $200 and
$300 an acre,

These prices are exceptionally low tn view
of the natural and artificial advantages offered.
The churches and other institutions, embracing
every important creed and party, have passed
the period of debt and struggle for existence,
and society ls represented by clubs which enjoy
the prestige of long traditions of exclusive
ness, The ocean views and inland scenes, the
bathing and fishing and an unrivailed road
system appeal to the love of nature and the
taste for outdoor sport. The transportation
facilities, including ferry and steam and trolley
railways, is cheap and adequate, the farthest
part of the Island being accessible in an
hour from Manhattan, and the fare being
five cents across the water and five cents
more inland. Under these circumstances
the explanation for the low price of real estate
on Staten Island will have to be sought on
purely technical ground. A high local rete
of interest on morigage loans causes fee values
to remain low. Down to consolidation
the island maintained an independent existenoa,
and the local banks made practically all the
loans, the rate of interest being 4 per osnt
Since consolidation the island has come increas-
ingly Into notice with Manhattan capitalists
and lending institutions, so that the rate dur
ing the summer may be sald to have been re
duced to & per cent on new loans and 5\ per
cent. on renewals. It is evident, therefora
that Richmond borough Is approaching a period
of acttve speculation, and that, apart from
this prospective influence, real estate invest-
ments are meantime certain to rise in valog
owing to a falling interest rate
