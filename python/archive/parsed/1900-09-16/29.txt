TROLLEYING OF A SUNDAY,

Mary Jane”

Thus sang my young charge, Dickey, on
Baturday and for every day since we returned
from our (rst vonture by trolley into New
Jersey, and on Sunday morning I had her up
and ready at 9 o clock, the same hour and the
game hard Job to got her started that it was
before This time our tour was to be made
entirely in the State of New York and we left
by the trolley which we took at Fifty-eighth
strect and Tenth or Amsterdam avenue, bound
nor} Ten minutes after we had started
Dickey asked if it was Sunday morning

“Of course,” sald I, “Why?”

“Beauas,” said she, “I have been observing,
and if there are any stores closed on this street
1 fall to see them Is there any law closing
them?"

“Really, my doar, I don't know,” sald I. “If
the saloons are closed 1 guess that's enough.”

“What's sauce for the goose ought to bo sauce
for the gandor,” said she sententiously

Farthor upithe street we passed a store with
the name James Butler over the door, The
place was closed

“Thore,” said I, “I

“What's that?”

“That Jamos Butler store. He began business
with nothing but bis energy, I don't know
how many years ago, and to-day he owns 115
stores Just Iike it allover the city.”

‘Um said Dickey, “1 think it shows that
it pays a man to observe the Sabbath.”
along Amsterdam avenue to 120th
street we transferred to the cars of that ilne
to Third avenue, where we transferred again
and went a few dozen feet to the maln station

Crossing the Harlem Kiver, just
we were at one fell ewoop
in Westch county, and though the city
government still followed us, our county gov-
ertment called us te the court house in White
Plains— slightly anomalous possibly, but a fact
nevertheless. We trolleyed along pleasantly
enough, for a trolley is pleasant even on & Warm
day, until we came to West Farms, where every-
body and his wife and children got aboard
and we had a touch of bad car manners by
people standing up in front of us and shutting
off the breeze, something I never saw on any

“Just like an Octopus.” sighed Dickey, who

tinued, “also lived in this neighborhood, and
wrote a poem to the Bronx, which he referred
to as ‘My romantiojBronx,’ He is buried not

to eat in Tarry n This ‘a arank Injustice
to a thriving city on the Hud-on. A White
Plains dinner is 75 centa and not equal to the
50-cent Plainfleld dinner, though a very we od
one. Economy is not to be overlooked by
the troliey rider

White Plains is the county seat of Westches-
ter county: Is a very pretty town with cool
and shady streets: a nice home may be rented
for $385 a month or less; some excellent people
live there; it is thirty-three minutes from New
York by steam and four hours by trolley; It
has all the modern conveniences, and during
the two hundred and odd years of its existence
it has accumulated enough history to fill a
newspaper Its Indian name was Puaconens,
from which it has a street named, and |t derived
{ts present name from the white balsam whiet
flowered the plains it occtunies with its snowy
bloom. Ithasone hotel, which has hadthesame
name for over fifty year® The battle of White
Plains, fought Oct. 28, 1776, was a draw be-
tween Gen. Washington and Lord Howe, not-
withstanding there were more officers of high
rank engaged in it than any small battle of the
Revolution, at least a dozen Generals taking
art.

' Leaving town Immediately after our feeding,
we plunged once more into the green of the

 

woods, passing first the Westchester Fair
Grounds, where every year the fashion and
fat pigs, the wealth and watermelons, the

ide and “punkins” of Weatchester congregate

and hilller as we approach the Hudson and
finer houses begin to rise out of the woods

and we landed at last down at the level of the

we had fnished a balloon ride

“[ suppose,” sald Dickey, as we waited for
the next move, “that this place is called Tarry-
town, because we tarry here”

"No,” said I, “it is not. It {s so called from
the Duteh word ‘Tarwe,’ which means ‘wheat,’
this having once been a wheat section, and
its origiual title was Tarwe-town.”

‘Thanks,” said Dickey. “Proceed with your
reminiscences.”

‘They are not reminiscences,” said I, re-
seuuing her reflections on my age "The
are history You must think I am old enough
to be a erent grandimother *

‘Old enough,” said she, “but not otherwise
eligible And she chuckled, as single young

This ride overlooking the Hudsen, as from a
balcony, is one of beauty. We passed alone it
as ina dream, stopping long enough at Dobbs
| Ferry to learn that dan Dobs, a Dutchman, had
aferry he re 200 years ago and changed the name
of the place, which the Indians called Weece
quaee-wuck, to the less romantic but more easily
yronounceable name which it now bears: cateh-
| ing a glimpse of Ardaley, the home of great-
nese and golf: snatching a view of Sunny Side
and of Irvington and landing presently at
Hastings Here a man, who evidently hadn't
the ® proper idea of truth in his mind, told us we

onrha rand over the bridge which spans a deep
and picturesque gorge in the midst of the town
We got it, of course, because that was what we
were there for, but we walked a mile before wa
did However, it was a charming walk under
the trees, with views of the great river all along,
and we hardly knew we had walked a mile when
we came to the troiley awain For nearly three
miles we rode now, passing through the pretty
suburbs of Yonkers, and stopped in the town
for another transfer

Yonkers is a fine town,

cold in winter, but never uninteresting. It is
an old town, too, and it derived its name from
the Dutch word “Jonkheer,” meaning “a vou ing
