IN FAVOR OF NEW COAL ROAD,

Appellate Division Decides for the Delaware
Valley and Kingston,

The Appellate Division of the Third Depart-
ment of the Supreme Court of this State handed
down at Albany yesterday a decision uphold-
ing the action of the State Railroad Commis.
sioners in giving the newly organized Dela-
ware Valley and Kingston Railroad authority
to build its proposed road along the line of the
old Delaware and Hudson Canal to tidewater
at Kingston. This decision was rendered
on an appeal of the New York, Ontario and
Western and other coal-earrying roads from
the decision of the State Commissioners.

This new project is backed by the Pennsyl-
vania Coal Company and S. D. Coykendall

of Kingston. Itis designed to furnish a shorter
and cheaper tidewater out.et from the anthra-
cite coal flelds of Pennsylvania. ‘lhe success
of such a scheme would be cetrimental to the
interests of tac Erie, the Ontario and Western,
and the Delaware and Ifudson companies.
Determined opposition has been urged against
Uniess the opposttion companies
to the Court of Appeals there
