CUBA'S TRUE AIMS.

A Letter From Senor Varona Decitning te Be
a Constitutional Delegate.
Gen

Sefior Enrique José Varona, Wood's

| Secretary of Public Instruction, has recently

written a letter deciiuing the request of his
admirers in the Province of Puerto Principe to
represent them in the coming Constitutional
Assembly. It is one of the broadest-gauged

productions yet issued by any Cuban states- ,

man. He looks the situation squarely in the

| face without blinking and, divesting himself |
| of all prejudice,

tells his countrymen some
plain truths. He deciines to serve in theCon-
stitutional Convention because he sees only
too plainly that his views are ufteriy antago-
nistic to those of the people who would have
him represent them They believe in imme-
liate absolute independence He sees the
futility of such hopes and he refuses to make
himself a martyr to public indignation when

| he knows his martydom will be of no avail

Sefior Varona has long been recognized as
as ove of Cuba's leaders. He is a journalist
by profession and as late as the early part of
Gen. Brooke's Governorship of the island was
editor of La Patria. His letter follows
“Gen. M. Ramoa, President of the Republican

Party, Puerto Principe

“DeaR SiR AND FELLOW Citizen: I am
indebted to our Camaguey for many tokens
of affection and confidence, but none has
moved meas much asthis one brought to me

have felt that my epirit was weighed down
more and more by (he grayity of this situation,
which, being obscure in itself, bas been ren-
dered more un.ertain and perilous by nearly
two years of blind forgetfulness of reality

“You desire that I will represent your people
in the National Convention. More than a
month ago many respectable fellow citizens,
you among therm, wrote to me with the pro-
posal. I answered, excusing myself and prom-
iaed to write to them clearly and diatinotly. You

“All those who would make the Cubans be

‘We can aspire to much, because It is within
the conyenience of the American people and
within their practices and principles to throw
no uncue obstacles In the way of our tnternal

celving the others, telling them that we have

MIDDEN AS A HEALTH RESORT.

Court Enjoins It Nevertheless as a Compulsory
torm of Cure.

Nicholas Karataoni, proprietor of a summer
hotel at Glenwood, Oyster Bay, has obtained an
injunction from Justice Bischoff of the Supreme
Court, pendente lite, restraining Thomas «4. |
Townsend, owner of a pier at that place, and
Campbell & Co., contractors, from leaving horse
manure at that place. Campbell & Co. have a
contract with this city for the removal of horse |
manure, and they have been unloading it at |
Glenwood, where it is sold in time to the farm- |
ers. VDlaintiff says that the odors are driving
his boarders away. The defendants returned
that the manure was making the place a health
resort. John Reinhart of the firm of Campbell |
& Co. made affidavit that three years ago he
was nearly a skeleton and had to drop his former
business on account of ill health At that
time he took up his present business and now
welghs 220 pounds and is in vigorous health
The Court eays:

“While I have not overlooked the satisfying
experience of the defendant Reinhart, to whose |
pertinacity in handling manure is due his ea |
cape from the grave, I must exprese my con-
clusion to be in favor of the motion. Further- ;
more, the papers show strong probability of
the plaintiff's success in the action. With
the optimism to concede the benign effects
of the eMuvia, which but for the injunetion,
must envelope the plaintiff's hotel, a sojourn
in the place could be the result of choice only

~ , by persons deliberately seeking a cure sich
ia the daughter of Charles T, | as Came te Mr. Reinhart, but such heroism

cannot be looked for in the publie et large,
the plaintiff may rightfully
seek his pairons under norma! conditions.”

TESTING THE CIVIL SERVICE LAW,
A Rochester Case Which Will Decide a Point
of loterest to All Cities of the State.

Rocnes7Ter, Sept. 15.—City Treasurer Samuel
B. Williams's mandamus proceedings against
the local Civil Service Board will decide a point
of interest to all citles of the State. The action
is to compel the Civil Service Commissioners
to certify to the Treasurer all the names on
the eligible list for clerks, so that in filling a
vacancy in his office he can appoint any oneon
the list whom he desires, instead of being com-
Pelled to choose from the first three names
on the eligible list. The papers say that in May
last the Treasurer asked for a certification
from the clerks’ list to make two temporary
clerkship appointments. Three names were
on the general clerks’ eligible list and the firet
three names on the German clerks’ list were
certified to him. One man was temporarily
appointed from each list and the appointment
from the German list was afterward made
permanent. Mr. Williams wants to appoint a
man on the list below the firat three.

Attorney Keed to-day said that Mr. Williams
based his right to have the full list of names
certified to him as the result of the recent dee
cision of the Court of Appeals, which decla
the existing law regarding the certification
names t) an appointing power unconstitutional,
In 1883 a law was passed providing that when
4p appointing power asked for a certification
of names the first three names on the list should
be given him from which to choose. About
two years ago this law was changed so that
the Civil Service Board was only obliged to
certify the first name onthe eligible list, and the
appointing power was forced to name this man.

@ Court of Appeals recently decided that

; the law providing for one name was unconatle

tutional, ‘he Court said that it gave the a
Pointing power ho discretion whatever. Mr,
Nilliarns holds that as the law is declared void
there ie no law in existence in this State which
allows the Civil Service officials to limit thet
Certification to any number of names,

that therefore all the names on the clerks’ |
should be certified
