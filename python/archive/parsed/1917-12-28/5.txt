cease to be distinctly visible.

What, by the way, is to become of
that body, so long the censor of rail-
road morals, the arbiter of railroad
fortunes, the drag on railroad devel-
opment, the airbrake on railroad en-
terprise, the well meaning oppressor
of the railway stockholder and the
sirictly legal depressor of railway se
curities?

After sharp noon of this Friday
what are the esteemed gentlemen of
the Interstate Commerce Commis-
sion going to do to earn their de-
served salaries?

There will be no more suppression
of unlawful railway combinations to
be done, for the stroke of twelve will

the

member of the force on any subject he
wished to speak to me about, I wanted
to see him personally and not some
friend who might come to speak for
him. In fact, it was made clear to the
force that every member of it was ex-
pected to stand on his own record;
that a man need not expect that his
poor work could be made up for by the
influence of powerful friends; and that
if a man had a good record and was
trying to do his work as it should be
done, he needed no other recommenda-
tlon. The door was closed to people

who came to ask things as favors for |

policemen, but it was open wide to
policemen who came to ask things for
themselves.

This was the first essential
work of keeping politics out of the
police; of making the police under-
stand that nothing more was expected
of them except to do their plain,
straightforward duty just as well as
they could—but that this was expected
and ‘would be demanded of them. The

grosser manifestations of it which
take the form of crookedness and dis-
honesty, Hes in the unavoidable con-

In every way J have tried to make
