ZANGWILL'S DUTY IN

Writer Sends Greetings to

the
Menorah Convention,

Two letters from Israel Zangwill re-
Bretting that he could not attend their
sessions were read yesterday at the fifth
annual convention of the Intercollegiate
Menorah Society at Earl Hall, Columbia
University. The noted Jewish author
and lecturer writes that his work lies for
the present in England.

“Notwithstanding the dominant moral
and military work of America,” he writes,

“the centre of gravity of the world situ- |

ation, with all of its possibilities, still
lies here.”

In a second letter he refers to the
campaign against the Jews which is be-
ing made abroad.

“TL did ot realize when IT wrote to
you.” he vs, “how grave was the anti-

 

 

Semitic campaign which is looming here, |

A speech which T have just delivered at
Brighton seems to have done much good,
but my experience and the reverberation
this speech has obtained strengthens my
feelings that here is the spiritual battle
zone In which I am needed.”

The sessions were devoted to discus-
sions concerning the promotion of Jewish
culture in American and Canadian col-
leges,

Principals and Chorus Sing

Is Meritorious,

 

Tie annual performance of Handel's
“Messiah” by the Oratorlo Soclety took
place last evening in Carnegie Hall. For
years the organization has rested its
foundations upon this staple work, with-

pout which its activities speedily would

be curtailed, if not altogether ended, It
can be trusted to attract audiences of
sufficient size to make seasons of ora-
torio possible,

For this reason it is to be regretted
that there was some empty seats last
evening, as the performance was one of
merit, Walter Damrosch, who is once
again the conductor of the organization,

was fortunate tn obtaining four compe-
tent soloists. Mary Jordan, who was to
sing the contralto solos, was taken ill,
but there was an excellent substitute in
the person of Nevada Van der Veer, who
sang with beauty of Voice and com-
mendable style
Mabel Garrison

 

was heard to advan-

tage in the soprano music. Theodore
Karle, the tenor, sang with excellent
enunciation and with appreciation of

 

his music, while Henry Scott delivered
the bass recitatives and solos with splen-
did vigor and with perfect clarity of dic-
tion, The chorus sang well except in a
few troublesome spots and the Sym-
phony Society orchestra supplied a sub-
stantial instrumental background, with
the ald of Frank Sealy at the organ.
