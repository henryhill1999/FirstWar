GEN. SHARPE POWERLESS
He Tells Senate Committee

Many Functions of Depart-
ment Were Usurped.

 

Special Despatch to Tar Svs,
Wasuinaron, Dec, 27.--Merciless In-
terrogation of Major-Gen, Henry 4G,
Sharpe, Quartermaster-General of the
Army, by the Senate Committee on Mill-

tary) Affairs disclosed to-day new facts
in regard to the shortage of wiater
clothing for soldiers in camps and can-
tonments and augmented the growing
@uspicion that something has gone wiong
in the War Department.

Along with the disclosures of short-
ages both in the supply of overcoats and
woollen blouses fresh details with re-
spect to other delinquencies of the sup-
ply vepartments of the army were made,
Incidentally profiteering of the most
flagrant character was discovered among
Government contractors, near relatives
of high functionaries of the Council of
Natfonal Defence.

Major-Gen. Sharpe was almost pa-
thetic in his protests to the committee
that he could not carry every detail or
the vast supply contracts in his mind.
He promised the figures should be in
the hands of the committee Immediately
‘when Senator Hitchcock (Neb.) de-
‘nmrded to know when the contract for
the known army necessity of 2,000,000
overcoats had been let.

Demands a Direct Answer.

“When was this contract or these con-
‘tracts let?’ demanded Senator Hitch-
eock, but Gen. Sharpe did not answer
‘with sufficient directness to satisfy him.

“That doesn’t answer my question,”
snapped the Senator. “It wars yur
function to get those overcoats for the
,army. Now .when were the contracts
‘het?” i

Again Gen. Sharpe was uncertain. He
---@ould not regall, but promised be would
furnish the answers to all auch ques-
tions after consultation with department
eecords.

It transpired. in the later Aestimony
that the contracts were based on infor-
mation conveyed to the Quartermaster’s

w Department late in May, almost two

«..months. after the declaration of war,
when the size of the proposed American

.Mghting force had been determined. Ap-
parently it did not seem necessary to
the. civil officials of the War Depart-
ment to inform the military head of its
supply department that an army of
+1,600,000 men would have to be equipped ,
ntil May 28.

-men have been given, Gen. Sharpe sald, |
‘and.early next year it is expected to |
Rave on hand enough for 1,300,000.

6 Hie Fanctions Usurped,.

The Council of National Defence was
dragged into the investigation when Gen,
Sharpe admitted that the functions of
the Quartermaster-General’s department
literally had been usurped by the supply
committee of that organization, of which
Charles Eisenman is the head.

The testimony showed that the ehort-
age on overcoat contracts had been 48
per cent, delinquent on November 30,
Leggings contracts at the same date were
similarly behind, and even summer wear

§ contracts were behind and the contracts
h.. fee, woollen goods had been 48 per cent.
fay aaiilied.
” -The suspicious contract regarding
©. -which the committee expressed gravo
concern was one made by the supply
> committee of the Council of National De-
fence with the Huse Assorting Plant,
Inc., organized to sort wool scrap on
army contracts,

. The sorting. contract was let last Sep-
tember at the rate of 6 cents a pound for |
‘the sorting. Gen. Sharpe testified that |
‘the Quartermaster Corps made no inves-
i “tlgation of its own of the reasonableness

“ of the price,
‘
|

.

Contract Was Terminated.

i goq “Several weeks later," said, Gan
-Bharpe, ‘we looked into the matter a
discovered that 2 cents a pound would

have left a generous margin of) profit,
and the Government decided to termiinare,
the contract,

“Do you believe any one directly hs
terested in that contract had anything to |
do with letting it?” was asked of Gen,
Sharpe

e No." saidithe Quartermaster-Gener: al,

“If you had known that the brother or
other near relattve of a member of the;

‘benecern, and that it was organized for
the specific purpose of doing this work at
@ profit of from 200 to 300 per cent.,
would you have let the contract?” Gen,
Sharpe was asked.

» ‘Assurediy not,” sald he,
. The resolution adopted yesterday by
the committee in whith it was said to
} the Secretary of War that in the opin-
Jon of the committee-the critical situa-
tion of the moment demanded a relif-
auishment of the policy of red tape an-
Aanglementsa and direct dealing with a
raye situation has net vet been replied
o by the Secretary of War. Gen. Sharpe
jwas questioned on thie point. He ad-
mitted that his only source of informa-
tion on the subject of the resolution had
been the newspapers. He sald the Sec-
‘retary of War had not yet advised him
wf any change in policy in regard to

i

> the official routine,

| . Gen. Goethals Takes Charge.
“What steps have you taken in re-

‘pponse to the rmexolution which this com-

mittee adopted yesterday?’ asked Sen-

ator McKellar (Tennessee), was the
‘way in which the subject was brought
u

 

ee

Dp. ‘

“T haven't been informed of it,’ an-
swered Gen, Sharpe.

“The Secretary of War has not
brought it to your attention?” demanded
Senator McKellar.

“No, sir. Major-Gen. Goethais has
taken charge of the office,” answered the
witness,

The conclusive result of the inqulsi-
tion of Gen. Sharpe gave the committee
the Impression that there had been a

tween the Council of National Defence
and the Quartermaster's Department,
which in view of the fact that the func-
tions of the two organizations
most intimately
the least unfortunate, and in view of
the results in deficiency of supply of
crying necessities in the last degree de-
plorable.

Sharp criticism for the shortage of
winter overcoats was made by the Sen-
ators, who declared orders for clothing
were not followed up to insure de-
liveries. Gen, Sharpe gaid he had the
information In the fllea, but could not
recollect the detatls,

‘It isn't a question of details,” said
Genator McKellar. “It's a question of
coats, Thousands of men are without
them, Why is it?”

 

liveries was largely the cause.

“You practically bkurrendered your
power over contracts to the Council of
National Defence, didn't yuu, except that
; you bad a rapresentative meeting wi
vr ‘ the board’” asked Senator Chamberlain.

Gen, $4 arpe anewered in the alflema-
tive, nid explained that the council had
—methhig to ao with taking uniforms, but

 

 

(only with getting cloth for their manu.
facture.

Gen; Sharpe sald manufacturing con-
tracts were placed !n sufficient time for ,
making of clothing, but that delayed de-
liveries held up the clothing manufac.
turers, ’

Tracing the causes for delay in get-
ting clothing to the troops,
Frelinghuysen asserted it was due in

|part to changes in eloth specifications,

\ hear,

resulting from a conflict of authority be-
tween the wuartermaster-General and
the Council of National Defence.

Practically every contract for over-
coata was delayed, Gen. Sharpe said, by
trouble in getting cloth and by strikes in
the clothing factories. The decision to
send forces to France sooner than ex-
pected waa another cause,

Senator Weeks brought out that Bos-
ton woo! dealers early in the war offered
wool supplies to the War Department.

“Was anything done?” he asked.

“Not ther,” Gen. Sharpe answered.
“Later I think the Council of National
Defence took up the matter.”

Questions relating to cantonment con-
struction contracts were asked by the
committee, but Gen. Sharpe sald all con-
tonment matter had been handled by
Gen. Littell. The latter and his assist-
ants, including Major Sterrett, are to be
called soon,

To-morrow the committee expects to
