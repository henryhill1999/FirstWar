VALUE OF POLAR RESEARCH

olony Nor THE SOLE REWARD OF
AncTIC EXPLORATION.

 

Discoveries of Great Importance to Mankind
Made io the Past-Probiems of Solence to
He Solved To-day Within the Polar Zones
~Cost aad Domaerr Much Exaggerated,

Copyright, 1000, by F. A Cook.

The true aim of legitimate polar explora-
tion is not, as it is popularly supposed, to reach
the north or the south pole, but to seoure
knowledge concerning the regions within the
polar zones, There laa blank space of about
three million square miles around the northern
axis, and another of about eight million square
miles around the southern pivot. We thus have
at the two poles an unknown area equal to the
combined spread of North America and Eu-
fope. Ip this region there would be room for
two hundred countries as large aa the State of
New York, and then there would still be space
for the British Isles, Germany, France and
Bpain. In e region of such incomprehensible
extent ts there not the prospect of material
discoveries of interest and value to mankind?
In the dawn of the new century of boasted
progress and enlightenment ts it not @ oon-
fossion of regrettable darkness to find that an
area equal to one-quarter of the entire known
land surface of the globe ts still a blank upon
our charts?

1t {s the habit of many people to decry the
efforts of polar explorers as being barren of
results comparable to the expenditures of life
and time and money, Fortunately for the prog-
ress of terrestrial knowledge, thease oom-
plainers are the men who measure everything
by dollars and cents, and such men seldom
pernetrate far enough into the records of ex-
ploration to find the far-reaching effect.

The result of polar exploration tn the past
has been productive of great results, but these
results enter so naturally into the development
of commeroe and the various branches of na-
tural sciences that, like the contributory waters
of a river, the original source ts lost in the new
@tream. To see the ultimate une of the re-
gulte of research within the frigid zones is,
at first glance, dificult; but a brief analysis
of the outoome of work of the past will indicate
the complex but important usefulness. Early
voyages into the fronen seas were directed

nly by ambitions to conquer new lands for
Soramparcial muurposes. From thojr efforts it
now follows that we have a knowledge of Alaska
with ita limitless gold, of the great Northwest
erritory, and, indeed, all of British North
merica, with its known wealth of furs and
ta unknown beda of minerals, and of Spitzen-
rgen and much of Siberia 8 a rosult of
the work of these forgotten explorers we have
developed a Sealing industry, a fur trade and
a whale fishery, which have brought a wealth
f billions of dollars to hardy adventurers,
t ia true that in thie work lives have been lost
and much money has been spent, but the in-
vosatment has pald a profit, not to the pioneers,
but to the succeed! generations, many hun-
dred times greater than the original outlay.
The alm of modern polar effort is not, how-
ever, to diseover a new passage to reach the
profitable trade of the Orient, or to find new
avenues for the development of commercial
nterprises It ta to gather information, the
fetter to understand the conditions of the earth,
not only within the Arctic circle, but at the
equator, or in our own lovality as well. To
attenipt to study the natural history of the globe
without a apecitic knowledge of the two polar
areas is like attempting to study the physiology
of the human svstem without a knowledga of
the cirenlation. It i¢ no more possible to under-
atand the physics of the regions tn which we
live without a better knowledge of the polar
unknown, than it is to understand the function
of the stomach without a clear conception of
the influence of the brain upon It e must

he science of forecasting weather is Still in

thousands of lives and millions of dollars. We
cannot hope to find the origin and destiny of
storms and cold waves, and a hundred other
weather peou'iarities ‘until the atmospheric
conditions, the terrestrial topography, and
the interchange of air and sea currenta are
carefully noted at the pole. In gevlogy and
in meteorol there is much to be gained by
oontinuation o olar exploration. The

orthern magnetic pole has been approximately
ocated by Ross, but it moves, and needs a re-

the report that he has located the south mag-
netic pole, but this has been done before him
by four other expeditions, and still, if we draw
a circle with a diameter of 600 miles on the
etill unknown Victoria land, it will only be
osaible to say that the pole is within this cirole,

ack what is the dividend cf this costly search
of ages? Without a consideration «f the other

roducts of polar work we can say that properly
& equip the sea cantain and the lond surveyor
will save future life and property, which will
fepay every outlay

What {« true of geology and meteorology
and magnetism ia equally true of the other
departments of science. The polar fauna and
flora have an all-important hearing upon tho
early life of the wlohe. If we would under-
stand the life following the glacial period we
must go to the poles to study the penguin, the
geal, the musk ox, the icebear, the reindeer
andthe whale. If we will gain a true knowledge
of primitive man we must seek the Eskimo, who
fs just emerging from the stone age. Every
phenomena of the clobe, every speck of life
and every sheet of earth is intimately related
to some other part of the globe The world

ust be studied as a whole, because each region
nfluences surrounding areas and indirectly
regions far away. If there remain larice blank

maces as these at th» poles, the home lands and
ife and conditions cannot be understood as is
necessary from a scientific point of view

The habit of condemning the work of polar
expeditions because of the cost of money and
time and life is a relic of selfish, narrow-minded
barbarism. It is the spirit of the man who
geeks only immediate personal cain and has
no thoudht of the future or of the enlightenment
of posterity, It is the motive of the Indian
who seeks day after day to supply only the
wants of his stomach But let us look more
deeply into this criticism Is the loss of life
or the expenditure of money so great as is popu-
larly supposed”

From 1848 to 184, the most active period of
Aretic research, there were 52) British seamen
engaged in the servi A calculation of the
total time occupied by these men would be
represented by 1,878 men in constant service,
Of these various English parties there were
thirty-two deaths, which would make an annual

reentage of 12 From this it will be seen
hat polar explorers do not suffer a greater
mortality than stay-at-home people in various
cities. The ordinary risk by climate and disease
fs rather decreased than increased among polar
workers, In the modern expeditions of Peary
and Nansen there has not been a single dearth
rom disease and only one from an accident.

n the voyage of the Belgica there was but one
death by an accidental fall and another from
@ disease previously contracted. With our
present knowledge of hygiene and with an in-
creased polar experience there is no need of
future calamities

The mistakes and failures of the past are
remembered, but it is forgotten that by these
mishaps we are to-day able to profit and so
plan expeditions that there is a reasonable

are the stepping stones to future success,
