ESTATE NEWS.

The real estate situation remained un-
changed during the week. Indeed, no marked
development of aotivity {la expected in a
Presidential year until after election, although
some recovery from the present condition
will be seasonable about the beginning of
October. The score or so of brokerage trans-
actions reported were of a commonplace char-
acter, possessing only local importance and
affocting only the several parties in interest,
The week's budget of private and public sales
calls for no observations that have not al-
ready been made on recent occasions

A suggestive theme, however, ts found tn
the announcement that the contract for paving
Sixth avenue with asphalt from Twenty-third
to Thirty-third street has been formally ratl-
fled. The abatement of the noise Incident to
heavy traffic on a stone pavement will no
doubt hasten the transformation of this sec-
tion of the avenue into a shopping centre
similar to the section between Fourteenth
and Twenty-third streets. The half-mile
north of Twenty-third etreet possesses every
requirement of ferry and ratiway connections,
and is contiguous to the district which houses
the better part of the city’s hotel and apart-
ment hotel population

How completely the avenue below Twenty-
third street is occupled by the existing shop-
ping trade appears from the paucity of transfers
and the high rental and fee valucs that obtain
At the partition sale of the Pell estate In April,
No. 300 Sixth avenue, at the northwest corner
of Twenty-first street, brought the extreordinary
price of $173,600. The property consisting
of a lot 34.8285, covered with antiquated bulld-
ings that are now being replaced by a new
structure, commanded arenta! of $4,900. Ina five-
year lease of the four-story building, on an ine
side jot 27. 1x05, at No.344 recorded this spring,
the rental graduates form $7,000 to $7,500, Since
1890 not more than ten transfers, counting the
Rlegel-Cooper block as one conveyance, have
been recorded affecting the avenue between
Fourteenth and Twenty-third streets. The
southwest corner of Twenty-third street, 26.0
x00, with a five-story building, was sold in 1507
for $870,009.

On the other hand, the four-story building,
with a lot 20x100, at Nu. 401, on the west side
of the avenue, between Twenty-fourth and
Twenty-@fth ‘streeta, was sold in June at
$00,250. According to the ecale of rents which
obtains in the block, the property would com-
mand from $3,000 to $3,500 a year. In con-
trasting this acale with the rentals cited be-
low Twenty-third street, it must be noted
that the west side of the avenue is far more
valuable than the east, the difference for the
block between Twenty-fourth and Twenty-
fifth streeta amounting to about $10,000 in the
fee of value ofa lot, Roughiy speaking, below
Twenty-third street a lot on the west side of
the avenue ts worth about $20,000 more tban
one on the east. Similarly lots on the south
side of Twenty-third street, between Fifth
and Sixth avenues, are quoted at about 40,000
more than those on the north side,

The scarcity and cost of large elites, whether
leasehold or freehold in the avenue below
Twenty-third street, have reached a point
which suggests an early extension of the shop-
ping trade. The northward movement would be
facilitated if the police could be induced to
banish during the day, at least, tho Tenderloin
element which infesta the section, The ex-
pectant attitude of owneis with regard to the
development of the avenue is shown by the
fact that some holders of large parcela deem it
expedient to give only monthly leases.

No. 61 East Sixty-fourth atreet, a four-story
brow nstone dwelling, on a lot 14.3x70.5, bas been
sold by Collins & Collins for the estate of Laura
M. Watkinson.

No, 311 West Elghty-ninth street, a three-
story dwelling, 20x55x19, has been sold by
Jease C. Bennett & Co. to George C. Heilner
