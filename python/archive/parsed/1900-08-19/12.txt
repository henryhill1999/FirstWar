signanos, the Newark police allege, have been
circumventing the authorities of the Erie Rail-
road, and at the same time violating the laws
of New Jersey concerning the transport of
combustibles, by sending fireworks to this
city packed in trunks as lLawgage. One of
the trunks exploded a week ago in Trenton,

back. And things that they'd sent out and got
