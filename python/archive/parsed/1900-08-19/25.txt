Bay Heap, N J, Alle. 18 The house-boat
studio of Gerard Rutgers flardenbergh, the
artist, may for the present almost be sald to
have joined the colony of cottagers here, He

has drawn It up between the sedgy banks of a

tiny little Inlet to Barnegat Bay, not far from

about fills the narrow Inlet in which she {a lald
ep. A little bridge connects her deck with the
driveway that leads down to the boat landing;
and when you once get aboard and take a peep
into her snug little ground floor, or rather water
floor, apartinent you are notata loss to under-
stand why Mr. Hardenbergh describes it as by
all odds the most delightful studio he ever had,

To the south and east you may look out over
the waters of the Bay rippling away to the sand
dunes just beyond which, and only a few hun-
dred yards distant, is the thrashing surf of the
broad Atlantic, ‘To the weat is a sedgy reach
of salt meadow grass and waving bulrushes,
spreading away to the dark fringe of pine and
cedar forest which is always the final and rather
melancholy note in all the shoreward landscapes
down on this part of the Jersey coast, Breezes
from sea and bay rustle the curtains at the
windows and fill the little apartment
with refreshing air straight from off the brine.
In this house-boat apartment Mr. Hardenbergh
has done all his work during the pastyear, The
walla of hils floating studio are covered, and the
tables heaped high, with his productions
water-colors that reflect all shades of Barnegat
Bay's calm and somewhat sad cast of acenery,
But the artist's best work is in his paintings
from life of all the many varieties of birds and
water fowls that haunt the bay. fis studies of
thiskind have won him no little fame, and he bas
not disdained to bring his art Into the com-
meretal fleld when there were inducements
sufficient The Havilands have worked many
of the game-bird pictures he bas made for them
{nto their dainty porcelains

All about him are his models models that he
shot and mounted himself, for he isa taxidermist
as wellasapainter, He has splendid specinens
of the great blue heron three of them in all
that he brought down only a short distance
below where the Pelican ts now tledup, Then
there Is a monster snowy owl, shot a few miles
inland: a fine wild goose, too, he has-the great
Canada gooee which comes here every fall,
flying in great V-shaped wedges and warning
the bay-men by {ts hoarse honk, honk, high in
air, that the hunting season ts near at hand, and
that the gunners from the city will soon be
down to fill the places that the hot weather
refugees from town have left vacant. To give
@ list of all the birds Mr. Hardenbergh has
perched about in his house-boat studio would
be about the same as making a catalogue of all
the feathered tribes that haunt the dark waters
of Barnegat. And that would be a long task—
&@ weary task

Pretty much every migratory bird that goes
southward in autumn and northward in apring
gives Barnegat a call. For fifty years it has
been a paradise for hunters, Old Bill Chad-
wick, tn his hotel on the sand neck about etght
milas below Bay Head, has his old registers
containing the names of scores of men famous
in New York and, indeed, throughout the coun-
try, who were guest# at the old tavern in their

time and sat around its blaving pine stump
fires on sharp Novemier tights compering
notes on this and that shot of the day's spor
and planning th sport of the day that was
to begin as soul as the heaving sea, which they
could hear thundering on the sands a few rods
off, began to put on the first cold, slaty glint
of dawn. dist as likely as not the sturdy
old bucks had a glass of hot Jersey apple
ack and & pipe over their yarns as they sat

fore old Uncle Bill's snapping fire. History
has afforded instances of euch @ thing hap-

the railroads and the cottages have not wrought
@ny very great change in the general aspect
of things. There is still the stark, bleak tum-
ble of the sand dunes with the surf crashing
at their feet. ‘The dark waters of the bay

some seasons when the fish do not min as well

The tenor question is evidently no nearer solu-
tion than it was six months ago, when It looked
as if the season of opera at Covent Garden
might produce some singers worthy to take
a place tn the company at the Metropolitan,
MM. Bonet, Slezak and de la Tour, who had
never been heard there, were thought to be
possibilities of the next New York season and
{n the present scarcity of tenors there waa
encouragement in the idea. M. de la Tour
waa indeed under contract to the Maurtoe Grau
Opera Company, although it now seems uncer-
tain whether or not be {s to be heard here.
Tn any case,his appearances here will not be made
under the circumstances originally expected.
fle isto not replace M. Van Dyck, for that artist
returns to sing the limited répertoire in which
he bas been heard here for the past two eea-
son M. de la Tour's London experiences
led Mr. Grau to reéngage M. Van Dyck rather
than rely on any possibility of M. de la Tour's
success here. This was after the London sma-
son had given a fair idew of his capabilities,
Leo Slezak, the young Polish tenor, made no
impression whatever. Dr. Loewe of Breslau,
to whose company he belongs, said that his
vocw education was to be carefully looked
after. But it was not found in London that
he showed any evidence of proper teaching
or any probability of becoming in any way
euperior to the average run of Gérman singers
Lut he is now only 2 {ae old and M. Slezak
may one day become the tenor of the future.
M. Carlsen, another German tenor, felt him-
self so far below the standard which even Lon-
don required that he returned to his home
after one appearance as TannAgueer. H
was never heard of again during the rest o
the season and, of course, much less to

voice and singing were highly praised,
though his acting was declared to be conven-

tional and usual to the highest degree. Lon-
don estimates of singers are not In the least
decisive. Mediocrities prosper there, while
some singers who have fousd most favor else
where make litue or no impression. M. Bonei
may be even more interesting as an artist
than the somewhat self-contained Londo

praise indicated. M. de Lucta was in such

vocal condition that he cancelled his contract
for the United States and {s to retire from the
stage for a while in the hope of recovering
his former powers, which were never remark-
able at any time. He only helped the tenor
question toward solution by eliminating him-
self. Ernst Krause, who ls well known here
from his appearances in German opera, was
received with scant favor because he singing
has falled to possess little delicacy or art. He

Embarrassment of a Young Woman Whose
Brother Played the Races.

HIS

Among the young people who attended an
evening sociable at a well-known New Jersey
seashore resort the other evening wasa young
woman from this city visiting friends at the
place. She is an expert on the piano and
her friends had arranged the affair pur-
posely to give her a chance to show her ac-
complishments, In the letter that was sent
inviting her to spend a couple of weeks at the
place she was asked especially to bring her
own music with her, as everybody at the re-
sort was “just dying” to hear her play. When
she arrived and her trunk was unpacked one
of the first articles that came to view waa
a dark leather musicroll that bulaed out. Her
friends clapped their hands in delight in antio-
ipation of the great musical treat in store.

They wanted her to try some of it right away
but the girl pleaded fatigue, and with visita
and recetving callers the Mme was well taken
up until the evening of the sociable.

After going through the formalities of being
{ntroduced the visitor was finally asked by the
hostess to play something The big bulging

musie roll was produced and the girl went to
the piano accompanied by the inevitable youn
man to “turn” ‘Twirling the stool sround
until it reached a height to suit her the girl
seated herself and placing the music roll in her
lap, unfastened the strap. It required sev-
eral turns of the rol) to disclose the contents,
but when it fnally was opened and spread out
a lot of newspaper clippings dropped out and
fe]| to the floor

The young tnan who had volunteered to do
the “turnin hastily stooped and gathered
them up while the girl looked on ina perplexed
way, but this look gave way (o one of morti-
fication when he handed her the clippings and
ehe saw that they were something relating to
horse races. She stammered that there must
be some mistake and that she had not received
her own musie roll, but she was convinced that
no mistake had been made when her own frienda
assured her that it waa the same one she had
brought with her. Many of those present hy
this time had gathered around the embar-
rassed girl, plying her with all sorte of ques.
tious, until finally one young man, who had
picked up the roll and was examining Its con-
tents, called out

“Why, this is dope.’

“dope” explained that the dope he referred to
was but horse racing dope, or, in other words, a
record of the races, This statement straight-
ened things out a bit, but he made a hig hit
with the owner of the music roll and her friends
when he asked her if ashe hada brother. Upon
receiving ap answer in the affirmative he re-
marked that of course that explained the whole
thing, for probably the brother played the
races and had put the “dope’ in the musie roll
by mistake.

When the girl returued home the first one of
t!e family to greet her was her brother. Her

asked her what was up she snapped at him:

JIM WOULD RUN TO FIRES,

A Retired Fire Department Horse That Made
Things Lively for His New Driver,

Jim is the name of an iron-gray horse who
up to a short time ago was attached to one of
the uptown fire houses, Like many other fire
horses that have served faithfully in the Fire
Department, Jim reached a time when he had
to go. When they were making up the list
of horses to be sold at auction last June, Jim

was on the list, When Jim was put up it was
thought that he would make a good truck
horee, A tall, thin man who attends all auction
sales of horses opened the bidding with «4
twenty-dollar bid. Jim's priee was soon up to
ry and a Harlem contractor raised his price
0 $58 and got him

About two weeks after Jim was hitched up
to a cart and hauling dirt to a new building
Jim and his driver were eating their noonday
meals under a big shady tree on upper Broad-
way, when the driver noticed that Jim had
ricked up his ears and was looking around
n wonderment. The driver suspecting tha
somet! ng was wrong got up on the seat ree

turped the corner. Jim thinking that he was
attac to a fire engine instead of @ dirt cart
started after the engine as fast as he couid

Raine place as the fire engines. The alarm
was a false one and this fact deprived Jim of

The rest of the programme is as good as ever,
Some changes will be made, and many pon-
ular entertajners retained. The threa Yow
earys, fugglere and acrobats, who were im-
nortad. by Oscar Hammerstein, are marvellous
in thelr tumbling, and truly comioal at the
same time. One looks like Peter Daller, and
has a ruanner of funmaking very much like
that comedian
