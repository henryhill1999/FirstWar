One of the earliest diacoverins of the investi-

had no jess inan three

distinct “sormauagmoulsta re

the memory of her glorious ava'‘ars of old, and

becomes acain for the moment Hindoo Pr.ncess ,

or Queen of France.
Hor third “romenmo’' is the most remark ble
ofall. Through her astonishing mediumistic

faculties she has ertered in o relations with the |

people and affairs of the planet Mars, aud has

professed to unved its mysteries, tnaking use |

at times of alangusee which was quite un-
known to experts. She had no gift for lan- |
guages herself, detesting the study of them,
though her father spoke Hungarian, Ger-
map, French, Ital.an and Spanish and under-
stood Enuwlish fairly well From an early age
Mile Smi.b was given ts day dreams, This was
partly the result of diasalisfaction with her
environment. In speaking of a dream in
which an fsolated house fizured she sald on one
occasion: “To me this retired mansion, in
which I lived alone, folated, represents my
life, which from mv infavcy has been neither
bappy nor gay. F.ven while very young I do
not remmember to have shared any of the tastes
or any of the ideas of the members of my
family.

makeup my mind te marry, although I had
several opportuni lies, A voloe was always
saying, ‘Do not burry; the time bas not ar-
rived; this is not the destiny for which you are
reserved.’ Anal have listened to that voice,

which has abs luiely nothing to do with oon- |

acieno*, and 1 do net regret it, for since | have
engaged tn sptritiam I have found myself soe
surrounded wit’ sympathies and friendships
that I have somewhat forgotten my sad lot.”

In the winter o 1891-42? Mile. Smith became
interested im epiritiem and jelred a creole of
persons who were interested In antomatio writ
ing. After a short time she began to show
powers much greater and more striking than
thoee of her associates.

The following isa gummary of the two first
seances held in this new eo vironment:

“March 26, 1892.—Fleven per-ons around a
large and heavy dining table of oak wit) two
leaves. The table is set in motion, and several
epi its come and give their name- (by raps),
and testify to the pleasure it gives them to find
themae) yee among us. It ts atthis seance that
Mile. Smith begina to distipguls!) \aguo gleams
with long white streamers movinw from the
floor to the eviling, and then a magnifioen! estar,
which in the darkness appears to her alone

throughout the whole of the secnos, We aucur |

from thle thatshe will end by seeing things
more distincty and will poasess the @ift of
dairvoyance.

“April 1—Vielent movements of the tabla,
due to a spirit who calle himself David and
announces himself as the spiritual guide of
the group. Then he gives way to another
spirit whe say he is Victor Hugo, and the
guide and protector of Mile. Smith, who ts

‘very much surprised te be assisted by a person |

ef soch importance, He soon disappears.
Mile. Smith le very much agitated; she has fits of |
ahivering, {s very cold. She is very reetiens
and aces suddenly, balancing Itself above the
table, a grinning, very lll-farored face, with
jong red hair, She is eo frightened that she
demands that the lights be lit. She is calmed
and reassured, The figure disaprears. After
ward she sees & magnificent bonquet of reses
of different hues being placed on the table
before one of the eitters, M. P. All at once
she sees @ smal) snake come out from under-
neath the bouquet, which, crawling quickly,
perceives the flowers, looks at them, tries to
reach the hand of M. P., withdrawe for an tin
stant, comes back slowly, and disappears tn
the tureertor of the bouquet. Then all is die
solved and three raps are given on the tabie.
