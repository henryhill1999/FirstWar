TWO WOMEN’S NOVEL FIELD

THEY FIND PROSPERITY WHERE A
MAN HAD MET WITH FAILURE,

A Railroad Restaurant on New and Successfal
Lines—Ambitions of the Young Queen of
Italy—Women’s Beauty in Bathing Salts

The Chinese Women’s Rules of Mte.

Two women who had to support themselves
felt that the task would be easter if they could
work together As they were not fitted to
be teachers in these days of exacting higher
education and had no adaptability for millinery
and dressinaking beyond the ability to wear
their own clothes well after they had selec ted
them with taste, the occupation of making
clothes and hats for their friends was itmn-
possible, They thought of a violet farm and
decided that there was too little seriousness
about that, shuddered at ths task of trying
to erowd boarders Into thelr small bome and
dreaded the reaponsibillty of renting a larger
house that would make the business profitable,
A restaurant In the emart town they lived In
would have impossible, although for
various reasons it appealed to them, They
could go away and leave it at ni@ht and not
hawe its presence a constant reminder that
they were at work In thele fondness for this
idea they devoted more thought to the res-
tuurant scheme than to any other. Confident
that a way ean usually be found, thes tried
every possible means of combining the keep-
ing of arestaurant with residence In a suburban
town where such an establishment would have
been and doomed to bankruptcy.
They were determined women, however, In-
tent on carrying through their plan and com-
pellad moreover by necessity to do something
of the kind,

Finally an idea that seemed poasible of
execution occurred to onoof them. The rall-
road station of the small town tn which they
lived was the centre of several oonneoting
branches of the road. Many persons changed
cara there for points reached by the small
branch lines that ran in various directions.
For that reason this station was of much more
importance than the size of the town would
ordinarily have caused Its businesslike
character was proved by {ts possession of a
which {4 rare enough tn

who kept if was satisfied with the degree of

for thern,

If any hedy ever meets with an ideal rafirend
reetaurant in a neighboring State, it will in all
probability be this one, for a second never
existed, One of the partners recently mar-
ried at the end of their third wear of business,
but her agsoclate carries it on as successfully
asever, They began by making the place neaf,
which wae the least ex pensive of their improve-
mente, although none of these made thelr way
of conducting the place any more costly than
thelr predecessors had been, Two maids in
appropriate dreas supplanted the slovenly men
formerly ino attendance All of the pastries
came from the home of one of the two women,
where a cook wie engaged for a certain. time
every day preparing the articles needed at the
restaurant. In addition to bread, this included
the cold meats. The articles prepared on the
emall stove in the restaurant were only those
that required to be served immediately. The
table service wae eerupulously clean and the
rlaes enclosure of the restaurant was ehiny tn
ts polish

The inorease {n business was immediate.
During the firet month the gain was 25 per cent,,
and at the end of a vear five times as much
business as the preceeding proprietor had ever
known was coming to these two enterprieing
young women. One of them was always in the
restaurant during the day time. It elosed at
9 o'clock In the evering,and In the early evening
hours one ot the maids took charge of the bus-
iness, The two women round that they could
support themeeives well on thelr profits. The
railrond people were delichted at the redemp-
tion of the place, thereby exhibiting an un-
uspected regard for the comfort of thelr pa-
trons, As tfevery difculty were to be removed
from thetr path, the former proprietor o1 the
place opened a restaurant acrons the way and
sueceseded In attracting te it just
patronage which had made them feartul of thetr
