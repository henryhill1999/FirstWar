cribed as
shrinking gate receipts and the prospective
reduction of salaries next year.

to the Inevitable result and also to
sral public demand, the magnates have
move to suppress disorder on the
thin season. They have overlooked
several cases of assault, notably Doyle's mix-up
re Emsiie and the more recent rough-

 

wit
and-tuml feht at St. Louis between Wol-
yerton and MeGann. There has been no con-
ceried effort on the part of the magnates to
keep the players In check. The bad faith of

the magnates who signed an ironclad agree-
pent at St. Louls in 1898 to suppress kicking
against decisions of umptres, whether right
wrong, las not been forgotten. The lack

eo
backbone on the part of the club owners

o!
wheu they broke this agreement and suld that
{t wus impossible to live up to it is still fresh
in the tainds of the public, The violent op-
position of certain club owners to fearless

Guipires like Thomas J. Lynch and Timothy
tiurst, who have always satisfied crowds by
their honesty, possibly caused some wonder
and also created a feeling of distrust among
those who were in doubt as to the squareness
of professional games

Taken all in all, therefore, the public bas
tired of baseball, especially in this city, be-
cuuse the magnates have failed utterly to keep
faith, and the players have been permitted to
run riot, If the magnates do not check the
players and the umpires are afraid of the mag-
bates, who will? By what ageot can the play-
ers be induced to heed the demands of the =
bail public?

The Protective Association of Professional
Baseball Players is a name that might mean
mich, If this body of men can be made to see
that the best protection to be secured is the
restoration of baseball in the public’s favor,
@ome real good may come of the movement
fustead of a grand mix ip in which the game
will be further injured and the business go
to the dogs. (an the Protective Association
oO! Professional Baseball Players meet the pop-
ular demand for (he suppression of kicking and
thugisu: which has been persistently ignored
p the National League magnates? If It can,

axball will receive a benefit that the mag-
bates have refused to permit the game to en-
jo). The President of the Protective Associa-
tion is Charles Zimmer, catcher of the Pitts
burg club and one of the “gentlemen” of the
ofession. Zimmer has never been a rowdy

li player, though for years he was associated
With Tebeau on the Cleveland team. Harry
Taylor, the attorney of the association, was
ouce first baseman of the Louisville and Balti-
more clubs, and at that time he was a credit to
baseball because of his olean playing and
sportsmaniike behavior, The secretary of the
association is Hugh Jennings of the champion
Brookiyos, who used to be a chronic kicker, but
nowadays believes that rowdyism must go.

Cannot Zimmer Jennings and Taylor put
@ pink in ths platform of the Protective Asso-
elation to the effect that it must be the duty of
every member to refrain from hoodlumism
and from questioning the umpires in any way:
also that the association is anxious to aatialy
the public demand, especially as the League
has remained obdurate? When the Protective
A was first organized the players
hat one of the benefits to be derived would
be the existence of friendlier feeli among
the men and a consequent absence of foul tac-
ti + on the teld such as spiking or in other ways
atiempting to injure opponents,

Ne wil feel more like brothers,” one of the
Players said to Tae Stn man, “and you will
very few cases where one player purposely

 

tries to injure another. Being members of
tis associatin will bind the boys so solidly
together that they will not feet like adopting
tactics indicative of bad blood and Ul feeling!”

Quve true! But if the players are to become
Bere friendly. why is it not possible for them
fo become more friendly toward the umpire—
the man roost abused and constantly subjected
fo insults. The plavers know better than any-
body that if thes let an wmpire alone the public

THE CONTEST OF WITS WHILE THE
BETTING GOES ON,

 

Methods of Judging the Strength of the
Other Man's Hand-A Point About Which
Players Are Apt to Be Lax~Ways of Deal-
ing With a Koown Bluffer—Trials of Nerve.

It is a compatatively simple thing to learn
the game of poker wel enough to play it, if
such a thing were possible, in the absence of
opponents. That Ia, the theoretical play, based
upon the rules of the game, the doctrine of
chances and the ‘cards in one’s own hand, is
easily enough mastered, so that the player
will have no dificulty formulating his own
course of action at any time when he happens
to have the first say after the draw. But,
although this knowledge {s essential to an
understanding of the game, it {s of Little prac-
tical value unless {tis supplemented with an
understanding of the play of others. At the
very outset of the play there begins a struggle
between opposing wits, {n which each player
{s compelled to watch the tactles of his oppon-
ents with as close attention as a swordsman
has to pay to the motions of his antagonist
{on a duel,

Because of this antagoniam, in which the
sole end to be attained is an opinion as to the
probable strength of the other man’s cards,
{t is of prime importance to observe as closely
as possible the habit of every man’s play, and
{t is aleo important, perhaps equally so, to
conceal one’s own habit. Because of this it
should be remembered that it {s bad play to
show any hand unless the rules of the game re-
quire it to be shown, and it is also bad play
not to insist on seeing each hand which the
rules require to be displayed.

This ts a point on which even experienced play-
ers are apt to be lax. Nothing fs more common
than to see hands shown down which have not
been called, and to hear this play and that
criticised and discussed when the player was
not obliged to reveal the line of reasoning which
he adopted. Whenever that is done the player
who has shown his cards contributes to the
benefit of hisopponents by telling them in
effect just what his line of play has been on
one occasion, andso enabling them to judge
of what {t is likely to be at some other time.
The rule fs simple and explicit. The hand of
each man who {a in at the time of the call rust
be laid on the table face up, so that each person
in the game may seo what each man has seen
fit to play on. But nohand which a player

refuses to back to the extent of a call need be
poee. nor ia it required to show the winner's
and unless he be called.

It is therefore loose play to show even a
phenomenally good hand, such as might sur-
prise the party, when it has won a pot without
@ call, Still worse is it to show a
worthless hand = after the player has
successfully bluffed on it. It only serves
as a guide to one’s opponents On the
other hand, it {is very cominon to hear
a player, after the call, when his opponent
has declared his hand, say, “That's good,”
and throw his hand, face down, in the discard
pile. This will never be allowed by good players,
who havea night under the rules to Know whether

e has been bluffing or has been guilty of bad
udgment in backing a hand too heavily for
ta actual ¢trength, The man who does not
insist on all his rights at the poker table is ex-
tremely likely to have them ignored.

The importance of seeing all calied hands,
Hea in the o portunity, given by the dieplay,
of judging of the bavits of other men's play.
When you know that a player is in the habit
for example, of holding an extra card when
drawing, you may often judge of your
chances YY drawing agalnst him. better than
you could otherwise. ne trick of play is com-
mon with many players, of standin pat on
an incomplete hand, such as two pairs, or a
very weak hand, such as a@ pair of jacks after
ppeaing a jackpot. The object, of course,
{s to give one's opponents the notion that the
player has at least a straight, and an opponent
who believed that would, of course, throw down
three aces or an thing lease, without even a call.
f he knew tha’ che opener was a habitual bluffer
ne would call on a comparatively emall hand.

An example of how this knowledge of a man’s
game hele his opponents is given in
a certain play which haa been de-
scribed heretofore. The gamesters who
believe in {t will invariably raise before the
draw if they chance to havea pair of jacks or
better and to sit in the age seat, or next to it
on the right. This is a rule of play that has
decided merit, and will win many pots if prop-
erly backed by subsequent play, but there
{s a counter to it squally oon which will
eee “ money in many cases for him who
plave it.

Lat it be supposed that there are six playing
and that A has the deal. B has anted and ¢,
D, E, and F have comein. A,having two jacks,
raises the limit. Iftheothers do not kuow his
lay, they may not improbably all drop out,
hus giving him @ small winning, it is true,
but an easy one On a small hand. But if tt be
known that A is in the habit of raising thus
on # comparatively small hand, the others will
be likely to come in if they have any reasons
uble prospects in the draw. Suppose that
each draws three cards encees A, who, having
the last draw, 4till looks on his jacks ws reuson-
avly good, and draws two, seeking to give the
impression that he has three of # kind. ©
may bet single chip and D and E drop out
‘This gives F, if he shull have caught « third
to bis pair, an Opportunity for some good play.
If be wise he will simply see the one chip
that C has put up and wait for A to ruise, us
he robably will do, to carry out his play log-
ically. Lf B and C see the raise, F will then be
justified in raising again, with the expectation
of making more than he would have made
by raising the first time he had the chanoe,

This really amounts to the use by F of his
knowledge of A's habit of pi as « means to
win A's money. The example ks a simple one,
but it illustrates one way in which this knowl-
eda is useful, and there are hundreds of such
ways, for the game is one of unlimitedvuriety.

The habit of bluffing is one that many other-
wise good players form, and it is of all habits
the hardest to conceal, since the habitual bluffer
is almost certain to be caught often enough
to raise a suspicion of any play he may make
even on # good hand. Obviously if a man
could always remuin undetected, the bluff
would be the simplest and eusiest way to win
ut poker, but since it is almost npossible to
bluf frequently without being called, and thus
exposed, the good player will attempt the
feut seldom. Exch successful bluff, however,
constitutes u temptation to repeat the effort,an
the pluyer who succumbs to the temptation
too requen tix is almost certain to come out
of the gume a loser,

There are two ways of countering the bluff,
and the choice between them is a matter call-
ing for first-class jucgment. This Judgment,
moreover, must be not only In regard to the
probable strength of the carts im hand, but
also in regard {o the habit of the bluffer's play.
The simple call, ia, of course, imme intely ef-
fective, ant ia usually employe! as the counter
when the plaver believes that another man is
bluffing. but at the same time has no eres! confi-
dence In his own hand. Tt requires courage to
call, of course. when one has @ smal! hand,
but it is often goo! play when a bluff is sus-
pected, unless the amount to be put up for a
call bears too larae & proportion to the amount
in the wy When the limit is small, this is
aeidom the case, 80 ty at a call is tolerably sure
to come, and the bluff ts selcom successful
It is a proverb in voker that it is of little use
to bluff in a small limit game. The renson
is that the man who wishes to call can usually
get a good percentage on the necessary het

In using this first mentione? counter to the
bluff. therefore, only a simple calculation is
neceasary. The amount in the pot can be seen
at a glance, so that the o tds of the bet are ap-
parent. If they are sufficiently large to bal-
ance the probabilities of the suspected bluffar's
roally having the winning hand, there is, of
course. only one thing to ¢o, and that ta to
cone It is therefore celf-evicent that any
knowletge you mpay have o° the bluffer’s hahit
of play will be of advantage to you in decicing
wheather to play.

It will be seen that a bluff to be effectual
should be made for a large sum In comparison
to what {9 already in the pot, and the bloffer
will bet in conformity with this idea, ayeealy
apenking enotural reeult is that (F he beta
too heavily it becomes at once apparent thet
he really {@ bluffing ant he is tolerably certain
to be calle}. The onestion of how much to
put up fo make the bluff effective without
overdoing it calls for nice judgment.

The second counter of the two mentioned
ix to bhaff the bluffer. This ie one of the boldest
things to be done in poker and is not to be at-
tempted by any player who 's not fully con-
fident of his own nerve, and at the same time
confident that the other's nerve will fail. Take
a deal ih) which all have passed out but Aand B.
There is $1 in the pot, and A having only a
strnall pair in his. hand, decides to bluff. If
he raises 50 cents he will expect B to enll if he
hae, cay tens or better, which he ta v likely
to have If A should faire it $2, on the other
hand, B would immediately, suspect a bluff
and would be all the more likely to call. A
raise of $1 would be, however, large enough
to dever Bfrom calling unless he had a strong
hand, becatse the $2 in the pot would only
give him 2 to 1 against the $1 required for a
call And at the same time it would not be
a larger bet than A you's naturally make if
he had a strong hand and wanted to get as
much as eible on it

The bet of $1, therefore, is probably what
A would make, desiring to bluff on his «mall
pair. B will suspect a bluff, «ince the

ker player always suspects his opponent o
inne and allows the suspicion as much
weight as the cireumstances indicate, With his
own hand of a pair of tens he does not feel him-

BEN JORDAN IN TOWN.

The English Featherweight Comes Mere to
Meet Terry McGovern.

The local colony of fighters was increased
yesterday by the arrival of Ben Jordan, the
English featherweight pugilist, who was a
passenger on the Cunard liner Lucania, which
reached this port yesterday morning. Jor-
dan was accompanied by his brother Tom,
who will act as one of his trainers, The for-
eigner got quite a reception when he landed.
Martin Dowling, who will look out for Jordan's
interests in this country, Sam Fitzpatrick,
Chudey Schloss, Hierb Carpenter, Harry New-
bar and Jack Sullivan were at the pier to greet
the Englishman. Jordan does not seem to
look as well as he did when he first came to
America to fight George Dixon for the feather-
weight champiooship of the world at the Lenox
A. C, two years ago. He scouts the idea of
being ill, however, aod declares that he is in
the best of health. He says his attenuated
appearadce is due to the fact that he has been
undergoing a long siege of training.

“My visit to the United States,” said Jordan
toareporter of THE SUN, “is to arrange a fight
with Terry McGovern. Uf I fail to get on a
mateh I will immediately return to my home.
The reason why I did not arrive here sooner
is because I was under the {mpression that
MeGovern was going to come to England.
Abouta month ago l received word that MeGov-
ern had consented to fight me at London, and
I at once began to train. However, it seems
as though I was misinformed, for later I was
notifed that he would not ht me abroad
and that if I wanted a match I must sai! for
this country. Well, you see I am ready to do
business, and hope he is prepared to do the
same.
“Tt ia rather disappointing to know that the
boxing game will soon he over in this State
If McGovern means to fight me he can have
ampre time for I am in firet-ciass condition
and will require only about ten days in which
to get in trim. They tell me that MeGovern
may not fight me because of his theatrical an-

gements. Well, I have always known Moe-
vovern as A fighter and not an actor and I hope
that I will not have to home without a
bout with him. I think I have a great chance
of Dealing Terry. I am #tronger now than
ever. I defeated Tommy Hogan in England
recently and my friends tell me that I have de-
veloped into a good puncher. I was not at
my best when I met Eddie Santry, though.
I was full of malarial fever and was so weak
after the first ten rounds that I could scarcely
hold my hands up, Santry admitted himself
that it was a lucky victory for I had him de-
feated when I received a punch on the ‘aw
which knooked me out. Iam still the 122-pound
champion of the world. 1 whipped Dixon at
this weight, while Santry fought me at 124
pounds,

Jordan further said that if he defeats McGov-
ern he wil! stay in America and he ready to
face all comers at 122 pounds. Jordan will
train at either New Dorp or Oceanic, N. J

Dr. Ordway, the American representative
of the National Sporting Club, London, was
also a passenger on the Lucania. Ordway
aaid that pugilism is booming in England and
soon expecta an invasion of American boxers
abroad. Ordway while in town will t to
arrange matches during the fall and winter

apective classes in America and England.

The youre athletes connected with the

, schools of uils city and Brooklyn are preparing

fo come hack to the city, and Inu week or #0
the large private schools uptown and their
rivaix across the Lig bridge will be alive with
youtus auxious tu attain proficiency in football,

An opportunity will be offered to patrons
of school spore in New York this : ear to wit
hess a game of more than usual importance, as
the interelty match between two ropresenta-

! tive school teanw of the New York and lang

Island Intersenoimstic associations will take
place at Washington Park on Thanksgiving
Day

The indications are that the strugele for hone
ors on Ube gridiron will be more severe than ever
before, It is not at all wulikely that the six-
teen schools belonging to the association will
enter teams. The junior league will also con-
tain spirited elevens and should be of nearly
as much importance as the senior organiza-
liuns, The candidates for the Columbia Gram-
mar School football team will begin training
at Columbia Oval on Monday, Aug. 27. Capt.
Herche will be in charge. All of last year’s
team will beon hand. In speaking of the pros-
pecta of the tearn Herche sald:

“The boys of Columbia Grammar School mean
business this year. We have been playing In
hard luck last season, and | think the tide will
change. The boys are all hard workers and
good players. Last season we were bhandi-
capped by having no grounds to practise on. At
Columbia Oval we have two large rooms, of
which one will be fitted up as a gymnasium.
The candidates will be taught all the tricks of
the game. A great many of our games last
season were lost by misunderstanding of sig-
nals, but we will have a code this year that will
be thoroughly understood. Our athletic de-
partment will be greatly strengthened this year
and we expect to have strong teams tn all the

indoor games,

Candidates for the Woods School football
team will begin work on the school's grounds,
Unionport, to-morrow afternoon, The boys
are already arriving and there is every evi-
dence of lively competition for places on the
eleven. School does not open until Sept.

light practice. he school is fortunate
having go many of last season's team. The
following boys will again be candidates: Calley,
centre, Bohdes and Briggs, guards, Church
and Taylor, tackles; Coohan and Thomson,
ends, Salter, quarter back; Barnard, Rony
Rosenthal and Arnold, half backs, fill, ull
back. There are a number of last rors
substitutes who stand a good show of displac-
ing some of the regular boys. Laughton
MeCormick, both quarter backs, will be back
and will be very much in the race for places.

The elevens of five of the seven Long Island
achools will all be in training the first wee!
tember The championsh ? schedule will
much earlier than usual. At Garden ty
the St. Paul School boys are rapidly making
their appearance. Dr. Ray Hare, the athletio
director, says that the team this year, whe
fully organized, will be a fast one. Many 0
the Jast year's champion team have left, in-
cluding Blount and Boysen, two of the best
quarter backs in the scholastic league. Bo
go to Columbia University, where they w
make a strong addition to the ‘Varsity tea
All the vacancies on the St. Paul eleven w
be filled from the second team, and Dr. Hare
will start in with about thirty-five candidates
who have had at least one year’s experience
on the gridiron. All the practice work will
be done at the school’s campus, Garden City.

Prof. Lewis of Hamilton College will coach
the Brooklyn High school football oom s
fall Grounds have been secured at Benson-
hurst, where the bulk of the practice will be
done A little work will one ft the parade
grounds, Prospect Par shojhenen, Well-
stood and Kennedy will back, and the rest
of the team will be picked from raw material.
Coach Lewis says that the greatest attention
will be paid to blocking and break through
- kicks Signal work will also receive atten-

on.

At present it is not knewn how men of
old boys will return to Pratt Ine tute ars
athletic asacciation has not as yet secured 4

the baseball players had copsiderable trou

new grounds of the institute have been ii ed
and all the work will be done there

Both the Polytechnic Preparatory and Erea-
mit® Hall High schools will be represented
strong elevens. The former lose @ very val-
uable adviser in R. Manning, who will go te
Harvard. He was manager of the footbal)
team last year and handled the eleven In egod
styla The Polytechnic team will obs ly
be coached by Prof. Kellogg. There le a fee
ing among the students that a Post-graduate
ata’ of coaches can be secured. It is though
better work will be done oy the candidates
if they work under ap instructor of the school

Manager L. Morris will fill the place of head
eoach at the Erasmus Ball High School. e
has held the place for the past three y
and nis work been very satisfactory, Al
but two of the eleven of last year are expecte
back and prospects of a champion team are
brighter than. usual. The school has fine
grounds at Flatbush, Brooklyn, where most
of the preliminary work will be done,

It was said at Brooklyn Latin School last
week that no team will be placed on the grid-
fron. The students say they will turn their
attention to handba!! and baseball early in t
season and to hockey and skating later ip t
year. Ro Are e i, RA. F allott
dates by the Long Isiand Interscholastic u
and it {s likely that an eleven will be arvdeted
there

While {t is uncertain whether the Collegiate
School eleven this year will be a strong one, the
great difficulty is that the players are selected
almost without exception from the class about
toenter college. This necessitates the develop-
ment of A new eleven each year. Practice
will probably commence next Monday. The
team will be a light one, and, when fully organ-
ized, will play in the Junior league

There {a no apparent reason why Ru ord
High School should not have @ stronger ren
this year than last. The line ts almost intact,
and behind it the position of full back ts the
onty problem. Capt. Finn can play there, but
he is needed at quarter, while Stokes, who is
a dashing line bucker, cannot kick satisfactorily,
For half back, Price is eull on the ficld, bap
his partner, Brill, has graduated. on
Jadiam are two new and prom oan
back of the line, Both the ends, Voorn and
Farrar, will be back at the school, with Hutton
a newcomer. Samuels, tackle, and Brown
Fisher, guards, will undoubtealy occupy their
former places this seasou. Dixon, the shot
putter, is able 10 give Baxter a hard rub fo
centre, although the latters experience wi
stand . ln in good stead ;

H. D. Brennan will again have charge of
the squad of football players at De (a Selle
Institure. Keeler, Murphy and Farrelly are
the most promising of the team of last year
back. Bapanan says that he can put forth
aLother coampion team with the material on
hand. Tue training of the team this year will
be dene in conjunction with the Manhattan
Coliege team, at Jasper Field. The first week's
practice will consist of an hour's brisk work
enon day, such as falling on the ball, kicking,
blocking and breaking through

It istpossible that Sachs schoo] will again re»
frain from entering a football team In the
scholastic series this fall, Prof. Thompson
acid Inst woek that he did not see where the
goheol waa going to get suitable material for
a cuccessful team. There are, he said, very
few students at the school whose weight le gul-
ficlent to enable them to take an active part
in the come. The whole trouble with the team
last vear was lack of weight. There tsno
doub., however, that tho school wil) place @

The preparatory school at Fordham College
will have three athletes of no meni ory

dolph Ledesina and Manuel Baleeinde. These
three youngsters are Cubans, having arrived
here three inonths ago. George A. Daly, who
