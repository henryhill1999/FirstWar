RAILROAD DEALS AT HAND.

ATORY OF THK ABSORPTION OF READ-
ING AND JERSEY CENTLAL,

 

According to the Report the Baltimore and
Otto and the Pennsylvania Are to Dt-
vide Them Up—K. & 0. to Get to New
York—Pennsylvania to Get Coal Traffic.

Baurimony, April 12.--The next move of
large importance in the railroad world js
expected to be the absorption of the Philadel-
phia and Reading und the Central Railroads
of New Jersey by the Baltimore and
Obio and the Pennsylvania systems. The
plan {9 sald to be for the Baltimore and Ohio

and the Pennaylvanta to acquire the propertios
and divide them among their systems, the
Baltimore and Obto taking the Philadelphia
and Heading division, extending from Phila-
delphia to Bound Brook, N. J, and one or two
other Important tranches, and the New Jersey
Central! division extending from Bound Brook
to New York. The Pennsylvania would ac-

quire the remaining divisions.

This scheme would give the Baltimore and
Ohioan unbroken line of its own from the
metropolis to St. Louls and Louisville by way
of Cincinnati, and would secure to the Pennsy!-
vania absolute control of the anthracite coal
tonnage of the Scranton, Wilkes Barre and
and Mauch Chunk districts of Pennsylvania,
whichare now dominated by the New Jersey

Central,

It is said that the Pennsylvania heretofore
bas not looked with favor upon the Baltimore
and Ohto entering Jersey City over its own
tracks, but since it has acquired such a large
{interest in the property this opposition has
disappeared, and now it is said that the Penn-
eylvania is not only willing for ite one-time
rival to secure these advantages, but will aid it
in every way to bring about the deal, provided
the Baltimore and Ohio will reciprocate by aid-
ing the Pennsylvania in controlling the au.
thracite coal traffic,

This scheme is undetatood to have been con-
sidered in Philadelphia yesterday, when Chair
man Salomon of the Baltimore and Ohio and
President Cassatt of the Pennsylvania confers
red on railroad matters, The management of
both the Baltimore and Ohio and the Pennsyl-
vania, for obvious reasons, have kept the mat-
tera secret until their plans are fully matured,

The consummation of such a. deal would not
only enable the Baltimore and Ohio to reach
New York over ite own, tracks, but would also
give the company the Market street station of
the Philadelphia and Reading and the latter’s
large terminal facilities at Philadelphia and
New York. 7 ‘

Another matter which is said to be nearing
a head is the formal transier of the control of
the Baltimore and Ohio Southwestern to the
Baltimore and Obio.. The Baltimore and Ohio
owns all of the stock of the Baltimore and Ohio
Southwestern, and guarantees principal and
interest on the latter's mortgage indebtedness,
The operation of the Baltimore and Ohio South-
western as the southwestern division of the
Baltimore and Ohio was provided for ‘ua the
plan of reorganization of the former, but the
carrying out of the terms was delayed by Pres-
ident Bacon and Viee-President Greene of the
Baltimore and Ohio Southwestern, This road
extends from Parkersburg, W. Va., to St. Lonis,
and " iches Cincinnati, Louisville and Spring-
field, I.

Messrs. Bacon and Greene were in Balti+
more yesterday in conferenea with Baltimore
and Ohio officials, It was given out that they |
liacnssed only the luprovements contemplated
on the Baltimore and Ohio Southwestern, but |
t ls believed that formal transfer of the con. |
t-ol of the latter property was the chief topic |
under consideration, |

PROSPECTS OF THE GOULD SYSTEM,

Missouri Pacific Stock Continnesto Advance
on Talk of Dividends,

Missouri Pacifle Railroad shares advanced
from 554 to OS*, yesterday and the continued
activity of thisstock on ‘Change kept alive the
rumors of a prospective dividend. President |
George J. Gould said that the question of divi-
dend had not yet been discussed by the di-
rectors. Russell sage, who is second only to |
President Gould in the extent of his holdings
of Missouri Pavifle stock, made this statement |
late yesterday afternoon: |

|
|
|

“Missouri Pacifle shares have been too lowin

valuable property. | It controls the South.

velop into one of the great controlling railroad |
properties inthis country. [have been inter. |

Gould that he beeome interested in the prop-
erty. Astothe paymentof a dividend on Mis. |
souri Pacific shares, that will come along in |
|
'

price for some time.

due time.”

The tlnancial statement of the Missouri Pa-
cifle for the last flseal year shows a decrease in
surplas earnings, although the gross and net
earnings were much in excess of the earnings
of the previous year, The surplus in 10S was
$1,170,800, while last year it was only $040-

ue. This decrease is due, it is sail, to ex.
penses attending the rewljustment. of the |
bonded indebtedoess of the Iron Mountain
road, |

Reports submitted tothe recentannual meet.
naofthe St. Louis Southwestern Railroad, of
whieh Edwin Gould is the head, show an un-
commonly favorable outlook for the cotton
erop. On or ahout May 1a direet connection
will be made between the St. Louis South.

CONSOLIDATION A PUBLIC GOOD,

 

Injunction Against the Wagner-Pollman
Transfer Denied by the Court.

The motion of William H.N, Francis,asa stocks
holder of the Wagner Palace Car Company, to
enjoin the transfer of the stock of that company
to Pullman's Palace Car Company has been
denied by Justice Beekman of the Supreme
Court. Francis owns 100 shares of the Wagner
Palace Car Company and was the only stock-
holder to fight the proposed arrangement. The
owners of 187,188 shares out of 198,605 voted
for it. By the agreement the stock of the
Wagner Palace Car Company was put at $180
4 share and wasto be exchanged, share for
share, for new stock to be issued by the Pull-
man company. Stockholders of the Wagner
company who did not desire to go in are en-
titled to recelve $180 ashare for their stock,
Tho Judge says that the plan of liquidation and

the consideration to be peta for the property
seem to bo reasonable, fair and adequate. He
continues:
Tt is urged that the absorption of the Wag-
ner company by the Pullman company will
create a great monoply of the business.
I fail to see that this would be the result in
any sense, which is otnoxious to the Jaw, as
the A in Question in no way involves ans re-
straint upon others from freely engaging in
the same kind of business, It is contende
here on behalf of the defendants that the chi¢
merit of the proposed absorption of the bual-
nossof the Wagner company by the Pullman
company is in the reduction of administrative
expenses and reater effectiveness in
mana ome! and that there is a4 corre-
sponding benefit not only to those immedi-
ately interested in the business, but to
the public as well, as the tendency of
such conditions is towarda reduction of
charges for the service rendered. The con-
tention is borne out by the observed results of
similar aggregations of business enterprises
under one control, whieh has become one of the
economic features of the present day. Ther
seems to be noghing, then, in the propose
transfer here which is injurious tothe public
interests.”
Tho Court saya that the contention that the
agreement is not advisable ig of no weight be-
cause the directors of the Wagner company
were empowered by the articles of agreement
on which the company was founded to dissolve
iton giving sixty days’ noticetothe stock-
holders, which had been done,

KIGUT AGAINST THE NEW COAL ROAD

 

The Erie Company Scores a Point in the
Pennsylvania Courts.

Port Jervis, N, Y., &pril 12.-The Erle Rail-
road Company to-day scored a point in ite fight
in Pennsylvaniato prevent the frie and Wyo-
ming Valley and Pennsylvania Coal companies
from building its proposed coal road from
Hawley, over the abandoned Delaware and
Hudson Canal, to tidewater at Kingston, N. Y.
Last November the Erie Company dumped 100
carloads of coal ashes in the canal at Lacka-
waxen, where the Erie crosses it by a bridge.
This was to prevent the new road from build-
ing on the bed of the canal, which is under the
Erie tracks at this point. The matter was
taken to the courts and Judge Purdy, the pre-
siding Judge of Pike and Wayne counties, or-
dered the Erle Company to remove a wooden
bridge it had built across the canal ona level
with the bank while an injunction was pend-
ing, leaving the coal and other obstruction un-
disturbed,

To-day the Erie Company, through its coun.
sel, sought to tile a bond, which in effeot would
give it permanent possession of the land under
its bridge No, U at Lackawaxen. A special
term of Pike; County Court was held at Milford
to-day betore Judge Purdy and Aasoclate
Judges Klaer and Houck, at which the Erie
and Wyoming Company asked for an injuhe-
tion to restrain the Erie from filing its bond,
The injunction was denied and the Frie per-
mitted to file its bond, This gives the latter
company the canal bed where it is_ obstructed,
and not only prevents the new road trom pass.
ing under the Erie’s bridge at that point, but
will prevent fliling the canal with water for
boating coal, in case the Pennsylvania Coal
Company and tndividual anthracite operators

BUSTON AND ALBANY LEASES,

Boston Men Go to the Legislature With the
Amendment They Demand.

Another obstacle to the ratification of the
lease of the Boaton and Albany Railroad to the
New York Central has been interposed by rep.
resentatives of the East Poston Company, a
corporation which owns extensive wharf and
terminal property in Boston, Nathan Mat-
thews, as the representative of this company,
has formally applied to the Massachusetts
Legislature to amend the proposed lease by in-

serting aciause requiringthe New York Cen-

tral to spend $5,000,000 within five years in
enlarging and perfecting the docks, wharves
aud other terminal facilities owned by the Bos-
ton and Albany company in East Boston

Mr. Matthews says that the persons who
control the New York Central ure behind the
proposed lease of the Fitehburg Railroad to

| the Boston and Maine, and he objects to givin

the Vanderbiits unrestricted eoutrol of most o
the important railroad interests in) Maasa-
ebusetts, The East Boston Company wants a
definite understanding with the New York
Central regarding its purpose in the extension
and development of the Boston aud Albuny
terminal facilities,

The Vanderbilts are apparently making no
efforts to influence the action of the Massa
chusetts Legisiature) The New York Central
people take the ground thit they have made a
'iberal offer forthe Boston and Albany prop-
erty, and if the State of. Massachusetts does
not care to have the offer accepted, the re-
sponsiliity rests in that quarter, ‘The Boston
and Albany as an independent line woult be fn
no position t: hurt the interests of the New York
Central, while the last-named company, by
purchasing or making an allinnee with the
Fitchburg Railroad, could divert au immense
amount of trafiic irom the Boston and Albany,

PLAN? ( FFICES 10 REMAIN HERE,

Lynde Harrison Says the Headquarters Will
Not Be Moved to New Haven,

New Haven, April 12.—Lynde Harrison of
this city, who !6 an executor ofthe estate of
the late Henry B. Plant, the millionaire railroad
and steamship man, announced to-night that
the mainoffices of the Plant system will not
be established In New Haven, as has been
announced. These offices will remain where
they are now, in New York city. Mr. Harrison
said the story thatthe main offices would be
soon removed from New York to New Haven
was probably due to the fact that Mr. Plane
just prior to his death had decided to have his

rivate offices established in this city Ina
batidin on the New Haven Green. Ever since
Mr. and Mrs. Plant spent their honeymoon in
the old Tontine Hote!, opposite the Green,
years ago, Mr. Plant had A great desire to coma

THE SUN, FRIDAY, APRI

 
 

PROSPERITY IN THE SOUTH.

YARN SPINNERS MEET AND AD-
VANCE PRICES IN THEIR GOODS,

 

 

President Adamson of the Association Says
That McKinley's Re-election Will Make
Secure the South’s Prosperity § for
Four Yeara More—The Trade Outlook,

Cuariorrs, N. C., April 12,.—The Bouthern
Hosiery’ Yarn Spinners’ Association met here
this afternoon and adopted an advanced scale
of prices for yarns, Prosident Charles Adam-
eon of the association, a large mill owner of
Cedartown, Ga, told Tue Sux correspondent
that the redsiection of McKinley would bring
four more years of prosperity, He sald that
the industrial outlook in the South is very
bright. He sald: “As long as the prement
prosperous condition of the country continues
there will be no decline in the prices of yarns,
While there ts an apparent lull in the demand,
which might lead one to think that prices are
softening, this is due to the fact that the mille
are full of orders and sold ahoad, and also to
the fact that the knitters are hoping for a
break in prices and are only buying what {6
immediately needed without placing any
future orders,

“In addition to thease facts, certain commis-
sion men In the Eust, working on a plan some-

what similar to what was done in connection
with the cotton market, are trying to give the
idea that the markets are declining in order to
buy cheaply and speculate. Cotton will not
come down any when the new crop comes in,
An examination of cotton prices for fifty years
back will show that the price of cotton, like
that of fron, runs in cycles. It shows that this
and next year cotton will be higher, until the
weave mills cease doing the business they now
do. The hosiery yarn men need have no ap-
prehension about prices,

“Another factor opening up_to the cotton
manufacturer is the matter of export trade
withthe Philippines and the open door tn
China. Our country is on the eve of expansion
in alllines of trade, and particularly in the
cotton trade. It will only stop when the cotton
trade of the world is in the handa of the Amert-
can manufacturers, the same as the fron trade
now is, It behooves tha South to support the
movements to extend this trade, Profits may
not be large, but the demand 14 practically un-
Hmited, and in my opinion weshould pay more
attention to export trude than to any other.

“It ia possible that some depression for a
short time may show itaelf about the time of
the Presidential election, but that will be

short.

“With the redlection of President McKinley

the country has_a certainty of four more yeara
of prosperity, Our finances are now ona good
basis and, taking a broad view of the altuation,
Tecan ace no reason why the present prosperity
should not continue and form the greatest
period of success in. manufactures that
America has ever seen. Tam in a position to
qecge with tolerable aceuracy the feeling of
fastern capivaties with regard to our manu-
factures, [amin eloce touch with some of the
leading men in the North and it is easier now
to interest capital in any enterprises, especially
in Southern enterprises,”

Concerning the price of yarn Mr. Adamson
said the association simply moved up prices
to fit the advanced market quotations, He sald
the difference in price in favor of Fastern
yarns halentirely disappeared, In some cases
Southernmills received the highest prices.

THE “S00” LINE WONT YIELD,

 

Prospects of a Rate War Againat the Cana-
dian Pacific,

Cricaco, April 12.—Passenger officials of the
Chieago-8t. Paul lines met with those of the
lines from Chicago to the East to-lay and re-
ported that they had been unable to effect an
agreement with the “Soo” line of the Canadtan
Pacife system to restore rates to a normal
basia, The Western lines urged tho East-
ern roads to join them in meeting the compe-
tition of the “Soo” line on through business,

both prorating on per rate _baagis, using as
factors the aalling rate of $11.50 from St. Paul
to Chicago and the regular first-ciaga rate from
Chicago to New York of $18 by the differential
lines and $20 by the standard lines. The Cen.
tral Passenger Association roads Interested
will recommend tothe Joint Passenger Com-
mittee, which will meetin Now York on April
18, that the Eastern roads co‘perate with tha
Chicago-St, Paul roads in meeting the “Soo”
line competition,

It haa always been the rule of the Grand
Trunk road to meet any rates made by the
Canadian Pacifie) The Grand Trunk js certain,
therefore, to help the Western roads in their
fight withthe “Soo” line. The New York Central
now cooperates with the "Soo" Jine in maine
taining cut rates from St. Paul to New York
but the Central is also willing to get. a share o}
the Chicago-St. Paul lines throngh ita connec-
tions, the Lake Shore and Michigan Central.
This complicates the situation, because the
standard Vanderbilt lines want to make as low
progernonars ratesas the Eastern differential
rods

Thore is a possibility that a big rate war
affecting both the East and the West, will
grow out of the strife,
