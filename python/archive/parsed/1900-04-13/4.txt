RACING,

Gwynne, a Good Thing, Beats Christmas
Carol by a Neok,

Wastttnoton, April 12.—The track was sloppy
at Bennings to-day as a result of the heavy
rain of last night, yet this did not interfere
with the racing,which was very good, all things
considered, Tho layers doing business were
scorched, not because three favorites won,
but owing to the vietory of Gwynne tn the first
race, which proved to be one of the best things
of the meeting, When the betting opened 100

to Ll was the odds quoted against him, but |

it did not last very long as bunches
of greenbacks were thrown into the book-
makers’ faces all during the betting so that
his price fellto15to1, The good thing went
through successfully for, after Allie H. had led
into the stretch, Gwynne went to the front and
lusted long enough to win by a neck from
Christmas Carol, Tho latter is owned by

“Pather Bill” Daly, and after the race was run
be wentto the stewards and lodged a com-
plaint against awarding the purse to J. J.
Castles, owner of Gwynne, declaring that
Custies Was guilty of racing on outlaw tracks
aud had pot been reinstated, The stewards
investigated the matter and fonnd that Daly's
charge Was untrue, and for his trouble Daly
wis fined $50,

he management has persuaded Chariie
Brossman, trainer and part owner of Imp, to
run her in the second Bennings Handicap on
Saturday. Brossman was about to ship her to
Morris Park and let hor rest until the meeting
opens there, but this morning he changed his
mind. He will ship herto Morris Park on Sun-
day, This morning Imp was worked six fur-
longs in 1:16%. Boney Boy, winner of the first

MEMPHIS, Apri! 12.--The Ardelle Stakes for two-
year-old Oilles was the chief attracton at Montgomery

plications from players have been recelved,

The full achedule of Atlantic League games
Will not be ready until to-morrow.

McGraw and Robinson received contracts on
Wednesday from the St. Louls club. They
were promptly returned unsigned. McGraw
wrote a letter to President. Kobison of the
Browns which he enclosed with the uno-
signed documenta explaining that he and
Robinson had a lucrative business in Baltie
more and gould not go ao far away from home
to play ball and asking that he and Robinson
be traded off to some Kustern club.

While a number of the Philadelphia club's
players have not signed ore for this
season, both the management and ¢ 2 paysre
deny that a wholesale strike on the part ofthe
stars is contemplated. Col. Rogera said yes-
torday : “Some of the men are 80 superatitious
that they hold on to their contract tothe last
minute. There ia a baseball rule, however,
that no man can play more than five games
unless his contract is turned in. Of course, we
have the contracts of the new players and of
others who received new ones this year, be-
cause they were being advanced in their pros
fession, Astothe meno who receive the limit
of salary, such action is unnecessary. The
Boston players signed the same kind of a con-
tract aa the Philadelphia players in ‘v@. This
contained the three-years’ renewal clause, aud
the Boston club has not reala@ned asingle old

layer toa new contract. Sofar as we know,

ajoie, Delahanty aod the othera who have
not algned a new contract have no grievance,
and the only terma to be arranged for Dela-
hanty is the additional amount for captaining
the team.”

Bautrwong, April 12.—There will bea unique
bargain day exhibition here to-morrow. By
some error in booking, Union Park waa leased
to two parties for to-morrow aiternoon.
Manager Hanlop had arranged to play a
practice game between his regulars and Tre-
éerves, and the manager * the Maryland
University nine had secured the grounds fota
contest with Yale. Hanlon was determined to
put hia men through one moro trial perform-
ance before bringing them home to New York.
Altera longconelave with the Marsland’s man-
ager, a new departore in “Gable eager:
attractions was decided upon. The collegians
will be number onv on the programme. Their
game will be started at 2 o’e'ock and the
Krook!yn exhibition will immediately follow
Only one admiasion will be charged to see
both games, McGraw and Robinson have
been! around the Eutaw Honse, where the
are quartered, much
of their time. Me(rraw sald to-night that
if he is foreed to remain out of the game this
gear he would never play ball again and

obby seconded his partner's ultimatum. The
Brooklyns will leave for home after to-
morrow's game.

CamBripos, April 12.—The Harvard baseball
team left Camoridge this afternoon on its
Southern trip and will reach New York early
to-myrrow morning and will leave immedi-
ately for Charlottesville direct, The party in-
cluded seventeen players, in charge of Trainer
MeMaaster and Assistant Head Coach Hayea,
with Manager Trainor and Assistant Manager
Murdock to look after the business detalis,
The men taken were: Kernan, Stillman, Mac-
googld and Coburn, pitchers; Mtine and Capt.

eld, catchers: Kendall and J. b. Clark
first’ base: Fineke and George, second
base: Coolidge, short stop; UG. C. Clarke and
Ewar, third tase; Jaynes, Christenson, Lough-
lin and Wendell, outielders. When not play.
{ng games the team will practice on the old
National Leagne or Georgetown grounds In
Washington. The college daily, the Crimson,
says the following about the ee editorially:

“The Southern trip can be criticised on prin-
ciple but supported on expedjenay. A large
number of men are taken on an expensive
trip during the holldays. They practise to
win and not because they like to, When
not practising they enjoy themeelves tn the
laces where the scheduletakesthem. Holiday
niseball practice in Washington ts similar to
summer football work at the seashore—both
are objectionable on principle. But there is no
question that the Southern trip is necessary if
we would cope with ouropronents, They go
Routh for practice and we must do likewise or
be ata digudvantage. And year after year the
advantages of the trip become greater, Expedi-
ency has gained its pofnt over prineiple and
will continue to gain it until! the principle
means more thang it does at present.”

Crxctywatt, April 13—Three of the Ctnein-
natt Club’s surplus players were “farmed”
out to minor league elubs to-day. The

J. ROGERS MAXWELL’S NEW 48- FOOTER
WILL BE READY NEXT MONTH,

She Has Beon Named Hebe and Will Bo |

Up to Date in Every Detall—Prospects
ofa Lively Year for Boats of 30-Foot
Class Raceabouts Will Be Prominent,
When J. Rogers Muxwell sold the schooner
Imera!d and afterward gave an order for a
stoam yacht, those who knew him declared
that it would not be long before he was back in
the ranks of racing yachtsmen, Last year the
steamer Kismet was used to follow the racers
from port to port, and Mr. Maxwell divided his
time with the two small boats owned by his
ons, the Possura of the 36-foot class and the
Olseau of the 2%-foot knockabout class. These
were very successful. When plans were being
arranged for this season's racing Mr. Maxwell

looked the fleld over and decided that he would |

like to have a yacht and that of all the classes
the 43-foot promised the most sport. Karly in
the winter he placed an order for this kind of a
boat with B. B. Crowinshield through Frank
Bowne Jones, and the yacht has been built by
Lawley at Boston and will be ready about the
middle of May. She has been named Hebe and
is up to date in every detail and will be raced
in all the regattas in this vicinity. She is of
composite construction, is fitted with a pole
mast and is a keel boat.

This will make five yachts In the Maxwell
fleet, all of which fly the shamrock aa a private
signal. The Oiseau was built by Herreshoff
last year and will be raced by J, Ik, Maxwell,
Jr. The yacht is now at the foot of Fifty-ffth
street, South Brooklyn, having some alight
changes made fn her rig that will enable her
to rage in the 40-foot class. Last year she
carried no bowsprit but will have one this year.

Hor dimensiones are 41 foot over all, 25 feet on
the water line, ¥ feet 6 inches beam and 4 feet
draught. The Oiseau has a centreboard, and
will carry about 1,000 square feet of canvas
this year, Another new yacht for the feet
will tha 22-foot raceabout, which is being
built by Stearns at Marblehead from dea.
signs by Purdon. for Harry Maxweil. She isto
be named feapner. She will be a keel boat, 33
feet over all, 21 feet_on the water line, 7 feet b
iuches beam and 6 feet draught. She will
garry GOO square féet of canvas. The Possuin,
built Jast year from designs by Clinton HA.
Crane, raced in the 36-foot c!nsa, er difhen-
sions are 43 feet over all, 30 feet on the water
Ine, 10 feet beam and 7 feet draught She
spreads 1,400 square feet of canvas. he
ogsim will probably be sold.

The 30-foot class ia which the Oiseat will be
raced this year will be one of the moat attrac-
tive for smail yachta in these waters, One new
boat has been built and several ‘eats’ have
been changed 80 as to get into this class, Al-
fred Peats, Jr, is having the new 3-footer

ullt, B. B. Crowinshivid is the designer and
the boat is being constructed at Frank Wood's
yardat City Island. Sho will be a keel craft
and have a pole mast. The catboat Kit, owned
by fT. H. McDonald of Bridgeport, will have a
bowsprls put in and rigged as a sloop, The
other ts forthe claes are: Alerion, owned
by $i H. Alker, who hax had the 110-foot steam
yacht Florence built Dy Herreshoff: the Mar-

verite, owned by J. Il, Dingas; the Alyee, a

sawley boat, owned by W. H. Hennen ot Yule;
the Momo, owaed by Clinton A. Crane, and the
Departure, owned by Clin‘on B. Seeley, The
latter was built for the 34-rating claas, but bas
pot been out for threé seasons. She isa fin

ee) boat and inorder to race in the class slight
changes will be made in her rig.

Sixteen yachts will sail in the class for 21-
foot raceabouts, Soma of these gre last year’s

oats and others raced {n Eastern waters and
have now been purchased by yachtamen inthis
vicinity. Every eiub will give special prizes
for races between these bonts and the contests
should be close and exciting. The boats eligi-
ble are:

Edwina, formerly Indianola, owned by Rear Com
modore J, Nelson Gould; Kantaka, owned by George
J. Bradish; Shtndrift, owned by S, ©. Pirie; Kittie,

NEWS OF THE WHEELMEN,

Fifteen Entries for Amertoa’s First Auto-
mobile Road Race,

yesurday when the antries
for the first formal automobile road
race to be held in this country wero closed
with Chairman A, C. Bostwick it was found that
fifteen chaileurs had declared for the competi-
tion. This was considered a goodly list, con-
sidering the fact that in this country litle atten
tion has been paid to racing machines, most
those turned out being designed for all around
road work. The entnes indicate that the struggle
will be chiefly between the believers in gasolene
motors and the advocates of steam engines, only
ue electric vehicle having been entered. The
electrical carriage will be that of A. L. Riker,
‘The gasolene motor vebicles entered are: George
F. Chamberlain, A. R. Shattuck, D. W. Bishop,
Jr, Jefferson Seligman, C. F. Weston, J. C. Me-
Coy sud A. ©, Bostwick. The steam carriage
competitors are: L. L, Barber, S. T. Davis, Jr.,
Vv. f Macy, W. AL Hall and David HL Morris.
The start will be made from 4@ pout near Spring
field, L. L, at 10 o'clock to-morrow morning, and
the course will be straigutaway over the Merrick

road to Babylon and back, @ distance of fifty
miles. ‘The face will be run under the rules of

MARVARD’S SPRING GAMFS,

Are Disappointing.

Camprrpor, April 12.—The Harvard spring
kimes were held under most untavorable con-
ditions this afternoon on Holmes Field. A
rain with an east*wind accompanying It shifted
down during the contest, making it Cisagree-
able for contestants and spectators alike, The
Gaines were disappointing. In not one of the

| track events, excepting the one-mile run, was

there # performance that gives hope of chang-
ing the resuitof the Yale games on May 12.
J. BE. Haight, the promising freshman, was
tried in the quarter mile and made a fair show-
ing, covering tho distance in 51 26% seconds,
Clerk ran him a close second, but did not seem
upto the form he displayed in the Yale games.

Darling, the medical schoo! sprinter, failed to
make @ good showing in the dashes, but as he
has been training only a week he did as well
as could be expected,

Sprague won the “hundred” in slow time, but
inthe final heat strained an inner musele of
his leg quite severely, This is the first time

rague has been persuaded to put on a run-
ning shoe since entering in the fall, and as he
has chosen totrain for only a short time he ha
nobody to blame for his accident but hitaseit,
This will probably put him out of the game for
the balance of the season. Boal gota surpris-
ingly good throw off inthe hammer, covering

WANTS

Without Him, According to Report, Jeffries
Will Not Fight Corbett.

A report went the rounds of the sporting re-
sorte yesterday that unless George Siler offici-
ates as referee Jeffries will not tackle Jim
Corbett at Coney Island next month. Accord-
ing to an intimate friend of the champlon Jef-
friea and Siler had quite a chat at Detroit last
Friday night, after the brawny boilermaker
had disposed of Jack Finnigan in jig time,
Jeffries is sald to have informed Biler shat un-

lees he officiate’ there would be no fight. Tue
SUN reporter’s Informant has this to say:

Jeffries thinks that Siler fa the squarest
and one of the best referees in the ring, and as
champion he dee ares that he reserves the
right to select aman who in his opinion best
suits him. You know that Siler is notin good
odor with the local promoters of boxing on ac-
connt of his decision in the Jeffries-Sharkey
match, and for this reason he haa been ex-
cluded from oMciating in the Kast, especially
in this a 2 Jeffries is aware of this, but as he
ig Siler's rlend he will stick out for him until
the last. Should he do so pou can bet that
thére wont be any fight, forthe Seaside people
wont stand for Siler, Ofcourse if the fight is
not held Brady will have to sacrifice $5,000 as
aforieit. Corbett wont give in to Siler, but he
bas never stated any reasons why,

T have also been told that Jeffries does not
want any holding {nm the match, but will insist
On the men fighting themselves free.”’

M’GOVPERN QUITS,

Tries to Beat Faro at Troy and Drops
About 81,500,

Tuoy, April 12.—Terry MeGovern, the cham-
pion bantam and featherweight of the world,
who had been playing an engagement at the
Star Theatre, left the city this morning with
his exchequer sadly depleted as a result
of a bont with “King Faro.” MoGovern
had an appointment at the close of his
performance with Joe J. Bullivan, J.
flerbert Mack, Frank Barry, Harry Wal-
ters and his manager, Sam Harris, all

members of New York Aerie Fraternal Order
of Fagles, who were in town attending the in-
etitution of Troy Aprie, Terry was delayed and
dil not appear unffl the e¢rémonies had con-
cluded, ‘Then he was made the subject of rail-
lery, and the chairman imposed on hima fine
of 00 cents and gave him five minutes to pay it.

Terry declared he would make some Trojan
pay the amount and decided to battle a few
rounds with the tiger. He spent several hours
at play, trys to win the half dollar, but fi-
nally went broke and quit, When the banker
took an inventory of his winnings it was found
that the sportive little pugilist had dropped
epout 01.500 inte the claws of the striped ear-
nivore,

Terry McGovern Ready to Fight Dave Sul-
livan,

There was a big gathering of sports atthe
Delavan House last evening to witness the ar-
ranging ofa match between Terry McGovern
and Dave Sullivan, Sam Harris came all the
way from Troy to fix details, but after waiting
nearly two hours he left in disguat. Harris
was willing to pit MeGovern againat Sullivan
at 124 pounds. He said that ho would only
concede pie weight to Sullivan as he Armly
believes that such a battle would draw a big
house and be very {ntereating. Paddy sullivan
was present in the intereats of Eddie Gardner,
brother to Oscar Gardner, and told Harria
that in case nO agreement was arranged be-
tween Suilivan and McGovern, Gardner wonld
take Sulifvan’s place and fight the champion.
Harris jooks apon the substitution of Gardner
as feasible, aud if he does not hear from Sulli-
van pretty soon he will take Eddie on,

farris said he bad coneluded not to let
MeGiovern goto England and fight Ben Jordan
next winter at the National Sporting Club, He
sridthat hia present business arrangements
will prevent Terry from Jeaving America for at
least a year, as he isto be a full-fledged actor
next seasou in a melodrama called the
“Bowery After Dark.” If Jordan will visit
Amertca, Harris continued, Terry will Iny off a
couple of weeks and fight him.

McCoy Agree to
July 30,

Arrangements were practically completed
yesterday for a mateh between Jim Jeffries
and Kid MeCoy, the battle to be decided on
July 30 atthe club offering the best induce.
ment, The articles are to be slened to-day.
They wil! call for a eombat of twenty-five
rounds tinder straight Marquis of Queensberry
rules, and are to be binding whether Jeffries
or MeCoy is defeated in the meantime
MeCoy said:

“Twill show my frienda that I am all right
after I tackle Jeffries. He may have quite an
niivantage when it comes to the question of
weight, but Lauess notwithstanding thia.T will
be just as strong and, combined with skill and
eontidence, | ought to win. Twill be in the
best possible snape and will surprise alot of
people who think that I will be ontelnasad,”

Charley White has been selected to referee
the mill.
