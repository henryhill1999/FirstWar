YIRDINER HEARING,

Holt Says He Doesn't Think Presi-

Henry “pitle Was Unjastifiably Attacked

Collected Forfeite—Evidence About All In

The presentation of evidence to sustain the
os brought against District Attorney Asa
toe Gerdinor by members of the City Club
vil bo ony iuded to-day. With the exception
{ baif an hour in the morning, the hearing
halore Commissioner Wilcox yesterday was
devoted to the offering of documentary évi-
dence by Horace KE. Deming, who represented
na City Club, The other half hour was occa-
ol by Honry Holt, the publisher of the Edu-
snow Review, who with Nicholas Murray
vor was indicted for printing an article
yaded “Tammany in the Baddle,” which 1n-
sipded a statement that President Little of the
poard of Education was “a fine old educa-
onal nastodon,” The indictment was subse-
quently dismissed ,

Mr. Holt In answer to Mr. Untermyer’s ques-
tion eaid that he was a member of the City
Cub. The correspondence which passed be-
tween Mr. Holt and President Little before the
indictment was read. In one of his letters Mr.
Little told Mr. Holt that he was not under the
jpflaence of tho “cohosive power of public
plunder,” a8 he thought the fine old educational
pastodon article had intimated, and Mr, Holt,
polying, assured him that he never thought
be was and apologized if he had {n any way
jptimated such @ thing.

“Well, Mr. Holt.” demanded Mr, Untermyer,
“hat do you understand by the expression
‘cohesive power of public plunder?”

“It ia not my phrase,” replied Mr. Holt, “but
[think I could guess what it meant.”

Mr, Deming objected to the question and
aoswer and the Commissioner ruled that they
were not in order, whereupon Mr. Untermyer
exolaimed: “If this isn’t calling & person a
thief, [don’t know what it is.” Then he asked:
‘Didn't you consider that article a oruel and
gajustiflable attack upon an honorable publio
oficial, Mr. Holt?”

“"T did not.” replied Mr. Holt.

‘Tt uch an article were written against you
would you not feel offended and seek satisfao-
tion?’ demanded the lawyer. Before Mr. Holt
could answer the Commissioner satd that tho

question was improper, Mr.
t jotment and the notification he had received
ofitapresentation by the Grand Jury froma
police officer who had asked him to appear in
court.

Were you first arrested and brought before
aPolice Magistrate?” asked Lawyer Deming.

‘| wag not,’ replied Mr, Holt.

Mr, Holt was followed on the startd by a re-
porter who ha! interviewed the District Attor-
rey immediately after Mr. Holt’s indietment,
Lawyer Deming had a copy of the interview as
pobiiahed, and the reporter swore that Col.
Gardiner had used the expressions, ‘This criti
vam of punlic officials must stop,” and ‘ where
higher oMlieials are concerned he (the District
Attorney! deemed it wiser to Degin actions by
ndietment and that was the reason why Mr
Holt was not first brought before a Magis-
trate,

This practically concluded the examination
of witnesses, One of the eases the papers in
which were put in evidence was that of Trum-
ull W

counse! he learned that he had mada a mistake |

and every effort was made to have the case tn

pnt before it had been disposed of then the
Iiatriet Attorney had presented it tothe Grand
lary and Dr. Cleaveland was indiote The
odietment was dlamiased by Justice MeMahon

The Distriet Attorney tried to have the matter |

gested that the Attorney-Goneral should he

Molineux was indidted and then the insdict-
ment waa dismissed, He was indicted again
and convicted. Mr. Deming offered all the

apers in the case, including the two speeches
oy Col, Gardiner, in evidence to support the
chargethat Col. Gardiner ha! neither “the
mental por the moral sense to qualify him for
hla offlee,””

Mr Untermyer protested against the ‘“veno-
mous assault,’ andas Commissioner Wileox
rebuked Mr. Deming for the language he
used, Mr. Untermverasaid: “['vene doubt bat
that ali the eriminala in New York State agree
with Mr. Deming andthe City Club’ members
that the Distriet Attorney ts flagrantly in-
competent.” Then he asked tanntingly

“Do you propose to offer the convietion of
Molineux asa further evidence of the mental
and moral incapacity of the District Attor-

ney?”

THEATRICAL NOTES,

A Censor at Daly’s—A Sunday Opera—The
Experience of Mrs. Langtry.

Daly’s Theatre has w censor and his namo is

Daniel Frohman. He is the manager also,
“Wheels Within Wheels” {a to be brought out
at that house next Monday. That comedy was
lately successful at the Madison Square, with a
oast made up In part from the stook company
belonging to Daly's. It was one of the cleveroat
of the London output of plays iliuetrating affairs
of courtship and marriage with somewhat
cynical humor. It contained the escapade of a
young wife who was barely saved from an
elopement, but everything was said and dono
politely, except by /im Blagdon, a type of char-
acter known in England asa “bounder”’—that
fe to say, a hoor in good society. Blagdon had
had mannors, and hia biatent talk became
very impolite attimes. But Mr. Frohman has
used a biue pencil on that part, so that in
speech and behavior the fellow, while still 4
“bounder,” shall not be offensive to Daly audi-
ences,

All the theatrical tendencies are not toward
protection for sensitive people. The Sunday
“concert” has taken on dramatjc aspects more
and more in thia city, To the music, which

alone is legal, the performers have made for- |

bidden departures into characters requiring
makeup and costumes, and sketches with
gponery. Now a performance of ‘Vavalieria
Rusticana’ is announced for Easter Sunday at
the New York Music Hall, and it is said that,

if the pollee do not interfere, plays will be per- |

formed regularly in several of the theatres,
Some aspects of the outbreak against im-
moral plays are so abeurd aa to bring the
yhole movement into contempt. When Mrs
Langtry appeared here in “The Degonerates”
er autoblographical exploit as the heroine
was regarded as in the worst possible taste,
but the play, with al! ita tainted atmosphere
and smirched oharactera, contained po seene
of more than mild indecency. Yet Mrs. Lang-
try was prohibited in Detroit, while a band of
half-nude women were unmolestetin a foul
extravaganza, Pittsburg shut her out, but
simultaneously let in Mrs. Fiske with “Becky
Sharp’ and May Howard with living pictures
She has had to give up this week in Newark,

although “Carmen” with its sexuality is being |

performed there both as an opera and as a
Plain drama, and ashamoful burlesque is given
ata vaudeville house. Mra. Langtry's experi-
ence changes her from a culprit into some-
thing like a martyr. :

Relief Fund will be given at the Metropolitan
Opera House on the evening of April 26. Lil-

HIG LEGACY FOR COOPER UNION,

It Will Get All John Haltstead’s Property
When His Poster sister Dies,

The trustees of Cooper Union were surprised
ina pleasant manner when the will of John
Halstead, an old retired tea merchant of this
city who died last May, was offered for pro-
bate. [t was thea found it provided that al!
the residuary estate should revert to that in-
stitution at the death of the testator’s foster
sister, to whom the property was bejueathed,
The trustees, it developed yesterday, have
since been even more surprised to find the
estate to be worth at Jeast $250,000, Owing to
the fact that the property reverta to Conover
Union only upon the death of the present

residuary legatee, the amount of the property
was not looked into at the time by the trustees,
but it was commonly estimated at $40,000,
When the estate was settled up, it was jgund
to consist of many acres o? coal land in West
Virginia, the vaine of which was far beyond
what had been supposed, and securities and
real estate which made the estate a valuable
one. A lot of charitable inatitutionsa. were
named in the will, but the gift to Cooper
Union was made, according to a clause in the
document, Lecanse of the particular interest
the testator had alwaya taken in the Institu-
tion

Some of Admiral Dewey’s friends, and, for
that matter, the Admiral himself, seom tothink

| To those experienced in such matters the ques: |

tion has come, Who is to foot the bills for this

ation it would cost $3,000,000 to organize this

RrAcod upon a@ ballot whieh could be voted,

Fuad Left by W. H. Vanderbilt.

The decision of Surrogate Fitzgerald holding
that the bequest of $5,001,000 in trust under
the will of Willlam H. Vanderbilt ia subject to
the Inheritance Tax law has been affirmed by
the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court,
all the Judges concurring. Under the will the
$5,000,000 was to be held so that the late Cor-
nelius Vanderhtit should have the Income for
life, with power to dispose of the principal
among his children as he chose, If he did not
exercise this power of appointment the fund
on his death was togo in equa! shares tothe
children, The will of Cornelius distributed
the money among /is children. The fund was
not taxed when the estate of William H. Van-
derbilt passed and was taxed, and the law
under which the tax was sought by the Comp-
troller after the death of Vorne;iee wre not
passed untll 1X07, Cornelias died in 1890 and

subject to the law of 1807. The tax Is 300,000.
