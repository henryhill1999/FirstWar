street, and yesterday in the Register's Office
was recorded the wansfer of that property by
Edward EK. McCall, the lawyer, as referee, to
Maud B, Banks, who is Mrs. Theodore H. Banks,
wife of the Nassau street banker. It may be that
since she acquired the property she has sold it
again, or it may be that Mr and Mrs Banke
are the ones who bought the other property and
are going to build the magnificent residence of
