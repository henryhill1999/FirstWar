GAGE'S BOND PLANS

Call for the Withdrawal of Government Funds
Canses Goessing in Wall Street,

The call of Secretary Gage for the with-

Grawal of 5 per cent. of the Government funds

n depository banks, the money so withdrawn

 

to be utilized in paving for ¢ 40) 2
per cent. bonds of Istl, has attracted atten-

tion in Wall Street to the holdings of the local
banks which are subject to withdrawal under

the Secretary's call The total amount of
Public funds held by the depository banks
throughout the yuntry S14. 805,242. OF
this amount the banks in this city hold $40,704,-
400, secured by bonds on deposit at) Wash-
ington The chief depositories, with the
amount of bonds they hold, are National

City Bank, $17,765,000, Hanover National Bank
$6,152,000, National Bank of Commerce, $3,440,000

 

Chase National Bank, $2,218,500, Western Na-
tional Bank, $2,040,000, Local bank officers
think that the cont iplated withdrawal of

City, as only a comparativel ill proportion
of the total amount of the publie deposits ts
held here

There was some talk in the financial district
esterday arising out oof reports that Seere-
ry Gage will soon suspend the further ex-
change of the @ per cents, 4 per cents
of 1907 and of the 5 per cent. bonds for
the new refunding 9 per eents issued under

 

the provisions of the Currency law. Siteht
declines in the market prices of the 4s and
68 were aseribed to t talk According to
the report the Seeretary of ie Treasury in-
tends to make a purchase of bonds in the fall
in the open mar and by suspending bond
exchange operations the prices are likely to
decline to figures which will present a better
purchasing basis

OLD OFFICERS TURNED DOWN.

Consolidated Exchange Regular Ticket Drops
Them for New Men.

A atiff fight is expected at the anffial
election of the Consolidated Stock and
Petroleum Exchange on June il The reg
ular nominating committee of the Ex-
change has presented a ticket, which,
{f elected, will mean a practically complete turn-
over in the management of the institution = M.,
H. Wagar is nominated for President tn place
of Charles G. Wilson, who has been President
fifteen years; C. A. Badeau for First Vice-Presi-
dent in place of Gen, Thomas lL, Watson, who
has held the office about ten years, and F. R.
Grant for Treasurer in place of John Stan-
ton, who has been in office twenty-one years,
The only officera renominated are FB. R.
Hetts for Second Vice-President and
Valentine Mott for chairman. A number of
new inen are named for directors. It is ex-
pected that the friends of President Wilson
and the other old officers will nominate them
on an independent teket

The reason given forthe turn-over {s that the
Nominating Committee thought the members
“wanted a change” in the management
There was no objection, it 1% stated, to
Mr Stanton's renomination excepung
that he declined to accept unless President
Wilson also was renominated) The last time
there was a contest for the Presidency of the
Exchange waa about eight years ago, when the
Mate George Puller ran against breaident Wilson
and was defeated

GOULD WONT SELL MO. P.

 

He Declines Rockefeller’s Request to Set a
Price on His Stock.

There is high authority for the statement that
George J. Gould, President of the Missourt Pa-
cific Railroad, recently declined to listen to a
proposition submitted by a representative of
the Rockefellers to take his Missouri Pacifle
stock athisown price. As the story goes the
Kockefellers, having beeome large holders of
Missouri Pactflo stock desired to obtain full
control They commissioned a New York flnan-
cler to see President Gould and ask bir tf he
would set a price ou the stock held by himself
and those whom he represented

Mr Gould is alleged to have replied that he
would not sell his stock at par, or for 200. In
fact he did not propose to part with it.

A statement was authorized vesterday that
the Missouri Pacific Railway Company has not
sold a dollar's worth of its treasury stock,whieh
how amounts to $7,551,860, It is asserted that
there is in the Missouri Pacifle treasury at
present the same amount of the company’s
stock that was held when the company was
paying dividends

NO SAND DOCKS AT ROSLYN,

 

 

Hempstead Trustees Deny an Application for
a Renewal of Privileges,

Rosnyy, I. 1, May 23. Application for a
renewal of certain sand dock privileges in the
harbor of this place waa denied yesterday by
the Roard of Trustees of the town of North
Hempstead, and many wealthy residents of this
section who were interested in abolishing these

alleved nuisa ‘s are jubilant For several
years sand docks have been maintained on the
east and west sides of the entrance to Hamp-
stead Harbor During that periodit is alleged
thatthe beanty of the harbor has been dis-
fieured by the entting away ofthe green sloping
uplands, leaving nothing but heaps of wubbish
and stretches of barren sand, It is asserred by
thoseonposed tothe docks that the once famous
shore drive whieh was the pride of this village
and formerly was frequented by William Cullen
Bryant was ruined by the work on the docks
and made impassable. The Town Board was
compelled to hold several public meetings, at
which almost everybody “present condemned

FINANCIAL AND COMMERCIAL.

Wenpnespay, May 28.

There was a further falling off Inthe volume
of trading in stocks, and the transactions in
bonds fell below $1,000,000 par value. Sugar
Refining and American Tobaceo again held
the first places in respect to activity, but the
dealings in both were considerably smaller
than yesterday. In Sugar Refining the falling
off was 50 per cent, while the transactions in
American Tobacco were @ third smaller, An
advance of ten centa per hundred pounds tn
the prices of refined sugars caused further
covering of short contracts in Sugar Refining
stock that lifted the price to 117'4. Shortly be-
fore the close, a regort thata trade agreement
for one year as to prices had been made be-
tween the American Company and the #o-
called independent refiners} was cireulated
It apparently originated with the pool that
has been manipulating the stock of the Ameri-
can Company. This report was so absurd that
{t hardly required the prompt denial of the
President of the American Company to dispose
of it. Itshould be obvious to the merest novice
in business affairs that a company of the mag-
nitude of the American Company is not Mkely
to declare a truce for a year, or in fact for any
period, that would enable ita competitors to
make profits with which to continue their fight
against the principal interest in the refining
industry. There were indications that a strong
market for American ‘obacco, Brooklyn Rapid
Transit and Northern Paciflo commoh were
taken advantage of by the pool in Sugar Re-
fining to dispore of apart of thestock it has
accumulated. Toward the close the early {m-
provement in Sugar Refining was lost andthe
final price was fractionally below that ef yes-
terday,

There was nothing new regarding American
Tobacco, The market for {t appeared to re-
flect the same tactics that have been employed
in Sugar Refining to drive the short interest to
cover, ‘The prospect of a good summer's busi-
ness was responsible for the advancein Brook-
lyn Rapid Transit. The moderate yet effective
buying of Northern Paciflo econmon appeared
to come chiefly from Berlin, where reports of
an ineresse in the next semi-annual dividend
upon the stock are Just becoming current. As
to-morrow, Ascension Day, is a holiday in Ber-
Hin, it's probable that there will be a cessation
of the demand for stocks from that
centre. The market as a whole approacheda
condition of traditional midsummer dulness. The
taking!of $1,250,000 gold for shipment to Parts to-
morrow had no effect upon any of the financial
marketa. A further decline In the price of coke
and the probability that many ovens will be
shut down because of the falling off in the de-
mand from tron manufacturers caused a little
selling of the tron and steel stocks. The closing
was very dull and irregular
