TROUBLE OVER PARIS REGAITA, |

Conditions Upset English Oarsmen and May
Affect American Crew.

An unexpected complication has arisen in
connection with the international regatta to
take place at Paris this year, which will appar-
ently result in the absence of the English col-
lege and rowing club crews from the races and
may affect the entry of the Americans in at
least one event. The first news of the situation
received in this country is contained in the fol-
lowing comment which appeared tn the London

Sporting Life of May 9
“It is now practically settled that Light and

Dark Blues will be strongly represented at
Henley, although entries for the ‘Grand’ will
not be as numerous as predicted, Itisallup
with Paris competition, however, owing to the
absurd regulations laid down by the executive.
Fancy the senior and juntor eights, fours and
even pairs being rowed with coxswains! This
would mean new craft and totally new condi-
tions, the which very few Fnglish crews will
tolerate. It really looks as if the Pars execu-
tive is trying to make English competition
impossible. Anyway it is hardly lkely that

university men and others will go out of their
Way to fulfll such utterly crudeand nonsensical
regulations. The pity of it!” ,

Secretary Fred. R. Fortmeyer of the Na-
tional Association of Amateur Oarsmen was
much surprised when shown the above para-
graph. For the t eighteen months he has

’en in communication with Edmund Fleu-
tiaux, Secretary of the French Association, con-
cerning the details of the proposed raves, and
during that time informed him that the custom
in thia country is to row all races, except the
eights, without coxswains, and until yesterday
had no .dea that the events at Paris would not
be run in conformity with the recognized rules
inv here and in Engiand.

The Fnglishmen’s growl is unwarranted so
far as concerns the dight-cared races, aa it is
customary everywhere to carry coxswains In
those events, Nothing is said in the artiole
about the double geulls, so that it is presumed
they will be rowed as usual without coxswains.
The news regarding the pair-oared races does
not affect the proposed American entries, as it
has been determined not to send representa-
tives to contest in that event

The,most serious item is in reference to the
fours, as {t has been pianned to send the
winners In that class at dhe trial races to com-
pete in France. If the regulation recarding
partying a coxewain in thia race is obligatory,
it will mean an immediate change of — on
the partof the N. A A. 0 and perhaps the
abandonment of the idea to send such @ crew
In view of the correspondence which has
passed on the subject Secretary Fortmeyer 18
loath to believe that such is the case, but he will
lose no time in obtaining a confirmatian or
denial of the report so that the association here
will know how to act. _A letter was {mimne-
diately sent to Secretary Fleudiaut quoting the
paragraph tn Sporting Life and asking for
definite information as to which crews will be
required to carry coxswains.

If itis found that a coxswain in the fours {s
optional with the competitors, Seeretary Fort-
Ineyer said that the Americans wil be perfecuy
willing to accept the conditions. In that cnse
they will take issue with the Frenchmen, send
over a crew without a coxswain and take the
chance of steering astraight course rather than
sutup with the handicap of an additional man
n the boat

Outside of its prébable effect on the repre-
sentation of America In the four-oared race,
the newa had a disquieting influence on oars-
men generally, as one of the chief objects in
sending the crews abroad was the chance pro-
vided of meeting the Henley winners or the
best English crews on © neutral course, If the
disaatisfaction in Fogland with the executive
of the Paris regatta is as great as indicated
there is every probability that thia object will
not be attained, and {t is felt that the honors
rained will be empty tf the acknowledged
f nglish champions decide to sulk

 

LOCAL TEAM FOR PARIS,

Athletic Enthastaste Trying to Induce the City
to Be Represented at International Games,

A movement is on foot ainong the local athe
letic leaders to ormanize a team to represent the
city of New York at the International games to
take place at Paris this eurmmer. The idea
cropped up ata meeting of the Championship
Committee of the Metropolitan Asaoetation heid
yesterday and steps were immediately taken to
put the acheme into execution.

Theplan most favored is to have the team
sent under the direction of the city authorities,
and if poasible to obtain a grant from the mue-
nicipal funds to further the object. John P.
Boyle, President of the Pastime A. C., who
was at the conference, waa deputized to bring
the matter to the attention of Alderman George
Burrell, who 8 a member of the P A.C. and tn
his day was an active athlete. He is expected
to bring the scheme before the Board of Alder-
mer and to urge {ts adoption One argument
in its favor is the fact that Boston has already
dex ided to be represented by a team, and that
New York should not be outdone by the Hub.

If the idea meets with favorit is intended
that only American citizens and voters be sent
It is also proposed to boida set of trial games
open to athletes residing in the Metropolitan
Association, tinder the management of a com-
mittee comprised of one member from each
club in the district, to seleot the men to repre-
sent the city A good part of the money re-
quired for expenses is likely to be furnished
from the @ate whicha set of games of this char-
acter would attract,

These games will be held, if at all, on June 12,
sliowing ample time to send the inen to Parisin
time for the sports which begin on July 15

President James E. Su.livan of the Metropoli-
tan Association is heartily in favor of the idea,

nd thinks that in case the Aldermen fail to
favor the project it could be carried throughon
a more limited scale by the clubs of this district,
with the aid of a popular subscription,

LIPTON INCREASES HIS

 

 

 

OPFER,

Will Give 61,000 Instead of $500 for New
Vork Yacht Club Races,

Commodore Lewis Cass Ledyardof the New
York Yacht Club yesterday received a cable
gram from Sir Thomas Lipton, who isan hon-
orary member of the club, confirming his re-
cent offerto give acup or prize money to be
competed for by yachts of any class in the
squadron, The original offer was for the value
of $600, but Jin yesterday's cablegram Sir
Thomas signified his desire to increase the
Q@mount to f*e1,000, The club will probably not
take action on the matter until {ts next general
meeting, but. of course, the new offer will be
accepted as the originalone was. The donor's
original cablegram read aa follows:

‘““aean honorury member of the club would
be delighted if the committee would accept $500
cup or check for amount as prize for competi
tion during coming season in whatever class of
yachta committee might decide upon

The club has not decided whether {t will put
the entire amount into one prize, but some of
the members at the clubhouse last night
thought this would be done.

 

 

JEFFRIES AND SHARKEY AGAIN,

O'Rourke Covers the Champion's Forfeit and
Agrees to Make a Match To-day.

Unless either of the contracting parties see
fit to wriggle out of it, another match hetween
Jim Jeffries and Tom Sharkey will be made
to-day. Yesterday, Tom ©'Rourke, acting on
the request of the ex-sallor, took the first steps
to clinch a fight by handing a certified check of
$2,500 to Al Smith, thereby covering 4 forfeit of
a similar amount which W. A. Bra iy posted for
the champion the other day O'Rourke told

 
 

THE SUN reporter last night that Brady called
upon him during the afternoon and thata
match between the two big fellows was dis-
cussed,

“T told him that I would meet him at his
office at 4 o'clock to-morrow afternoon,’
© Rourke sald, ‘‘and he waa satisfied Sharkey
prefersa battle of twenty-five rounds Iean-
not say exactly whenthe fight will take place
It will be decided as quickly as possible.”

When Brady was seen he said “Jeffries {s pre-
pared to take on Sharkey, anda contest wil be
arrang*d without delay I want {t tocomeoff
within a month's time if possible Jeffries is
willing to fight any of the big men, and [am
gind that Sharkey has at last consented to go
into the ring with him again "

The fight, if itis arranged, will be fought at
Coney Island. The club, eo O'Rourke states,
will make a liberal offer” Sharkey has two

NOW FOR THE BELMON',

AISTORIC RACE THE FEATURE OF
MORRIS PARK'S CLOSING DAY.

 

 

Yesterday's Sport at Westchester Pleases Vis-
itors -Sweet Lavender Wins the Gatety Im-
Dressively—The Van Cortlandt Handicap a
Popular Victory for Vulcain—To-day's Cord.

The spring meeting of the Westchester Rac-
{ng Association has now reached its final stage
after fourteen days of sport among thorough-
breda which would have closely approached the
ideal standard if the weather had held good
Since Monday the elements have been favor-
able, and yesterday waa faultless for an outing
Two popular stake features adorned the card.
Those who followed favorites broke at least
even with the ring, three first choices winning

The hurdle event, which is daily growing tn
favor, opened the day's racing. Gov. Griggs,
Monroe Doctrine, Lackland, Athamas and King
Bon were taken out, leaving @ handy field of
five with FMilon d'Ora slight favorite over Dr
Eichberg. Tbe Dootor made strong running
for over a mle, but this suited Filon d'Or who
made his bid in the last half-mile and won
easily by eight lengths. Even then ho clipped
three-quarters of a second off the course record
made by Lackland the other day.

Gold Lace made it two straight forthe talent
by sprinting clean away from the field of
maiden three-year-olds and upward down the
Eclipse course. The third event was another
sce mper down the hill for two-year-olds and
McCue scored his first win since his reinstate-
ment with the Kingston filly Ondurdis. Con-
nie, the outsider of the party, showed early
speed, but then flopped all over the track leav-
{ng the lead to Ondurdis, with Gold Heels
and Scurry in hot pursuit. They flrished in
this order and the wise men of the ring smiled
for the first time, as they had gathered in a lot
of welcome money on Sourry

Ten fillies accepted for the Gaity Stakes. The
Walden pair, Anecdote and Educate, showed
the master hand of their trainer, and when 2 to
1 against their chances could no longer be had,
9 to 56 was freely taken. Then M, Murphy's
grotesquely named, but bloodlike Tower of
Candles, dropped from 6 to 1 to 9 to2,and
meanwhile the Litdefleld following was
60 busy backing Sweet Lavender that
her odds tumbled from 6 to 1 to 7 t 2
before the rank and “file took the
hint. The high-strung youngsters were unruly
at the post, but finaily gotaway In fair order,
Tower of Candles raced to the front at the first
pole, but Littlefield gradually urged Sweet Lav-
ender pastthe Candlemas filly, and nursed

her home an easy winner by a length
and a half. It was one of the vet-
eran’s cleverest rides and boosted his
waning popularity among horsemen, Clubmen,

 

 

form players and general tipsters were a unit
in selecting Vulcain to win the Van Cortlandt
and the Kingston three-year-old was quickly
played to odds on. All Gold and Kinnikini
closed next in
veritable “whipsaw
their order of favoritism Vuloain
clear on the inner rail opposite the fel
closure, but All Gold challenged resolutely,
Turner had to drive the favorite hard to
squeeze home by a head. Kinnikinic closed
withafine burst of speed and finished at All
Gold's shoulder, O'Connor complained against
Turner, but the numbers stood

Another rousing finish developed in the sixth
race, a selling event for three-year-olds andjup-
ward. First Whip, Precursor and Sparrow
Wing fought it out through the last furlong,
only three-quarter-length intervals dividing
them at the line

Inquiries were rife on all sides as to the pos-
sible result of to-day's time-honored event, the
Belinont Stakes, Apart altogether from {ts
historic prestige and the liberal manner ty
which it is endowed by the association and
August Belinont, the stake commands the at-
tention of breeders and buyers as one of the
most crucial tests of three-year-old speed and
stamina

The fleid named for the thirty-fourth renewal
of the Belinont to-day is small numerically, but
the quality of the class represented is beyond
question Jobn E. Madden's candidate is Grul-
den, a Snpendthrift colt, who mixed it up with
Mexmerist @ couple of times as a two-year-old,
and showed high speed in his only appearance
this year. Harimock, who will carry the colors
and hopes ot P J. Dwyer, needs no higher ref-
erence than his public trial between races on
Wednesday

Arthur Featheratone has an exceptional pair
fn Missionary and Mesmerist, but the latter
may be wil! lrawn, as the Western horseman
(se wreatly impressed with the present form of
Missionary Ine Keenes have also named a

 

 

femand, and the result was a

patr, Petruchio and Toddy. The well-named
deacendant of Hot Seotech has been prepared
especial\y for the Belmont, and he will pr ba-
bly be the choice of the stable, although both

may atart. Lugene Leigh ia quietly confident
of fidrirs's abiity, and the Standing people
think their colt has a royal chance

If the race for the Eclipse Stakes turns out a
comparative failure as @spectacie the associa-
tion cannot be blamed, The event is richly en-
dowed and dozens of two-year-olds are not
oniy eliwible, buton the spot and fit enough to
take an outside chance tt is probably a plain
case of ‘scare, four of the five named having
been linpressive winners during the past week,
while the Whitney colt, Prince Charles, was
second in his only start. The minor events on
the card have filled well and the meeting at
headquarters promises to wind up with éclat

How They Finished at Newport.

CINCINNATI, May 23.—Two races at Newport to
day were of unusual Interest. One of these was 6
free bandicap at a mile and $0 yards. Eberbart,

the winner, was clearly ahead of his company, com-
ing away and winning as be pleased. But the cbiet
interest centred in the last race, amile affair, because
ne of the starters was St Ivor, that is a candidate for
tonia Derby Bonors, The son of St Florian and
imp Medusa got away first and maintained bis lead
until the stretch was reached when he tired and was
only able to finish fourth. The three-year-ol filly
Cheat owned by Rutledge and Stevens, fell and
broke her neck while being exercised at Latonia this
morning. Jockey Britton, who was riding her, suf-
tered a dislocated hip. Summaries

NEWS OF THE WHEELMEN.

 

Major Taylor Will Probably Be Reinstated

This Week.

After the off season of 1800, when there was
turmoil and bickering every where in the cycle-
racing game, a reaction of the most positive
kind seems to be at hand, and the summer prom-
ises more sport of keener character and cleaner
character and greater variety than has been
witnessed for several years. The stars who
dropped out last year have returned; new ones
have sprung up and nearly all of them are de-
veloping from specialists to allearound men,
able to compete in short races or the motor-
cycle game. Every day brings fresh news of

nterest.

The latest, which was revealed yes-

terday, is that Major Taylor, the colored boy,
who holds the world’s record at a mile, is to be
reinstated by the other professionals on the
payment of a fine and is likely to be seen in the

ear because he had first
