DOUGLAS LEADS AT GOL
FORMER AMATEUR CHAMPION AHEAD

IN THE M. G. AL EVENT.
Thirty-two Quallfy at the Nassau Country
Club for the Match Play To-day — Fine
Scores Over the Well Adapted Links
Schoolboy Beats Out the Colleglans.
Anew record for the Nassau Country Club
links was made yesterday by Findlay 8. Doug-

fying round of the second annual Metropolitan
Golf Association championship tournament,
His ecard showed, 80, 82, 162, which has never
been equalled in a competition over the links,
The last nine holes in the morning were made
in 86 andin the afternoon in 30

“Folks have been saying | could not put,”
said Douglas gleefully after the early round,
“Thave thought all along that if the greens
were right Eequid get the ball down and to-day
I prove it’

His long game was the best Douglas has
shown since the amateur championship last
July andon the short game he was terrific
The approach shots always gave to him a@
chance to put out and usually he ran down the
ball. Playing the third hole in the morning
Douglas was in the bunker from his second, a

mashie shot, and the hole cost him @ +x
But once the turn for home was made
Douglas's game was ideal He was paired
with Travis and had the better of the
long game throughout, but on the short
game, strong as Douglas was, Travis

quite held his own, Hamilton did very well,
but Travis beat him a stroke. His partner,
Brooks, runner-up last year, after a 3 on the
first green did little that was brilllant. Norris
was next in line with 173, theu came Seeley, with
176, the schoolboy making the two collegians in

the race look like outsiders. A. Graham and
Tyng were tied at 179, but all the others had an
average over fives, Harrinian leading this divi-
sion with Ist

So much tor the scores. The conunittee, as
there were fifty-three to start, raised the mum
ber to qualify from sixteen to thirty-two, and

there were four tied at 196 forthe two last
laces on the list) Ef the oriwinal limit had
wen retained 186 would have been the top

score Championships should be on a more
severe standard thau the ordinary open tourna-
ment, as many of the wolferssaid, and perhaps
it Wasa mistake to raise the ldimit. On such a
charming day and with but little wind, more-
overona links that could hardly be excelled,
in the spring atany rate, an averame of five
should atleast be expeeted from a. lieh-class
wolfer, Both Travis and Allen had holes in. 2
Kmmet was wofully off in putting, but his
long game was very good. The prominence of
the players Whose names are notoften seen in
the first set at tournaments was the most pleas-
ina lesson of the play. When the matches be-
gin this morning the plavers in this set will
make many @ mix-up. Eight of the sixteen
woo qualified last year are againin this vear’s
select set. The result in the qualifying round |
luat year wasa tie between Douglas, Harriman |
and Tyng, at 173) If anything, us now ar-
ranged, the Nassau links compels the finest
golfing, and the seores would indicate our
amateurs are steadily climbing up in class All
are eager for the tnateh play and what it will
eal
Thank heavens, this trumpery sort of plav
fsover'’ Harriman said as he handed in his
eard. To-day the match-play devotees will
have their opportunity

Phere was not a great attendance at the links,
vet the grounds and the clubhouse were gay
with onlookers There were tents of bright
stripestolunchin and torest in at the firat tee
Thesplendid clubhouse was wide open for the
plavers and their friends. The cottagers came

  

 

to the golting in carriages, on horseback, or
a-wheel, and, in one instance at least, ona
dastring aut mobile. Harvey) Murdock, the
Nassau President, started off the plavers,
and the club's secretary, Wo Crittenden
Adams, made a vigilant guardian of the
score board, The M G A officials

on hand were R. H. Robertson, O W. Bird and
CL Tappin. Harry B. Hollins, Jr, of West-
brook, could not start, as he has a Harvard en-
trance examination to pass — Other with-
drawals were Howard A. Colby of | Kssex

I have examined Warner's
Safe Cure and am pleased to
say that I find it a valuable herbal
remedy, containing ingredients cal-
culated to give health and renewed
power and energy to the sick. I have
tried it personally and find it is a fine
tonic for a sluggish liver, restorin
it to a natural healthy action an
bringing back the vim and en-
exgy of perfect health,

Washington, D. C.,
Feb. 23, 1900,

In my experience with the sick,
I have seen some very serious cascs of
kidney and bladder troubles cured through
the use of Warner’s Safe Cure, after doctors
had fatled to do any good. I have used it my-
self several times when bilious and for indiges-
tion, and never have failed to find help from its
use. Iam therefore pleased to endorse it as well
worthy the confidence of those suffering with
stomach troubles or diseases of the pelvic

organs,

Delicious, Wholesome and Not Dear,

When buying a tin

of Van Houten’s

Chocolate Drops, or a similar

tin of Van Houten'’s Choco-

late Croquettes, the purchaser gets

a splendid kind of Chocolate, in a convenient,

edible form, and after it has been tried, the fla-
vor is certain to be pronounced “ Delicious !”

Those who prefer the Tablet form can procure
the Chocolate in that shape, and also in small
bars.

Van Houten's Chocolate, of irreproachable
composition, forms a splendid and delicious snack
when on a pic-nic, a journey, or when out for a
spin on the wheel.

Taking into consideration the quality of Van
Houten’s Chocolate, it is not dear.
