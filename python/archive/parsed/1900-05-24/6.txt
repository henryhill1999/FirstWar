NO MUTINY ON THE TEXAS.

The Little Trouble That Occurred Was Be-
tween the Men and Petty OMicers.

Too much indulgence in liquor caused an out-
break among the enlisted men on board the
U.S. battleship Texas on her recent cruise,
The whole affair was not more serious than
dozens of other disturbances aboard ship about
which nothing is ever heard outside Of the Navy
Department Capt, W. ©, Gibson on the one
hand and the enlisted men on the other laugh
at the suggestion that there was anything in
the nature of a mutiny aboard.

What did happen was this: While the ship
was at Galvesion In April taking part in the |
celebration, there were many visitors aboard,
some of whom brought liquorto the men. It
was alinost impossible to prevent this. Two of
the men Were arrested and this caused some
{il-feeling between some of the other men and
the petty ofloers, From time to time this feel-
ing broke out after the ahip left Galveston, but
it did not reach so serious an aspect that it was
brought to the attention of the captain until
the Texas arrived at Bermuda, There the men
were set to work upon the decks with a shellac

mixture made of what is called Venetian red
andalcobol, Among themany traditions, worth
and otherwise, which the American jac
hands down one that tells how to
extract a highly intoxicating drink from this
shellac, A numberof the men mixed the shel-
lac with water, stirred the mess violently until
the alcohol was clarified and the foreiga matier
collected in the centre by centripetal force
Then they poured off the watered aleohol,
mixed it with sugar and lemon juice when they
could contriva to get hold of those adjuncts,
and proceeded to get very drunk upon it. In
the resultant intoxication some of the drinkers
became imbued with ao high an ambition for
more stimulus that they undertook to drink
the shellac mixture as itstood and were made
exceedingly ill

One day the Captain noticed one of the men
intoxieated and ordered him below, The mas-
ter-at-arms Who took the man down was one of
the officers against whom the men had become

prejudiced at Galveston and several of the ar-

 

 

rested man’s companions attacked him, begin-
ning the attack by throwing a bueket upon him
as he was going down with his prisoner. Then
they made arnsh tor him Butother menrbes
of the crew pitched incon behalf of (he masters
at-arms and the row was soon over, that officer
having come out with nothing worse than a cut
on the forehead and avother on the back of the
head. Inall, nine men were put under arrest,
and when the ship reached Hampton Roads
there was a court-martial in which seven of
them were found guilty and! referred to the
Secretary of the Navy for punishment.

“All talk abouta mutiny is nonsense,’* said
Capt. Gibson 1o a SUN reporter vesterday
“Nor is it true that the men on the Texas area
particularly tough crowd. Itis common for
mien to get drink in some way on shipboard and
So far as the reports are
were mufinous or in-

then make trouble
concerned that the men
solent toward the officers they are utterly
groundless What little trouble there was
was between the men and the petty officers"
Several men ofthe crew with whom the re-
porter talked sald that there had been nothing
likea mutiny, but that some of the men ha
got too much to drink aud nade fools of theim-

selves

“LA TRAVIATA’ AT THE AMERICAN,

What Is Said to Be the First English Per-

“La Traviata” in English in New York dur-

dificult to explain, vet Verdi's opera was sung
last night at the American Theatre. None
of the composer's operas seems more utterly

WRS, LANGTRY SAILS AWAY,
A Passenger on the St. Louls Yesterday

Others on Outgoing Steamers.

Mrs. Langtry, whose theatrical engagement
in this country closed with a performance of

“The Degenerates” at) Worcester, Mass, on
Tuesday evening, sailed yesterday forenoon
on the St. Louis.

“T am coming back to America again, of

course,” she said, “but probably not next fall.
My trip here has been a very successful one
although in several cities I found a strong senti-
mentin favor of the Boers and ‘The Abrent
Minded Beggar’ was not so well received when
recited.’

Mrs. |.angtry was registered on the pas-
senger list as Mrs. De Bathe. Mr. and Mrs.
Geo Gould and Miss Helen Gould had a

  

dou incentive for going to the pier to see the
St. Louis sail, for among the passengers were
Frank Gould, the late Jay Gould's youngest
son, and Lady Mary Sackville, who has been
the guestof Mr. and Mra. George Gould,

Among the theatrieal people on the steam
ship are Mme. Emma Nevada She was ac-
companied by Dr. B. Palmer, her husband.

Phere was a brass band on the pier whieh
played in honor of William Furst, the theatrical
musical director, who sailed with his wife.
Other passengers were Col William [. Elkins
of Philadelphia: Al Hayman, Mrs. Frank Les-
lie and Col. M. J. O Brien

On the Tentonie which sailed at noon was
Rev. Charles M. Sheldon, who recently
ducted the Topeka Capital on theological lines
for a week. Mr. Sheldon is going to the Paris

NEWSBOYS AT ROSIE'S FPUNERAL,

Meanwhile They Are Taking Care of the Cor-
coran Business at the Bridge.

The funeral of Rosie Coreoran, the Brooklyn
Bridge newsgiri, will be held from her home at
102 James street, to-morrow, She will be buried
in Cavalry Cemetery. Last night the women
friends of Mrs, Corcoran, who are very many in
Cherry and Water and Henry streets, sat in the
front room about Rosie's white-covered coffin

and commented tearfully on the uncertainties
of life, Inan outer room at the head of the
stairs sat Rosie's oldest brother surrounded by
alargenumber of his friends. Pipes and to-
baceo and other simple refreshments were pro-
vided for them

Most of the Park row newsboys Intend to go
to Rosie's funeral A number of them volun-
tarily took the Coreorans’ places at the Bridge
entrance yesterday and carried on the businses
for them under the supervision of Mra, Corco-
ran'srival, Mra Shea, who was anxious that
the respeet which the family was showing for
its dead might not costit toomuch. Mrs. Cor-
coran, who has had vears of bitter experience
with the Parkrow newsboys, sent them word by
visitors atthe house that if they thought they
were making @ permanent entrance on her
territory under the semblance of doing her a
favor she would take great pleasure in showing
them to the contrary when the period of her
mourning Was over

SPARRING WITH GARDINER,

DULNESSG@ DEPARTS TEMPORARILY
FROM THE WILCOX HEARING

  

 

And More or Less KRepartee Gets IntorCirca.
lation. Colonel's Military Record Gone
Into His Medal of Honor and His Family
Tree He Calls Citizen Deming "My Man,”

Distriet Attorney Gardiner’s Cross-@xanmina-
thon was taken up before Commissioner Wilgo x
yesterday and was unfinished when the hear-
ing adjourned at 5 o'clock, Horace E. Deming,
for the Attorney-General, questioned the wit.
neas about bis ariny record, his right by virtue
of descent to iembership in the Soclety of Cin-
cinnati, his father's army record, bis grand-
father’s army record and his great-grand-
father’s record. At times during the quivzing
Col. Gardiner showed signs of intenservexation.
He also vexed Mr. Deming by calling'thim "My

man"

“LT enlisted as Captain of Company I, Rifty-
first New York Volunteers, on May 23, tse,"
said Col. Gardiner, in response to Mr. Denting’s
questioning ‘“To-day is the anniversary of my
enlistment. I was discharged on Aug, 7, 1861,
owing to my father’s death. IT was in the
skirmish at Fairfax Court House and at Bull
Run. In May, 1862, Preentered the service and
served until September After a second honor-
able discharge I went into the army again In
1883. I wasin Carlisle, Pa, during the battle of
Gettysburg. Carlisle was included inthe battle.

It was shelled,”
“Did you hear the guns?’ asked Mr. Deming.

“No, Lean't recall that { did,’’ said the Col-
onel after a few minutes’ reflection

“Isn't Carlisle twenty miles from Gettys-
burg?”

“T don't know.’

The Distriet Attorney was questioned regard-
ing his medal of honor, whieh he said was
awarded him thirty years ago for distinguished
services Hesaid that he did not kuow why
his name was not included in the oflcial list of
oMeoers so distinguished

“dn your answer you state that vour ancestry
isan honotable one, that your family has re-
sided in this city since the days of Wouter Van
Twiller, and that you don't know who the
signers of the charges are. Do you consider
such statements an answer to the charges?”
asked Mr) Deming

"I consider respectable antecedents an in-
centive to live upto them, After all, handsome
is as handsome does,’ was Col, Gardiner’s
answer,

“Do vou consider such statements an ane
swer?'' repeated Mr Deming

“Why ot course to such vague, wild, slander-
ous, Vituperative, atrocious attacks upon & life-
long citizen,” answered the witness "My good,
level-headed friend. Chief Clerk MeKenna, ad-
vised me to put that in.”

May we go on with the cross-examination,”
interruptod Mr. Untermyer

“May Leoon, vou mean,” said Mr. Deming
u're always going on {To Col, Gardiner]
Did your father live here?”

“What rot! Why, he was baptized in St
Paul's,” answered the witness

“Did vour father join the army?”

The witness couldn't remember, nor did he
know whether it was his father's father or his
great grandfather who fought in the Revyolu-

 

tion

"Well, which sde did he fight on?” was
asked

"Youshow very little knowledgo of American
history [don't know which side he fought on
IT never saw him

“Well, you have testified that you areamem-
ber of the Society of Cincinnati. How can your
membership be genuinely basedis you don't
know whether your father’s father or your
wreat grandfather fought in the Revolution?”
asked Mr Detoing

*Mero bership io the Cincinnati is based upon
either direct or collateral descent. I had a
mother. Would vou like me to write you ont
my genealogical tree, my man?”

Col. Gardiner here recovered from his vexa-
tion toamile frinmphantly at Mr Deming, who,
usually very amiable in his expression, did not
smile for the remainder of the day
inl perogatives?

  

 

 
  

      
      

“Have you any cpnstitutic
was one of the ug ons asked) The answer
was: “LE fancy that the constitutional provisions

 

relating to my office are still in force”

Mr Deming annonneed that argument aa to
whether the prosecution would be allowed to
introduce additional speetfications to the
charges would have to be postponed

PRESBYTERIAN ASSEMBLY SENDS THE
QUESTION TO A COMMITTEE.

Will ?.-00rt Next Year-Dr. Birch Withdraws
Appeal inthe McGiffert Case-The Kev. W.
MB. Noble of California Elected Permanent
Clerk Report of Foreign Mission Board,
St. Louis, Mo., May 23.~The question of a
revision of the Westminster Confession was
by « vote of the Presbyterian Cieneral Assem-
bly this afternoon placed in the hands of a
Committee of sixteen to report back to the
Assembly next year. This cominittee will
compare, analyze and summarize suggestions
from the Presbyteries, which are invited to
tuke action on the “whole matter of a restate-
ment of the doctrines most surely believed
among us and which are substantially em-
bodied in our Confession of Faith.” An hour's
discussion preceded the adoption of this plan
Following the action on the creed revision
the Assembly elected the Rev. William B. Noble,
DD. D., of Redlands, Cal, permanent clerk from
& fleld of seven candidates. The MeGiffert case
was disposed of by the Rev. Dr George W.
F. Birch withdrawing his appeal atter it had
been declared regular
The report of the Board of Foreign Missions
was the important order of business at the
morning session. It was presented by the
Rey. Ur. Charles Cuthbert Hall of New York,
chairman of the committee. Dr. Hall said that

the report was filled with gladness and sadness
He said that the board was operating in twelve
countries of the world and maintaming 127 sta-
tions with 1,748 American men and women act-

ing a@ missionaries Passing to matters of
administration, the report said that the re-
ceipts of the board in 1800 were $020,825, the

largest contribution since 1896. The eommit-
tee stated that the amount was not commensu-
rate with the money spent on home churches,

Dr. Hall closed his reading of the report by
an eloquent plea that the Assembly fndorse the
action of the Board of Foreign Missions last
May in New York, in declaring for the coopera-
tion of the Presbyterian Church with churches
of other denominations in their work of evan-
welization in foreign lands

The portion of the report dealing with the
Catholic Church and the friars of the various
orders in the Philippines was in part as follows:

"Questions as to the character and influence
of the Koman Catholic friars in the Philippines
have been much discussed. Archbishop Cha-
pelle has publicly indorsed them in an article
published in this country as if it were possible
to convinee the American public that these
men had been worthy representatives of the
meek and lowly Saviour, the great Physician
of souls and the Peinee of Peace. On the other
hand the concurrent testimony of Government
agents, army chaplains and soldiers of all
ranks, authors and tourists, as well as misston-
arias, has given them a most unenviable char-
acter in almost every respect. The mainspring
of the uprising of the people against Spain was
found in the widespread diswust and despera-
tion of the people at the outrages of these rep-
resentatives of the Catholic Church. So far
from any disafectiontoward Americans on the
score of their supposed disapproval of of their
hostility toward the Catholic friars, Filipines
have uniformly rather shown a dread lest the
United States Government should reinstate
these, thelr old age-long oppressors.

“That the Government should exert any {m-
proper interference with the affairs of the
Catholie Church in the Philippines is not to be
desired by any eandid observer. It is not de-
sired by Protestant missionaries, but all the
efforts of the Roman Catholie hierarchy, either
in the eld or by the diplomacy of distingulshed
prelates in this country, ought to be resented
and opposed in the interests, not merely of
Gospel truth, but in the interest also of the
great fundamental principles of religious libs
erty, upon which our Constitution and our whole
history have been made to rest. There cannot
bean established Church with relations of Chureh
and State in any part of the United States, yet
this is practically what Romanists seem to
desire and strive after."
