KSTATE NEWS,

nting rumors of sales that were not
absolutely confirmed, last week was still so
at vo for real estate men as to encourage the
iatthat the realty market is entering upon
a naw perio loft activity. The causes of the ex-
sonsive dealing during the week were not new.
They have been present in the market since
the assured success of the renting season, |nat
fali, but their nfluence was evident forthe firat
time last week There is reason to believe
that they will be potent for many weeks to
come, th ugh this belief may fail of justifica-
tion and the market may slump back into its
{nert condition of the early fall and winter.

An encouraging feature of the week's busi-
peas was the amount of investment buying in

the sales re ported, This feature was more
noticeable than it has been for several months
and seems to | ndicate that investors are about
to return to realty from atook dealing, in which
case activity 's assured for some time to come.

Broadway property predominated tn the list
of transactions reported, the sales including

the southwest corner of Broadway and Walker
atreat, bought by Henry Corn for improvement;
the corresponding corner at Broadway and
rifty-fourth street, secured by an out-of-town
investor; five lote at the northeast corner of
Broadway and Seventy-first street, bought by

abuilier: the block front on the west side of
breed Wer. between Eighty-fifth and Fighty-
sixth streets, also bought by builders, and the
reported aala,which yet lacks certain confirma-
tion, of the apartment house on the south
aide of 108th strest, extending from Broad-
wayto West End avenue, Upper Broadway
also shared in the activity. Nine lots on the
northwest corner of Broadway and 10th
gtreet were soldon Saturday, as were lots at
l4eth street, The lots at 190th street formed
part of an important transaction in Twelfth
ward property, atotalof nearly thirty lote on
Broalway, W adeworth avenue, Hawthorne
street, Sherman avenue, Audubon avenue and
Past avenue being sold,

Fitth avenue property founda placa in the list
through an Important exchange, The Nevada
apartment house was exchanged by Flako &
Dowling foreight lots on the avenue, between
qoeth and LO7Tth streets, five lots on 107th
atreet, east of the avenne, and two lots on the
southeast corner of the avenue and 100th street,
The various other sales of the week were both
numerous and important, and would have made
the week an active one without the dealing
on Broadway and Fifth avenue They in-
eluded another pot of the old asylum property
fronting thirty feet on Fifty-flrat street, and
adjoining the Park plot; Nos, 114 and 116 Lib-
erty street, abutting on Cedar atreet, for which
iz at Nos, 274 and 276

One interesting transfer wis recorded, —Will-

Company, took title to No. 13 Broadway and
thus secured all but twoofthe parcels in the

is probable that when these are secured a big
