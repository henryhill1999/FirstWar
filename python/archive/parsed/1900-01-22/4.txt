Early Football Practice at Old Venn,

Champion James J, Jeffries will cease giving
exhibitions on the road this weok and aftera
brit lay-off will go to Allenhurst, N. J., to pre-
pare for his coming battle with James J, Cor-
bett. While this match is generally pooh-
poohed by sporting men because of the belief
that Corbett has not a chance, there are others
who feel that the man who conquered John L,
Sullivan may get into condition once more so
axto get an opportunity to outpoint Jeffries
through sheer cleverness, The champion says
that after he has met Corbett he intends to
takealong restin spite of his manager, W. A,
Brady, who wants him to continue on the road.

“| peed a reat,” Jeffries says, “and I must
haveit. Ithink [have kept my word with the
American people in regard to meeting al!
comers, and when I have disposed of Corbett
I will have all ring records broken, so far as
engaging in contests is concerned, for I am
the only champion who has agreed to fight
three men in leas than a year, Last June, be-
fore I met Fitzsimmons, I was tho laughing
stock of the sporting world, but I won easily.
Then I met Sharkey and defeated him fairly
and squarely, and now they ask me to tackle

Corbett.”

“Tam anxious to meet Corbett, for I have a
avore tosettle, At Carson City I was hts box-
ing partner when he was getting ready for
Fitzsimmons. Then [ was a good fellow in his

estimation because [ never tried to hurt him
in practice bouts, Since then he has said that
he used to knoek ine out every Morning betore

to show how much trath there is in his state-
menta. Willl beat him? Well, rather easily.

“If Choynski does not. agrea to meet me,

was practically knocked out in jig time the |

other night by Choynski. The latter has since
then posted $500 asa forfeit to bind another
match, The money isin the hands of George
Considine, manager of the Broadway A. ©.,
who has been anxiously waiting for MeCoy to
eoverit. Big gate receipts are almost _a cer-
tainty ifthe match is made, so that MeCoy's
remark about “winner take all” fs belleved to
be sincere by his friends. Asa matter of fact,
however, McCoy knows that few tightera will
agree to such terms and that Choynski in par-
icular would not listen to such @ proposition,
n fact, sporting men say that Choynski would
re foolish not to have a loser’s clause inserted
in the articles, simply asa matter of business
and precaution.

AUGUST BELMONT’S NEW YACHT,

Precautions Taken Against Winter Storms
~Work on the Second Cutter.

Bristor, Jan. 21.--August Belmont's new
cutter Mineola is securely moored until spring
and will be practically undisturbed by storms,
The boat was far from being finished when she
slid into the water. Carpenters have been at
work on the interior ever since she was
launched, making and fitting partitions, and
caulking and smoothing the deck, The ma-
hogany trimmed companionways, skylights
and other deck openings are covered with
storm hatches. A degree of finishing is yet to
be done on the bulkheads,

Tho waterline marking, as shown by the in
tersection of the white and green paint, is be-
tween eight and nine inches out of the water.
The shipping of spars, sails, rigging and in-
terior fittings will bring her down nearly to
this line. Sheis higher out of water forward
at presentthan aft. Her model presents no
tumble home appearance. Instead of having
that characteristic she fs what could be termed
“wall-sided.” With a freeboard of about three
feet, ahe should prove to be as dry. a boatin a
good breeze and with flattened sheeta as the
Defendor or Columbia, Her bow is much liko
Columbia's with the exception thatthe more
pointed part of the upward curveis further
aft inthe Mineola. For the same reason, the
sheer is# notso marked as in Columbia, The
fine run and the sweep ofevery curveon the
afteroverhang is something to call forth ad-
miration, There are three deadlights on a
ata amidships and extending for-
ware

Tho spars for the new cutters are being made
at fast Boston, while the work of arranging
about the sail spreads has begun, In about two
weeks more the second of the new 70-footers

ewill bo ready for launching. Carpenters and
machinists are working on everysection of this
eralt, showing the hurry there is to get her out
of the shop and afloat. to make room for
setting up the next one’s frame,

History_is repeating itself in the purchase
mado by Mra. A 8. Van Wyekle, Six years ago
her husband bought the steam yacht Eugenia,
The name was changed to Marjorie in honor of
Miss Van Wyekle. sire. Van Wyck! purchased
the large and new steam yacht Eugenia last
fall in Chester, The name has just been
changed to Marjorie. The latter will leave
Philade'phia on Feb, 20 for a West Indies
eriise of three months, with Mrs, Van Wyckle
and party on board,

 

Court Tennis,

Tuxepo Park, Jan, 21.-The week's court
tennis carnival under the auspices of the new
‘Tuxedo Tennis and Racquet Club, wound up
with a doubles exhibition in which Peter
Latham and E. H. Miles of England, defeated
Tom Pettitt and Lawrenee M,. Stockton of
America, by 6-1, 6-2, 6-4, The match at-
tracted unusual notices, as when the same pairs
met at Boston recently, the home players won
by 5-1, and it was an open secret that the
Fnglishmen were wound up to-day to wipe out
the defeat,

In the opening set the Englishmen showed
rare combination play and kept their oppon-
ents mostly on the hazard side. Thoy ran out
two gamesin short order, Latham's returns
being deadly. The Americans cut-in for a
game by clever all-round play, but had a stern
ehase from there on and the first set went to
Latham and Miles, 6-1. They beld each other
on even terms for two games of the second set,
when the English champions put
pressure ond ran to 5—1 on splendid forcing
rallies. ‘The Boston pair won the seventh
ame by brilliant team work, but the British-
ers captured the next game and the set, 6-2.

The third set developed {nto a grand con-
test, in which the Amerioans took the initia-
tive and scored agame. The Britishers caught
and passed them, but the Americans drew
level ae “two all.” Latham and Miles then
raked in a couple of games, but the home pair
once more closed the gap and looked like turn-
ing the tide, Stockton had struck his stride
and Pettitt was covering the court in rare style.
Latham and Miles, however, were not to be de-
nied and they won out, 0-4,

Racquets.
Tuxepo Park, Jan, 21.—While the raqeuet
court here is in an embryo stage, it is thought
that it will be ready for play in the fall, With

a view to an appropriate (nauguration series, a

NEWS OF THE WHEELMEN,

SUNDAY IN THE CYCLE SETTLEMENT
AT MADISON SQUARE GARDEN,

 

Experts Use the Day to Spy Ont Detaila—In-
cldents of the O, enlng Nigh(—Good
Crowd on the Roads—Motor-Cycle Racing
Prospects—Wheels in the Transvaal War,

The glitter and buatle at the opening of the
Cycle Show at Madison Square Garden were
missing yesterday and many of the exhibits
were shrouded in white, but the mechanical
sharps of the trade and a fow of the privileged
class of riders populated the place all day
studying the points that it is impossible to find
when the crowd is present. The first night of
the exhibition was pronounce! hy experienced
ones to have been @ surprise because of the
large attendance on awet night. The storm
prevented many from taking span new wheels
and motor vehicles to the building for fear of
soiling them and these were busy yesterday
moving in their machines

An incident of the firat night was the spoil-
ing ofone exhibit, or rather the mystery of it,
by asmart New York girl who solved the prob-
lem ofa revolving globo with the continents
dopictedon it. It isa hugeaffalr—ubout five feet
in diameter, It is slight!y inclined, like a class.
room globe, and continually revolves, but there
is no sign of an electric motor or wires or any
other power in sight, The mystery of what
turned it was onethat kept acrowd about guess-
ing untilthe girl visitor arrived, She leaned
over the rail aud put her finger on the
big ball, It stopned. She discovered that it
was very light. Then she slipped inside the
space, andlooking behind the globe espied an
electric fan blowing upon the raised letters of
the firm's name that belted the globe. Holding
acatalogue up in front of the fan she inter-
rupted the revolutions and satisfied herself
and othora that she had solved the mystery.
Another incident that brought one exhibitor
plenty of trouble was the d.scovery of a stout

and perspiring man that the big tire pumpe
were excellent for cooling purposes. The exhib.
itor “blew off’ the stout man and inatricea he
had a line of visitors waiting fora similartreat,
It became such a popular idea that noone
stopped to investigate the machines or talk
business.

One thing that the show seams to demon-
strate is that the low erank hanger craze and
the short bead fad have reached their limit and
are beginning to react. There is in faet a vom-
mendabie absence of the faddism that con-
fused seekersafter the truly best by introdue-
ing features of no proven value simply for the
sake of exciting interest. There are no apect-
mens of “curleyeue’ tubing and a lack of
the “hexagonal.” “spiral” and “ovoid”
oddities in this line which have made big
protensions at previous exhibitions. There
is something of what might be called freakish-
ness in enamelling, suchas the iiea of giving
the headpost and the diagonal strut one eolor
and another color to the rest of the whee), but
this, when it is done, has been handled
iu a way that finds favorin mayy eves. There
ara no wheels striped tike barber poles, how-

 

ever, The striping idew has been trans-
ferred to the rims, whieh in many
eases hava been made to. look hand

some by thin stripes in the middle and along
the outeredges, Options in color are given by
practically all the makers, bur the array of

wheels is free from a considerable of the gau- |

diness that has been seen. The long cranks
and the moderately high gears prevail, but the
inclination toward overdoing these features
seems to have been checked. The general
length oferank onthe ‘stock motels” of road
wheels is seven inches, with options
smaller sizes, It is noteworthy
that a parts maker, who supplies
makers, catalogues 7% and
cranks a8 regular stock, so

though

experimental riders who wish to follow the fad |

that was started in England ean be supplied,
Tho changed conditions of manufacture that
have tended toward making wheels look alike
and yet have been truly improving quality

are noticeable inthe number of concerns that |

are using such parts as cranks and sprockets
made by the same specialists in these
branches, ‘he progress of the parts mukers
is wellemphasized, The fact that tactor.es in
which all resourees are devote! to making a
few things with special machinery cag often

produce a better and cheaper  articie
than a factory that makes only. for
its own wheels has apparently been

impressed upon many makers of the highest
reputation, In respect to hubs and spokes and

the fastenings ofthe latter there is much that |

is original and distinetive. Ove bright {dea is
founs inthe whee! of a Western maker, who
obviates the necessity of removing the sprocket
trom the rear hub in order to put in a new
spoke by making the hub flange on the sproeket
side with buttonhoile slots so that the apokes
ean be hitched in an! drawn up taut easily,

 

So many of the stars of the eycle track are
enter ng the motor fleld that motorevele races
ire likely to leap into the foreground in the
spring, while anew crop of fast men to seek
forchampionship honors by unaided pedaling
will be needed. Frank Waller, the veteran six-
day rider, is having an American machine built

with acarburetor of French make. Joe Judge
is having one ma le that he says will negotiate
a mile in 50 seconds. MePRachren, the

Canadian erack, who is now a resident
of Newark, ia having a three-horse
power tandem constructed that will have mora
overhang than any other ever par out, Tom
Cooperand Fioyd MeFarlan! also are gos
ing toturn inte motor riders, and others that
have ordered machines made are the Hunter
brotherao. Newark and the Lawson brothers
of Chicago, Besides those name! the ex-
perts who were in the fleld last year and in-
tendtoremaininit are Charles Miller, Herel
Fournier, C. 8. Henshaw and Austin Crooks,
In the light of these things there is little to
fear but what there will be plenty of good
material to mect Janott, the Englishman who
has challenged the whole eountry or any other
foreign expert.
