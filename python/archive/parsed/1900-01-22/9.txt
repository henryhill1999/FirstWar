A Trade Sale of China and Glass

We have no idea of interesting careless folks in our advertising—at least it is hopeless

to expect much in that direction.

It is the man or woman who thinks; who, better still,

knows—the one who values money, having much or little of it, that comes here for supplies.
And, to thinking folks, ‘‘trade sales’ stand for something—and are interesting. They

are measures of the buying power of the business.

tage.
order stops time-waste.

quantities of goods quickly.
And, hence, today’s sale of Table China (in the Basement ) and of the wanted Odd Pieces of China and Bric-a-Brac and
Cut Glass (on the Main Floor).
Details that follow state the savings, as measured by every-day fair prices—

Separate China Pieces in Groups
A Group at 10c—

These are Austrian goods, neatly decorated in
flowers and gold. Tea plates, breakfast
plates, after-dinner cups and saucers, tea cups
and saucers. All good value at 25c each—
though you may choose at 10c.

A Group at 25c—

French and Austrian china and English por-
celain, Actual values at $6 to $9 a dozen
—a fair proportion at the latter figure. All
are attractively decorated in colors and gold.
The tables hold bread-and-butter, tea, and
course plates, cracker jars, after-dinner cups
and saucers.

A Group at 50c—

This is all French china—breakfast plates,

dinner plates, comports, bon-bon dishes,

olive dishes, tea cups and saucers, inkwells, |

The lowest valuation on the least expensive
kind is $8.50 a dozen—that for the break-
fast plates, Other pieces in this lot are
worth $10 and $12 a dozen.

Trunks at Half Price

One of the three best trunk makers we know of—and one of the three
lives away over in Paris—asks us once or twice a year to sell his sample line
for him, This maker doesn’t retail, so the samples get much less handling
than do those in retail stores—-in fact, most of these haven’t a marora
scratch,

Just seventy-five—no two alike —and probably it will be fairest to sell |
none of them until 9 o’clock. That will give all a chance who care to come.

Men’s trunks, women’s trunks, women’s hat trunks, steamer trunks.
Cheapest is $5.50 regularly. It will be $2.75. Then by easy steps to the
very finest—a $33,50 trunk. That will be $16.75. |
