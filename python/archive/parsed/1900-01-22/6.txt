ng recorded For this state of things the
peevl is feverish activity is mainly responal-
hie, the present collapse being @ reaction from
it but the South African war has had some
effect, and, /ast week, the revelations of the
grate Trust Company's loans, betraying the

harrassments of some heavy operators,
yotributed to discourage speculation.

i] now before the State Senate, intro-
aqeed by Senator Stranahan on behalf of the
‘al nt Committee on Taxation appointed by the
Kiqte Legisiature last winter, proposes changes

our method of imposing taxes for State and
te a) purposes Which, as might be expected,
ith determined opposition from the in-

emt
Aso
The

aw
a they are calculated to affect unfavor-
ably. The complaint most frequently made
against our present system of taxation is, that
{t bears Upon taxpayers unequally, The city of
Naw York, for example, insists that it is re-
quired to contribute a larger share of taxes for

the support of the State Government than is
just, as compared with the rest of the State.
Owners of real property complain that the bur-
jen upon itis disproportionate to that laid upon
personalty, andof the owners of personalty in
the shape of money in bank or lent to borrow-
ers, some are taxed heavily while others are
ttaxed at all. A reform which promises to

salaae taxas in any case Is of course welcomed
by those whom it promises to relleve, while one
which threatens to increase them is cor-
respondingly denounced by those who expect
to suffer from the increase.

The new bill aims at silencing the complaints
# his city against the reat of the State, so far

«{t proceeds from what is said to be an ex-
saa ve valuation of taxable realty and per-
sonality as compared with the valuations of
other localities, by abolishing all direct taxa-
tion for State purposes, except one of one per
cont. on shares of stock !n banks, banking as-
sociations and trust companies, and one of
one-half of one per cent. on mortgage debts.
The stocks andthe mortgage dehts so taxed
are to he exempt from taxation for local pur-
poses, and, for such purposes, moneyed capital
tn the hands of individuals fs to be also taxed
one percent. and no more. This last provision is
made in order to allow shares in national
banks to be taxed without conflicting with the
act of Congress which permits such taxation
only on condition that {t shall not be at a
grester rate than it is upon other moneyed
capital inthe hands of individual citizens.

Another proposed object of the bill is, by tax-
ing mortgage debts, to bring under taxation
an immense amount of persona! property
which now escapes It altogether, and thus to
lighten the tax upon property which is caught
The mass of mortgages upon real estate in this
elty are notoriously held by savings bankg, trust
companies and life and fire insurance compa-
nies, and since they represent money coving
by these institutions to depositors and policy-
holders, they are exempt from taxation as be-
ing offset by an equal amount of debts. Of the
reat, much fs held by non-residents, and for
that reason cannot be taxed by our authorities.
Rince competition from non-taxpaying lend-
ers brings the rate of interest on mortgage
Joans down to four and one half per cent. or
lesa, lenders who are obliged to pay on them
a tax of two and one-half per cent. cannot net
an income from them of more than two per
cent. and the result is that resident executors
and trustees, as well as resident capitalists
(investing on their own account, prefer to put
thelr money {nto Government bonds, which
pay a little over two per cent. and are free of
taxation, city bonds, also tax free, yielding
threa per cent., or the stocks of leased rail-
roads which yleld between three and four
per cent. Thus, a law which exempted all
mortgages, without distinction, from loeal
taxos, would cause little or no loss to the local-
itr, while the half per cent. to be laid on them
for State ee would yield a handsome

revenue to the Stat
Undeniabdly, the imposition of a sweeping tax

of one-half of one per cent.upon mortgage debts
without exception, will have a tendency to in-
crease somewhat rates of interest to borrowers.
Lenders will take it into consideration in mak-
ing their loans, and the duty of paying it will
have to be assumed by the borrower. It is,
however, by no means certain that the rates of
interest on mortgage debts would be increased
by the full one-half of one per cent. of the new
tax. Many millions of doilars now Invested, as
has been said, at from two tothree per cent.
{n Government and city tax-exempt bonda,
would be lent at four and four and one-half
Der cent. as soon as the lenders were assurad
that the tax would be one-half of one per cent.
and no more, instead of the two and one-half
per cent, to which mortgages held by resi-
dénts both as trustees and for their own ac-
count are now liable, and the corporations
and the non-residents would have to meet the
new competition from this source.

More than this, the owners of mortgaged real
estate would derive some compensation for
any Increased interest they might have to pay
on their mortgages. by the abolition of the
taxes upon their property for the benefit of the
Btate. This city, last year, had to contribute
for Btate purposes the sum of $6,250,000,
which, upon the total assessed valuation of
real and personal property amounted to 20
cents on the $100. The release from local tax-
ation of bank and truat company stock would,
indeed, require an addition to the local tax levy
of $2,000,000, or nearly 6 cents on the $100,
but, still, the net reduction of taxation upon
real property would be about 14 cents on the
$100, In a rate of from $2.25 to $2.50 per $100,

However this may be, and with whateoever
Justice owners of real estate may Oppose the
new tax on mortgage debts, it is rather sur-
prising to witness the zeal with which the
officers of savings banks denounce it. One
would think from their talk that they will be
personally sufferers from a threatened reduc-
tion, however small, of the income on their
mortgage investments, whereas the loss would
not be theirs but that of their depositors, who,
by law, enjoy immunity at present from all
taxation. The mortgages to savings banks
amount, by no means, to one-half of tha in-
vestments of those institutions, but even if
they were one-half, the proposed tax on them
would reduce the dividends pald to depositors
by only one-quarter of one per cent. which is
surely little enough return for them to make
for the protection of their property by the
police, the fire department anc all the other
government agencles maintained by taxes,

\ more serious obstacle to the acceptance of the
bh ilas alegisiative measure isits possible con-
fict with the Conatitution of the United States.
One similar to it, namely, that of making the
tax a lien on the mortgage and collecting it
through the debtor, was adopted, some years
eco in Pennsylvania, but it was deelared un-
constitutional by the United States Supreme

Court. Latterly, however, the same court has
fistcined a law in Oregon declaring mortgage
celts to be Hable to taxation In Oregon as
rea) estate, although held by citizens of other
Frat ind countries) The sound lawver, Mr
Kamuel B. Clarke, whom the Joint Committee
Consulted in drafting the bill, is confident
that tt matitutional objection has been met
and overcome by providing that the tax shall |
be collected from the debtor by process of law,

alter giving due notice tothe ereditor, and an
opportunity to him to defend his rights

It is declared in the bill, that “mortgage
debtea and obligations created as well by eor-
Porations as by natural persons shall be subject
to the tixes hereinafter imposed,” and that
“In case of a mortgage in trust, all of the debts
and obligations secured thereby, notwith-
standing that they may be owned in severalty
by different persons, shall be considered as an
eitirety, so far as liability for State taxes ia
concerned.’ The trustee of the mortgage is
charged with the duty of protecting the bond-
holders by paying the tax, and upon such pay-
Mentitis (> have a tien for reimbursement
jpon the bonds. This provision will seriously
atect the great railroad companies, espe-
ial'y the New York Central, which is at

To disarm opposition from this quarter,

it might be wise to exempt from the proposed

tax all mortgages bearing a

So far as it goes, however, the proposed bill
will greatly improve the present method of

assessing and collecting taxesin the State.

It

will lighten the taxes upon property which
now bears an undue share of them, it will add
little or nothing to the taxes upon other prop-

erty now taxed, and

if {t reaches property

which has hitherto escaped it is certainly to be

commended.

As the Joint Committee point

out in their report accompanying the bill, the
alternative tothe measure is one compelling
citizens to make out and deliver to the asses-
sors of taxes, lists of their taxable possessions,
and verify them by oath, as is required in some

of the other States of the Union:

At present,

the inequalities and injustice of our system of
taxation are 40 glaring that public oploion

not accept/this one, we may incur something

worse,
