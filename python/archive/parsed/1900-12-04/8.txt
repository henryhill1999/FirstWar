The attendance at the Fasia-Tipten “Old
(lory” sale at Madison Square Ciarden vester
day morning was remarkably lacae for the open
tog of the second week, and prices were good,
considering the quality of the horses oflered
The consignment from Daniel Mahaney aver

Laseelle’s lot Rand, by Overstreet Wilkes, dr,
with a record of 2.185,, sold for $800 and wall go
to Leechbure, Pa He showed well and three
or four horsemen wanted him The roan geld-
ing Gagnaunt by Jay Bird, with a pacing
record of 215%, went to UC. M Martin of this
city for $800) «The top price of the afternoon
sale was reached when R Roberta of Brooklyn
secured the roan gelding Ward, by Baxie Bird,
for $1,000. Good prices were realize? all the way

through the Lasselle collection

Doe Tauner, the Cleveland horseman, Andy
McDowell, C. C. Lioyd and several other pro-
fessional and amateur drivers, met at one of
the tables during the afternoon aud enter-
tainingly discussed the performance on the
Speedway on Sunday of the new record horses
that were bought last week It was under-
stood that some of the rowacites were disap-
pointed in their purchases. They were not
able jo get the speed out of them they antici-

iter
’ “Of course they were disappointed,” sald
Tanner “Any man who buys @ fast trotter
or pacer and ex pects to go right outon the road
and drive them to their record mark will be
disappointed. It turns a horse upside down
to be taken right out and put to new work
without preparation. The new owner does
not understand the horse and the horse does
not understand the new owner. You cannot
expect a horse to do his best under such cir-
cumstances. If Mr. Beannell had undertaken
to drive The Abbot on last Sunday on the Speed
way would have been the most disappointed
man ontheroad, The champion would doubt-
ess have shown to less advantage than any
ewonelipthere. It takes a long Ume anda
ot of patlence to get a horse accustomed to
new work, and 4 road rider should possess the
ability to handle him in the right way to get
the beet results. ‘Training a horse for the road
nd brushing requires just as much skill as it
oes to get him ready for the races.”

The evening sale opened with the average
crowd present, Prices ruled about the same
as during the day for the sare clasa of horses.
Man were there to buy, but inferior or unsound
animals were quickly detected and bidding
was slow, A good record horse, however,
or a fair prospect, brought all he was worth
Beveral out-of-town horsemen who attended
the sale last week returned yesterday for the
session of the Board of Review of the National
Trotting Association at the Murray Hill Hotel

CotamMa Karns Fourth Place in the General

The foothall aeason tnet cloeed. while it
produced a definite chariplonetip eleven tn
Yale, demonstrated aleo that there i a new
sap.rant for leeding hone in the Columbia

Varsity Judaing from the «ames plased
thie fall it will not be long before the old “Hie
Four” combination of Vale, Harvard, Prince
ton and Venneyivania, denoting exclusive

) supremacy on the «gridiron, may be quite rad

cally changed If there could be an offleral
rang how of the leading eievens it would he
a care of Yale in posseasion of Lret honors
without a dispute, for tha New Haven cleven
beat all comers with con parative eare, as
shown by the unusually lore scores Second
place would @o to Harvard, because the €tite-
fon easily vanquished the Quakers and in fact
every other team except Yale Pennsylvania
would be entitled to third place because of
her great victories: over Columbia, Cornell,
University of Chicago and Lafayette

Then would come a break in the big combi-
nation and the elevation of Columbia to fourth
place. Sanford’s «trong eleven, though beaten
decisively in the early part of the season by
Harvard and Pennsyivania, braced up later
on and not only plaved the closest mare of the
year with Yale, but also clearly defeated Prince-
ton. Columbia's improved form against the
Indians here on Thanksgiving Day entities
the elewen to the high rank that would be be
stowed upon it if there could be an official
award Some of the eritics are inclined to
believe that Columbia murht be placed on @
par with Harvard and Pennsylvania, on general
results and comparative strength at the end
of the season, but this appears to be strete ning
things too much. Next to Columbia it woule
be necessary to place Lafayette, because the
Kaston men walloped Cornell after the Itha-
eana had easily beaten Princeton, Rut as the
Tigers vanquished Lafayette early in the sea-
son complications might arise over this rang
that could never be definitely settled. Suflice
it to say therefore, that Yale, Harvard, Penn
svivania and Columbia would be officially de-
clared anew “Bie Four,” devoid of any fora
of sentiment, But the traditional “Hie Four,”
with Princeton a member instead olumbia,
Will not be diss« 1 until Sanford’s eleven
bus proven more conclusively ite superiority

This fact, however, does not cause one to
lose sight of the facet that in two vears of time
Columbla has jumped up among the leading
football universities, and that there is a brilliant
future for the Blue and White if the present
form of Improvement continues. Sanford'’s
contract expired jest Saturday, but it will no
doubt be renewed. W. BR. Shoemaker, who
nianaged the eleven 60 skilfully, will not leave
college. He will therefore be manager another
year
