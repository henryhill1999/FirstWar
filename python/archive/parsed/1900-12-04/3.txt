of Representatives this afternoon and was read
therein. Itis as follows
To the and Howse

At the outgoing of the old and the Incoming
of the new century you begin the last session
of the Fifty-sixth evidences
on every hand of individual and pation ul pros-
perity and with proof of the growing strength
add increasing power for good of republican
institutions, Your countrymen will Join with
you in felicitation that American liberty Is
more firmly established than ever before, and
that love for it and the determination to pre
earve it are more universal than at any former
périod of our history

The Republic was never so strong because
never so strongly intrenched in the heirts of
the people as now, The Constitution, with
few amendinents, exists as it left the hands of
{te authors, The additions which have been
made to it proclaim larger freedom and more
extended citizenship. Popular government has
demonstrated in its 124 years of trial here its
stability and security, and its eficieney as the
best instrument of national development and
the best safeguard to hiiman rights

“When the Sixth Congress assernbled in No-
vember, i800, the population of the United
Rtates was 5,308,483. [tis now 76,204,790, Then
we had sixteen States. Now we have forty-
five, Theo our territory consisted of 909,060
sgpare niles. Tt is now 3,846,595 square miles
¥ducation, religion and morality have kept
pace with our advancement in other directions,
and while extending its power the Government
has adhered to its foundation principles and
abated none of them in dealing with our new
peoples and possessions A nation so pre-
served and blessed gives reverent thanks to
God and invokes His guidance and the con-
tinuance of His care and favor,

THE CHINESB PROBLEM,

In our Yoreign intercourse the dominant
question has been the treatment of the Chinese
problem, Apart from this our relations with
the Powers have been happy.

The recent troubles in China spring from
the anti-foreign agitation which for the past
three years has gained strength tn the north-
ern provinces, Their origin lies deep in the
character of the Chinese races and in the tra-
ditions of their Government, The Taiping
rebellion and the opening of Chinese ports to
foreign trade and settlement disturbed alike
the homogeneity and the seclusion of China.

Meanwhile, foreign activity made ttself felt
in all quarters, not alone on the coast, but along
the great river arteries and in the remover
districts, carrying new ideas and introducing
few associations among a primiuve people
which had pursued for centuries a natioual
policy of isolation
The telegraph and the railway epreading
over their land, the steamers plying on their
waterways, the merchant and the missionary
penetrating year by year farther to the interior,
Vecame to the Chinese mind types of an allen
f@vasion, changing the course of their national
ffe and fraught with vague forebodings of
disaster to their beliefs and their self-control.

For several years before the present troubles
all the resources of foreign diplomacy, backed
by moral demonstrations of the physical force
of fleets and arms, have been needed to secure
due respect for the treaty rights of foreigners
and to obtain satisfaction from the responsible
a thorities for the sporadic outrages Upon the
persons and property of unoffending sojourners,
which from time to time occurred at widely
emparated points in the northern provinces,
as in the case of the outbreaks in Sze-chuen and
Shantung

Posting of anti-foreign placards became a
daily ocourrence, which the repeated reproba-
tuon of the Imperial power failed to check or
punish, These inflammatory appeals to the
ignorance and superstition of the masses,
mendacious and absurd in their accusations
aud deeply bostile in their spirit, could not but
work cumulative harm. They aimed at no
particular class of foreigners; they were im-
partial in attacking everything foreign

An outbreak in Shantung, in which German
mdiasionaries were slain, was the too natural
result of thease malevolent teachings. The
posting of seditious placards, exhorting to the
utter destruction of foreigners and of every
foreign thing, continued unrebuked. Hostile
demonstrations toward the stranger gained
strength by orgamization

The sect, commonly styled the Boxers, de
veloped greatly in the provinces north of the
Yangtse, and with the cullusion of many nota-
ble officials, including some in the immediate
councils of the Throne itself, became alarm-
ingly aggressive No foreigner's life, outside
of the protected treaty ports, was safe. No
foreign interest was secure from spoliation,

The diplomatic representatives of the Powers
in Pekin strove in vain to check this move-
thent.. Protest was followed by demand and
demand by renewed protest, to be met with
perfunctory edicts from the Palace and evasive
and futile assurances from the Tsing-ll-Y amen,
The circle of the Boxer influence narrowed
about Pekin, and while nominally stigmatized
ae séditious, it was felt that its spirit pervaded
the capital itself, that the Imperial forces were
imbued with its doctrines, and that the imme-
diate counsellors of the Empress Dowager were
{mn full sympathy with the anti-foreign move-
ment.

UNITED STATES

The increasing gravity of the conditions in
China and the imminence of peril to eur own
diversified interests in the Eanpive, as well as
to those of all the other treaty governments
were soon appreciated by this Government,
causing it profound solicitude. The United
States from the earliest davs of foreign inter-
course with China had followed a policy of peace,
omitting no oceasions to testify good will, to
further the extension of lawful trade, to respect
the sovereignty of its Government, and to in-
sure by all legitimate and kindly but earnest
means the fulleat measure of protection tor the
livea and property of our laweabiding eitivens
and for the exercise of their Ler ent «

among the Chinese people

Mindful of this, it was felt to be appropriate
that our purposes should he pronounced in
favor of such course as woud hasten united
action of the Powers at Pekin to promote the
administrative reforms #0 greatly needed for
atrengthing the loperial Government and
maintaining the integrity of (hing, in which
we believed the whole Western world to be alike
concerned, To these ends 1 caused to be ad-
dreased to the several Powers occupying ter-

of %inch shot and shell were fired, destroying

did the balls rain that, when the aminuution
of the besieged ran low, five quarts of Chinese

Attempts were made to burn the legations
by setting neighboring houses on fire, but the
flaines were successfully fougit off, although
the Austrian, Be.gian, Italian and Dutch lega-

With the aid of the native converts, directed
by the :nissionaries, fo whose helpful cogpera-
tion Mr. Conger awards unstinted praise, the
British legation Was made a veritable fortress
