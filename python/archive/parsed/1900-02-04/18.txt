“Taok look'’ she whispered. “there ia my
father Ask hin where Philip is”

The two men were walking arm in arm, and
Preeonily, stumMine over a cask, the Provost
swerved a littls to the left to avoid the piled con
fusion of the quay, and, as he did so, he noted
Uimphray Spurway sianding by the corner of the

 

sireet with his companions 4 litdle behind him in
the dusk of the wall,

“A beaw and balmy nicht,” he said, making his
magisterial salutation, Which was alWays con
sidered to beofsuperescellentdignity. “Ah! good
Master Spurway, What gives us poor folk of Aber
cairn the pleasure (and | may add honor) of your
company”? But | forgot--yes, yes, | have heard
there is an attraction at the footofthe Vennel that
robes usin a Worthiness notourown, A dainty
bit widow, Master SpurWay, or, rather, when I
think of it, searcely a Widow, butifone may say so
Without offence, so much the more taking on that
account!”

“Not even you, Provost Partan, can say such
things Without offence.” returned Unfphray, very
gravely, While Anna shrank deeper into the dusk
of a doorway. and Will bowman spread his mas
ter's coat-tails abroad to shield the girl from her
faiber's eyes

“No offence, man; no offence at all!” replied the
provost) amicably, “surely we have kenned ane
anither weel aneuch this score o' years that] may
fake (‘he freedom o' a Jest Wi’ you, Lmphray, my
friend”

“Lhave been seeking a lad of the name of Philip
Stanstleld,” said Mr. Spurway, without continu
ing the subject; “he Was last seen in the company
of your companion, Mr Saul Mark Perhaps he
can give us some information as to the boy's pres
ent Wherea bouts!”

“My companion!” cried the provost, seandalized;
“nae, nae companion o' mine, Saul Mark is just
the supercargo o' @ bit boatie that rins (o Bor
deaux wi' oor Abercairn staples -thread, baith
black, white and whitey-broon, birk pirns to wind
iten, and your ain manufacture o° braidclaith
whilk, gin I may say gae, has made us famous
through a’ the land o' France”

“Of what ship is Saul Mark the supercargo””
asked Umphray

The provost tlied his broad hat alittle to the side
as he slowly and meditatively scratched his head

‘The name of the boat?” he answered. "Dod,
T canna juist bring it to mind at this present mo
ment" (Here he glanced cautiously over his
shoulder) “Ye see, there's the trip back frae
Bordeaux, and though, of coorse, she comes in
ballast, pavin’ stanes an’ gun flints, there's whiles
odd things get stowed awa osic as ankers o'
brandy, wee barrels o' the fine clairy wine, tobacco
that will make the noblest sheeshan in the worl’

awa’ o’ guid siller o' the municipality And
Tdinna haud wi themava!
In this fashion, and at considerable length, the

provost expounded his theory of the several inci
dents of imperial and local taxation. to whieh
Umphray Spurway listened impatiently enough

‘But, Provost”: he broke on as soon as opper
tunity allowed, “this lad was seen to enter the
town with Saul Mark. and we mean to find where
he is concealed. In whieh we ask for cour magis
terial assistance Tf he be on shipboard we must
go there and recover him Philip Stansileld

THE PERMANENT SNOW COMPOUND. |

 

Bernard and Brainerd Catlin Bought Five
Dollars’ Worth Unknown to Their Father
and Realized Barrels of Fun Out of Ht.

 

 

Copurighted, by Char'ea Baltell Loomes,

"T'd as soon sell you my farm for two cents |
as to buy your compound,” seid farmer Catlin
to the black -hairedand uncanny looking stranger
He had arrived just at nightfall at the close of a |

longwinter's storm The flelda and troes
ant jences and oreots were white with
snow and the iwo Catlin bows were delighted

but their father, with bis kuowledge of the work |
that it entailed would bave been glad to see the

BLOW take the same wings that had brought i |
and fly to the uttermost parts of the earth And |
here was this fellow having the impudence to

 

offer him a compound that would make snow

keep his milk and butter cool and comfortable
Without any need of ice

“Wish we could see the thing work,

we know it would stay when a thaw came?’

said Mrs Catlin, and went up to their room to kiss

Hsoys are generally anxious to have snow re |

they would say nothing

At last. toward the end of January, there came

 titte tamily of them on their way to the new
wortd Were lostoll Newfoundland only last month,

In raising these new little pets a great point is

made otdeveloping color, There are the standard
and broken colors Of the former the most valu
able are the lustrous black fellows, with feet and
tal to match, then there are mice with soft fur,
brichteves and a genile and playful disposition
Which are the especial favorites of children; those
with the pink eyes are not considered so highly
bred as those With deep blue or black eyes: clear
eut chocolate markings also add to their distine
tion Solid chocolate and fawn with feet and
tails to mateh are other varieties highly prized
‘The fad of the moment are the cream and pale
yellow mice, one of the latter having recently
been sold for 815 \nother very pretty specimen
might be called a symphony in gray, since ite
body is of gray, with light silver markings, and
sears and noseofa delicate pink

Of the broken colors there are the black and
white white and fawn. and vellow and white. the
value of the mouse depending upon the even
ness of the markings, The thoroughbred should
have by neits a dark pateh over each eve and
one at the tail and if it can boast a saddle in the
centre of the back hanging lower on one side than
on the other, like the fox terner, its social position
may be considered supreme

The chief charm in havine mice for pets lies
in ther intellivence, Which is said to be ofa high
