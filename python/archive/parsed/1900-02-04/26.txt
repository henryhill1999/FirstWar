OINTS ABOUT THE MANAGEMENT
2 OF 1HK TKUMP 8UIT,

f One Failure of Long-Suit Players
—S. Puzzling Points Often Met—A
Situation Misunderstood by the Beginger
Interior Leads and the Pursuit of Slams.

In the management of the trump suit, one of the
qust common errors is rushing t trumps in order
to swp an apparently impending ruff, Long
suit writers tell us that this is the great secret of
the admitted failure of long-sult players ip attempt
ing to protect themselves against shortsuit tac-
ica, If they get the first trick in @ suit opened
short against them they run off the trumps, so
as to prevont the short-suiter from getting the ruff
which they imagine he is always playing for
lf any one would take the trouble to tabulate the
hands that are opened short and to put down the
exact proportion of them in which the opening
lead is made for the deliberate purpose of getting
in a ruff in the suit, it would be found w be very
small. When a short suiter opens with a weak
ault, especially with a supporting card, he is
usually in the high grass with some other suit,
which is both long and strong, but which cannot
be made until the adverse trumps are exhausted.
It is part of his game t coax the adversaries to

start this exhaustion of the trumps, and tricks
are often ducked with the deliberate intention of
driving them to 4 trump attack

If the adversaries do not go to trumps, they
usually switch suits, because they acknowledge
that it is bad practice to lead back suits opened
from weakness on the left, as it necessitates going
through that weakness to probable strength on
the right If they switch, they give the short
suiters an advantage in position inthe suits which
they have avoided opening, and so it seems that
the defence is beset with difficulties and the long
suit players are always in doubt as w the best
continuation. Hoyle said: “When in doubt,

lead trumps,” and this is what modern players
usually do, although the experts are of opinion
that leading trumps is about the last thing to do
when in doubt. They insist that you should be
Dretty sure you know what you are doing before
you etart a trump attack, unless your holding
is such that you would start the trumps regardless
of the original opening of the hand against you.

‘There are two or three puzzling points in the
management of trumps that come up very fre-
quently. One of them is leading up to or through
an honor turned; another is going on with a losing
trump, in the hope of knocking down two together;
another is returning partner's trump-lead after
winning the first round rather cheaply, @ position
which always leaves one in doubt whether it is
8o important t) get Out the trumps that you can

afford to put your partner under the disadvantage
of having the strong hand behind him

Here are some deals which illustrate all these
points, and show how the experts manage such
things when they get down to business at the
whist table. The first deal is from the mateh
between the Atheneum and the Toronto clubs
for the championship of Canada. Z dealt and
turned the deuce of hearts.

Yok get six tricks only,

Trick 1.) Many coummon-sense players would
open the trump from such a band as this, but
it would prove a loser

Trick 2. With the ex
ries’ suit as his reentry, ¥
hand and leads trumps
Waiting to establish his suct because he
if he leads his suit first and finds the king arainat
bom bis reentry will be forced cut before the ime
for its use bas arrived,
aerve that if Y does not lead the trumps, but starts
his suit firsi, Z wil! lead the trumps after ruffing
the second round of clubs. TS will prebably re
turn his partner's suit in order to clear it before
the trumps come out, and Y will then refuse ‘o
go on with the trumps, as he can see into the
situation from the fail of the 9 from A, niarking
ell the trump strength with b, who is unblock-
ing the spades and calling at the same time = \
would force with the clubs instead, and if B were
foolish enough to take up the trump attack, lead-
ing the queen, Y-Z yould get eleven tricks on
the deal without any trouble,

Trick 3. Itis a very old axiom in whist that
4f you win the first round of a suit as cheaply
as with a queen or jack, having no higher card
in your hand, it is very bad policy to return the
suit unless you are strong in it) The 9 falling
from A should have warved 2 that it would be
unsafe to return the trump and he should have
opened his spades instead, buts many persons
do not believe that this rule apples to trumps
as it does to plain suits, that Z prohably thought
he was bound to go back with his partner's lead

mmand of the adversa
takes a shoton the
witheut
ees that

minwcdiately

It is interesting to ob

Trick 4. Y can still save the hand if he
thinks about the situation for a moment Win
ving with the jack and returuing the five, with

the deuce turned up, Y should be able to place
every trump exactly, A having renounced. Z@
cannot possibly have the queen, for with four
trumps originally he would have returned the
douce, not the five, If Y had understood the
Principles of trump management he would have
quit the attack at once and started his sual, so
astogetitelrarved before \ and ) rot their spades
cleared.

Tad Y led his suit, Z would have rutfed it out
for him and led three rounds of diamonds, and
upon B's overtrumping ¥, B would have been
compelled to take up the trump attack and then
return his partner's spade. This would have
given Y-Z eight tricks, instead of six, even after
Z'serror of returning the trump attrick 3.

‘Crick 5. This discard of Z's is very bad His
partner is the one that led trumps. and he should
have discarded his weak suit. This would have
saved two tricks by showing his partner, Vo oat
trick eight, that the only hopa was to switch t
the single diamond

The overplay was rather pecular

~y=Z get eleven tricks, a gain o’ five.

Trick 3. So far the play lias beer the same,
A opening his long suit in beth cases. Had
either table opened with the Sinvleton trump and
B retnrned it, Y would have run with lis clubs,
forcing Z on the second round 4% would then
have led diamonds three times, ani if Y did not
trump with the ace and force B again \ HW would
make three tricks only, even if B refused to over
trump Y. If Y trumped the third round of dla
monds with the ace he would lose a trick

Z's return is rather curious. If he was fishing
for a ruff, why did he not lead his singleton in-
stead of giving up a card which might be very
useful in stopping the adversaries’ suit if {t wae
led through him?

Trick 6. This is another extraordinary lead,

pat in ee case the evident intention is to avoid
oOrcary .
Tnck 7. B is practically forced to lead the

rum ps. a,

ok 8. At this point B went to sleep. Y¥
has shown him four trumps and Z bas already
Dlayed three, Cau it be poombie that B had @

 

  

pide dream and thoughé there were fourteen trumpa

whatever you may call it, costs four tricks, because
if = amps with = care gna alter comming
one ‘s trumps forces out other w

spade suit, Aim st make six tricks on the deal,
no matter what Y-Z may do after that.

Trick 9 This is another inexcusable error.
To lead right up to the major tenace in trumps,
with the whole club suit declared against him in
the hands of the player that holds the trump ten-
ace, makes it loo
in this deal, "
, Adeal came up at the visitors’ game at the New
York Club last week which illustrates a point in
trump management that ia often misunderstood
by the beginner, There is little variation possible
in the number of tricks to be taken, but there ia
4 lot of play in the hand, showing careful readin,
of the cards by both sides. Z dealt and turn
the ace of hearts;

A—B get eight tricks.
Trick 1. Many persons h ve a strong objec-
tion to leading trumps up to an honor turned,

aud they will fiddle around with all sorts of pe
culiar plays to get the partwer in ao as tw come
Sewn v@ honur. In the majority of cases it
will be found that the old writers were correct
in their statement that there is not much risk
in leading up © an honor if the rest of your
hand demands a trump attack. Mathews, writing
a hundred years ago, says in his thirteenth maxim:
“Do not lead trumps merely because an hovor is
turned up on your leit, or be deterred from it if
on your ngiit band Either is proper if the cir
cumstances of your hand require a trump to be
led; neither if otherwise” In his Masim No. 70,
he says: “It is equally advantageous to lead
up &) 4s through an ace; not 6o much to a king;
and disadvantageous t) the queen turned up.”

(rick & ‘iany players would return the ad-
versuries’ suit, through strength t weakness,
which would bring about the saine resultin tricks
B does not wish to give Y any chance & make
4 losing trump.

Trick 5 In this position nine out of ten plavers
would go on with the trump on the theory of draw
ing two for one, because even if the jack and uine
are in one hand, A will still have a trump lelt
and stil holds command of the adverse suit’ A

ia notin such desperate circumstances that he must |

exhaust the trumps, however, and he argues

| that the jack must be on his left, because with

| the Hath coup on the first trick

|

both ace and jack Z would have probably played
A does nothke
to give up the command of the diamond suit on
the chance tiat Y will ruff it, so he is forced to
open the clubs, hoping that will place the lead
with Z

Trick 7 Y now thinks he sees a chance w
make his own and his partner's trumps separately,
if he can find Z short in spades

Trick & Now the time has come & knock the
trumps together, because if the jack is with Y
it will force him either to come up to A's guarded
king or t lead B's suit

Trick 8. Y isin difficulties and selects the lesser
of two evils, for there is a chance that he may
save an bovor in clubs in his partner's hand,
but t) lead the spade would be to give I two sure
tricks

Trick 10) A has the hand counted down, and
sees his ouly chance is to place the lead with Z
who must lose every other trick if 1s will only
keep his diamond jack guarded

INTERIOR LEADS

If there is one fallacy more than another into
which modern players have fallen, it is imagining
tha there is any bing to be gained by leaciig
interior cards. In “Common Sense in Wlust’
pawe 44, it is stated that: “Tt is one of the funda

mental principles of the common sense game to |

lead) always the top or botiom of a suit, never an
inwrmediavw card Nothing is so demoralving
to a partier as interjor leads, which have neither
the courage of attack or the virtue of defenee, but
are simply miserable subtwerfuges, totally unin
tell.gi ble except as private conventions.”

Nevertheless there are some very grood players |

who cannot see the force of these remarks. An
{interior lead from a suit headed by a single honor
is one of the favorite openings In the | system
adopwd by the New York team, who ought to
know beter Here is what happened to one of
them the other day when he dealt and turned
the eightof hearts

HECORDS AND PERSONALITY,

 

 

A Quiet, Stwical Man of Thirty, Who Upsets

Hie Strongest Cards—Great Winnings.

Harry Vardon, who has three times won the
open golf championship of the United Kingdom
and is the present holier of the title, arrived
in this country yesterday on the St. Paul.

Vardon is the leader of a host of fervent admirers

in Great Britain, but that he should have a per

sonal following here, aside from the cohorta who

have read of his achievements, is somewhat of a

surprise. Yet this is the case, and it Was brought

out in a marked Way in 4 discussion among some

Profeasional gulfers yesterday

“Vardon cannot play on hard ground,” said

Jim Laing of the Crescent A.C. “Even when

the ground is in the grip of frost the turfis so seft

and spongelike in Fngland and Scotland that the
club never hits the earth. But in this country

the grass is so thin that to play from frozen earih

professionals, is not utterly in a class by hiniself
as was shown only a week after Lis great victory
over Willie Park, Jr, when “Sandy” Herd beat
bim by @ hole at Trafford Park. J. Ho Taylor
and James iraid have also beaten Vardos in
matches. When Horace Rawlins was in ing
land in 1895, and then the holder of the American
open championship, Braid beat bim by 5 up acd
4 to play, while Alexander Finley, the Ho tia
profeamional, was beaten by Vardon this winter
at Ganton, by 7 up and 6 to play. These scores
may. indicate how Vardon will class with our

resident professionals, wow whom the respective |

A winner's style ia always worth studying
“No horse ever runs so grandly as the winning

turf. Io golf every winner, to carry gut the same
idea, establishes a new school. When Willie
Park, Jr, was onen champion, the man whecould

are taken, stated in its report

“The only person who may fairly be blamed
for the result is Harry Vardon, the Jersey Jehu,
whore driving was quite frightful to see and cal
culated to appal even the stoutest- hearted.’

Not only is Vardon’s driving most consistent,
but he is also unrivalled in direction and distance
Others may outdrive him at times, but oo ane
can hold him for steadiness or straighiness, ‘To

The best of many analytical comments on
Vardon’s swing is without doubt that made by
the English crivc, Garden G. Smith Tt tella,

and Edwards of Columbia, get force into their
strokes by the sirong, upward turn of the wrists
