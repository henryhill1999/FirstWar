BROADSIDE FROM EBBETS.

_—_—-—
SCORES THE NEW ASSOCIATION AND
ALSO M’OGRAW,

Bays the Quin Scheme Has Falled—Declares
That Hanlon Has Legally Leased the
Balimere Grounds Accuses McGraw of
Withholding Contracts From the Club,

CH. Ebbets, president of the Brooklyn ase
ball Club, who has been conferring with Hanlon
and Von der Horst at Baltimore and Jobo L
Rogers at Philadelphia during the past three
days, returned home yesterday and made a de-
tailed statement regarding the situation to @ re-
porterof THe SuN, Ebbets was in the act of
signing Pitcher Kennedy to a Brooklyn contract
when the reporter met him, [le said that he had
signed in all nine members of the champion team,
but refused to give any names, saying that
secrecy would be maintained until all had been
secured.

“We are signing our players without much
trouble,” said the Brooklyn presideat, and #0 are
all of the other League clubs Tomy knowledge
Pittsburg, Chicago, St. Louis and Cincinnati have
induced all of their old players to sign. Brooklyn
has not made an atwmpt to gather in the
champions until this week. Philadelphia be
Nieves that the option clause in the League con-
tract holds good and th titis unnecessary to ask
the players to sign formally, I think when the
time comes to open the season the public will find
that the League hasgotailthe stars The play-
ers know that their salaries are sure in the League,
whereas in 4 rival organization, such as the As
sociation, they might not receive what should be
paid to them,

“A number of playera well remember the expe-
rience they bad during the Brotherhood war of
1890, when the backers of the rival leagues
lost upward of 81,000,000. ‘They also know
that the Association, which has been trying
to organize at Philadelphia this week, has
no backers like the men who put the Hroth-
erhood on strong financial legs, E. B. Tal-
eott, E. A. McAlpin, ©. Van Cou, Gen, Jourdan,
the Chaunceys, (, A. Prince, the Wagners, W. W.
Kerr, Phil Auten, Armour, Albert L, Johnson,
John Addison and F. B. Robinson were a solid
lot compared to the so-called backers of the Phila-
delphia movement, and yet they could not beat
the National League. Players know this and
also the fact that since the Brotherhood revolt
salaries have taken a big drop It was only last
year that they began t) go up, the Brooklyn Club
paying out $50,000 for the services of the
Superbas.

“The League considers the Association move:
menta dead letrnow. Inability to get backing
at Philadeiphia and Sew York bas killed it, The
withdrawal of Pr vidence is another blow, and it
will not be at all eurprising if the official announce-
ment of a disbandment is not promulgated ina
few days. The League has looked over the ground
carefully and is ready w fight for its rights.
It has the money, experience, brains and the
players. Itis ready to organize an @ssoviation
circuit of its own, if necessary, and conflict with

n’s circuit if he decides to take achance. If
the backers of the latier want to lose thelr coin,
weare prepared to accommodate them bul we
feel quite sure that they will not go on with the

 

venture, now that they appreciate the exact cone |

dition of affairs.

“So far as the situation at Baltimore is con-
cerned, we are not worrying for the reason that
we know exactly where we stand) Wecan prove
in court, if necessary, and cau show documentary

vidence that Union Park be. ngs to us untl
Sauary of next year. Under the laws of Mary-
jand @ contract by letter is legal and we can

ove beyond the questionof doubt that we leased
nion Park through the medium ofa letter sene
by Hanlon on Jan. 22 to the ownersof the property.
But that is a cide issue, Hanion and Von
der fiorst have been treated unfairly by
rsons who called themselves ther friends
cGraw, not concented with trying to deprive the
Balamore club of is grounds, he holds the
contracts signed by the Kalumore players Jast

year and refuses to hand them over tu the Balti: |

more club. The contracts do not belong to
McGraw, but he wishes to withhold them from us
ao that we cannot prosecute the players for jump:
ing the ‘option clause Hanlon, as president of
the Baltimi re club, has requested MeGraw time
and again to surrender the contracts which are
the property of the club, but he has steadily re
\used,

“MeGraw bas been well treate! by the Balimors
Club. He has received every dollar that the club
nas agreed to pay him. The men who have aided
MeGraw in this new movement have been played
for good things and do not know It Von
der Horst and Hanlon have been opposed to
the plan to reduce the League circuit by the drop-
ping of Baltimore and other cities, but they have
received no credit for it, The Brooklyn-Baltimore
syndicate has lived up to every legal and moral
requirement it has paid salaries, overlooked
offences by the players that deserved discipline
and has been opposed to oppression. I hardly be-
lieve that when the people of Baltimore have
cooled down they will sanction the treatment ac-
corded to Hanlon and Von der Horst, the men
who, by their pluck and gameness, brought three
League penuants to that city and developed
players who are noted al! over the country

“When the Association bubble has been com-
pletely exploded, the League Circuit Commitee
will resume business. I) it is decided to drop
Baltimore from the circuit, it will be time enough
then for us t) have an inping, and s0 far as we
are concerned McGraw can do as he pleases I
understand that Quin is thinking of abandoning
the East and forming 4 circuitin the West to com-

ise Chicago, Milwaukee, Detroit, St. Louis,

ansas City, Minneapolis, Louisville and Cieve-
land. If he makes a move of that sort, where
does he expect toget players? Surely not from
pe National League, for men who can play

n the big circuit will not voluntarily

drop into a minorleacue TI fee! quite sure that
such a move would be @ failure, in as much as
the players and public support would be lacking
I have mot received any intimation when the
League will hoid a meeting, but I should judge
that itwill not be verviong Robison is sul) at
Baltimore with Hanlon aud Von der Horst"

Brush, chairman o! the Cireuit Committee, has
sentouta statement thatisamusing Init head-
mits thatthe comnittee met recently at Cleveland,
which contradicts his statement mace at the time
that no meeting had been held
few bouquets atthe League, and winds up ly say
ing that the magnates have the mterests of base
ball and not their pockets at heart
mognates, by the way, say that the way they have
heen held up to ridicule by the newspapers has

been the direct) cause of this Association
movement. They way they have been mis.
represented, especially in the matter of

fostering rowdyism on the fleld. But they have

evidently forgotten the written agreement which |
Louls two vears ago to)

allof them signed at St
purty the sport, and which was promptly vio
lated by the majority of them as soon as the um
pires made a few close decisions against their
teapis.

By turning overa new leaf, by dropping trickery |

and secrecy, by coming out into the open in ry
sponse to the public demand and by adopting
methods from which sandbagging is eliminated,

the League may receive a chance ty win hack tha,

contidence of the public But under the present
circumstanves they must be blamed for the dow:
fall of the national game.

COLUMBIA'S SPORTS,

 

Dr. Peet Describes the Stroke to Be Used
by the Crews This Year.

The Columbia Untversity crews have passed

through the period of preliminary training and

! are now at work on the rowing machines,

| mastering the details of the stroke to be used |

thisyear, This is what Dr, Walter B, Peet said
about the stroke yesterday:

“The reach willbe considerably longer to-
word the stern than that used last year, The
hard eateh which tended to pull the boat out of
the water will be abandoned, but the latter will
be taken firmly and the oar pulled steadily to
the end of the stroke throuch a hard leg drive,
A bard shoulder lunge without too much jerk
will constitute the quick snap-up on the re-
covery, and thia will be followed bya slowing
down toward the end of the recovery to pre-
vent the shell from hanging between strokes
|

and losing its impetus, The whole stroke will be
more level, that is, the angle of the catch will
be more decided than heretofore and the
feather will not be carried as long. The slides
will bo started quickly on the recovery aud will

be slowed down gradually, This in general

will be our stroke for 1000."
The freshmen and the new men for the class
crewa have found much difficulty in mastering

the new stroke, and Dr, Peet has divided the
candidates into squads, each of which contains
several former ‘varsity Oarsmen to help in the
indoor practice,

Columtia will race Annapolis egain this year
and willentera crew in the senior eight of tha
Harlem Regatta on Decoration Day. On the
same day the second crew will row Harvard
University, Penosylvania and Corneil on
the Schuylkill River. This will he the
first Columbia crew to row at Philadeiphia.

Two hundred and twenty-fve men are now
working under Capt. Smith of the track team,
Maivolm Ford will take charge of the broad
jumpers; ©, U, Powell, the Cornell erack, will
coach the bigh jumpers; Trainer Mack will
handle the runners, and it is hoped that R. G.
Ciwpp, the holder of the world’s record for the
pole vault, will be able to help the vaulters. [t
| is feared that Columbia may have to withdraw

LAST OF THE POULTRY show,

The Fahibit Was the Most Successful Ever
Held in New York,

The poultry show which has been visited by
crowds during the past five days at Madison
Square Garden closed at 10:20 o'clock last night,
Of the eleven annual ex}ibite this one has been
the most successful Onancially, as weil as in
point of attendance, It bas been the only one
on which the weather has smiled kindly, all the
previous shows baving been visited by rain, sleet,
blizzards and snow. As the closing hour drew
near there was a rush by the exhibitors for the
cages containing their birds, ‘The streets eur-
rounding the Garden were lined with express
wagons and in an incredibly short time the ex

hibits were placed in single cages, hurried to |

the wagons and driven to the various railroad
depots.

Several of the express companies had provided
epecial cars which were atiached to passenger
trains leaving at mid-night
three-quarters of the cages in the Garden were
empty, and by tonight there will not be a single
feathered visitor In the vast arena. There may,
however, be a ‘possum in the Garden. Une of
these animals was brought in whan the show
opened, but he escaped on Friday night, He
scampered down ito the catacomba under the
main floor and diligent search has failed to drive
him out When the fact that there was a ‘possom
at large became known there waa a panic among
the exhibitors of poultry. Some of them remained
up all night guarding their prize winners for

A GENERAL GOLF LINKS.

MEADOW BROOK MAY BECOME THE
M,. G, A, CHAMPIONSHIP COURSE,

 

The Project Discussed After the Annual
Meeting atthe Metropolitan Club—Kx-

 

ecutive Committees to Investigate the |

Plan—Records of Cuntesis

An important move was made in the plan to
have a course inthe M. G, A. district reserved
forthe purpose of holding championship tour-
naments and other important matches at the
supper which followed the annual meeting on
VThuraday night at the Metropolitan club, It
was suggested that the Meadow Brook club
should turn over its course and golf house to
the M.G. A. forthe purpose indicated, and, as
the club delegate, O. W, Bird, seemed to think
the project a feasible one, the Executive Com-
mittve of the M. G. A, will submit it to each of
the forty-four clubs for a decision, Should
the trend of opinion be favorable, tho
association will assume the maintenance
of the links and the house, and such changea
as may be necessary will be started at once.
About three thousand yards in playing length,
the nine-hole course at Meadow Brook is one ot
the oldest and the least costly to keap in con-
dition of any in the Haat, It isanutural golfing
ground, like that at Garden City, which is also
on Hempstead Plains and only three miles
away, The Meadow Brook links can be ex-
tended to eighteen holes at only little expense,
for there 14 no luck of available land, and the
turfisso good that very little seeding or sodding
willbe required, A rule of the Meadow Brook
club permits a especial golf membership, whien
will simplify the matter should the elub allow
ita Inks to become the official M. G. A. course.

R. H. Williams of the Morris County Golf
Club was one of the strongest upholders of the
plan, In view of the growing reluctance witn
which the members ofthe M. G. A. clubs seemed
toregardthe holding of the amateur cham-
plonship, if for no other reason, hé thought the

idea a good one, for besides being used for the
M.G. A. championship and for all important
Inatches, the course could be loaned to the U,
SoG, A. forany tournaments it moeght wish to
hold. Once established in New York, “offletal’
links would spring up with similar golfing
Unions near other cities, and in time alithe U,
8G, A. champir penios wonld be deeided on
such courses, thus relieving the clubs from any
veraonal trouble and without closing any ofthe
inkato the members who belonged strictly to
the non-fournament class

The value of the Meadow rook eourse for
thie purpose was upheld by HEB. Holifns, Sr.,
of Westbrook, and others, Mr. Holins thought
that the Long Island Railroad would cooperate
Py runniog its trains on a schedule tosuitthe
golfers, or by stopping ata station that might
be putunpuatthe most accessible location,
his opinion the course might readily be con-
verted {nto one of the best go'fing centres in
the world, so that the records made there
would haveaceflnite meritin fixing the class
ofagolfer both here and in Great Britain, A
number of other golfers. spoke in warm in-
dorsement of the plan, The project may be-
come an established fact before the M.GQoA
championship is held in the spring. but it will
not affect the choice ofthe Nassau course for
this season's tournament,

GLEN Cove, Feb, 3.—The third of the series
for the Busby cup competition beganto-day ou
the Nassau Country Club jinks. The course is
still rough, due to the severe weather, and the
