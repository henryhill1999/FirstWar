——

The Dark Horse Who Seemato Have Won
the Fight in California,

SACRAMEN'T0, Cal, Fel. 8 The withdrawal
of Daniel M. Burns, which was announced after
midnight, leaves the Senatorial fleld practically
open to Thomas R. Hard, the dark horse from
Ventura county, wl ‘dno headquarters and no
tegular managers His friends telegraphed for
him to come to Sacramentoon Friday, and in the
afternoon a conference was beld, at which forty
cre men peldged themgelves to vote for hin. In
the evening a regular caucus was held whieh
Burns's thirty adherents did not atiend, as they
asserted that the aftemoon conference and the
pledge of the men against Burs and for Bard
was a violation of the caucus agreement, Despite
their absence, the caucus proceeded, and fifty one
men pledged their support to Bard, which will
secure his election tn foint session unless Burns's
thirty supporters refuse to vote. Should they
adopt this plan, there will be a deadlock, as sixty-
three votes are necessary to a choice. The gen-

eral opinion is that the thirty men pledged to
Jsurns will break up, and that Bard will be electad,

Thomas R ard has been connected with large
landed interests in Ventura county, southern
California, for thirty fice years. He verved in the
Civil War in a Margland Union regiment, and
while in the ranks was noticed by Tom Seott for
his execitive abilits He was placed in the Trans
portation Department, and did such good service

that when the war ended Seott made him, thr ugh |

he was then only 24 wears old, manager of his
railroad lands in California. When Seott died
Bard closed out this property, He remained in
Ventura county, and is largely interested in irriga
tion works, lemon orchards and oil companies
He isa man of large means. He has wo wife and
