CARNEGIE ON SHIP SUBSIDIES,

Believes Judicious Appropriations
Would Be Money Very Wisely Spent.

In many of his public utterances of recent
years, Andrew Carnegie has predicted that the
Tnited States would In time become the chief
shipbuilding nation of the worll, Hohas said,
too, that the future great seat of this industry
would be on the Hudson, fn or near thecity of
New York. Mr. Carnegie waa asked by Alex-
ander R. Smith, one of the New York Com-
merce Commissioners, the other day, if he
would prepare, for publication, a brief state-
ment of his views concerning the pending
shipping bill In his letter to Mr. Carnegie,
Mr. Smith said:

“My reason for writing to you in the matter
fe beexuse your position in the nation’s in-
Gustrial affairs gives especial value to anything
you may say, and because! believe your ex-
tended philanthropy has given you a great
influence with the people generally.”

In a letter dated Feb, 2, Mr. Carnegie has
replied to Mr. Smith, as follows;

“In reply to your request for a short state-
ment of my views In regard to subsidies for
steamahip lines, I have to say that, in imy
opinion, the chief obstacle to a rap and
permanent increase of exports lies in
the want o’ steamship lines with regalar sail-
ines. Regularity of sallngs ts one of the

“T have not had time to exam'ne the pro-
pored bill carefully, but L hepe it most favors
cheap freight carriers at moderate rates of
apera. As far as exports are concerned, a day
or two more on the vovage is bothing, Of
course, as far as naval considerations eo, aub-
aidies may be need: d for the fastest vessels,
provided these are built according to Govern-
ment need in time of war,

“Briefly, [think that a judicious bil! giving
sutaidies for a number of veara would be
money very wisely spent: indeed, it wor!’ 'd be
difficult to say how public money could teas
wisely apentatthistime. Tam confident that
after a short time few of the lines brought into
life through the encouragement a dies
would require a continuance o' these, Britain
calle her subsidies ‘compensation forcarrying
the mails.’ and for building sh pa ‘according
toadmiralty requirements.’ It might be well
for us to conform to that nomenciature, Very

on the old Paramus road which passes through |

POLICE JUSTICK'’S AUVICE

Explains What Gov, Roosevelt Meant by
the Strenuous Life.

Rocnester, Feb. 3,—This afternoon Roches-
ter's Democratic Police justice, in discharging
two boys, Benjamin Payn and Stanley Thomp-
son, who were charged with assaulting Julius
Bohrer, commen‘ed favorably on Gov. Roose-
velt's advice regarding the “strenuous life”
young men should lead.

“The Governor o! this State,” said he, “has
said on anumber of occasions that young men
should lead a strenuous life, The Governor
does not mean by that that young men should

walk down the streets with chips on their
ahonlders, and thet they should be ready to
fight on the alightest provocation, but he
means thatthey should te morally rave, that
they should be eager to do whdtis maht inthe
face of opposition, in spite of prejudice, of
public clamor and of anything that stands tn

Mrs. Baldwin Beran to Think Mrs. Gordon
Waan't Coming Back.

The neighb rsof Mrs. Mary Baldwin, who
| ves at 142 Fast Fifty-secon' street, were say-
ing unkind things about her yesterday because
she sent the onesmonth-old baby of Mra.
James Gordon, who livos in the same house, to
Bellevue Hoepitalon Friday night, when the
mother, who had left itin hercharge, failed to
come home on time. Mrs. Gordon wanted to do
some shopping and, having no one else with
whom toleave the baby, asked Mrs. Baldwin,
who lives on the floor below her to mind ft,

Thia was at 11 o'clock on Friday morning and

Mrs Gor on said she'd be bavk in halfan hour,
She didn’t return ins half an hour, but Mra,

' Baldwin's patience he'd ont until 3 o'clock,
The baby was eryine and Mrs. Baldwin wanted
togoout, She doesn't know Mra Gordon very
we'l, an! she rather got the impression that
her neighbor was trying to palm off the bab
onher Sosheecal ed ina policeman who touk
the baby to Bellevue Ho-pital,

|} It was so'clock Friday night when Mrs, Gor.

 

|

! don got home, She went right to Mra. Bald-
Win’s rooms,
| “I’ve come for the baby,” she said, “I was

kept away longer than I expected.”

L haven't got your baby,” said Mre, Bald.
win, “I thougnt you'd gone away for good
an: die ive it over to the pol ce,”

*What!” gasped Mrs. Gordon, “You gave
my baby away?” and then she burst into
| tears,

A ne'ghbor advised Mra, Gorion to gothe
East Filty-first station, which she did. The
sergeant there routed Policeman Kirby, who
took the chid to Bellevue, out of bed to find
out what he'd done with it. Mrs. Gorion went
to Bellevue Hospital then, and her child was
restored to her.
