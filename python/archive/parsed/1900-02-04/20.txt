The Best Hosiery Offer Vet.

Every one knows that the cost of labor and materials has gone away
up; that prices of manufactured goods are and are going to be higher
Perhaps We have not taiked about it so much as some other people, but
action is better than talk, and months ago, in anticipation of raised prices,

New Parlor Furniture at Unparalleled Prices.

This offering of new Parlor Furniture in advance of the season, at the
prices quoted, is indeed an unusual and memorable one. Every suit in the
collection will readily command 50 per cent. more than the marked price in
very few weeks, Every suit is entirely new; in fact, many of the styles have
their first showing at this sale and all the goods have left the manufacturer’s
workroom within 48 hours of this announcement.

We cannot recall that ever heretofore entirely new and up-to-date
styles have been offered at the prices we name notwithstanding the great
advance in the cost of manufacture. The coverings are in tapestry, satin
damask and velour, yet to make the offering exceptionally attractive we will
give the buyer the privilege of selecting coverings from a large line of color-
ings in each style

We can therefore safely promise to match the decorations of almost
any parlor or sitting room.

There are thirty patterns to select from in three and five piece suits

A Chance in Silk Remnants.

The business we have done in silks during the past month has been

the largest in the history of our house.

The reason is not far to find—we

have given better values than could be found elsewhere. Taffetas, Foulards,
fancy Taffetas, evening Silks and black Silks have vanished from our

shelves like dew before a Summer sun.

Naturally we accumulate many remnants in ends of from one yard to
ten. Enough to make a waist in most cases, enough for a skirt in others.

Still, they are remnants, and so we want you to take them at

rices way

below even the reduced prices at which the entire pieces were offered. _ It's
a good chince for you and we get rid of the odds and ends, They are all
new styles, remember, all new color combinations.

Just in line with this.qpportunity, so far as value goes, but not in the
remnant class otherwise, are 6,500 yards of the best quality Corded
Japanese Wash Silks, which we will sell at 29c. a yard. They come in
checks, stripes and plaids and all the best colors, dainty and durable.

Jackets and Capes. \F

We want to clear up all our
Winter Capes and Jackets quickly.
A good chance for a careful buyer.

iots, single and double breasted,
silk lined throughout and properiy
tailored. The same Jackets have
sold at $9.00 to $22.50, now
