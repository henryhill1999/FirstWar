FRILLS OF FASHION.

Certainly tea gowns have a new mission in
life now that it has been suggested that one which
is new and becoming is an effectual tonic fora
pretty convalescent. ‘They are, indeed, beyond
compare this season, and such dreams of beauty
we have never had before owing greatly to the
soft clinging effects in the materials. Classic
grace is one great secret of their success and not
60 much the varying moods of fashion as in
Other departments of dress.r Crepe de chine,
panne and liberty silk, are the popular materials,
but an occasional variation is seen in the beaded
nes and mousselines used for this purpose. Pale
green mousseline embroidered with jet and made
over green silk forms the model shown in’ the
iilustration, and the clasps which join it at the
sides are of silver and turquoise. The sleeves
are transparent and the bolero is solid jet, Another
pretty idea for a black combination 1s @ gown
of ab liberty silk draped with black lace flebu
stole ends in front and trimmed with black velvet
ribbon and narrow ruches of lace. Other gowns
of liberty silk illustrated have a plaited chiffon
front, and elaborate trimming of lace. Some
thing gorgeous in pale blue panne has the popular
Watteau plaic in the back hanging away from
the figure to show the outline of the waist, and
the plait starts from a transparent yoke of hand-
some lace. ‘The open front is filled in with lace
over white silk and the sides are faced back with
white silk and fastened across at the waist with
three narrow straps of black velvet drawn through
diamond buckles. It is needless to add that all
the tea gowns have a train, as they are never of
walking length, but it is a very important part,
adding a special grace to the costume. Some
of the latest models show the gathered skirt
shirred down 4 few inches below the waist, one in
mauve crepe de chine being enpoctaey .Presty,
with a heart shaped decollete neck filled in) with
adainty chemisette of lace. ‘The bodice ts bloused
alittle in front, the fulness drawn well down below
the waist line and contined by a belt of silver

among the tea gowns, and sometimes the bodice
