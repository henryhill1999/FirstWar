report of the operations of the expedition ua-
derhis command in Cavité province, from June
Loto June 22, LH. The report ie accompa

a route «ketch of the movement and a map of
the battle of Zapote River. Gen, Lawton also
enelosed copies of all messages recetved by
him and the officers of his command during
the engagement. The report covers four @n-

on reuching the place where Gen, Ovenshine’s
osed to be, found only the
eouts and two companies of the Fourteenth
enemy, No other troops
o's brigade could be seen, and when
Gen, Ovenshine reported to Gen, Lawton he
remarked that he had “scarcely any brigade
left’ Orders wereimmediately given to reform
this brigade, which was accomplished.

Hynlght the American troops were only a
mila to the southeast of Las Pinas, Gen,
Lawton says: "The day's march had been
mate over rough trails, through thick, higb
grass, with but very little drinking water, and
the fighting had been practically continuous,
making it especially trying on the entire com-

afternoon, ‘The American troops resumed the

Gen. Lawton in a letter to the Admiral com-
maniting the naval forees,in which he ex-
pressed his appreciation of the Ianding of

officers and men from the gunboat Helena and
the monitor Monadnock in support of the
companies there engaged. (en Lawton said:
‘The bearing ot ofleers and men throughout
this battle was magnificent. As Gen. Oven-
shine says, speaking of Lieut Kenly and his
battery, ‘This ls probably the first time in hise
tory that a battery has been advaneed and
fought without cover within thirty yards of
strongly manned trenches.’ The force of the
enemy was between 4.000
armed men They Lad defeated the Spantards
at this point, and were confident. of their
ability, and had taken an oath to hold this
strongly entrenched and well fortified position,
Our foree, which carried these ‘impregnable’
works was jess than 1.200 strong; really leas
than 1,000 men were actually engaged tn driv-
ing them out. Gen. Ovenshine, riding back
and forth not over 150 yarda from the enemy's
entrenchments directing his command, was
certainly an inspiring example to his men,

The American troops marched into Imus_on

insurgents were located at San Franclseo de
Malabon. After several attempts to reach this
place by direct routes, Gen, Otis ordered that
no further advance be made on Malabon.

INE ‘WARK’S OL DEST T PARK,

PROTESTS AGAINST USING IT AS A
CITY MALL SITE,

 

It Was a Training Ground When the Town |
Was Founded in 1666 and Many Memo-
ries Cluster Around It-Why the City
Hall Should Be Built Somewhere Else.

Newark is soon to have anew city hall, The
present edifice at the corner of road and William
streets has been in use for the last half-century,
and before the city got possession of it Was a tavern
of great reputation throughout the upper part of
the State. Itis now entirely too small for a city

| of 280,000 inbatitants, and some months ago @
| commission was appointed to look about for a
site for anew building. The commussion has not
yet made its report, but the impression is deepen-
| ing that it looks with favor upon Military Park,
| a triangular plot in the heart of the city, which
| has been preserved as a park since the founding
| of the town in 1666, and there is much indignation
| expressed among the older residents that any one
should so much as hint at encroaching upon this
historic stretch of lawn.
| The Mayor and the other city officials favor the
Military Park site openly, and many of the busi-
| ness men do also. They argue that, as a number
of new parks are now being opened by the County
| Park Commission in the outlying districts of the
| city and in various parts of the county, there is no
| longer need of the litte triangle whose vertex lies
just north of the point where the Morris Canal
| crosses Broad street and whose base is two blocks
further up Hy building the new city hall in ie
| park, they show that from $150,000 to 6200,000
' might be saved which would otherwise have to be
| expended upon a site. The park is centrally situ-
ated, with one of the busiest parts of Broad street
on its western side, and Park place on the other
and along the base of the triangle. They say
that no better site could be bad for the purposes
of those who would have the greatest use for the
| city hall, and that with so much open space around
it as would remain from the park if the hall were
erected about the middle of its length, a handsome
building would be shown off to good advantage.
Far too many buildings, they say, are placed upon
insutleient ground, and their architectural beau-
ties are hopelessly dwarfed and cramped,

The arguments of the opposition, those who
would never permit a building in Military Park,
are based largely upon sentiment. They say
also that the park is needed as a breathing spot;
that every large city needs such places, and that
the health of the poor peuple living in the crowded
districts a few blocks away from the park would
be affected were it taken up with acity hall. The
poor, they say, cannot afford to take trolley cars
to the parks in the suburbs and have not the time
to walk to them, or else they have not the inclina-

much use for anything else besides a park =
training ground, and none of the setilers
drawing for plots wanted it. It was for many
qenre called the Frog Pond, but aftera time was
drained and ditched and filled in, untillong before
) the Revolution it was as level as 4 table
| About eight years after the town was founded
the Indians became restive, and the town fathers
appointed a day when every man and boy in
the town between the ages of 16 and 65 should
assemble on the Frog Pond lot and give up the
day toan ee of arms and military mance
vres. Capt. Robert Treat, the leader of tha set-
tlers, instructed the men how to fight the red
men and selected on the first training day the
men whose duty it should thereafter be to carry
muskets, bandoliers and matches whenever
' service was held in the meetinghouse, Others
| were appointed who were to fire off guns while
at work in the fields in case they should detect
bs Indians stealing upon the town. ‘The sound
ene was to be the signal for the women and
cht tren to flock to the meetinghouse, and the
men were to follow last
In_ 1746 the first Episcopal church tn Newark,
old Trinity, was erected on one of the corners
of the training ground. The base of the old
church tower still stands and is a part of the pres-
ent church. Through the door in this tower
Washington passed to attend service upon the
occasion of his week's stay in Newark a short
time before the battle of Trenton, when on his
way down the State in filght from the Hritish
Later the church was used for a hospital for
wounded Revolutionary soldiers. The old church |
and its present successor were the only ones ever |
erected on the park, and there is a tradition that
the land on which the church stands shall re-
vert to the city whenever the steeple and tower

 

of the church must be painted white once in so
many years, and if this is not done the land re
vers. These tales are often told to this day,
and are actually believed by hundreds, but no
searcher of the records, no matter how diligent,
has ever been able to find any document that
| corroborates in anv way either of the stories
After the Revolution a small temple of liberty
| Was set up in the middle of the park. It was sup
| ported with thirteen columns to indicate the origi
nal States, and was made symboiic in other ways
Tt was from this pavilion that the annual Fourth
| of July orations were delivered with the people
| of the town standing about on the soft grass of
the park. The Revolutionary veterans were
marched about the park until their ranks he
came thin and the survivors were no longer able
to do much more than hobble.

Early in the 40's Newark was a
facturing city, even more prominent for its manu-
factories than it is now. As a@ result scores
of boya came into the city from adjacent towns

down. Another tradition is that the atceple |
|

reat manu-

to work in the factories and learn trades
Many of them were headstrong fellows who
could not be kept within leash on the

farm, and when they rot too obstreperous their
fathers would pack them off to Newark to work in

a shop These boys used to assemble in Mili
tary Park at night and carry on all sorts of high
jinks. There were no poife emen, only one or

two sleepy watchmen. There were no lights
about the park, and the boys could carry on about
as they chose. They built enormous bonfires,
composed of cords of wood taken from schooners
in the nearby river and of wates taken from the
fences of the residents around the park. They
held weird dances, and the older Newarkers never
tire of telling the wild deeds done in the old park
During the Civil War the regiments that went
out from Newark, and in fact from all the upper
part of the State, halted on their march to the
railroad station to say formal farewell to their
friends and relatives, and here addresses were
made to them and the stirring war songs were
sung by choruses of young girls) Many cere-
monies have heen held in the park during the
last quarter of @ century, and now that there
seems dange: that the park may be used for a
city hall the sentiment against the project is be-
coming more outepol en, day by day.
