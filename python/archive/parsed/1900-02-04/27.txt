Own a Farm in Honduras,

Make It Pay for Itself
and Yield You Substantial Profits at the Same Time.

One acre of the rich and incomparably fertile soil in Honduras yields more profit than many acres of good

farm land in the United States,
Here is a proposition which enab
vated by competent and experienced pl

same time.
The American Tropical Planting Company owns absolutely,

tation lands on the north coast of Honduras.
The crops indigenous to this soil and easily produced in enormous quantities aro

nuts, Cacao (chocolate), Oranges, Lemons, Bananas, Vanilla, Tobacco and Sugar Cane.
This property has a fine harbor of its own and is only three days from Mobile or

Guaranteed 59 Bonds.

The Company has issued 5,000 profit-sharing plantation bonds under a Deed of Trust made to The Corporation

Trust Company of Delaware. : ;
These bende bear five per cent. interest, and each represents one five-thousandth of the entire plantation with

all improvements, buildings, machinery, or other property of the Company.

The bond not only pays five per cent. dividends but it entitles the holder to a definite and proportionate share
of all profits,

The Company takes its pay

acres in these bonds.
Thus it will be seen that the Company and the purchaser of the bond stand on an absolutely equal basis. The

Company must make money for the bondholders or it can make no money for itself--it owns absolutely nothing
except bonds,
” For these bonds it not only relinquishes all title to the property but binds itself to develop and market the

products for twenty-five years,

All the Property Goes tothe Bondholders

At the expiration of that time the Company binds itself by contract to turn over the entire plantation and all
its property to The Corporation Trust Company of Delaware to be sold to the highest bidder and the proceeds of the
sale are to be distributed pro rata among the bondholders.

The bonds are now offered for sale at only $200 each, They may be paid for, if desired, upon the partial pay-
ment plan and held in escrow by The Corporation Trust Company of Delaware, to be delivered to the purchaser when
he shall have completed his payments,

Thus the holder of one bond, for which he pays only $200, becomes possessor of one acre of this valuable and
fertile property.

; Sroperis | cultivated, an acre of Honduras land yields at least $100 profit perannum. The holder of the bond
draws his five per cent. dividend, gets the profits accruing from the cultivation ot the land—which in a very short
time will repay his entire investment, and at the end of twenty-five years receives his pro rata share from the sale
of the entire property, which at that time will of course be immensely valuable.

Profit-Sharing Dividends.

Over 1,000 acres are already under profitable cultivation, and levery acre of the remaining 4,000 can be placed
under immediate cultivation with no expense beyond that necessary in ordinary plantation farming, Such being the
case, a profit-sharing dividend of from 5 to to per cent, is an almost absolute certainty at the end of the first year.
This, of course, is in addition to the guaranteed 5 per cent. dividends which the bonds draw,

This profit-sharing dividend will grow bigger and bigger every year, and just as soon as the whole property is
developed sulficiently to enable the Company to reap the full benefit of its natural resources the holder of a bond
which now costs $200 will receive at least half that sum every year. His bond will be worth $1,000, at the very lowest
and most conservative caleulation,

Thisis absolutely the biggest money-making proposition open to the public to-day and the investor is perfectly
sate because the Company itsell cannot make money unless he does, andthe whole management and disbursement of
moneys is in the hands of one of the strongest financial institutions in the United States.

Investigate this.

Send for our booklet, “The Main Points of the Proposition,” which explains all these matters in detail, contains
maps of the Company's property, and gives quotations and extracts from GOVERNMENT REPORTS showing the
marvellous fertility of this territory and the character of the crops raised,

FINANCIAL AND COMMERCIAL,

 

Saturpay, Fob, 3,
The weekly statement of averages of the As-
sociated Banks made a much better showing
than nad been oxpected, The increase In law-
ful money was nearly 54 millions, The apeca-
lative community, h wever, was inclined to

 

belittle this change and was d sposed to at- |

tach importance to the Increase of nearly
114 millions in the loans. That Increase ts
easilyexplained, The banks have been fairly
large buyers of commercial paper this week
and at the same time Stock Exchange require-
ments have been greater than for some time
past, owing to the moderate revival of apecula-
tion in seeuritics, Moreover, local bankers
bonght $5,000,000 city bonds last week and

$7,000,000 city of Pittaburg bonds this week, |

making a total of $12,000,000 to be financed
until the obligations mentioned are placed
with investors, The expansion in the loans
may, therefore, be attributed chiefly to the
transaction of actual business rather than to
speculation,

The average increaso in deposits {ts not as
large ae it should he by about $1,300,000, The
net result, an increase of nearly $1,600,000
in the surplus, brings that item up to $30,-
871,275. Now that the diversion of in-
ternal revenue collections from the Trens-
ury to the special depository banks has

the banks will have to de-

ceased,
pend entirely upon the interior movement

| for anv further improvement in their condl-

tion, Atthe moment they are atrong enough
for all practical purposea and are in faet in
condition to  inereaae moderately thelr
accommodations to customers and others.
Should the receipta of money from the interior
fall off or the speculative community make
considerable demands upon lenders the prea-
ent rates for money might easily prove to be
the lowest of the season, This possibility will
logically serve to keep speculation within con-
servative limits,

The dealings tn stocks to-day were on
a fairly large and the market was ir-
regular, owing to realizing salea at the end
of a week of rising prices, The net changes,
which fayoret| toth accounta, were asa rule
fractional, About the only noteworthy net
fluctuation was a decline of 2% per cent.

selling movement shortly before the close
of business. On the other hand, St. Paul com-
