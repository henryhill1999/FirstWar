Harold Pauer, who is to be heard for the first

he made M. Paderewski's acquaintance through
his teacher. Mr.Graham P. Moore. profeasor
at the Royal College of Musle. M, Paderewski,

forte, advised him to continue his studies in
Paris, and in 1802 M. Bauer went to the French
capital and received instructions from M,
Paderewski on the pianoforte and M. Gorski
on the violin. The following year he decided
to devote himself wholly to the pianoforte

properly, It seems incredible to Americans
that such @ state of affairs should have existed
for 80 many years in the opera house of the
largest civilized city in the world, and the sit-
uation can only be attributed to the English
indifference to music in operatic or almost any
other form. The funds required to make these
important alterations will not, of course, come
out of the profits of the season just conchided,
but have been liberally subscribed by the syn-
dicate of stockholders

The failure, from a financial viewpoint, of
the Tondon Philharmonic Society's season
has compelled the call for an assessment of
10 per cent. on the guarantors and brought
out the fact that most of the soloists either ap-
peared for nothing during the season or for very
smal feew Jt seems that MM. Pace
and Rosenthal were the only performers who
drew large audiences and under the ctreume
stances it might be suggested that the New
York plan of engaging attractive artists and
peving them their full fees would prove more
profitable in the end. Part of the society's
deficit this vear is due to the purchase of a
diamond ornament as a wedding present for
Clara Butt.

The late Duke Alfred of Saxe-Cobura was
a pupll on the violin of Sir Charles Halle and
devoted himself to a study of the instrament
with great enthusiasm for an amateur. tis
only published composition was a waltz called
“Galatea,” although he was the composer of
other works that were said to be quite worthy
of performance. Perhaps this would never
have been said if anybody but a duke had
written them. It was at his sugwestion that
the Royal Amateur Orchestra was formed
and the duke acted as first violin at the earlier
jubilee performances. He was also a soloist
on one oceasion and plaved a number by Spohr
and when Mme. Marie Rose sang the Gounod=
Bach “Ave Maris,” he plaved the obbligato,
He was for a long time a patron of the Royal
Academy of Music and played an active part
in founding the National Training School for
Music, which developed later into the Royal
College of Music. It was the late Duke's pred-
ecessor, Duke Ernst Il. who is known as the
composer of two operas, one of which was
sung at the Metropolitan Opera House.

Tt is said that MM. Jean and Edouard de
Reszke and Mmes. Ternina and Brema may
give “Tristan und Isolde” in Paris in German
during November. But M. De Reszke’s friends
place little belief in the rumor, as it is known
that he will devote himself exclusively to the
recovery of his health until the time comes for
him to appear at the Metropolitan

Fanelon Thompson has been singing with

The Grand Opéra is to have a new curtain, made
of aluminum instead of the tron curtain that
the law requires which has hitherto been tised
in the theatre. It is to be sixty feet broad. It is
expected that it will at least have the advantage
over iron of not feeling quite so heavy if it

to completion in the month of Aucust, 147
When it was decided to produce the work, in
response to an imperative demand fre Wag-

careful. Liszt conducted at all the rehearsals,
and spared himself no labor to make the per-

The directors of the opera contributed $1,500 for
the expenses of the production, which was at
that time regarded as a moat liberal allowance

anxious to get an education, but lacked the
means. They were aware of the profit in trap-
ping minks, also of its uncertainties, So they
were prompted to try raising thera, Lo three

two Extremes tn Ticket

The suc ess of last week's only new play, aside |

from that large portion due to the presence of
Andrew Mack as principal actor, lay entirely in
its many theatrical but effective scenes, It
seemed as if these five or six striking situations
had been devised, and then a drama written
aroundthem. “The Rebel" showed conclusively
that James B, Fagen ts a better scenario writer
than play writer, Had he been dexterous in

| itself

his use of his material he would have turned out |

would please the more
thoughtful ob-erver as weil as it surely has
the casual onlooker. Mr. Fagen had taken his
material from various soure *s, yet treatedit orig
inally The most stirring scene of the play was
obviously acopy from “Held by the Enemy,"
but a novel change had been made, It will be
remembered that the fourth act of Wilham
Gillette's war melodrama was in an old church
used asa hospital. The heroine's brother was
there, Wounded anda prisoner. She and her
friends had devised a plan for his escape. The
physican told the authorities that the boy wus
dead, and asked that bis sister might have his
body for burial, Permission wos granted and
the corto reached the out r vestibule before
it was stopped. The boy was being carried on
a stretcher, covered over, face and all, with a
blanket. The villain, an officer of the enemy,
saw the lad breath and ciscovere! that he
wasn't dead, Then followed a period of sus-
pense, dramatically written and construcwd
with all Mr. Gillette's knowledge of stage-
craft brought to bear, a@ scene that it is
not capering to say is one of the most dramatic
in our American drama, The sister and her
friends argued, pleaded and were delant with
the v liain (hey knew that inthe boy's weak
atate delay might be fatal. Finally the officer,
by this time sure of his point, pulled back the
covering from the lad's face to prove that he
was alive. The sister felt that her last hope had
vanished, but the villain said, “You may take
the body; heis dead.’ Belleving tiat h» was
mistaken, the girl was overjoyed that her plan
of escape was successful, but one glance at her
brother showed her that the man’s words were
true. While they weretrying to take himout
under the blanket. he bad died of his wounds.
A scene in ‘Tho Rebel” resembles that
elvsely, and if as well handled, would be al-
most as effective, On the eve of his
death the hero escapes from prison in a coffin
intended fora brother prisoner who has come
mitted suc He js put in a vault,
whence his and a friend come to rescue
him. ‘Hoey are about to lift the lid ot the coffin

her point of view itis @ most tragic situation,

the only feeling created is, what a good joke on

scene, nevertheless
An earlier scena in ‘The Rebel’ is alsoan
ihustration of « dramatic idea rather clumsily

THE DEMORALIZED DOBLEYS

THEY'VE BEEN ON A VACATION AND
HAVEN'T A CENT LEFT.

That Last Meal on the Paddlewhec! Emptied
Their Parses-Then They're Dressed in

“A little vacation,” said Mr. Dobley, “is a
dangerous thing.”

He was seated with his wife on the deck of
the Paddlewheel, upon which they were
turning from a brief resting spell out of town,

“It was vou who insisted on our going away”
said Mrs. Dobley For my part | long ago
concluded that home is the best place in sum-
mer time.”

“The strenuous life of the American va
tion", continued Mr. Dobley, “instead of re-
freshing and revitalizing the tired brain worker,
sends him home with a battered belfry and a
rooted distaste for exertion,’

“Of course there is a relaxation
but ithelpsin the end,” remarked Mre

‘But we happen to live in the present,

selves into a future rieh with possible advant-

“The change in you
Mr. Doble {
sitting upon the deck of a boat without © hat,
having contracted the peculiar habit of going
bareheaded. The reault is that your
skin is burned to a sort of burnt ochre tint
fecked with sealskin freckles. You have
formed the amazing idea that you must wear
your shirt waist rolled back to your
elbows as though you were about to begin a
heavy day’s washing. You have shortened
your skirts and your russet shoes are badly
in need of a shine. When you do reach town
and put on your hat to go uptown, it is a hat
that will excite remark.”

‘It is the very newest thing in hata,” said
Mrs, Dobley; “a white felt sombrero with a
green veil, I think it's all right.”

“All right the top of a mountain peak
or on a sandy beach, or the cover of a aummer
home guide,” said Mr. Dobley; “but not within
the confines of a great city, Besides that, you
are laden with bunches of grass, cattails, golden
rod, and bundles of shells. In abasket at sour
foot is @ strange eat with which have
formed some odd afMliation.”

“If you are referring to Koko,” sald Mre
Dobley, “be kind enough to remember that
it is a pure Angora kitten. Besides we can
take a cab.’

“That's it," said Dobley, “vou have re-
turned with the cab habit. People go away
with the intention of climbing mountains and
walking miles a da, over country roads, Be-
fore they are an hour in the mountains or at
the seashore a lethargy sets in and they go
around in hacks and stages and rolling chairs
Anvthing to avoid exercise Arriving in
town the cam seem tame and common place.
So they frolis about in cabs, although they
frequently have no money to pay their ordi-
nary bill For it is the invariable rule to
return from a vacation pecuniarily embar-
rassed f :

“How perfectly ridiculous!” said Mra. Dobley.

"It is only too true,” said Dobley. “Look
about you Do you see one happy, L-am-
going-on-my-vacation - and - have - money-to-
buraface? Notone. There is always a wealthy
people starting Lneir vacations,
Sometimes the look lasts only two days and
they return home dejected by high rates and
sleeping on cots in the smoking room But
the expression ia there when they start, and
it is a beautiful thing to observe Few people
start for a vacation without money, while
many save up ull the year so that for a tew briel
weeks they may live at a rate entirely beyond
their cireumstances. The return home is al-
ways pathetic * 7 .

Oh, if that is all that’s troubling you, said
Mra peniey you can get some more money

bau

‘That is a magnificent theory,” said Mr.
Dobley, “if it always worked practically there
would be no end of socialism, anarchy and dis-
content, But banks are not loan associations
and the inroads made upon these institutions
by the vacation habit causes the world of finance
to totter.’ 9°

‘T wonder if we can get anything to eat!
mused Mrs. Dobley. i'm awfully hunery

so um I," said Mr, Dobley. “Another
instance of the demoralization of vacation,
When we left town our appetites were health-
ful and normal, but not over-developed, You
may remember that When we reached the High-
ball Lun we discussed the question of the a la
evrte and the American plan dining room,
deciding on the former.’ :

‘{ thought it would be nicer,” said Mrs,
Dobley, “to fust get what we wished, when we
wished Tho regular bills of fare give so
much that one doesn't want. I thoughtit would
be much more ecouormiecal on the European
plan,”

It would,” said Dobley, “under ordinary
ciroumstances; but we both developed fierce
and ferocious vacation appetites We've been
having two breakfasts a day for the last three
weeks.’

“Oh, you can't call that little luncheon after
an oceal) bath a breaktaat,” said Mrs. Dobley.

We had two breakfasts to-day,” said Dobiey
seriously, “without any ocean bath 1 feel

While on their vacations they do," said
Dobley. “but suppose we can't break off this

P. T. BARNUM'S TURTLE,

Mr. Bennett Catches an Animal Marked by the
Showman tn His Boyhood,

Danpury, Conn, Aug. 25.-A relic of the
boyhood of P. T, Barnum, the showman, wag
unexpectedly discovered yesterday at Bethel,
Barnum's birthplace. It is a one-hundred-poundg
snapping turtle, in the shell of which is cut the
inscription:

Barnum in his reminiscences tells of Devil's
Island, a swamp island near his boyhood home,
where he had a flerce encounter with a nest of
snakes, It was close to this island that Nathan
I. Bennett, a New York diarmond merchant, dise
oovered this living relic of the showman, Mr,
Bennett's summer home is near by, and being
A sportsman he recently bought the swamp
and with it the island. The former containg
many sluggish streams where some kinds of
fish abound and snakes are plentiful. Mr.
Bennett started out to look over his new posses:
sions and ventured far into the swamp

Coming to a boggy place he stepped upon @
moss covered bowkler, as he supposed, and
was instantly precipitated into the wet bog,
The bowlder rose up beneath him and walked
away. Mr. Bennett had mistaken a monster
turtle for a stone, and when he had wiped the
swamp mud from his face and recovered from
the start that the unexpected antic of the supe
posed bowlder had given him,he went in pursul®
efit. He was unable to handle the monster
alone and two workmen came to his assistance,
[he turtle did not submit to capture withou
a fight It was | on a stoneboat an
drageed to Mr. Rennett'« farm, When the
rooss and dirt were seraped from the turtle’s
back the Inscription cut there by the showman
when he was a lad was discovered Mr. Bannett
shipped the turtle to some of his friends in New
York tie reptile is estimated to be ore
than one hundred years old. Its shel) wi be
preserved asa relic of P. T. Barnum
