IRREGULARITIPS IN THE HAND,

have eltber more or less than his correct number of
cards, or the trump card {s notin the dealer's hand,
or any card except the trump card Is so faced as to ex-
pose any of the printing on Its face, and less than
three tables are engaged, there must he a new deal.
If more than two tables are in play, the hands must
be rectified and then passed to the next table; the
table at which the error was discovered must not
orerplay the deal, bul shalltake the average score.

See. 2. If, after the first trick has been turned and
quitted on the overplay  f a deal, one or more cards
are found to have been left in the tray, the players at

how or nohow, their interest in the deal being

Although this may be a deal in which there is
the possibility of quite a sewing, perhaps enough
to settle the top score, the players at the next
table are obliged to take the average on it,
through no fault of theirs. Heretofore it has
been the custom to allow the deal to be played

See. 4. The penalty for a revoke is the transfer |

of two tricks fromthe revoking side to thelr adver
saries. If more than one revoke during the piay of a
deal is made by one side. the prnatty for each ad-
ditional revoke is the transfer of one trick only. It
can be enforced for as many revokes as occur during
the play of a deal, but fy limited to the number of
tricks won by the offeading side; no palr, however,
ean score more than thirteen on the play of any one
deal. The revoking player and his partner can not
score more than the average on the deal In whieb the

LAW XI
MISCELLANPOUS
Section 3. A player has the rightto prevent his

partner from committing any trregalarity, except |

revoking.

See, 4. Ifeitherof the adversaries, whether with
or without his partner's consent, demands or waives @
penalty towhich they are entitled, such decison is
final; tf the wrong adversary demands apensity or @
wrong p'nalty is demanded. none can be enforced

The clause about one paneer’ waiving a)

penalty is likely to lead to trouble, Some
players are entirely too good natured, under

the impression that they are acting tbe part |
of gentlemen, and the moment any irregue- |

larity occurs they say Don't mention it, my
dear fellow. Go right along as if nothing
had happened Under this law, such ex-
clamations will effectually bar the partner
froin enforcing any penalty, and a= smiling

shake of the head will ibtless be construed |

as a waiver if the advereary is at all keen on
the game, It is now the eral custom to
allow either partner to insist on his rights
and to waive them only by mutual consent

THE STANDARD SYSTEM

There were some suggestions about changing
the standard system of play, but no one seemed
to take any interest in the matter further than

good joke by trying to change it. The official
organ seems to think the system must be quite
por ular and used by a great nuniber of players,
eeulse SO many copies of it have been dis-
tributed A good many copies of the Rubaiyat
have been disposed of in the past few years,
but it would be diffleult to find any one who
followed its teachinas who is not in jail. There
were people at the tenth congress who told you
they Were playing the standard system, but a
very superficial questioning disclosed the fact
that they were about as familiar with it as most
persons are with Shakesveare. They could
make a quotation here and there, but they all
had mental reservations about certain parts,
Which would seem to plice their alleged stand-

ard system as in the “modified” class, a defint- |

tion which is now given to any @ide departure
from anything. [! there is any j layer living
who sticks absolutely to the standard system
verbatim, he should
be stuffed and put in a museun

There were some hands played at the con-
gress which would dely any system, standard
or otherwise, to explain how ce in results
were obtained. Take the following example,
played in the open , airs on Wednesday after-
noon, the queen of hearts turned by Z

Trick 2. A finesses the second round of trum
because he knows tbat even if he catches the
jack he cannot also catch the ueen and he would
rather have the lead come upto him, Theonly
advantageof three rounds of trumps immediate-
ly would be to get a discard from his partner,

Trick 5.—Y places the deuce of trumps. with

make this little trump on the clubs so he shifts,
but instead of starting his long suit he leads
his singleton, in which sult he hopes his partner
may be stroug as he is so weak himself. A lucky

lay

; Trick 8. A plays hia major tenace suit cor-
rectly, leading the small card first. If he begins
with the ace he is certain not to make another
trick unless his partner tas an honor

This does not look like a slam hand, but at

correct principles of second-hand play and put
the Jack on the first lead of trumps, Y and Z

YORK AND BROOKLYN.

A Vigorous Campaign Expecced Among the
Private Institutions of the Two Cities
~Preparations Now Going On to Select
Strong Teams—Ready for Practice Gossip.

In a week or so almost all of the large private
achools of the New York and Long Island Inter-
scholastic Association will be in running order.

The young athletes will devote their first week

to finding out what the sentiment is {n respect

to football The season is expected to be
brighter than at first supposed, and the struggle
for the championship honors more severe, The
coaches and captains are hard at work selecting
candidates to mould together strong teams and
all will be ready for practice {n a short time.
The rivalry in athletics between the New York
and Long Island associations is more intense
this season than ever before, There willbea
number of intercity matches, and both assoct-
ations are more than anxious to carry off the
honors, The Long Island League has the ad-
vantage over the looal lads, as its age limit ts

21 years, while in this city the age tmit is 20,

A year more toa schoolboy is a great deal, as

the various interscholastic meetings have

shown. Just why the New York Interscholastic

Association sticks to the 20-year limit when all

the other associations in the United States set

the limit at 21 isnot known. P. H. Christensen,
who holds the national interscholastie record
for the mile run, 4 minutes 42 3-5 seconds, re-
cently said

“The) New York Interscholastio A. A. can
never hope to defeat the ‘un-East’ assoclations
unless the age limit ts raised. Several futile
efforts have been made toadd a year to the
old limit of 20 years, At the Iast national
meet the local body was represented by as fine

a set of young men as ever trod the cinderpath,

but try as they might, {6 was utterly impossible

to compete successfully against the boys from

Roston, who had a year more of experience

and training bebind them’

In regard to the masagement of football
games in the championship series, notices have
been sent out to the effect that no one will be
allowed on the gridiron except those that have
offici il business there, and that no grounds will
be engaged unless sufficient police protection is
@ssured In speaking of thes: notices Dr.
Moore of Colurobla Grammer Sehool said

“itis hard torecall a single Interscholastic
football game at which the spectat
within the space allotted to them ¢
from dashing over the ropes and
with the players. In aimost every game played
immediately alter the hick-off the crowd with
one grand rush swarmed out of the grandstand
and over the ropes into the fleld, and intertered
so with the players that the games had to be
stopped several times. Concerted school eries
do very jittle good toward urging @ team to
victory; in fact, they are the cause ofa good

} deal oi fumbling, as the signals are very often

not hearionu account! of the noise In fulure no
one will be allowed on the fleld of play and Iam
sure that the games can then be played without
interferencefrom the crowd "

Lhe candidates for the Kyies School football
team of The Mronx Schoo! League have re-
ported for practice. The following players will
inake the team: Alurphy, left end; Beasley, left
tackle; Bates, left guard, Farney, centre, Mere
#ans, right guard; Graf, right tackle; Uy ton,
rightend, Brant, quarter back: Lane, lett half
back, Wiley, right half back, Thompson, cap-
tain and tull back

Murphy, who will play left end, is a good boy
for the position Although a litde light, hefs
strong on tu t, runs and tackles well, and is
in every play. Beasley played rigit guard in
the eleven last )ear lie is a good football
player and makes every ounce of his weight
teli. His tackling, breaking through and run-
ning with the ball, places him in a ciass by him

sell. He plays hard and steady from bevinning |

toend. Bates isa nowcomer to the school, and
has the making of a fins guard. His great
strength, combined with his welaht, makes @
combination hard to get through. fits fleetness
in runoing ith the ball is one of the features of
his playing

Forney is another new boy on the team. He
bli cks hard and follows the ball well, Mergans
isan excellent player. He has | ned to use
his strength well. ile plays steady and hard
and follows the bali well, At stopping centre
plays he is good, Graff played, ceutre last sea-
son, Where he earned the title of the best player
atthe po-ition in the Bronx League. He blocks
well, is a sure tackle and runs in excellent style
with the ball. He is good at breaking through
and stopping plays. Upton is an ol! boy at the
school. Heis an all-round player, rarely miss-
ing a tackle, andis very speedy down the field
in kicks.

Brant fills the vacancy left at quarter back
by Upton, who will play rightend, Brant's
passing is true, and leiasure to get the ball
sromptly to the runner and at the proper time,

ane played righthalf back last year. He ia
stockly built and shows very gvod judgment
in interference. tlis tacxling is of a highorder
and be downs his man with force, Willey
played left tackle on the team last year. He is
a very speedy boy and when well clearof the
ends very few can catch Lim, Captain Thomp-
son played in the same position last year n
addition to bei 4: a sure tackle he isa good line
bucker. His catching is sure and his punting is
excellant

Cutler School will place a football team onthe
gridiron again this fall. The eleven will be con
posed of new material, as allof the old players
have graduated Manson goes to Harvard,

| where he will make a strong addition to both

the track nd football teams Fosdick, Doug-
las and Buck have not decided as yet where to
go, but wherever they land they will prove ex-
ceiient additions tofany team. Warren, who
played such a star game behind the line, will
probably go into business, while Littlejohn and
Akin willwo to Columbia. George Salmon, the
athletic trainer, returned to town last week and
began active prepurations for the opening of
the football season At Cutler, when seen by
THE SUN reporter, he said that last year's
experience had taucht him that. training on
the home field brought better results than the
surmmer resort mnethod of former seasons, and
that the preliminary squad had theretore been
o. dered to report at. Columbia oval the first
week in September. The ten days before school
opens willbe devoted to light work passing and
falling on the ball, punting, catching and run-
ning

The Berkeley School candidates will take a
very conspicu, us partin the football proceed-
ings this fall. They are determined to have a
winning eleven, and neither time nor expense
is being spared to attain this object. The
team will be composed mostly of new boys who
will go into training at Berkeley Oval next week
Mavbury. the crack quarter back of last year,
will be back and play in the same position. It
is likely that te will be elected captain of
the team. Roome, the little left end, will
also pilav on the team adain, and
with additional experience = will prove
astrong player this season. Dr. J. 8. White,
headmaster of the school is enthusiastic on the
subject of athletics and will doeverything in his
power to assist the boys in wioning the banner
this year. He has establiened a rigid rule,
however, that studies must take precedence
over football, and that all candidates must
stand wellin their per entagess if they desire
to make the tean

In recognition of the excellent work done by
left Half Back Smith of theWoods School team
Jast year, he has been elected captain of tha
football team for this season. Thore is some
talk o. holding an entertainment for the bene-
fit of the Athletic Association in the near future
Capt. Smith will soon put the candida
work. Johnson. who played quarterback
year, Will again be in his old position. He
also a good half-mile runner and will greatly
strengthen the track tearn thia s’ason

It is not known whether Drisler School will
support a football team this season or not. At
the schoolit was said that the boys are a i{ttle
siow in showing up, and therefore it will be
Eakin,
Marshal], Schmid and Prentage are likely to re
back to help boom the gridiron sport. Should
however, a football team be organized, it wil
by po means :eceive the attention that will be
given to hockey. In the latter a strong team
will bedeveloped

On the best authority it can be said that Madi-
son School will resign its membership in the
New York Interscholastic Association The
school Was on the verge of taking this step last
year, but owing to the efforts of N. Von Taube,
it was decided to remain another season. This
season, however, all of the good athletes have
graduated. The school has never taken a
prominent part in athletics, lacking the proper
material

Although Dwight School does not expect to
win the champlonship in football the prospects
ot a first-class team are good. A marked tin-
provement isexpected from last year's boys,
and with the new materialon hand the sehool
should be héard from. Theathletes were some-
what handicapped lset season owing to want of
training space, but they will fare better at their
new quarters, 15 West Forty-third street 4
three-story brick and stone addition has been
built, and the whole interior of the main build-
ing reconstructed, The gymnasium is sixty feet
long and seventeen feet high, and occupies the
full width of the building. It is thoroughly
equipped with the best apparatus, and has an
exvert «toff

For the past few years the athletes at Wilkon-
Vail School have taken a back seat, but this
year they have a surprise in store. The school
intends placing astrong eleven inthe fleld and
as there are several excellent players available
they should make a formidable combination

VALE FOOTBALL PLANS.
The Eleven Will Begin Tratoing on Sept. 19
Schedale of Games,

New Aaven, Aug. 25.—Gordon Brown, cap-
tainof the Yale footballiteam has fust sent
out not.ces stating that he will return to New
Haven on Sept 15 to begin the training of the
Yale eleven. Capt. Brown has asked all the
old pluyers to report as near that date as pos
sible and not later than Sept. 19. On the latter
dute he expects to have all the old players back
and to begin a daily line-up in order to prepare
the team for Yale's opening came of the season
with Trinity on Sept, 20 in this ety.

Owing to the fact that Yale has arrange@@
game for the first Saturday after theopening of
college on Sept. 27, it will be necessary for the
team to learn some tricks in siznals before
college opens. Usually Yale has not attempted
to line up a team until after the opening of col-
lege. It is expected that one or two coaches
will come to New Haven with Capt. Brown to
assist him from the very beginning in the de-
velopment of the team

Capt. Brown does not propose to loseany foot
ball players this fall on account of low standing
in studies, Warned by Yale's experience of
ast season, when half the members of the
regular team were on probation during
most of the season, Capt. Brown has lasueda
timely warning to all men who are in the habe
of neglecting their books, The letter which he
has sent out reads as follows

The management of the Yale University Football
Assoctation wishes to call the attention of the candi-
dates furthe 1v00 team tothe following rules of the
college concerning scholarships

“In the academile department no student ts allowed
to represent his class or the college in any athletle
organization as officer, member or substitute if hets
under discipline for irregularity of attendance or con-
duct, or under warning for low standing, or tf hie
average mark for the previous term was below 2.25,
fhe same restriction applies during the fall term te
freshmen having five entrance conditions,

“Inthe SheMelid sclentiNe school no student will
be allowed to act as officer or member of any athietie
organ zation tf beis under oficial warning for low
standing or trregularity of attendance, if he has out
standing conditions, if he is repeating work witha
lower class, or if he ts on probation."’

The captain concludes his letter witb the ad-
vice that the members of the senior and junior
classes who intend to play football arrange
their courses so thgt they either do not have any
afternoon recitations or, if they do have after-
noon recitations, to arrange to have them after
§ o'clock

Capt. Brown and the Yele team have both
suffered a lossin the death of Charies Tracy
Brown, Yale, ‘03. Yale has recently lost sti!
another man who was regarded as a likely man
for the team this season. Cunha, the big Ha-
walian who was tried at centre on the ‘Varsity
last fall, has written to friends in this
city that he does not intend to return
to Yale. Cunha expects to enter the Leland
Stanford University in California this
full Cunha feels very sore because Yale did
not think he was good enough to play centre
rush last fall and to catch on the ‘Varsity nine
this season. Owing to his injured feelings he
has decided to quit Yale. Under these circum-
stances a good many Yale men will not regret
Cunha’'s de varture, It has always been a
princtple at Yale that Yale can get along with-
out even the best athletes if they are not loyal
to Yale,

Yale's schedule of football games has been
changed considerably since {t was first ane
nounced last March. The revised schedule for
the season is as follows

Saturday, Sept 28, Trinity at New Haven; Wednes-
day, Oct. 8, Amherst at New Haven; Saturday, Oct
6. Tufts at New Haven; Wednesday, Oct 10, Bates

The Physical Directors’ conference recently
held at Dayton, Ohio, has caused considerable
discussion among the Y. M.C. A. athletes in
general. Some important changes have been
recommended to the Athletic League of North
America

It was decided that in dealing with men who
come into the xymnasium for special treatment
the physical director should have the coMpera-
tion of a physician. It was voted to recom-
mend to the Athletic League that steps be
taken to put bowling on an amateur basis. It
was also voted to recommend that the rules for
rupning high jumpand pole vault be change
to conform to the rules ofthe A. A VU. except
that in the running hich jump the stick shall be
raised by the oMcials two inches each ime and
the pole vurilt ir inches emak tune

branches of this city and Erooklyn are perfz: .
ing plans for the fall and winterseason, bee
sides basketball the interesting features next
winter will be gymnastics and competition in
that line betweén representative teams of the
different branches will be held

The new members of some of the branches
have recently shown astrong desire to organ-
ize football teams to represent their respective
branches, and the chances are that their desire
willint rest ®:veral of the old members to such
anextent that teains wilbeorganized. There
has only been one team in former yer
which was the representative tenm o the
oe a 4. This has caused a great deal of
dissatisfaction among thoss that did not secure
