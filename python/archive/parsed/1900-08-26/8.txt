Heavyweights, Excepting Choyosk!, Barred
at Chicago.

With the end of the boxing game In sight
in thie State it ls not probable that the big heavy-
weights will find a fleld for thelr operations
at Chicago, Jeffries, Corbett, Sharkey, Fitz-
simmons and Rublin, and in fact all the heavy-
weights except Joe Choynski, whose home is
at Chicago, will have to glve that city a wide
berth. mong other pugilists who, {t is said,
are not wanted at the Windy City by the au-
thorities are Kid MeCoy and Tommy Ryan.
The reason for this ban is that the big men at-
tract too much attention and also that the
boutea in which they eagnge Invariably develop
into prize fight» During the past year Fitz-
simmons, Rublir, Sharkey and MeCcy lave
appeared in Chicato three times. Fitz knocked
out Jeff Thorne, and Sharkey settled Choynaki
Ruhlin and Jack M Cormick wont the limit,

did MeCoy and Ryan and MeCoy and Chorn-
si The police do not desire any knock-cutes
and believe that the big man usually settle
heir grievances before the limit. With the
al man tabooed the fight nromoters of Chi-
cago will be placod at a vantage in secir-
ing high-class drowing cards. However, an
efiort will he made to have the present six-
round standard incraased to a limit of eleht
and possibly ten rounds.

FITZ AFTER JEFFRIES.

 

vengaton | Money Posted fora Fight Next Friday—Jeffries

Hangs Fire.
If Jim Jeffries decides to fight Bob Fitz-

hy yor simmons he can be quickly accommodated

for Pius sald yesterday that he ts ready to take
him on next Friday night, and what's more,
Lanky Bob is prepared to have the mill fought
at Madison Square Garden. By a good stroke
of business the management of the Twentieth
Century Club secure! Fitz's signature yester-
day and Uf Jeffries consents for a speely battle,
which {s rather improbable, the contest will
be decited in this city. Fitz's willingness
to Indulge in another scrap before Sept. 1 came
in the nature of a surprise, as it was thought

he Conso- | that he did not intend to do any more fighting

for six months at least. Billy Brady was seen

fr; yesterday about Fitz's proposition. As was
for the women | expected, he refusal to arrange a match be-

tween Jeffries and Fitz for Aug. 31. Brady
Bald:

“Fitz can make all the bluffs he wants to
now. He has the upper hand, but Jeffries
fa the champion and will dictate terms. Jef-

fries quit training about ten days ago in
no condition to meet an thody ago ong idan
night. Why didn't Fitz «lve us hi pegarppce
about two weeks ago when we as him,

pha pe would take on the gi ampion? No,*
e did not care to because he did no ean t
fight. Now that Jim in no condition an

a decided disadvantage if he agreed

inside of a week, Fitz tric
to make a grand stand play. Well, wo wil
call his bluff

te an have armill with Jeffries, but, it will
not next week. There are plenty of places
outeide of this State where the pair can settle
their grievances. And what's more the world
fe not coming to an end right away. When
Fitz was the champion he only fougbt ogee tn
two vears. Jeffries on the other hand hae
met two men since he knocked Fits out. And
what's more Fitz can thank Jeff for his victory
over Sharkey. The botler maker gave the
sallor such a hard beating that he has not re-
covered from it to this day, Sharkey before
Jeffries met him ‘and the Sharkey of Friday
night are two different individuals as far as
phisical condition 14a concerned

“If Fitz is so desirous of meeting the
who licked him so equarely Inst year why does
he not post a forfelt? 1t will be covered in
a burry and I will meet his representative
= any time to arrange the details of a match.
effries will agree to cross arms with Fitzsim-
mons at Carson City and consent to the win-

As s00n as “Lanky Bob” heard of Jeffries’s
reply to his desire to tackle the champion
again Fitz in company with Perey Williams,
lus manager and Lacker, hurried to this city
from Bergen Beach and proceeded at once
to an office on Park row. Fitz's presence
jn town was soon discovered and he waa fol-
owed and buffeted about by a crowd of urchins
and newsboys who made things rather un-
comfortable for him. With the aid of the
volice Fitz managed to reach his destination,

HUGUENOT YACHTS RACE.

SIXTH ANNUAL REGATTAV OF THE
CLUB SAILED OF F NEW ROCHELLE.

 

 

Calm and Light Winds in the Morning Kept
Many Boats From Reaching the Starting
Line—Sis Wins the Special Cup for the
Raceabouts—Dud Wins the Dory Race.

Calms and light, changeable breezes rather
marred the sixth annual regatta of the suguenot
Yacht Club, which was sailed on the Sound
yestorday. Early in the morning there was
hardly a breath of wind on the Bound, and
consequently many of the yachts entered for
the races were unable to reach the starting line
in time to race, About noon a very light
wind came from the southeast, and the
Regatta Committee, J. Nelson Gould,
E. Hanford Sturges and H.C, Ward, decided to
send the yachts off. The preparatory signal
was at 12:30 aud five minutes later the

rat of the racers crossed the line, The course
or the 43, 86 and 80-foot classes of sloops and
yawls was from the tar ting line, off the
eastern end of Huckle y Island, Bie blac
buoy at the westerly entrance to Hempstea
Harbor, bearing Sowehgney - by 000%, then
to the blac buoy o Delancey Polnt,
bearing north-bv-east and then to the starting
line, bearing southwest, This was sailed twice
over, making fifteen miles altogether.
raceabouts, knockabouts, 25-foot sloops and
§0-foot catboats went to +4 buoy ° the
easterly end of Execution Rooka, then to the
red spar Ruoy off the southwesterly endo
Hen and Chickens reef and then home. Thi
was sailed three times, mening 144 miles in all
The smaller class, except the dories, sailed
twioe around the same triangle, and the dories
sailed a three-nille course.

The first leg of the course was windward
work, butin the light wind the yachts had a
hard time to reach the first mark, It was a
reach on th® second leg and when. they
reached that point the wind ifted
to the southwest and made t
beat home On the second == roun
it was a close reach to ye first mark, arun ‘4

 

the second and a beat home. When the win
changed it freshened and the yachts had a nice
sailing breeze to finish the race in.

The club used Huenleoerry, Island as a
club station during the dey. This was loaned
tothe yachtsmen by the “Huckleberry In-
diana” of the New York Athletic Club. A tent
was erected and the frienda of the membera
watched the races from the island. T. K. Ebert,
a member of the club, gave a handsome aliver
cup for the raceabouts to compete for. Only
two started and the Bis wasthe winner. The

APTER THE BATTLE,

Sharkey and Fitz tn Good Shape—Big Win-
nings on the Fight.

The quick and decisive victory of Bob Fitz-
simmons over Tom Sharkey at Coney Island
Friday night was the talk of the sports yester-
day. The followers of Sharkey who thought
that he would at least give Fitz some kind of @
fight were disappoloted over his showing, They
could not understand why the ex-sailor did not
do better in view of his rattling con-
tests with Jim Jeffries and Gus Rubilin,
They figured that if he stood off the Cornish-
man once before for eight rounds when he did
not know as much about boxing as he does now,
he ought at least to have lasted twice as long
on Friday night. Everybody sounded the
praise of the former champion, Fitzsimmons,
who has by his two recent victories knocked the
old theory that youth will be served into
6m thereens,

The desire of the sports now is to see a match
between Jeffries and Fitzsimmons speedily rati-
fled. The impression prevails that the brawny
boilermaker cannot very well dodge the issue
without impairing his prestige with the pubile.
Fitz has gradually but surely, by his clever per-
formances in the ring of late, ingratlated
himself with the patrons of the game and

is now in a _ position to demand a
fight with the man who wrested his
title of heavyweight champion from him

last summer, Fita is in better condition now
than he has been for years, and there are many
who think that Jeffries will not have such an
easy task the next time the twain come to-

gether. In his battles with Kuhlin and
Sharkey Fitz did nut havea chance to extend
himself, as he had his rivals beaten as

800D 4& he could get to them :

Atter the combat Fitzsimmons Joined his wie,
who was waiting for him at a neighboring
otel, andin company with hig backer, Peroy
jitilama, and George Dawson, the party at once
drove |p @ carriage to Bergen Beach. When the
cartiage arrived at the Beach Fitz was the first
to alight and all hands went at once to thy
inembra Hallon the boardwalk and attended
e ball of the Percy Williams Association. Fits
did not have time to put on a dress suit, and led
the dance with his wife atured in a light brown
sult. He made ech, Joined in asong or
two and ensored fimecl? inti 8 o'clock in the
morning, when he reured. He was cheered re-
peatediy on the way to his cottage. The
auburn-haired pugilist arose at about ' o'clock
yesterday moro ng and said that he felt like a
winner,

“I've changed my mind about not Bghting
again in six months,” said the conqueror o
Sharkey and Ruhiin, “and if Jeffries is satisfied
I wili meet him next Fridiy night before the
club which gives us the mos! money. Tam in

the Boilermaker if I don't oare to. My battle

with Sharkey last night was merely a
little exercise. I did not have even a
chance to get warmed up. It wag easy
money for me, SRarkey fought as cleverly

as he knew how de-pite all hesays to the con-
trary. Why, did you see how he ducked my
swings in the first round? The solar plexus

end the fight. Sharkey was very weak after

“T bad eeridus intentions of quitting the ring
