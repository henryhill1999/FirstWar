SUNDAY EXCURSION OF TWO

NOVEL i
NEW YORK WOMEN.

Unsuspected Pleasures of a Trip to Staten
Ieland and Thence by Ferry and Trolley to
Plainfield and Back Picturesque Scenery
on the Way -Seventy Miles For 70 Cents,
“fave vou ever gone trolleying?” said I, a
inate of vet invisible years, to my youthful
choree, Dickey, a flighty thing of twenty, one
dav not long ago.
Igave a shirt-walst young man the tra-le-loo
ag few evenings ago,” said she, with summer-
girl Mippancy a
‘T wouldn't be surprised, said I, frowning
shat: ‘but that isn't the kind, That which

trefer to ja the kindof trolley that goes with
an electrical spark, not an emotional one,”

*Oh sheexclaimed; “oh, you mean riding
in the street cars? Well, I guess yes. Not
possessing a carriage young man or an auto

young man at this season, I have done the next
best thing for the heated term by securing the
attendance of several street-car young men
with whom salary is not much of anvbject. I
go with them frequently of evenings, and I find
it refreshing and diverting, while they find it
economical, We really do have delightful air-
blast excursions, and by judicious manipula-

of transfers we have ridden miles and

tion
miles andlanded almost at our starting place,
ani al! for the small sum of five cents per

person. Oh, Mary Jane, dear, if only house
rent were cheap.” and she sighed

‘You doa good deal of talking,” said I, “but
scurremarks are not germane to the subject.

ai take vou away from the town far into

evs t
i e quiet country and show you the beauties
of nature.’

“rund rstand,” sald she, nodding her head;
“econ and cows and pigsand mosquitoes
and things like that? No, dear, I have never
tried |

’

‘Then said I, firmly, “vou shall. Itis not
ev rything thata manleas woman can do, but
she can do trolleying, and I willshow you. I
learned how not long ago during a visit in Phil-
adelphta, and itis perfectly lovely. New York

ithere. Igot a suburban trolley guide ata
newestand the other day and have studied out
atrin fornext Sunday for two lone women,
Don't ask any questions, but trust in me and get
ready for anearly start on Sunday morning.’

Diekey rather demurred to anything early
on a Sunday morning, but she overcame her
scruples and her custom, and at 9 o'clock we
boorded an Fighth avenue car at Fifty-elghth
t, bound south, and were off on our trolley

fs as |

trip. It was glorious, as the suniit smokeless-
ness of a New York morning always is, and a

car with plenty of empty seata in it enhanced
cur pleasure, for the crowd was all I feared
foo rnde was pleasant down the wide avenve
through the newer part, and interesting when
{t began to wind in and outamong the old
houses, and when we left the car at Battery
Park Diekey wasenthusiastic. Wemight have
taken avother car around the park to South
Ferry, but we chose to walk acrose this pleasu'e
ground of the old-time fashionables of New
York, and the bay breezes over the green grass

 

 

 

 

and through the leafy trees made the little trip |

afoot delightful. Inthe ferry house we saw the
wheels gorcund tn allsorta of automatic ma-
chines, |/keapairof Lappy children, and then
the big doors opened and we went on board the
boat for Staten Istand. Out fn the bay a bit,
Dickey stood in the forcastle of the ferryboat,
if thatis the nantical term for the front porch
of a vessel, and caught the fresh salt wind in
ter face,

“It is lovely, Mary Jane,” said she; “‘lovelier
then anyt)ing any young man has said to me
all sumrmer.”’

‘More exhilarating,” sald I, ‘and with just
About ss much substance in it.”

“Whata beautiful thing this New York bay
and larcor is," said she, ignoring my comment
entirely, and sweeping her eye around the
horizon

‘Yes, said I, “and do you know who was the
first wiite inan to sail into it?”

4 ist pher Columbus,"’ she answered, with
co" fideno

‘No, dear," anid I, kindly, “it was not. It was

Notwithstanding it was nearly four hundred
Yeors Ago, nobody has over yet named anything
in New York in bs honor."

Somebody ought to name an «partment
house for him,” saidshe. ‘‘Lhey seem to be a
litte shy on apartment house names.”

"the xtmanof any note," I went on, un-
heeding, “was Henryk Hudson, who cama

to hing his name on its forks. He was fol-

one reason why, perhaps, if ordinary people
don't keep out of the way, they'll get run over.”

named for Klizabeth, wife of Sir George Car-
teret, to whom, with Lord Berkeley, the Duke
of York granted the province of New Jersey,
or, as it wes called, New Cre-area, a much pret-
tier name than New Jersey. It was at one time
the capital of the Stute. Princeton College was
founded here, and the first Presbyterian church
in the State was established here in 1666,"

“Good for Lizzie,’ chaffed Dickey, ‘‘but if I
were as old as she is I wouldn't tell my age, I'm
sure, would you?” :

“Weare not discussing ages," said I, feeling
as most women of my age do when young
things of 20 wet to talking about the years. “In
any event, Elizabeth is the third city in the State
and has a population of 45,000. Nice people
they are, too.’

*Yes,"' said Dicker, “I've noticed two young
men in shirt waists and one girl in a green gown
you could fecd (he cows on."

Takine a JWlainfleld ear which came by
presently, we left Elizabeth and took to the

the country as if they wantedto get
somewhere ‘The ride was simply delighttul,
and when we came to the brow of the hill over-
looking Plainfleld and the plains from which it
gets ite name, spread out at the foot of the cool,
green Watchung Mountains, Dickey went into
raptures over the view and every thing

“Well, it beats Central Park!"" she exclaimed,

“Then the acme of the superlative is reached,"
said I, enjoving it as much as she di

At varous points along the route we had
noticed screens similar to those we had seen on
Rtaten Island, as well asafewincas.ng the more
delicate live stock.

“Oh, those screens,"’ said Dickey; “i know
now what the man jneant who told mahe did
not jive in New Jersey because he couldn't
breathe strained alr.”

Just the same, t suburban places along
the troliey lines are charming to live in, because
they are park like in their beauty, they have
clubs and all the modern conveniences, an
their people are cultivated city people who have
everything except money eough to lve «8 well
in town as they canin the suburbs. Inaddition
is their contiguity to New York, which atones
for a mosquito or two, more or les, before the
frost nips them

Plainfield has the proud distinction of bein
called the most beautiful town in the State, anc
if seeing is believing, one who sees it can readily
believe. Its lawns are the green of the parka,
{te streets are parkways, its homes are like plo-
ture houses, and every prospect of it pleases
We did have such a good dinner, too, which
can't be said always of country hotel dinners,
We were hungry, of course, for that is one of
the good features of trolley exercise, but the
dinner was fine, anyway

One might think pretty Plainfleld was not old,
but it has }eenton the «pot since 1755, and there
isa shingle-covered Friends’ Meeting House,
unchanged {nsid or out, which has been in ser-
vice for more than a hundred years. Washing-

When I told this bit of news to Dickey she

On Broad street we took a car for Jersey

bounded at the trolleyside with hundreds of
sunflowers turning ever their faithtul faces to

Ine more upon the island oF Manhatten we
took the elevated, because it was growing late,
and the trolley was not for our use in the city
that day after what we had seen of it in the
country, and we reached the Fifty-ninth street
station nine hours and twenty minutes from
the hour of our departure from the Fighth
avevue cornerof the square. The whole tri
had been made without accident and only such
delay as was necessary in changing cars, and
we had travelled over seventy miles at a cost of
only seventy cents, not counting fifty cents for
dinner

“Well, Dickey,” said Las, we we came down
the elevated s'eps, “what do you think of trol-
leying by now?’

I thought I was going to be tired to death
and sick of the whole thing," she said, with
agreeable frankness, ‘but I feel aa fresh as a
daisy and I never spent a pleasanter day in all
my experience, I shorejdid not.”

‘How about no men being along?” Tinquired

“Oh, Mary Jane,” she said, leaning upagainst
me, ‘it was such a blessed relief.’’
