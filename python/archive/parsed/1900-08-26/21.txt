Save Your Hair with
Shampoos of

 

And light dressings of CUTICURA, purest of

emollient skin cures.

This treatment at once

stops falling hair, removes crusts, scales, and
dandruff, soothes irritated, itching surfaces,

stimulates the hair foll

icles, supplies the roots

with energy and nourishment, and makes the
hair grow upon a sweet, wholesome, healthy
scalp when all else fails,

Millions of Women

Use CrTicura Soap exclusively for preserving, purifying, and beautifying

the skin, for cleansing the scalp of cru

sts, scales, and dandruff, and the stop-

ping of falling hair, for softening, whitening, and healing, red, rough, and
sore hands, in the form of baths for annoying irritations and chafings, or
too free or offensive perspiration, in the form of washes for ulcerative weake

nesses, and for many antiseptic purpo

ses which readily suggest themselves

to women, and especially mothers, and for all the purposes of the toilet,
bath, andnursery. No amount of persuasion can induce those who have once

used it to use any other, espectally fo
scalp, and hair of infants and childrer
emollient properties derived from Cu

r preserving and purifying the skin,

TICURA, the great skin cure, with the

purest of cleansing ingredients, andthe most refreshing of flower odors, No
other medicated soap ever compounded is to be compared with it for pre-
serving, purifying, and beautifying the skin, scalp, hair, and hands. No

THE GROUNDING OF THE OREGON

And the Pitght of the Chinese Cruiser That |

Sought Aid From Capt, Wilde.
TIBNTSIN, Aug. 2. On the afternoon of June
97 the Oregon was nearing the Tchang Shan
ehannel on her way from Hong Kong to Taku,
The passage into the Gulf of Pe Chi Li is marked

by a line of small rocky islands, and it is not
@ course that navy men would choose for a
Pleasant cruise, On the eve w of that day
@ thick fog set in ard « Wild ight
the big battleship to a

The fog held di ' t
and the next morn it eon
@nchor waiting for the w rtoel \ it
moon the fog lifted and Capt. Wilde immediately
ordered away several boat. to take sounding
The current had set the ship tot vuthward
eonsiderably more than bad been calculated,
@Qnd she was within about three luodred yards
of some small rocky islets. The boats took

Soundings in every direction for a distance
of at least a mile from the ship and found plenty
ef water, They returned to the ship and about
8 o'clock she got up anchor and started ahead
She gathered way under a siow bell, and just
@s the bridge had signalled “half speed ahead"
ehe struck and stopped. There was no jar or
Concussion noticeable on deck or on the bridge
The engines stopped and backed full
speed at once, but before the ship could answer
the strong tidal current carried her well onto
the rock. Sho struck on the port bow
twenty feet aft of the stem, and soon took a
considerable list to starboard. The examina-
toa that was made immediately showed that

the inner skin had been punctured by a point

@f rock which was stickt: into the compart-
ent, The hole was about two feet rahe

Fie Outer hull had been ripped open for twenty -

the leak as much as possible, but all the come.

Greater force shot six feet up into the compart-
Ments above of the berth deck. The hatches
tr shored down with heavy timbers to keep

m in place and prevent further springing,

| By this time the ship had a list to starboard of
9 degrees,

a fow minutes after the Oregon struck, bound
for Chefoo from Taku, The navigator of the
| battleehip went aboard the Frenchman and
went into Chefoo to report the accident and
secure assistance, He wa’ able to charter a
cargo boat to go out and +tand by the Oregon
| to remove her ammtnition and such other ma-
terial or gear as mnight be taken off to lighten
her. She was then to go to Port Arthur for
the Russian wrecking steamer Slatch,
The morning after the accident the Chinese
eriiiser Hai-Chi came out from Teng-Clou-Fu
and saw the Oregon on the rocks. She

close up to the big battleship and her Captain |

came on board to call on Capt, Wilde
hvery one of

| request for it instead. Capt. Sah said he had
only a little coal in his buokers, bis supplies
; Were almost exhausted and he had no money
with whieh fo purchase more Now that his
Government was in “rebeilion” with the Powers,
he could not wet creditany where, and altogether

 

 

he was in a bad way He was very much
| afraid that if he went to sea he would be
weathered in by some one of the many foreign

o'-war flocking about the gulf. In this

; completely cut-off condition he appealed to
Capt, Wilde for protection, and the American
skipper replied that as long as he had a gun

labove water hea would protect the Chinaman.
fhe Hal-Chi anchored near the Oregon and
her launch and men were of considerable as-

| sistance to Capt.tWilde. Capt. Sah took Capt. |
Wilde so literally at his word that when a

French eruiser hove in sight down came his
| Chinese dragon flag and up went the Stara

there was fifteen fathoms of water. and ten
