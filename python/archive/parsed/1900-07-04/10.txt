REAL ESTATE NEWS,

The subject of paramount in terest discussed
in brokers’ offices yesterday was the reduo-
tion of 18 points in the local tax rate implied
in the assessed valuations submitted by the
Board of Taxes and Assessments to the Mus
nicipal Assembly on Monday. The relief that
this reduction means to real estate is appre-
ciated when it is reflected that about 8 per
cent. of the burden of taxation is borne by real
as opposed to personal, property. The be
lief was freely expressed that the diminution
in the local tax will serve to restore a season-
ably normal activity to the real estate market.
which during the past twelvé months has been
in a condition bordering on stagnation. The
market value of real estate is determined, in
@ certain sense, by the tax which, before the
consolidation of the greater city, varied but
little from year to year, and was practically
a fixed quantity. Last year’s unprecedented
tax increment, though purely an incident of
consolidation, predisposed the public to look
for further fiscal burdens. Monday's an-
nouncement acts as an assurance that here-
after, as before consolidation, the tax will be
reasonably uniform and calculable, a condi-+
tion indispensable to activity in investment
realty.

In the case of an ordinary commercial asset
@ permanent tax increment would be followed
by a readjustment of the market value of the
asset. In the case of real estate, however,
because of the element of monopoly inherent
in land, such increment, {n a progressive com-
munity like New York, ts certain to be ulti-
mately shifted to the tenant, with only e tem-
porary impairment of the net rent. Land-
lords, therefore, being in a position to choose
between a temporary loes of interest, which
may turn out to be comparatively insignifi-
cant, extending over but a year or two, and a
permanent loes of capital, gererally prefer
the former alternative. This ctroumstance 6x-
plains the profound quiet which has prevailed
in the real estate market since the cessation
of the building movement a year ago.

That movement, by the way, with its attend-
ant demand for vacant lots, tended for a mo-
ment to obscure the effect of the increased tax.
As « matter of fact, the two leading features
of the movement were the result of special
agencies. The construction of tenements on
the lower East Side was justified by the un-
housing of about thirty thousand persona as
a consequenoe of the razing of buildings to
make room for public improvements—small
parks, schools and so on. The erection of
elevator flata uptown was occastoned by the
northward extension of the conduits of elec-
trical companies supplying cheap power for
elevators. The introduction of electrical
power into the uptown residential districts
raised the intrinsic value of lota, while the
supply of elevator flats being still compara-
tively limited, tenants are readily recruited
from leas modern housings. These special
agencies which have been at work on the lower
East Side and the uptown flat-house districts
caused the tax increase of last year to fall less
heavily upon tenements and elevator apart-
ments, which, consequently, have been tn fair
demand for the purpose of investment. The
rest of the product of the great speculative
building movement, namely, five-story flats,
lofts and dwellings outside of certain 4ocal-
itlea that appeal to folk of fashion, was not
favored by special agencies, and much of it
still remains unsold, having passed through
a process of liquidation, which has commonly
resulted in the building loan operator taking
over the fee, and in wiping out the claims of

less stropuly fortified ereditors. When the
building movement came to an end a year ago
on the excessive rise in cost of construction,
the full effect of the abnormal tax burden be-

came apparent, for, with the exceptions noted
in the foregoing, improved property was not
able to show customary net earnings on tra-

‘due to unexpectedly strong | ditional fee values, and so did not appeal to
