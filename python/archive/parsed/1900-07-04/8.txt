BROAD WINS ON A FOUL.

Sullivan Hits Him Below the Belt in Six-
teenth Round.

Inthe sixteenth round of a hard glove fight
at the Sea Side Sporting Club of Coney Island
last night, Dave Sullivan, the Boston feath-
erwelght, was disqualified for hitting Kid
Broad of Cleveland below the belt. Up to
that time Broad had outpointed Sullivan, who
recelved a severe punching with remarkable
pluck. It would not be fair to say that Sullivan
committed an intentional foul, but the blow
upon which he was ruled out could not be over-
looked, About 8,000 spectators saw the mill,
which was exciting at every stage.

The preliminary bout was arranged for twelve
rounds at catch weights, the principals being
Sam Bolan, colored, and “Cyclone” Quinn,
white, both of New York. Billy Madden
was the referee. In the tenth round tho "Cy-
clone” was knocked down with a right-hander
on the jaw, but he Jumped up and mixed
it up with enough strength to keep Bolan
off during the balance of the round. The
latter got the decision and was entitled
to it, but half of the crowd _ hissed,
+ Sullivan was favorite over Broad at odds of
10 to 8, The former was handled by his brother,
“Spike’’ Sullivan, Jack Hanley, Jimmy Deforest
and Billy Charlton, Broad’'s seconds were Pete
Burns, Walter O'Connor and Sam Bolan, They
were matched to fight twenty-five rounds at
126 pounds, weigh in at 8 o'clock. Both men
wore bavdages on their hands. Sullivan, who
was in splendid condition, began forcing the
fight as soon ag the bell called them out. Dave
outpointed his man with faat lefts on the face
and solid righthandera to the body. Broad
countered with effect on the head and ribs.

Sullivan began the second round with more
swift lefthanders, but Broad, who was
warming up to his work, stood him off
with jabs and swings. They wero soon in
a hot rally, Sullivan making his opponent
clinch from bard belta in the stomach. Broad
was the pacemaker at the opentng of the third
round, Heshot his left repeatedly Into Dave's
face, but the latter soon beat him off with body
blows and hot swings on the neck. The round was
even, but notso exciting aaythe crowd wanted,
Sullivan's mouth was cut in the fourth, Broad
ourlng in more lefts. Dave mized {t, and the
kid said he was hit below the belt. The referee
maid no attention to the protest, Broad
then began rushing heavily with a bard right on
the jaw and he sent Sullivan down fora
tullcount. When Dave got up Broad tried to
finish him, but Sullivan, while in distress, stag-
ered the Kid with smashes in the stomach and
ept him off until the bell.

Broad was hustling again In the fifth. He
reached thea mouth and neck with solid
swings and Sullivan” staggered. Broad
rushed flercely and in a desperate mix Sulli-
van’s left eye was aplit open. Broad
went in with left and right swings delivered
vered #o rapidiy that Sullivan was bewildered,
but Dave kept his feet and finished well. Sulli-
van met arush in the sixth with a hotswing on
the jaw that made Broad clinch. The
latter stood off then and _ peppered
Dave's face with lefts, Sullivan swung
wildly and Broad, getting to — close
quarters, staggered Dave witha couple of belts
on the head. Broad was faster now, while
Sullivan was comparatively slow in landing his
blows. Broad hada bi« advantage all through
the round.

Broad wasted no time In the seventh. He
went to his man with sharp punches tn the
face, Sullivan used his feet and also blocked
some, but at that he was fore d toreceive
a gruelling punching. Broad waa in again
with quick facers in the eight. Sullivan tried
hard swings for the Jaw, but they were for(the
most part wild until he got Broad near
the ropes. Then Dave shook his man with
several wallops on the head. Broad stood away
after that and banged Sullivan's face again
with long lefts. Sullivan met his antagonist
in the ninth withstraightleft and right swings
on the neck that were effective enough to make
the Kid cautious. Broad waited for an opening
then and walloped the damaged eye witha
punch that make Sullivan wince. Dave rallied
near the end and witha left jolt on the jaw he
pulled Broad up toa halt.

Broad was foreing it awain In the tenth, but
Sullivan stood upand exchanged smashes with
him until the Kid was on the defensive.
Broad cut loose again the next moment
and drove in the blows to the head with
such rapidity. that Sullivan had to clinch,
They roughed it in the last minute. Broad
countered his man as soon as they came out for
theeleyenth, and an old-fashioned bee resulted,
Broad landed the cleaner biows, but Sullivan
had many punches left. When the round ende
Sullivan was bleeding from the mouth, nose

deye,

"Ta the twelfth Broad continued to shoot fn
facers which again covered Dave's face with
crimson fluid. Sullivan countered steadily on
the head, but he did not seem able to weaken the
jd, who was after him hardin the last minute,
ulllvan improved somewhat tn the thirteenth,
He used a higher guard and reached the neck
with enough swings to keep Broad on the go,
Sullivan worked hard toward the end and
had the round, Before the fourteenth
began Sullivan's seconds complained to the
referee that Broad's handlers were using some
kindof suffocating ointment upon him, but the
referee waved them off. hen Broad re-
sumed hia former tactics, pounding
the damated face with swings and
abs, while Sullivan took them all and mixed tt
notly. Broad outpunched his man, however,
and Dave was weak in the legs when he sat
wn,
bg the fifteenth Sulllvan was staggered
witha heavy left on the jaw, but he guickly
sent home «a left that made the Kid wab-
ble too. A moment before the gong Sulll-
van was jarred again with a left and right flush
on®@the jaw. Dave's face was in ribbons,
The sixteenth round was scarcely ynder way
when Broad was forcing {t again with renewed
vigor. Sullivan finally landed a lefthander
well below the belt. Broad rank to the floor,
and Referee Madden promptly disqualified Sul-
livan, The time of the round was 1 minute and
64 seconds,

Good Roads Men Working for a Plank in the

After pounding away at the good roads
question for @ score of years the L. a. W. has
succeeded in having it recognized in the Re-

“Public movements looking to a perma-
nent improvement of the roads and highwaya
of the country meet with our cordial approval,
and we recommend this subject to the earnest
consideration of the people and of the Legis-
latures of the several States.”

Representatives of the League are now at
Kansas City to work for a similar recognition
from the Democrats, That the matter 1s
worthy of national attention {s shown by the
figures of the Road Inquiry Office at Wash-

The Old Mare Just Fails to Concede Thirty-
one Pounds—Jack Point Equals Record in
the Distance Race on Tarf—Realization
and Other Specialties for To-day--Entries,

The beginning of the end, as far as the pres-
ent meeting of the Coney Island Jockey Club
is concerned, was reached at Sheepshead Bay
Interest is accumulating as the
grand finale approaches and for the eve of
Independence Day when nearly everybody
is economizing breath and money, the attend-
ance was decidedly good. A stiff breeze from the
Ocean swept the enclosure and kept the atmos-
phere deliciously cool, but it proved a serious
handicap to horses racing against it down
the new Futurity course and on the home
stretch. All but one of the favorites failed
to score and about the only fortunate plungers
were those who followed Shaw, the rider of
three winners.

All other eventa on the card were dwarfed
in importance by the Long Island Handicap,

Coney Island on June 19, was an absentee,

The distance being one mile and a furlong

down and Charentus, crossing over, not only
shut her off at the first turn, but also outfooted

Second Race-A Highweight Handicap; six fur DEATH OF CHARLES BACKMAN.
longs on the main track:

 

Founder of Stony Ford a Notable Figure in
the Morse World.

Charles Backman, who was found dead in
his chair at Stony Ford, in Orange county,
last Saturday night, was one of the first and
foremost breeders of trotting horses in America.
Mr. Backman amassed a fortune in business
in New York before the Civil War and in 1864
ho gratified his long-time liking for horses
by establishing at Stony Ford a stud which
was unequaled anywhere in the world, excepting
perhaps at the Woodburn Farm of the Alex-
anders in Kentucky, The pedigree of Dexter,
2:1744, who trotted his first race in that year,
influenced Mr. Backman’s theories of breeding.
Dexter was by Hambletonian, then a com-
paratively unknown trotting sire, and his dam
was by Seely’s American Star. The founder
of Stony Ford bought up all the desirable
daughters of American Star that he could
find and bred them to the Rysdyk horse year
after year, By the time Hambletonian’s famo
was at its height Mr. Backman had more sons
and daughters of the great sire than any five
breeders in the country, probably. He sold
therm at fabulous prices and added many thou-
sands of dollars to his fortune, When Ham-
bletonian died in 1876 one of the most popular
60ns of the old horse was M. Backman’s Messen~-
ger Duroc, the sire of Prospero, Elaine, and
Other sensational trotters, Later on the pro-
prietor of Stony Ford pet A. B. Darling up-
ward of $10,000 for Kentucky Prince, and
from these two sires most of his trotters were
descended, Guy, 2:00%, the fastest horse ever
raised at Stony Ford, was by Kentucky Prince,
out of a mare by American Star, Among tbe
gona Of Hambietonian bred by Mr. Backman
was Electioneer. He was used but little in
the stud uutil Gov. Stanford of California
pougas him pnd Placed him at the head of his
newly established Palo Alto Stud, Electioneer
proved Pr far and away the greatest horse
ever ra by Mr. Backman, At one time
lis sons and daughters held every important
weord in the list of champions, and nearly
150 of them trotted in 2:30 or better, Mr. Back-
man made the mistake which wound up Wood-
burn Farm as a nursery of trottars. He bred
from his own stock without taking in any
of the new blood of such horses as George Wilkes
and other rising sires, and before the boom
in trotters succumbed to the hard times in 18993
Stony Ford had lost its prestige.

From first to last Mr. Backman entertained
with a lavish hand, and though he received
nundreds of thousands of dollars for his trotters

© maintained an establishment of such mag-
nitude and expense that bis fortune and his
farin were virtually lost several years ago,
In 1895 all bis horses were sold at auction at
panio prices. F, P, Olcott, W. B. Dickerman
and other friends who held a mortgage on the
farm leased it to Gen, B. F. Tracy a year or
two afterward, but Mr. Backman was never
disturbed in the possession of the historio
mansion where he had entertained Gen. Grant,
Robert Bonner, Roscoe Conkling, Commodore
Vanderbilt and hundreds of other notable
horse fanciers. The place is now about to be
turned over to the flon. W. C. Whitney, who,
It ls understood, will breed thoroughbred horses

Boralma tn Racing Form at Readville.

Boston, July 3.—The sti? breeze blowing down
the track at Rendville today did not prevent good
time betng made tn the four events on the card for
the seoond day of the New England Trotting Horse
Breeders’ Association spring meet By far the best
performance was in the 2:12 trot, Boralma, winner

of the Futurity last season and purebaces by
W. Lawson in the fall, lowered hts record one
rcond ip the first beat and seemed to be
doing nothing more than jogging partof the way.
He also won the second heat handily, Inthe 2:17
pace Paul Revere won the first heat jo @ close finish
with Gyp Walnut, and was just beaten outin the sec-
ond. n the third heat Garth, driver of Revere,
Btarted to lay up, but misjudged the distance and
caught the flag. The judges fined him $100 and de-
clared all bets onthe heat off. After that the race
was casy forGyp Walnut. Silvermaker and Clinton
Ki. made close fintshes in the first two heats of the
2 12 pace, each winning by a head. Clinton B. took
the third easily, and Clark bad to drive hard to finish
second over Early Bird, Jr. Dark Wilkes bad things
all bis own way in the 2:20 pace. Summary:
