confirmed the reported death at Tumaco of

was arrested and imprisoned together with
two other Englishmen on March 17 without
any apparent reason. They were In no way

NET EARNINGS LESSENED.

 

Beme of the Railroads Whose Operating Ex-
‘ penses Absorb Gross Earnings.

Btatements of railroad earnings for the month
of May, which are now coming in, demonstrate
in a marked degree the correctness of the as-
gertion, published in THE Stn two or three
days ago, that the increased operating expenses
of the railroads of this country are absorbing
more than the normal proportion of the gross
earnings. Following!sa table compiled from
the May figures of some of the principal rail-
rene in this country, which shows a decrease
in net earmingsin contrast with an increase in
gross:

kota. Rain ia much needed throughout the
Rocky Mountain region and plateau districts
The week was marked by exceptionally high
temperature over the middle Rocky Mountain
slope and Upper Missouri Valley.

Corn has suffered injury from heavy rains in
portions of Indiana, Illinois, Missourl and Ken-
tucky, and generally in the east Gulf States,
but on the whole has made very favorable
progress, especially in the great corn States,
In Iowa and Nebraska the crop ia in fine con-
dition, having recelved {ta final cultivation in
Iowa. In portions of Kansas, Oklahoma and
Texas corn 18 suffering from drought, and
would be benefited by rain over portions of the
Middle Atlantic States. y

In the Ohio and Central Mississippi valleys, as
in the previous week, winter wheat harvest has

yorts continue of damage to grain in shock,

n the Middle Atlantic States harvesting has
continued under faverable conditions and is

ractically finished as far north as Maryland,
Rood rains have fallen over portions of northern
Minnesota and North Dakota, but further de-
terforation in the condition of spring wheat ts

process of formation under the laws of New Jersey, with appropriate powers for
manufacturing crucible and other steel and other things made of iron and steel,
and all other powers deemed convenient, will have an authorized capital of fifty
million ($50,000,000) dollars, divided into five hundred thousand (500,000) shares
of the par value of one hundred ($100) dollars each, of which twenty-five million
($25,000,000) dollars in par value is to be preferred stock, entitled to cumulative
dividends of seven per centum yearly, and to payment of its par value, on dis-
tribution of assets, in preference to the common stock, but to no other dividends
or payments, and the remainder, twenty-five million ($25,000,000) dollars, in par

value, is to be common stock.

The corporation is to be vested with the properties, good-will and business
of the following named concerns, which it will purchase at a price not exceeding
nineteen million ($19,000,000) dollars, and, in addition therto, is to be vested
with six million ($5,000,000) dollars in cash, which shall be used for the purchase
of stock and materials necessary for the operations of the Company, and as a
cash working capital for the conduct of its business and other corporate pur

poses, to-wit:

Park Steel Company,

Singer, Nimick & Company, Incorporated,

Howe, Brown & Co., Limited,

Crescent Steel Company.

La Belle Steel Company,

Anderson, DuPuy & Company,

Cumberland Steel & Tin Plate Company,

Burgess Steel and Iron Works,

The Benjamin Atha & Illingworth Company,

Spaulding & Jennings Company,

Sanderson Bros. Steel Company,

Beaver Falls Steel Works,

Aliquippa Stee! Company.

These properties will be acquired free from lens and incumbrances, and the

charter will provide that the corporation shall not mortgage any of its property,
except by purchase money mortgage, without the assent of two-thirds in value

of the preferred stock.

Twenty million ($20,000,000) dollars of the preferred and twenty million
($20,000,000) dollars of the common stock, or a total of forty million ($40,000, 000)
dollars of the fifty million ($50,000,000) dollars authorized capital of the proposed
corporation, have already been subscribed or under-written with Mr. Alexander

vendors of the different concerns hereinbefore enumerated, at the price of one
hundred (8100) dollars in cash for each two shares, one preferred and one com-
mon, and the privilege of underwriting or subscribing for the remaining five mil-

incident to the thirteen organizations, show average earnings for the past five
years of more than sufficient to pay the dividend upon the proposed issue of
preferred stock, and for the past two years, sufficient to pay a large dividend
upon the common stock in addition to the dividend upon the preferred stock, and
it is confidently believed that, operated as one organization, and with the econo-
mies that can be introduced in the manufacture, distribution and sale of the
product, the earnings will be largely increased.

the Consolidation Purchaser nor to any syndicate or person as promoter'’s profit,
or for any other purposes than for the acquisition of the properties, good-will
and business of the constituent companies, taken upon a conservative valuation,

Notice to Holders of Certificates of Deposit
for First Consolidated Mortgage Five
Per Cent. Bonds:

The Committee appointed by holders of the First
Consolidated Mortgage Bonds of this Company has
found {t impracticable to prepare a plan of reor-
ganization, because it has been unable to agree
upon satisfactory terms with the Committees rep-
resenting prior lien Bonds. A majority of the Cer-
tificates for Consolidated Mortgage Bonds, and also
a majority of the Loutsville, Evansville and St.
Louls Ratiroad Company First Mortgage Bonds, of
the Evansville, Rockport and Eastern Railroad Com-
pany First Mortgage Bonds, and of the Hunting-
burg, Tell City and Cannelton Railroad Company
First Mortgage Bonds, have now been acquired by
Messrs J. P. Morgan & Co, who have announced
a plan of reorganization to which the Southern
Railway Company is a party. Reference is made
tothe advertisement of such plan for further par-
Uculars thereof,

It isthe opinion of the Committee that the terms
offered to the holders of Consolidated Mortgage
Bonds, under the plan prepared by Messrs. J. P.
Morgan & Co. are fair, and are at irast as
sallsfactory as any which could possibly be ob-
tained by this Committee in any other way. The
Committee therefore recommends to the holders of
guch Bonds that they deposit the same under the
plan and agreement announced by Messrs, J. P,
Morgan & Co

The Committee has accordingly terminated the
Bondbolders’ Agreement of May 1, 1805, and di
rected the return of the bonds deposited there-
under. Holders of Certificates of Deposit for Con-
solidated Mortgage Bonds, deposited under that
Agreement, may, without charge, withdraw their
Bonds from the depositary, the New York Security
and Trust Company, upon surrender of their respec-
tive Certificates.

FINANCIAL AND COMMERCIAL,

 

Turapay, July 3.

Notwithstanding the suspension of business
to-morrow because of the holiday, the stock
market made a fairly good showing. The trad-
ing was comparatively light, but the tone was
in the main firm. Duiness and professional

| selling for both accounts were offset by a mod-

erate absorption of securities by actual pur-

} chasers and by some speculative ventures for

long accounts. Foreign markets were de-
pressed by the distressing reports from China
and arbitrage houses sold several —
shares of various stocks. Their operatiogs,
however, had very little effect upon local senti-
ment, which ia in the main bullish, chiefly be-
cause of the prospects that Mr. Bryan and his
immediate political associates will absolutely
dominate the Democratic Convention and com-
mitit tg a platform that will alienate the sup-
port of a large element in the party.

The fact that the unusually large winter
wheat crop in the Southwest has virtually
been secured caused a sharp advance in Mis-
souri Pacific. The market for Sugar Refin-
{ng was favorably influenced by another ad-
vanoe in the prices of refined sugars. The
convictions in the Brooklyn Rapid Transit
conspiracy cases were not without effect upon
speculative sentiment. Continental Tobacco
issues were higher on moderate dealings on
reports of an improvement in trade conditions,
In a few stocks that have recently enjoyed
sharp advances there was a reaction, notably
in Tennessee Coal and Iron, The closing was
quiet but steady at slight reactions from the best
prices.
