The subject of the Philippine civil service is
also fully treated, the report eaplaining that

the Philippines by the commission, nearly ail

themselves; aud it is @ safe and desirable rule
that no American should be appointed to any
office in the Philippines for which a reasuuably

FINANCIAL RELATIONS OF THE UNITED STATES
ro THE PHILIPPINE ISLANDS,
The commission has carefully considered
the feasibility of assimilating the tariff of the
Philippines to that of the United States, The
differences, however, appear to be fundamental
and irreconcilable, The tariffs are as
as the corresponding economic and social con
ditions of the two countries, So long as the ex
isting chasm remains between the economic and
social conditions of the Philippines and those of
the United States, so long will it remain impractie
able to identify their tariffs, These conditions are
not more fatal to uniformity of protective tariffs
than to uniformity of revenue tariffs, for they
make it equally impossible to devise a uniform
dutiable list of revenue producing commodities,
Accordingly, the commission recommends that,
at the present time, no attempt be made to as
similate the customs duties of the Philippines
to those of the United States

pines had no money of their own, Formerly the
currency was gold. By degrees gold has been
driven out, and the currency of the Filipinos to
day is ona silver basis. In 1884 gold coin had
enurely disappeared. The following may be
taken asa resume of the article on the curreney?

First.) Manila bas a mint, which has been in
operation since the sear 1861

Second, the mint made coin peculiar to the
Philippines, which was the gold dollar in’ coin
for Sl, $2 and S4 and silver coin in fractional
currency of 50, 20 and 10 cents ,

Third, hat in 1S76 the cireulation of Mexican
silver money of Sl at the same value as the gold

dollar was autherized

Pourdh, that on account of the persistent de
cline of the value of silver, the Mexican dollar
Was of le value ench day outside of Manila,
but of equal value within Manila, as compared

 

with the value of geld) From this it came to

MHh CHINESE IN THE PHILIPPINES,

Considerable space is devoted to a review of
Chinese history as connected with the Philippines.
It is shown that they went there at a very early
date. prior te V571 When Legaspi founded
Mantla, in the middle of the seventeenth century,
there were some 80,000 Chinese in the neighbor:
hood of Manila. At that time they revolted
against the Spanish Government and fer some
days besieged Manila. In 1755 all non-Christian
Chinese were ordered to be expelled. But before
the day arrived for theirexpulsion, June 80, 1755,
many had become Christians and many other
were studying the mysteries of the faith.

The question as to the admission or exclusion
of the Chinese has been a prominent question in
Manila for many years, The Filipinos generally
regord the Chinese with reat hostility, and favor
their exclusion. A very full account is given
by the commission of the occupations of the Chinese
and of their whereabouts and customs in the
Philippines. ‘There was some diversity of opinion
among the members of the commission as to
whether the Chinese ought to be excluded, and
the commission concluded to leave the question
to be determined by the government that might
be established in the Philippines, The com-
mission concluded that the Filipino ean be de-
pended upon to develop many parts of his own
country. But, while this is true, it is to be eaid
{hat there are extensive areas in Luzon, Mindoro.
Mindanao, Palawan and other islands which are
either peopled by wild tribes or are uninhabited,
Ii would be quite out of the question to depend on
their sparse and uncivilized population for labor:
and since the people of these districts show little
or no hostility toward the Chinese, it would seem
that Chinese labor might be advantageously
employed, without danger of arousing opposition
onthe part of the inhabitants or in any way pre-
indicing their interesis. Where the native scen-
timent against the Chinese is strongly hostile, the
commission feels that we are hound to take
Into serious consideration, On the other hand
itis theught that Chinese labor might be very
advaniageously used in those portions of the
Archipelago where, from the character of the in-
habitants and their indisposition to engage im
manual toil or from the absence of inhabitants
and the well known disinelination of the civilized
native to leave his home and seitleina new region
t would net come into competition with the le bor
of the country, ‘The whole question is commend-
ed to the careful consideration of the President
