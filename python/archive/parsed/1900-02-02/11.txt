February Furniture News

7 February Trade Sale is bigger than its pred-

ecessors—more furniture; larger economy—and
yet the sale is made right in the teeth of large
advances in the costs of production.
Odd Pieces are a third cheaper than in January.
Larger lots are a fourth cheaper than in January.
But adding February wholesale price-advances
to the sum of the reductions you’ll be saving an
average of half.
This never was true of former large sales—it’s
lucky to save even a third. Now, isn’t it?
Please do not read us awry. A man said yes-
terday that ‘‘his’’ paper advertised that all our fur-
niture was reduced, and that he should feel con-
strained to tell his friends not to believe us. He saw
a piece that he recognized, and at its former price.
Of course, he did. We tried to make that very
point clear yesterday when we said :
‘‘Not everything in the Furniture Store is re-
duced, but the choice is from an aggregate of
$200,000 worth’’—25,000 pieces in all.
You know of few stores that have so many
pieces in their whole stock.
Permanent lines are being assembled for spring
business; certain grand old staple lines are being
re-ordered—none of this furniture is reduced, of
course. But it seems fair to say that two-thirds of
the pieces here are reduced.

Bedroom, Parlor and Dining-Room Furniture
Furs Reduced

We are merchants—not speculators: We are your agents to gather
useful things and beautiful things from all over the world, and to have them
ready whenever you come. Markets rise and fall—we simply do our best,
which has come to be a very powerful best, toward getting dependable
goods at least possible prices.

We could lock up all

 

the furs we own, and make money by keeping
them till next winter. Instead, we have Reduced Prices a Fourth
at least, and shall sell out every piece we own,

No, one exception, Of the great stock of Sealskin Coats we owned,
only six garments remain. We shall not reduce thema cent. $150 a
piece—which is less than we can buy equal garments today. If fur wearers
are financiers or are able to get the advice of financiers, they’ll buy this half
dozen coats in a jiffy.

Twenty-five of them—and as handsome as any we’ve had at their full
prices—$37, 50 to $100. But it is high time they were in serv ice, so within
the last few days we’ve marked them at prices running from $25 to $50—an
average little above halt, The garments are 30 to 46 in, long. Will you
share the good fortune?

Men’s

Wanamaker ShoeS---,4 i" 3.

Do you think for a moment that the largest retail shoe business in the
world has centered in the Wanamaker Stores by chance or careless selection?
Not a bit of it. A man may lose all business sense when he buys a dinner,
and a woman may bea bit liberal in choosing a bonnet, but the buyer of
shoes is apt to be prudent. Of course, there is careless buying, else the
average shoe store would cease doi ng busi ness; but, in the long run, sensible
folks depend on the shoe stores that

meet all conditions as to style,
are cheapest, in service-giving

And on this basis the Wanamaker Stores have a shoe business fifty per
cent. bigger than enjoyed by any other exclusively retail firm.
