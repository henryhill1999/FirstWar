About 4 o'veloek in the afternoon aud asked
Edith Ward, one of the saleswomen, to show
hersome styles, Misa Ward litted a box from
under the connter and was taking out of it two
Wrappers when she felt someth ng soft wrigele
in one of the garments. Then a rat as large us
a small-sized kitten jumped out landing alinost
In the face of the customer,

“Good heavens! a rat! ehricked customer
