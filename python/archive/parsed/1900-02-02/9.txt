Tnunspay, Feb. 1,

There was a falling off in the volume of trad-
jug on the Stock Exohange to-day and tho
course of the market was trrogular. This was
natural after the extensive covering of shorts
in the iron and stee! stocks, a movement that
was continued to-day. There has also been
large buying of these stocks for Jong account,
In fact that circumstance induced much of the
closing of short contracts. The iron and steel
companies continue to furnish statements

of thelr operations that unquestionably
stimulate the demand for thelr shares,
Figures relating to the American Car

and Foundry Company are printed further
on in this column, and the balance sheet of the
American Steel Hoop Company will, it ts re-
ported, be made public ina fow days. A state-
ment of the Republic Iron and Steel Company
has just come to hand which shows net earn-
ings for the seven months ending Dee, 31 of
$2,714,500; dividends pald on preferred stock,
$720,080; leaving a surplus of $1,904,431, It
is stated that prior to Sept. L the company was
engaged mainly in filling old contracts made
bythe constituent concerns before their con-
solidation,

The heaviest trading in the group unde, con-
sideration was in Steel and Wire, but the
greatest net advances were those of 9 polots
in Tennessee Coal and Iron and 3's points in
Colorado Fuel and Iron. The favorable show-
ing ofthe American Car and Foundry Com-
pany started fresh speculation fn its sharea
and there was also renewed activity In Presaed
Steel Car at advancing prices, Other industrial
issues that made good showings were Ameri-
van Tobacco and People’s Gas. On the other
hand Sugar Refining appeared to suffer from
the recent unfortunate operations in it. The
railway list was {n the main neglected, though
inthe late dealings a demand for Atchison
preferred imparted a degree of animation to
that stock and lifted the price fractionally. It
would not be surprising if the railway list
should be next to feel the revival of specula-
tive sentiment,

\ remarkable feature waa the anpearanoe of
Third Avenue as the atock most heavily traded
in. A few weeks ago bales of 1,000 shares of It
in a day attracted attention. To-day over
40,000 shares changed hands, The volume of
the trading in it would seem to indivate that a
large amount of the stock has passed from in-
vestment holders into Wall Street. A further
decline of & points in the price may logically be
regarded as foreshadowing an unfavorable re-
port by the experts employed to examine the
property by the bankers who have suggested a
plan forfinancing the company. The other lo-
cn! traction stoeks were heavy in sympathy
with the decline in Third Avenue,
