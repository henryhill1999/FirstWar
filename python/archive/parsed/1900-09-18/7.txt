FINANCIAL AND COMMERCIAL.
Monpvay, Sept. 17.
Part of the short interest in stocks that was
created in the selling movement on Friday
and Saturday last was covered to-day, and in
addition there was buying for the long ao-
count, The result waa an improvement in
prices which extended pretty generally through
the list. The change in the attitude of the
speculative fraternity was induced by the fact
that an advance in money rates did not follow
the disclosure in the bank statement of a large
loaa in cash by the banks, and by the prob-
ability that the anthracite coal miners’ strike
would not be of lone duration. Furthermore,
the published utterances of an operator who
led the bear campaign of last fall and winter
were calculated to have weight with the trad-

 

 

' ing element

This operator, who has been abroad for
months, and has at intervals emitted
doleful views on the financial situation
in America, sailed for New York on
Saturday As he was sailing he furnished
an interview, which was cabled to this
side, in which he declared that he fore-
saw increased prosperity for thie country, and
therefore was, by implication at least, a bull
instead of a bear on the stock market. If he
is to be an active in efforte to advance stooks
on his return as he was formerly in efforts to
put them down, he may have much to do with
shaping the future course of the market. If
his remarks are correctly reported, his change of
sentiment was accomplished by leading Amer-
fean financiers whom he met in Europe and who
convinced him of the error of his wave. Pre-
@umably, he will be asked, ax he leaves the ship
on which he is croasing the ocean again to ex-
preas himself so as to remove any linwering
doubt aa to his present position

There are indications that the outflow of
money té the South and West will not be as
large this week as laat Still, this is a matter
about which definite knowledge is not obtain-

able Anyway, the position of the banks is

ao atrona that it is believed the crop-moving
period will be passed without actual stringency
in funds Higher rates are not unlikely, but
ao long as there is no extensive calling of loans
there will be no particular objection to some-
what increased charges to borrowers Most of
the anthracite miners who are on strike seem
to have stopped work reluctantly, which is one
reason for thinking the strike will collapse
It may be that the strike will be terminated
soon by negotiation The financial community
has not appeared to regard {t 98 a serious affair
There arelarge accumulations of coal at storagé
points and no diMficulty in meeting the consump-
tive demand is looked forin any circumstances,
There were liberal dealogs in Union Pacifio
but this was one of the stocks which did not
finally show a gain in price. There was plainly
marketing of long holdings, presumably to
secure profits represented by the appreciation
in the stock since it was placed on a 4 per cent.
basis. There were also realizing sales of
Northern Pacific, Southern Pacific and the
Atchison issues. The net losses in these stocks,
however, were slight. The Granger stocks
were strong and there was an especially good
demand for St. Paul. The regular dividend
declaration was made on Rock Island. There
was a fair business in Missourt
Pacific, Southern Rallway and Louisville
and Nashville, all of which moved up. The
transactions in the anthracite coal stocks were
Hght, but nearly all advanced. The only issue
in which there was any approach to activity
was Reading first preferred. Brooklyn Rapid
Transit, Manhattan Railway and Metropolitan
Btreet Railway were in request. People’s Gas
rallied on moderate purchases, Weakness
developed in Tennessee Coal and Iron, but the
other steel and tron stocks were firm. Sugar
Refining was freely bought and sold, but closed
with merely a fractional appreciation in price.

‘There was a downward movement of cotton prices
owing to disappointing cables, indications of ta-
creasing receipts at Houston and New Orleans, rather
liberal arrivals at Augusta, easier Southern spot
markets and liquidation as well as a falling off tn
the demand from the outside public which ts show-
ine greater hesitation than recently to take hold of
eotton at these prices Neverthe ess, the Statistical
position remains very strong, the receipts are stall
comparatively small, andthe weekly government re-

rains fell in North Carolina and there ts still belleved

is due after the recent @real advance and thata good
