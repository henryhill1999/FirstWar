Rill Donovan, who was “farmed” to the Hart-
ford club of the hastern League last spring
and who has been pitching great ball up there
ever since, Was put into the box by Manager
Hanlon yesterday, with the result that the
big hitters of the St. Louis club were made to
jook like easy marks until the last inning, Dono-
van had great speed and curves, but he also
had a wholesome respect for Capt MeGraw,
to whom he handed four bases on balls and also

NEWS OF THE WHEBLMEN.

A Lively Seeston of the L. A. W. Executive
Committee Expected To-morrow.

A sequel to the trouble between the New
York State Division of the L. A. W. and the
national authorities is promised fer to-mor-
row when @ specially called meeting of the
Executive Committee of this State is te be held.
Than the minority report ef Joha B. Uhble of
thia city, who is a member of the National
Revision Committee, will be considered. At
the last session of the committee appointed te
revise the L. A. W. constitution, two complete
drafts of a new constitution were considered,
one originating with Abbott Bassett, the pree-
ent secretary, and the other with Mr. Uhle,
The draft of the New York member was not
accepted and when the revised constitution
is submitted to the national organization, he
will make a minority report. The new idea of
the niajority is not to do away with the State
divisions, but to have the moneys appertiened
among local consulates in the Btate inetead ef
all being handled by a secretary-treasurer,
New York has been fighting against all prope-
sitions to abolish its present headquarters
in this efty, where L. A. W. members from
all parts of the Union find a weloome, the
idea of the New Yorkers is that there is a desire
to squelch the organization here, aa it exists,
and at to-morrow's meeting there kely to
be proceedings that will be very fdas in
effect from oil upon treubled waters.

MR. BENNETT'S NEW YACHT.
One of the Largest aad Most Pewerfal Steamers
Ever Ballt on the Clyde.

James Gordon Bennett's new steam yacht,
l.ysistrata, which was launched from Denny's
yard at Dumbarton on Aug. 28, is the Clyde's
most epoch-making steam yacht. “This vessel,”
says the Yachteman, “has been built by the
Messrs. Denny from plans prepared by Mr. G
L. Watson for Mr. James Gordon Bennett, one
of the senior members of the New York Yacht
Club. The boat is the largest and most power-
ful yacht that has yet been built on the Clyde.
Lysistrata for so the big veesel was named by
Miss Amy Denny—ts 285 feet long on the load
water ling, and 914 feet over all, 40 feet in breadth
and 25 faet in depth, and 2,082 tona T. M. She

has a plumb stem, a long and qingulgrty erace-
ful counter, a full peop aft, @ long shade deck
amidships, and a short turtle hack forward, one
huge funnel, and a very rudimen sort of
mas! with nothing on it but a signalling yard

“The boat Is built of the finest ie
twin screw vessel, and a speed of eighteen
knots has been contracted for with her: trip)
expansion machinery_of about 6,500 indicated
horee power is being fitted and the engines are
being arranged on the four-crank prineiple.
ike her twin sister, 3 reerita, Lysietrata
as been built with the butte o rT pilates ever-
lapping, which it a novel y introduced to yacht
building by Mr Wateon

With regard te saloon and cabin accommo-
dation, Lysistrata haa suite after suite of hand-
some graceroorns many of them supplemented
with dressing rooms and bathrooms), while
dining room, library and owner's business
room leave nothing to desire The dining room,
twenty-five feet ‘lc ng by twenty feet broad,
and lofty and well lighted and airy, is being
done in the Greeian fashion The lighting
and ventilating of the vacht are om the most
modera and co*tly principles,”

A programme of unusual proportions at-

tracted a erowd above the average to (iraves-

ond yesterday afternoon. Male visitors were
wise enough to discard their straw hate and
tarn out in autumn costume, but some of the
women took chances tn their porous summer

' outfits. With them !t seemed to be a ortsis

of pneumonia or favorites, and after four hys-
terical, but unprofitable demonstrations, they
“rooted” two first choices over the plate, and
went home happy without worrying about
wraps.

The star feature of the outing was the Sea-
breere, for three-year-olds, at one mile and «
sixteenth. Prestidigitator, Post Haste, Withers
and Mayor Gilroy were withdrawn, leaving
Hesper a alight favorite over Peacefal, with
Oneck Queen next in demand. Hesper made
most of the running to the atetch, where (ireen-
ock moved up from a rear posttion and won
out in a drive by half a length Heeper cis
puted every inch with the winner and took the
place by four lengths frem Peaceful, who beat
Oneck Queen a head.

Criterion carried so muoh money in the
opening dash for two-year-olds that his price
dropped from 4 to 6 to 3to 6. Elivabeth M,
and Inshot outran the good thing al] the way,
but were forced to lower their colors in the
drive home, to Servilila. The Lurillard filly
with a fast win at Sheepshead Bay to her credit,
started at the false odds of @ to 1 and simply
galloped over her field in the stretch, winning
by a neck from Elizabeth M., who beat In Shot

ve lengths. Mike Clancy's latest acquisituon
ed long enough to beat the favorite a head

or show money
Several owners shied at the handicap for
al) ages, but enough stood pat to furnicha field
of eleven. Brigadier looked to be the olass
of the race and next to him the choices were
lotrusive and Gonfaion, Gold Or, at 80 to 1,
sprinted off in front for half the distance when

New Haven, Sept. 17.—The football! season

was the plan of the managers to begin work this
morning, but the pl ayers were nearly all late in
arriving. By noon there were only four play-
ere intown. By ¢o'elock a dozen or more had
been mustered and with this squad and Mike

Murphy, the veteran trainer, Capt Brown
went out te the gridiron. The players got
forty minutes’ practice in atarting ard |n falling
on the ball Then they were all trolled around
the cinder track for two miles uptil they were
in a glow. This ended the work of the day
All through the afternoon new arrivals kept

coming in and to-night there are twenty-six
players registered at the Hitchinson, where the
squad will be quartered until college opens

A training table was started at noon to-day
and everything is now in good running order

New Haven, Sept. 17.—George F_ Sanford,
the former Yale centre rush, who is now coache-
ing the Columbia football team at Branford
Point, to-day discovered a new drop kicker

layer is Ashley, a novice, who has just joined
he Columbia squad. This afternoon Sanford

had Ashley dropping goals in a hurricane and
the youngster scarcely missed one, Ashley
comes from Chicago and had never played

football until he came to Branford. Shecovich,
the old Yale end rush, who played for Colum-
bia lust season, joined the Columbia equad this
afternoon, as did also LaPrince, one of the sub-
stitute ends of Jast season. Wright, last year’s
centre rush, began regular training to-day, and
word was Lacetvad that both the Weeks boys
will be here to-morrow, Sanford lined his
men up for the first time to-day and began to
teach hem tricks and signals, The only vet-
erans in the make-up were Wright at centre
and LaPrince at end ne All the reat were
new players, who were shifted from place to
piace.
