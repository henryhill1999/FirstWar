MONEY T00 CHEAP—R. SAGE

HE FEARS THE BANKS ARE LEND-
ING ON POOR COLLATERAL

 

Rather Than Keep Their Cash Idle~Money a
Drug in the Market and the Situation Needs
a Stiffening Kate-Doesn't Know Yet
Whether He Got Seme of the British Lean,

Russel! Sage is not satisfied with the present
condition of the money market, where rates for
demand joans have been ruling at exceedingly
low figures, money on call being quoted on the
New York Stock Exchange yesterday at but 1%
per cent.

“There is danger, in my judgment,” said Mr.
Sage yesterday, “of very heavy losses because
of the collateral now being sccepted by the
banka of this city. They are compelled to ac-
cept collateral not good enough to insure them
for their loans because of the low money rate.
Otherwise they could not use the money at all,
This is a very unsatisfactory state of things,
Money ts a drug in the market. I think decid-
ediy that what the situation needs is a stiffen-
ing of the money market.”

“Do you refer only to the ‘Industrials’ {n
speaking of the collateral not sufficiently
good?”

“Yes, I mean the ‘Industrials’ particularly. I
don't feel the same way about the railroad
ebares.”

Mr, Sage said that he was pleased at the suc-
cess of the British war loan. Asked if he
thought the loan could have been fluated ata
highe: figure than 98, he replied:

“No, I don't think they could have floated it

at par. I doubt if they could have floated it at
00.1 think the Erglishmen used good judg-
ment in making tie figure 98. It was the in-
ducement of 2 per cent. in the issue price that
caused the loan to be snapped up with so much
avidity here, an aviditv that surprised me
somewhat, T confess. However, it would
have been different but for the unsatisfactory
condition of the money market

Did you carry out your intention of sub-
scribing?’ was asked.

“Tintrusted my subscription to another man,
andI haven't heard whetier he got the bonds
or not. | was glad to encourage friendly frel-
eg bevgeen the two countries, If this loan had

@ disappointment it would have been diffi-
cult to place another in the same way

 

LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY IDLE.

American Union Must Do No New Business
Until Ite Reserve Is Reenforced.

The State Insurance Department has notl-
fled the American Union Life Insurance Com-
pany that until its aasets are made equal to Its
Mabilities the company must not issuo any new
policies. According to the report of Chief
Examiner Isaac Vanderpool, made on Ang, 8
to Francis Hendricks, Superintendent of In-
surance, the company’s asseta on May 81 last
were only $862,818, while its liabilities on policy
holders’ account were $375,471, Robert H.
Hunter, First Deputy Superintendent of In-
surance, in char@e of the branch oMee of the
department in this city, said yesterday that
the impairment of the surplus reserve was not

sufficient to warrant the Superintendent of In-
aurance in requesting the appointment of a
receiver -

The officers of the American Union Com-
any say that they had {Intended to consolidate
he company with the National Life Insurance

Company, but the Superintendent of Insur-
ance refused to issue a license to the National
Company, which is a foreign corporation, The
officers of the American Union Company are
planning to consolidate with some other in-
surance oompany already doing business in
the State. John Napier, Secretary of the
company, said yesterday

“The trivial {mpairment of $12,658 figured
out by the insurance department could easily
be technically adjusted by the capitalists who
already have more than ,400 interest in the
company, but we are waiting to decide whether
to continue doing business in our own name
or to consolidate with some other company.”

Charles S. Whitney, Vice-President of the
company, said that the shortage impairment
due to disallowance by the insurance depart-
ment of certain assets would be made up and
that the reinsurance arrangement with the
National Life Insuranos Company would ul-
timately go through.

The American Union Company's capitali-
zation is $500.00. Among its directors are
J. H. Flagler, Henry L, Wardwell, J.8. Bache,
Arthur Kyle and E. C. Young.

 

BEAM STEEL PRICES MAINTAINED.
Pool Has a Conference and Does Net Make
the Expected Reduction.

Rather to the surprise of the trade as well
as to Wall Street, which has heard in the past
few days that the structural steel pool was
to be dissolved, it became public yesterday
that a meeting of representatives of the pool
had been held at the Holland House on Wednes-
day and that instead of reducing prices or
abandoning the pool it had been the sentiment
of those who attended the meeting that there
was nothing to warrant any action being taken,

The meeting adjourned with the understandin,
that prices for structural steel for the presen
were to be maintained at the rates fixed upon
in June, which are on the basis of $1.80 a hun-
pounds for angles and $1.00 per hundred

for beams and channels. The so-called beam
or structural stee) pool includes the Carnegie
Company, the American Bridge Company
Jones & Laughlin, the Passaic Rolling Mill
Company and the Cambria lron Company,
Representatives in this city of the American
Steel and Wire Company said y sterday that
they knew nothing regarding u report from
Chicago that a 55-cent cut per day has been
made in the sales department of the company's
Joliet mills, and that a further reduction is
contemplated, It was the company’s intention,
according to the reports, gradual y to reduce
wages all around until they get to the level that
prevailed at the time of the company's organiza-

on.

SUSPENDED FOR TWO YEARS,

 

Produce Exchange's Sentence of a Flour Man
Accused of Imitating a Brand,

Max Lubekin, a flour dealer of 28 Front street,
has been suspended for two vears by the Board
ef Managers of the New York Produce Ex-
change. This is an unusually severe sentence.
The complaint against Lubekin was made by
Wallace, Muller & Co. of 48 Pearl street, who
charged that he had been imitating their brand
of flour. The case first came before the Com-

praia Committee of the Exchange, who referred
tto the managers. The board decided that {t
must do its utmost to protect the millers and
obbers in their vested rights in particular
rands, and for that reason made the sentence
especially severe. It was reported at the Ex-
change yesterday afternoon that the testimony
showed that Wallace, Muller & Co. had sold
some of their brand to Lubekin last spring.
Though he tailed to buy any more he kept on

lling the brand, the demand especialiy coming
rom East Side customers. Wallace, Muller &
‘co made an investigation, and their charges
ollowed. Lubekin before the board set up
that he had not been guilty of any infringement
as his labels were black and Wallace, Muller &
Co.'s were blue. The complainants brought
their coopers to testify that their labels also
were blac

BEARD ESTATE TRUSTEES WIN.

Brooklyn Wharf and Warehouse Company
Obliged to Withdraw.

The ejectment proceedings brought by
Francis D. Beard, William Beard and Jeremiah
Robinson Beard, as trustees under the will of
William Beard, against the United States Mort-
gage and Trust Company, as receiver of the
Brooklyn Wharf and WarehouseCompany, to re+
cover possession of the Beard estate at Erie
Basin, were ended yesterday morning in the
First District Municipal Court, Court and State
streets, when Jusitce Walsh decided in favor of

the plaintif's. No defence was put in by the
defendants The property involved is on the
water front and was leased to the Wharf and
Warehouse Company. ‘The latter failed to pay
the rent as agreed. r

After the receiver had been appointed a cer-
tain amount was paid monthly on account of
the arrears, but the receiver notilied the trus-
tees that this amount would not be paid in
August or inthe future. The trustees then ob-
tained permission from the Supreme Court to
begin proceedings looking toward the recovery
of the property ‘The trustees will now make
new leases with the persons who sub-leased
from the Wharf and Warehouse Company.
This will guarantee a rental of about 850,000 a
year and will leave a large area of wharves and
warehouses to be utilized by the trustees,

 

THE FROTHINGHAM ESTATE.

The Referee Says $25,000 Is Dueto It for
Services to the Kings County Elevated.

The report of Referee William H. Ford in
the matter of estimating the value of the ser-
vices of the late James H. Frothingham as
receiver of the Kings County Elevated Rail-
way Company was presented to Supreme
Court Justice Lambert in Brooklyn for con-
firmation yesterday. Mr. Frothingham for-
merly was the treasurer of the company, When
Gen, James Jourdan retired as receiver, Mr.
Frothingham was appointed in his place, He
was to receive $625 a month as salary on‘account
of his services. In all he received $12,500,
Theodore I,, Frothingham, his son, began suit
as administrator of the watate to recover the
balance due his father as receiver. He con-
tended @iat the $12,500 was only on account,
and said there was a valid contract between
his father and the Reorganization Committee
by which his father was to receive an additional
$25,000. The referee heard testimony, the
witnesses saying that Mr, Frothingham was
entitled to an amount ranging from $20,000 to

50,000. August Belmont, the ¢hairman of the

teorganization Committee, thought that $20,-
000 was a sufficient sum. The referee recom-
mends that Mr. Frothingham was entitled to
$37,500, and that from this amount should be
deducted the $12500 he received on account
of his salary, and that $25,000 is due his estate,
Justice Lambert took the papers and reserved
decision,

GOULD THIEF PLEADS GUILTY.

Handy Man Who Stole Jewelry Ready to Take
All That's Coming to Him.

Charles William Blair, the ‘handy man” who
stole over $1,000 worth of jewelry from the res-
idence of Mr. and Mrs. Edwin Gould, at 72
Fifth avenue last May, pleaded guilty in the
General Se-sions yesterday of grand larcency
in the first degree. He will be sentenced on
Aug. 16. Blair was indicted by the Grand Jury
last month for grand larcencyin the first de-
gree and his pleading guilty to the full count

was something of a surprise. He jis in the
Tombs. Mrs. Jean V, Miller, housekeeper of the
Goulds, hired Blair about May 10. He was
known to heras Thomas Ashton. He worked
ten days and left without even vetting raid for
his time, but he took with him enough jewelry
tomakethat all right, He was arrested on
June 29 on the Bowery by Central Office detec-
tives, who had trailed him from Coney Island.
The Goulds had gone to Europe before Blair
was hired.

FINANCIAL AND COMMERCIAL,

Tuurspay, Aug. 9.

The record for dulness on the Stock Exchange
for this season was broken to-day, the total
transactions being leas than 90,000 shares. In
only one stock, Sugar Refining, did the sales
foot up 10,000 shares, and in only one other,
Union Pacifle common, were they in excess of
6,000 shares. The fluctuations as a rule were in
proportion to the transactions, that is, exceed-
jugly narrow and without significance. Sugar
Refining was exceptionally strong at anet ad-
vance of nearly a point and moderate buying
of Chicago and Northwestern common, pre-
sumably for Western account, lifted the price
of that stock nearly four points. Throughout
the remainder of the list the net changes
averaged jess than % per oent. and favored
both accounts about equally. Foreign arbitrage
houses were moderate sellers at the opening,
but before the expiration of the first hour they
ceased operating as the differences in quota-
tions between the two markets were so slight
as to preclude trading to advantage.

While the market app: ared to be so dull as to
be devoid of signifiiance, the fact is worth
noting that the inactivity which has character-
iz.d it for a long time past has not been
accompanied, as is frequently the case, by
decidedly lower prices, There is no pressure
to sell stocks, a circumstance which indica‘es
that notwithstanding the ex stence of conditions
that induce ecnservatism, such fs the Presi-
dential campaign, the complications in China
and the reaction In generai business, investors
are satisfied to hold on to their securities. The
chances are that they have increased their
holdings, for the floating supply of stocks in
Wall Street is without doubt constantly becom-
ing smaller. Brokers agree that they are car-
rying fewer stocks for customers than they
have been for many months. It {s possible,
however, that many speculative holders of
stocks, with ample capital, are having them
carried by banks and other lenders of money
instead of by their brokers, because of the lower
rates of interest they cin secure by doing so,

fully justified. ‘The company has bought dur-
ing the year extensive woodlands, erected tvo
wood preparing plants with 200 cords per dav
camicity, bought the Gardiner Sulphite mill
and made extensive additions at Rumford
Falis, Me.
