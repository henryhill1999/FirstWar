SHOT THAT KILLED GOEBE

R'S MEASUREMENTS FIGURE
THE POWERS TRIAL.

¢ the Bullet That Pierced Goe-

arorg ar Have Come From Powers's
Office--Other Contradictions of the Prose-
cution’s Testimony Made by Witnesses.

GroroxTowN, Ky., Aug. 9.—The defence in
the trial of Caleb Powers for the murder of
Wiliam Goebel got in some contradictions
of the prosecutions case to-day. The defence
hopes to conclude by Saturday morning and
the prosecution will then require about three
dave for rebuttal, 60 it looks tke the jury may
get the case in ten days.

Surveyor Coolman was on the stand again
this morning. He said that according to his
calculations a bullet that travelled nine and
one-half inches through Geobel’s body and in
doing so had fallen one and thirteen-six teenth
inches in that distance must have come from
a place seven feet and elghty-nine one-hun-
dredths above the window sill of the west
window of the Secretary of State's office, On
cross-examination Coolwan said:

“a straight line drawn from either front
window of the Secretary of State's office to
the centre of the hole in the hackberry tree
woud maet with no obstruction, A shot fired
from the east window would pass close to the
atone coping of the fountain, A shot fired
from the second story window over the Secre-
tary of State's office to the hole in the hackberry
tree would pass fourteen feet and five inches
above the pavement at the place where Goebel
{ssupposed to havefallen. Tfabullet was fired
from the southeast window of Powers's office
{t would pass four feet and one and three-eighth
inches above the pavement,and four feet three
inches above the place if fired from the west
window.” Prof. J.J, Rucker of Georgetown,
who assisted Coolman in his measurements,
corroborated Coolman to @ certain extent, but
had not made as full measurements as Cool-

was in jail there that Culton was an honorable
voung fellow of good family and could be trusted
anvwhere and would not run away if left out

Stone said he did not use that language, but
he did tell Pflanz that he was a clever young
fellow, of good family and would not try to es-
cape, and asked that good treatment be given
hir.. Just before court adjourned Capt, Stone
ot permission to explain that he did say that
faiton could be trusted, but that he meant it in
the sanse that if Culton told the jailer he would
not talk to the other prisoners or that he would
not attempt to escape, the jailer could trust
him not to do 80
D. H. Sinclair, the Frankfort telegraph opera-
tor, was recalled by the defence to lay the foun-
dation for a contradiction, He was asked if he
had not on July 25 told Dr. H. S. Keller that he
had the promise of a place, but the promise had
not been fulfilled: that he said he had gone to
Justus Goebel and demanded a piece that he
had had an offer of money for his testimony,
but had agreed to accep! a place as an exchange
of courtesies: that he could break down the
rosecution if he wanted to and had given Justus
oebel one week to fulfil the promise or he
would go to the defence for something, The
rosecution objected and the Court ruled that
e need not answer
Dr. Keller was put on thestand, but the Court
ruled he could not answerthe questions as to
what Sinclair is purported to have said, The
defence recalled Robert Noakes for purposes
of contradiction, Noakes said he never sald
to Abe Herndon that he Was going on the stand,
ut would answer no questions except when
attorney nodded his head. He did say
Herndon that he was in the hands of his
orneya and would do what they said. He
said he never told B. A. Rice that he would get
a written, contract that he was not to be prose-
cuted, before he would testify
Herndon swore that Noakes did tell him
he would only answer when attorneys nodded,
and Rice said Noakes did say in his presence
a few days after the trial began that he would
not testity till he got a written contract not
to be prosecuted as an accessory
4. F Sinclair, Postmaster of Georgetown,
and one of the attorneys for the defence, said
‘Wharton Golden told me on the train April

hall in the Fxecutive Building leading into the
reception room of the Seeretary of State's
office on Jan. 80 when the shots were fired. I
thought the first shot was the slamming of a
door at the west end of the hall, I looked, but
the door was closed and I saw no one in the hall,
I then went on inte the reception room. 1 saw
Gov. Taylor there and pushed him on back into
his private ofttce and asked him what the shoot-
{ng meant. We both went to the window and
looked out. T saw a man lying on the pave-
mentand | said: ‘That is Goebel,’ ”
On cross-examination he sald
“I did not tell the Grand Jury what IT have
told to-day because no questions were asked
me about it. I did not tell Mr. Pedicord in
Presence of R. EF. Roberts that_the first shot
founded clear and others muffled, and that
Tsaw Goebel and he quivered like a shot hog.”
Sinclair is the fourth or fifth witness who
has testified to beingin the hall of the Executive
Building when the shots were fired. Each

SURFACE MAIL CARS TO BE DROPPED.

Metropolitan Notifies the Postmaster That It
Does Not Care to Keep Them Going.

The Metropolitan Street Railway Company
has served notice upon Postmaster Van Cott
that {t wishes to terminate the Third Avenue
ine street car mail carrying agreement on
Sept.1. The present arrangement, which was
made three years ago, was continued by the
Metropolitan Company after it had absorbed
the Third Avenue system. The agreement will
expire on Sept. 1, and President Vreeland came
to the conclusion that a renewal of the existing
arrangements would be unsatisfactory. He
notified Postmaster Van Cott of his decision
two weeks ago, at the same time making It
Gear that the company did not wish to hamper
: eGovernment inany way, and that If it was
Mposaible for the Government to make other
arrangements the company would continue to
othe carrying for some time longer

The change will mean very little anyhow, ac-
cording to Postinaster Van Cott. ‘The surface
mail cars are used only for the delivery of mail
on the Fast side above Forty-second street, and
run only over the tracks of the old Third
Avenue line. Below Forty-second street, on the
“Ast Side, the ordinary mail is delivered by
pneuma c tubes and the paokage mail by

agons. The Postmaster said that arrange-
mente would probably be made forthe truns-
portation of the mail over the lines of the Man-
Ww an Elevated Railway, The mail for the
4 net Bide branch offices has for some time been
ph Mibuted over the elevated lines, and in Post-

Smith's Companion Found on the Floor With
Her Head Gashed,

A man and a woman who said they were John

Smith of 475 Fifty-fifth street. Brooklyn,
and Mrs. Mona Thompson of 236 West Fifteenth
street, Manhattan, went to the second floor
café of the Lipton House at Broadway and Kent
avenue, Williamsburg, shortly after 8 o'clock
yesterday morning and sat down at a table
hear an open window. The man ordered
drinks and after they were served the waiter
went out, Fifteen minutes later when the
Waiter returned he found the woman lying
on the floor with several gashes in her
head. Smith was nearby on a chair. He
seemed to be dazed. The waiter went into
the street and summoned Policeman Fallon.
While they were going up the stairs Smith
rushed past them into the street. Fallon pur-

sued the man along Kent avenue and captured |

him at South Ninth street.
he had inflicted the tnjuries upon the woman.
Fallon took him to the café where the woman
sald that Smith had struck her several violent

blows on her head because she had spoken to
an acquaintance who entered the café,

Smith denied the woman's story, He declared
that she must have received her injuries by
falling from a chair and striking a cuspidor.

Hospital brought Dr. Petit. He expressed the
opinion that the woman had a compound
fracture of the sku.l and that she would prob-
ably die. She was removed to the hospital,
She told Fallon she was separated from her
husband, who is in the Wast Indies, and that
e is suing her for divorce, She refused to
tell the name of the second man, on account of

FOUGHT CAP HATFIELD.

Notorious Desperado Wounded ia a Row-— Was
Working Under an Assamed Name.

CHARLESTON, W. Va., Aug. 9~-"Cap” Hat-
fleld, the desperado, and tne man who has
more notches on the stock of his gun than any
other man in the mountains of West Virginia,
is again In the public eye. For nine months
the officers of the law have {n vain sought him,
and it now turns out that when he escaped
from jail in Mingo county he fled to Cuba.
Finally, broken in health, he returned under
an assumed name to West Virginia. He said:
“There is too much of my blood in West Vir-
ginia soil for me to ever leave it.”

In McDowell county he has worked peace-
fully in the lumber business conducted by
a Cincinnati firm.
that the good-natured laborer was the fear-
less Hatfleld whose iron nerve has never failed

him, and whose rifle always dropped his man,

mountaineer threw the Lottle to the ground
and demanded the larger one.
and the man attempted to force Curtis to de-
liver the whiskey. Curtis drew his gun and
told him to stand back or there would be trouble,
“Cap” was in his element. With a emile he
said, approaching Curtis

“Give me that whiskey or I'll”

He never got any further. Curtis fired and
in the twinkling of an eye “Cap” had drawn
his revolver and the duel was on. Backing,
Curtis continued to fire, and at about the same
time both men fell. Curtis was shot in the
neck, Hatfield in the side. The men were
picked up by some of the other men in camp
and it was then that Hatfleld admitted that for
two months he had been sailing under an as-
sumed name and that he was the redoubtable
Capt. Hatfield. At this time physicians had
arrived and everything possible was done for
the two men. It is probable that Hatfleld will
be turned over to the authorities of either Lo-
gan or Mingo county.

THAT FATAL PRIZEFIGHT.

Some Say There Was a Woman in the Case
—Coroner Doesn't Believe It,

There {is doubt as to whether the boxing
bout in which Ralph Miller lost his life at Rich-
mond Hill on Wednesday night was a friendly
contest or an out-and-out prizefight.
are several versions of the affair and they all
conflict. Relatives of the dead youth allege
that the bout was for $15 and that the winner
was to receive $10 and the loser $5. Others
state that they fought over a young woman.
Victor Baldwin, who was Miller's opponent,
was arraigned before Magistrate Connorton
at Far Rockaway yesterday morning. He
was charged by the police with causing the
death of Ralph Miller. Baldwin is 23 years
old and weighs 160 pounds, With him were
arraigned five young men charged with aiding
and abetting a prizefight. They are John
Cleff, William Milligan, John White and Eugene
McHale, all of Richmond Hill, and Walter
Dunn of Morris Park. They were held in
$1,000 bonds each, Baldwin was held without
bail. The cases were all set down for Monday
morning at 9 o'clock.

Some of th se interested in the contest said
that it was fought with gloves, but so far the
gloves have not been found. Coroner Ruoff
said yesterday that he had learned that Bald-
win and Miller had known each other for a
long time and that they were always good
friends. He stated that his investigation had
satisfied him that the fight was not over any
young woman, but was the outcome of friendly
rivalry. The police are of the opinion that
it was a full-fledged prizefight and that there
wus little friendship about it, Miller was 19

Comptroller Coler made public yesterday an
itemized bill of Prof. R. A. Witthaus for services
rendered in the Molineux trial for which Prof.
Witthaus wants $18,550. The Comptroller de-
clares that hp will not allow the bill, and he ts
backed up by District Attorney Gardiner, who
wrote to the Comptroller yesterday that he
thought the ‘claim of value excessive.” Dr.
Witthaus's itemized bill is:

Together with the bill, a letter of explana-
tion from Assistant District Attorney Osborne
to District Attorney Gardiner was filed with
Comptroller Coler. The Assistant District
Attorney wrote that Dr. Witthaus was actually
in attendance at court and when not on the
witness stand was {fn consultation with one
of the Assistant District Attorneys and that
he, Mr. Osborne, did not deem it safe to pro-
ceed in a trial of such importance wit oy
@ man of scientific knowledge at his elbow.
In. conclusion Mr. Osborne wrote;

“I deem that the claim of Dr. Witthaus for
such service in a just and proper charge against
the county. This opinion {8 aside from the
value of the service,”

Before sending thie letter from his Assiat-
ant to Comptroller Coler the District Attorney
wrote this upon the margin

“Assistant District Attorney Osborne was
the trial assistant in the trial of Roland B.
Molineux in the Court of General Sessions
for murder in the first degree of which he was
convicted. The expert services of Prof. Witt+
haus were necessary and their duration could
not be determined in advance. The claim,
however, of value is in my opinion excessive.”

forces. Mr. Gudger states that quiet prevails
in the city and order is fast being restored. Dur-
ir the past several days excitement has been
\-ry great and bloodshed incident to battle has
been terrible.

A battle ocourred on July 21 at Corozal, three
miles outside the city limita of Panama, and
the Government forces retreated to their in-
trenchmenta within the confines of the city.
On Sunday morning the 22d, about daybreak,
the battle began within the city limita and all

the guns and cannon fired were within those
limits excepting two pieces operated by the
revolutionists outside. From that day until
Wednesday, the 26th, there was more or less
fighting both night and day. There was aces.
sation of hostilities, however, for the purpose of
caring for the wounded and the hospital corps
of the English warship Leander landed and did
good work.

On the 25th the Consuls of the United States,
England and France tendered their good oflces
to both parties in the interest of peace and they
were accepted. These officers visited the camps
of each of the contending forces and arranged
for an armistice for twenty-four hours and the
surrender in the meantime of the revolutionary
forces on terms satisfactory to both parties.
However, within four or five hours of the com-
mencement of the armistice, the terms were
broken and fighting continued all Wednesday
night. The next day the revolutionary forces
surrendered and quiet was restored.

Mr. Gudger states that the slai @hter dur-

ing these days has been great He
passed over the battlefield on Wednes-
day and saw the dead tn heaps all alon
the roadside and many were = reportec
in the bush where he could not see them It has
been estimated that more than 50 per cent. of
the revolutionary forces were either killed or
wounded. From what Mr. Gudger saw he has
no donbt that this estimate is approximately
correct, General amnesty has been given to
all revolutionists. After the fight at Corozal
Gens, Losado and Guerrero took refuge on
the English ship.
Some of the dead were cared for by their
friends In the city, some by revolutionists,
but the great majority were cremated on the
battlefield.

COURT TO RUN THE PEKIN?

MOTION FOR A RECEIVER FOR THE
TIVOLI'S NEIGHBOR.

If the Motion Is Granted It Will Not Re the
First Time That the Supreme Court Has
Been (n Charge of Similar Premises—Frank
D. Ames Wants to Dissolve the Partnership.

Frank D. Ames, lessee of the restaurant and
hotel business at 145 West Thirty-fifth street,
known as the Pekin, has given notice of a
motion, returnable in the Supreme Court
to-day, for the appointment of a receiver of the
property pending his action against his part-
ners, Doble R. Harley and Wilbur T. Ames, his
brother, for a dissolution of their partnership.
The plaintiff says that he has been unable to
get an accounting from the defendants but he
understands that the business is conducted at a
logs, and he wants it wound up.

The Pekin is between the Tivoli, which was
recently closed after a raid, and the Doré. It {s
an all-night restaurant and includes jn its bill
of fare Chinese dishes which give color to its
name. Its fall is attributed to the capture of
the Tivoli by the allles.

It is asked that the receiver to be appointed
have power to conduct the place pending the
action. A receiver isamere arm of the court,
so that in law it would be the court that would
be conducting the place, as the court once con-
ducted the Maison Tortoni in Lexington ave-
nue. The notice of motion served by William
Henry Knox, attorney for the plaintiff, asks:

“That the court appoint a receiver to receive,
administer and hold the property and the busi-
ness and to collect the rents, issues and profits
and income thereof, and to carry on and man-
age the business pending this action and fixing
the amount of security of the receiver and di-
recting defendants to convey and deliver to the
receiver the property and the business and all
books, vouchers and other papers relating to
the property and the business and giving the
receiver the usual powers and directions.

The plaintiff avers that he took a lease of the
property for ten years from Nov. 1, 1809, at a
vearly rental of $4,000, Hesays an agreement
was made with Harley at the start to act as
manager, and he has since acted in| that
capacity. It was agreed that Harley should
render a daily account of the business to the
defendant, Ames. ‘The defendant, Arnes, had
advanced money from time to time for the
sonduet of the business
. Piantitt suys that he understands that ft has
Cost $36,879.61 to conduct the business from the
<tart until now, and that the receipts have only
been $34,403.36. On learning of the continuing
loss the plaintiff says he gave notice that he
elected to terminate the a agree-
ment. He says that Harley has been fully paid
for hia services and has no interest in the busi-
hess or any property of the partnership. It is
alleged that Harley professes to have an ins
terest in the business and tts effects and
threatens to prevent the plaintiff from dis-
po-ing of these things Plaintiff says that, any-
way, he could not Specs of oo poceune
overything is in possession of the defendants.

‘ The complaint asks that it be adjudged that
Harley has no interest and has been paid tn
full for his services, and that the property be
disposed of between the plaintiff and the de-
fendant, Ames
