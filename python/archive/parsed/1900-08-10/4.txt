Sr, Lovis, Aug. &—Brooklyn opened here

to-day and won hands down, ,‘Cy” Young was
easy picking, ard the Superbas’ great work on
the bases netted them sevenruns, At that it
was only because they were too daring in cir-
cling the sacka that they did not double the
score, The stick work of the entire Brooklyn
team, save Cross, the short stopping of Dah-
lan, Woe batting of Donlin and the phenomenal

one handed catch by Donovan were the features,

supported. Kinley Mack closed at 8 to 1.

While at the post there was considerable
skirmishing and then cam* an awful start. The
horses were all atrung out, and Turner, the
rider of Ethelbert, as welias MoCue who rode
Kinley Mack, began to pull up, not thinking
it would bea go. Ethelbert was half turned
around when the flag dropped, and Turner
hastened to send him along after the field. . He
was at least five lengths back of Kinley Mack,
with the others several lengths out in front.
Martimas, Mr. Jersey and Charentus went out
to make the running. On the far turn Ethel-
bert and Kinley Mack moved up. Ethelbert

was on the outside while Kinley Mack
got through on the rall and = saved
several lengths. Making the turn into

the stretch Kinley Mack got through and took
the lead, while Ethelbert fell back a trifle.
Turner rallied him, and he responded se gamely
that at the furlong pole it looked as if he would

win. But the finish was too near at ) an
after a hard drive Kinley Mack won bya .
As a result of the defeat of Etheibert, which
brought storms of hisses for Starter Caldwell,
the alewards informed him that ne must bave a
barrier on hand by the time the races begin to-
morrow or else use the Clark machine which is
on the ground,

Match Between Ethelbert and Kinley Mack
Falis Through.

Sanatoca, Aug. ¥. EF. Mossom, in behalf of
Frank McMahon, owner of Cioddess of Night,
which ran second in the fourth rave, bid in
Himself, who ran third, from },. V. Bell. Him-
self was entered to be sold for $300, and as the
purse was only worth $580, McMahon got a
$2,000 colt for 9680.

After the Beverwyck Handicap had been
decided, Pete Wimmer, who trains Kinley
Maok, bean to jolly Jack Joyner, trainer of
Ethelber ,, because Kinley Mack had out «prin-
ted Ethelbert from the head of the stretch
home. This enraged Joyner, who wanted to
match the horses at once. He was willing to

match Ethelbert for from $5,000 to $10,000 a side,
from a quarter of a mile up tofour miles. Wim-

er would not accept the challenge, saying
that Ethelbert was sound and hk horse. w as

not. and then again Ethelbert preferred a dry
track while Kinley Mack was best over a heavy
or soft track. This probably ends all hances
of a match between the two.

It was learned here to-day that a prominent
member of the Metropolitan Turf Association
was ordered So peck his trunk and yo after the
Brighton meeting ended on Wednesday. It
appears that the investigations of the bad riding
at @ meeting brought forth the fact that
rom the appearances of his sheets he was
dealing in “dead ones.” He was informed
on Wednesday afternoon that he was wanted
in the Secretary's office and Bob Pinkerton
ted as hia escort. What was said to him
n the office is not known, but it is certain that
he ‘ not wanted around the Metropolitan

acks.

will be put to another trying test in the ring of
the Twentieth Century A. C., Madison Square
Garden, to-night, when he faces Gus Rublin,
the “Akron Giant,” in a 25-round bout. Ruhlin
beat down and stopped Tom Sharkey at Coney
Island last month, the end coming in the
fifteenth round. Prior to his decisive victory
over Sharkey, there was not much to be gaid in
Ruhilin’s favor except that be was a big, strong
rugged fellow, fairly clever, game and willing
to takea punch. With such clever instructors
and handlers as James J, Corbett and Dilly
Madden behind him, however, Ruhlin developed
something he never possessed before, science
ang genera'ship, together with unusual quick-
ness of action and implicit faith in the orders
he received in his corner,

While Corbett received much credit for Ruh-
lin's triumph over the Sailor, still the Akron
fighter was entitled to much praise because he
did the actual fighting and did it in such an
effective manner that Sharkey looked like a
novice in his hands, Indeed, it is a fact that
never before in his career as a prizefighter did
Sharkey receive suvh a thorough whipping as
in this instance. Unable to make a match with
Jeffries, whose arm is keeping him in tempor-
ary retirement, Rublin took on the next best
man in Fitz4immons.

In making this match the principals realized
two things: First, that if Ruhlin shold win,
he would be so justly entitled to a fight with
Jeffries that the latter would either be forced
to accept or forfeit the championship. Second,
that if Fitzsimmém@aghould win he would be in
line for another run in with the big boilermaker
to reguin his lost laurels, In addition to these

things, the men saw visions of bi¢ gate receipts
and their sight was good, if indications mean
any tains.

‘The best line on Rublin is his victory over
Baarser. In that encounter it will be remem-
bered that Sharkey went to his man at every
stage of the game with hard rushing and heavy
swings. Rutiin with well-timed footwork and
clever blocking avoided nearly all of these
blows and tien with a fine left hand he simply
jabbed the Sal or in the head until hewas “beat
to death,’ as ihe bloodthirsty talent put it. In
fact Kublin met Sharkey just as Jeffries met
Fitzsimmons. boih the Sailor and the Cornish
man being whipped in very much the same
way. Bul Fitzsimmons slueged Sharkey out all
rightin theie memorable battleon th: coast when
the referee, \\ yate Earp, decided that Sharkey
wononafoul, those who saw that fig it say
that Sharkey never had a chance t) wh p Fitz,
who punche ! the Sailor at will, and could have
st. pped Lim almost at any period had he cared
todo se, So when. omparing Ruhiin and Pita
with the idea of getting at the winner of to-
night's flit, itis useleas to bring the Sharkey
line into the reckoning, except with the fact
that Fitz is older now, and much older than

Ruhiin.

Several years ago Ruh'in fought twenty
rounds with Jeffries in California The decision
wasadraw, At that time nether knew much
about the game. Ruhin, however, held his
own and has been asking for a return mateh
ever since. Men who have wa ched these two
big feliows in their more reeent battles declare
that they employ the same methods. Thatiste
say, they are notfondof takingthecffensive, but
prefer to have an opponent come in. with
rushes and wiliswings) Thon they use the left
hand for facersandr.p the right into the boay
or over to the jaw when the proper time arrives
Jeffries whipped Fitz this wav and Ruhiin
stopped Sharkey in the ea ve manner,

Now the question arises, {+ Kuhlin as clever
as Jeriries and can he administer as much pun-
ishment? ‘ihe questio , it would seem, Could be
avswered partially inthe aflirmat ve, tor Ruhlin
did to Sharkey in fifteen rounds something
that Jeffries could not accomplish in twenty-
five. But Sharkey, it must be remembered, is
n ta Fitzsimmons The sailorisa phenomenon
as to physical str gth and wovld make a
model wrestler or “strong man" But he never
was a clever, selentific pugibat. Until Tom
O'Rourk took hodof him, Sharkey had an
unsavory reputation as a foul fighter, which, by
the way, he has succee’ed in living down
O'Rourke and Dixon taught the Sailor many
things, but trey could not perfect hin inthe
niveties of the manly artand finally gave him
up as hopeless. Agiinet Ruhlint :@ Sailor had
one style. That was rush and swing and
elinch Had fitzelmmons been in Ruhlins
place that night he would) probably have
finisied Sharkey with equal despatch and
effect.

Fitgsimmons, having learned a lesson from
his disastrous fight with Jeffries, understands
well what to expect from Rubin,

Fitz has seen
Rublin fight a number o” times

 

ind believes
that he knows how to tr.m Madden's bl¢ pro-
(égé@, The Cornisthman never had one set style
of fluhting. He has been a man quick to take
advantage of the situation in the ring, no
matter h w suddenly it might change, and in
this way he has won many finportant tle hts by
janding aprnuch on the proper spot. It never
has taken iong for Fitzto finish a man after he
has once got home one of his great Wallops; and

pug lists he haa met in
modern thines have feared t: mix it with him.
J ffries was particularly careful not toe get in
too close, and so he handled Fitz solely at long
range. Whether Kubin wili adopt similar
tactic. remains to be seen.

Fitzsimmons knocked out the “human freight
car,” Ed Dunkhorst, i: the second round with
one left-hand wallop in theear, It took Rubli
twenty-three rounds to beat Dunkhorst and
then he could not put him to sleep, the seconds
throwing up the sponge. ‘This gives a jair idea
of the hitting power of the twomen. Fitzis
the greater puncher. Hecan hook, Jab, swing
or uppercut with equal force and is atwo-
handed slugger of tremendous strength. He
likes infighting better than long rane work
andcan make a punch, travelling only three
inches, do the knock-out trick. Fitz is also 18
quick a8 a cut to see — and is one of the
trickiost fighters in the profession. He may
appear to be very groggy at some stage of to-
night's encounter, but it may only bea case of
‘stalling’ in order to catch Rublin off his
guard

‘The Akron man Isa good, stiff puncher, but
he cannot produce results ike the Cornishman,
Tf he had been ab'e to hit as hardas Fitz, Rublin
would!ave knocked Sharkey out much easver
than he did, for he got to the Sailor with com-
parative ease. Fitz, relying upoo his punching
ower, is fond of mix-ups. If Rublin comes to
bis man the latter will be more than satisiled as
Bob isaterror atthis style «f yoing. But if
Ruhblin stays off and walta lor Fitz to do the at-
tacking it will not be such easy sailing for the
lanky mon, Andit is pretty good betting that
if Corbett’s advice goes Ruhiin will be prepared
to stand off and make a Jong, careful, jabbing
fight ot it until he has old Fitz well beaten up
for the right-hand swing to the jaw,

Fitzsimmons could not get to Jeffries with
enough powerful smashes to put him in dis-
tress, while Corbett actually had the champion
groggy in tne ninth round, Sharkey could
make no better impression on Jeffries than
Fitz, yet Sharkey knocked out clever Kid
McCoy. (Can Fitz get to Ruhlin?

The weights enter into the calculations with
much prominence. Rublin will weigh close to
200 pound-, while Fitz will seale about 170.
Ruhlin is taller, younger and is propably
stronger in physique But Fite knows more
about the inside wi rkings of the rag and is
crafty enough to overlook nothing, Possibly
Fitzsimmons may find a way to reach the
Akron man with oneof his punches that has
knocked all the Ggat outof a0 many opponents
in the past, and then again Ruhiin may handle
the Cornishman just as Jeffries did. Whatever
the outcome, the fight bids fair to bea rattling
one

Fitzsimmons has trained, he says, and is fit.
He didn't work very hard for Jeffries and got
whipped. By putiing himself in oondition this
time Fitz thinks he will get to the top of the
ladder again. Stories of lame arms, festered
hands and freckles have emanated from Fitz's
cainp for the past week, but not much reliance
is taken in them by the publio, for Fitz is known
to be “foxy” and would not think of enterin.

“T have Ruhlin in the best trim of hia career,”
said Madden, “and, barring accidents, T look

Fitzsimmons's right arm gave him a little
trouble yesterday, but it was not serious
enough to cause the Cornishman’s trainers
or admirers any anxiety, While exercising
with the dumbbells Pitz felt a slight pain near
the elbow, but it seon disappeared. In dis-

cussing his chances, Fitz said

RICHFIELD SPRINGS, Aug. 9.—The Otsego Golf
Club's open tournament began to-day sith a
fine array of starters, a number of metropolitan
players being on band. In fact, the honors of
the day were carried of by Devereaux Emmet
of the Garden (ity Golf Ciub, who is now at his
best, He did the course in 41 and 45, hia 86 be-

ng cigbt strokes better than the Le-t of the

The course la 2,¢00 yards long andratier sporty,
the longest hole being 450 yards and th
shortest 140 yards. The bogey score is place
at 38, but it isno easy matter to play itin that
figure owing to the numerous obstacles th»
players have to contend with, It is a com para-
lively narrow course, with crevks, brooks:
ditches and all kinds of annoying bunkers and
hazards in adaition te hanging and cuppy lies.
The scenery, bowever, is grand. ihe
heavy follage, with glimpses of — the
lake, and the commanding view from
the hilitepa of — th: jake mountains,
valleys and the lowlands, gives the course a
most picturesque appearance, In the after-
noon the cottagers for many miles around
came in four-in-hands and traps of
description to witness the match pley. They
followed the competitors over the links,
and seemed to take amost as much en-
ore out of missaps as they did

ease, 1¢ did not prevent the “gailery” trom

DAVIS AND WARD TAKE DECIDING
GAME FOR INTERNATIONAL BOWL,

Black and Barrett, the English Teanis Team,
Beaten in Three Straight Sets—Visiters Us-
able to Cope With the Winner's Lobs—Vie-
tory Gained by Narrow Margin in Each Set.

Boston, Aug. 9 The supremacy of the
American lawn tennis players over the team
of English plavers which came here to contest
for the Davis International Lawn Tennis
Challenge Bowl has been unmistakably demon-
strated, for in the doubles match, played at the
Longwood Cricket Club grounds thla after-
noon, Dwight F. Davia and Haleombe Ward
defeated E. D. Black and H. Roper Barrett,
three straightsets by the scores of 6—~4, @~<4 and
64,

To-day's victory rettles for this vear the
question of whether or not a team of players
could be produced in England which could
cross the Atlantic and play a game that would
be superior to that which can be put up by
Whitman, the natlonal champion of singles and
by Davis and Ward, the national champions of
doubles, The Davis trophy will remain in
America for at least another year.

Under the conditions of the tournament in
order to take or bold the cup, it was necessary
tor on» of the teams to win three of the five
matches, four of which were at singles and one
atd ubles. Yesterday's two victories gave the
Amerioans two of the three points they wanted
and al! hinged on this afternoon's match. If
the Engli-imen had won the doubles. they

wou'd have had one ;o!ntto their credit, and
would then have stood a show tw take
home the bowl. The two final matches in sin-
gies ars to be played to-morrow afternoon and
the drawings seem to favor the chanoes of at
least one of the Englishmen taking aset. The
visitors are extremely disappointed over their
showing #o far and ure very anxious to win
both of the remaining matches if they possibly
can Sosome hot tenni: ts expected to-morrow
aiternoon between Whitman aod Black and
Gore and Davis,

Thestory of to-day’s game is not so easily
told as that of yesterday's matches, for the
Engiishmen certainly put up better tennia, ind
strove with all their might and skill to prevent
another victory_for the Americans,

In team
work avis aud Ward were seen at their best,
and they made few mistakes, while Black and
Barrett loat some points by not being in the
right place at the right moment. Service
counted considerably, and Ward's anpea
quite as good as that ot Davis, while Back and

arrett won ab equal number of games on the F
services,

Atalmostevery point the visitors were out-
pigved by their opponents, although the Eng-
ishinen scored as many aces on service as the
defenders of the trophy.

In placing the Americans showed marked sue
periority. Timeafter time the home players
would put up lobs to pull them out of a
tight place and invariably they got the
necessary polnt through that style of play.
Their opponents seemed utterly poadle to co
with the lobs and returned the ball finely for
either Davis or Ward to put up into the
j} tiragain. That the visitors considered a lob

ball something very useful at times was
demonstrated by th» quickness with which
they oop d it, and, of course, Davis got in
soe of hig sma hing returns that they were in-
capable of handling | Black was better than
| bls partner at piacing the ball out of reach and

}@ improved as the games wenton, Inone
game especially, the eventh of the third set,
he placed the ball down the centre of the courts
twice in succession, where neither of the Amer-
jeans couldreach it. Barrett also showed up
strongly jn this Work atopportune momenta
and the fifth game of the second set went to
the viritors on four straivht points scored on
c ever placing by each. Hod both the English
players been better skilled at this work the
scores would have been different,

Barrett's first appearance rated him as an
exe lent doubles player, Though not as good
) as his partner, he played with great steadiness
} andat times coached Black as to what kind of

sery cetouse, The weather was perfect and
