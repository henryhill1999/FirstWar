BROOKLYN, 8; 8T. LOUIS, 38.

“Roaring Bill” Kennedy redeemed himself
yesterday by pitching such effective ball
against the St. Louls stars that the champion
Prooklyns won with comparative ease. Ken-
nedy had perfect control. He didnot give a
single base on balls and his wild pitch was the
only misplay charged against the Brooklyn
team. Hanlon’s men found Young's fast deliv-
ery in the first two innings for enough runs to
clinch the vietory, After that, except in the
fifth inning, when Cross sent’ in Sheckard
ahadof him with a four-bagger, Young was &
mysiery to the Champions, Sheckard’s flelding
was one of the features. He knocked down
several hard liners and pulled in a coupie of
Jong fouls that made the cranks cheer enthusi-
astically. The fleiding by both teams, for that
matter, was clean and fast, which made the
game particularly enjoyabie, The score:

Perhaps no one of the 600 persons who wit-
nessed the ball game at the Polo Grounds yes-
terday afternoon was more surprised to see the
New Yorks win than Si Seymour, who Repos
forthe locals, When he stepped into the box
there were yells of delight from the loud-

vouthed Pittsburg players. His well-known
ropen nsity to outdo March hares and men from
Bort vrneo in the way of wildness was the cause of
thelr glee. Seymour gave every indication that
he would make an early ascent and, as he began
to shoot the ball everywhere except over the
ate, the noisy Pittsburgers followed each bad

Umpire Swartwood told a Sun reporter after
the game that he did not like to fine ball
players. It would seem as though the players
were aware of Swartwood's easy-going method,
for they did not hesitate to talk back at him in
eeason and out of season. There were any
number of useless kicks by Davia, Selbach,

Hatchinson’s Whereabouts s Mystery.

PRINCETON, June 1.—"Where is Third Base-
man Hutchinson?" is the query that has been
going the rounds onthe Princeton campus to-
day. Onlast Wednesday Hutchinson received
leave of absence by the baseball authorities to
compete on the track team against Cornell at
Elmira, with the understanding that he was to
return to Princeton on thefollowing day.
Nothing has been heard from him since, how-

ever. After the dual meet he left the track men
to attend a wedding in Elmira, where he lives,
and was to have
at the station in
failure to appear to-day to go wit
the nine to New Haven has caused
many to think that he has left the university.
although his friends here are loath to believe
that he would have purposely deserted the team
gust before the qamenenlp games without

aving notified Capt. Hillebrand:beforehand of
his intention. Hutchins, the old third baseman,
will take his place, but Hutchinson's absence
will weaken the nine. He was also quarter
back on the football team, and was the best all
around athlete in the institution,

In practice this afternoon Green's finger
injured, and Kafer has been called back be pehind
the bat Chapman, & a substitute, has taken
Kafer's place left field: so that the nine that
will face Yale to-morrow will be badly patched
up. The players got a big send-off by the stu-
gets this afternoon when they left for New

Lacille Sweeps the Speedway—Will She Meet
Cobwebs and Caryle Carne?

Lucille, 2:00%, the mistress of the Chicago
Speedway, that was brought here last March to
measure strides with the crack trotters of New
York, convinced everybody at Speedway Park
Yesterday that no horse can be fairly classed
as the boas of the road until he has met ber
and beaten her. The little mare was out in
company with the gray trotter Minerva,2:32;,
and the bay pacer Sunland Belle, 2:08, of C. K
G. Billings’s string, Mr. Billings and Frank
Jones of Memphis driving them in turn. Sun-
land Belle was not moving just right. When
Mr. Billings sent her down the road in a brush
with Minerva, whose record is nearly half a
minute slower than that of the pacer, the gray
trotter carried her off her feet at the end and
beat her cleverly. Mr. Billings then took
the reins behind Lucille. Straight as an —

Coudy but otherwise fine weather, spirited
racing and an average attendance helped to
make yesterday's outing at the Gravesend
track enjoyable. The players began encour-
agingly by dividing their attention between
Screech and Dr. Preston. The full dozen en-
gaged faced the starter and caused that official
some trouble. Maher was the moat alert jockey
and sent Screech off the mark so fast that the
break looked decidedly ragged. Willie Sands’s
filly had speed to burn and tiptoed her field all
the way.

The talent figured that Maher would repeat
in the next race on First Whip and made Moc-
Laughlin’s colt favorite. King Bramble and
Sir Guy were shrewdly selected as the poasi-
ble contenders, and the guess was good enough
to deserve better financial results than accrued.
Village Pride and Sir Guy set a merry clip for
