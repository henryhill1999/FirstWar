For the fifth time in two weeks a general ad-

SOUTHERN PACIFIC DOING WELL.

 

Talk With Mr. Huntington, Who Is Just Back
From a Tour of Inspection,

Collis P, Huntingion, President of the
Bouthern Pacific Railroad, reached New York
yesterday after an absence of about ten weeks
fm the Southwest and on the Paciflo Coast. He
gaid that his trip had been productive both of
personal pleasure and good business results.

“T never was so proud of the Southern Pacific
eas Tam to-day, said Mr Huntington in reply
to a question about the condition of that prop-
erty. “We have spent a good deal of money on
the road and it never was in such good shay e as
now. Within recent years [have changed the
course of the road, putting it back where the
engineers originally said that it ought to go.
This change has taken it, in some instances, 150
miles away fromits former route, The most
fmportant improvement accomplished is the

henge ingrade. Taking the whole line from
Yew Orleans to White Water, California, the
grades have been so altered as to reduce the
average from 2 to | per cent. This work hag
2on going on for the past five or six years and
as cost in the neighborhood of $12,000,000,

“The Southern Pacifle Railroad is now earn-

g considerably more than its fixed charges,
tis nearer tothe payment of dividends than I

oughtit was. It has been my policy in recent
years to work for the subatantial betterment of
the road, and for solvency, rather than for

ividends. I could not see the sense in dividing
any temporary surplis among stockholders
when the physical condition of the road needed
attention and when no man could foresee what
changes there might be in financial conditions
within a very short time. While other roads
west of the Mississippi continued to pay divi-
ends until they went into bankruptey, the
outhern Pacific pursued a conservative course
and husbanded its resources
"As I say, the dividend-paying period is much
nearer than I thought it was. When T went out
to California last spring Ithough that possibly
the road might begin to pay dividends in three
or four years, Now, Lam satisfed thatthe div-
fdend-paying period will come within two
ears. I do not think that we will commence
b ay dividends within the next twelve months,
at when we do begin I want to have the pay-
ents continuous. There will be a meeting of
eo new board of directors here very soon the
exact date has not been fixed—but the question
f dividends will not come up just yet.
me is not quite ripe.”
Mr. Huntington was very much encouraged
y the outlook for business on the Paciflo
ast. The general condition of crops, he said
sae very promising, His traffle men report
him that conditions were favorable for a
goo fall business. With regard to the new line

Utah he said that the details of the plans had

pot yet been determinod upon. Surveyors

Were now going over the ground as they had

Geen for the past two vears. There was little
loubt that the line would eventually be built.

 

DISTILLING OF AMERICA AFFAIRS,

The Investigating Committee Makes a Pre-
liminary Report,

The committee representing stockholders of
the Distilling Company of America, which was
appointed last December to make an inquiry
{nto the affairs of the company and recommend
whatever action might be desirable for the
benefit of the shareholders, hasmade a prelim-
fmary report. It emploved Stephen Little to
make the Investigation and he, as wellas the
committee, has had full access to all books and
Papers of the various companies, Mr. Little’s
examination covers periods from the organiza-
thon of each company down to Dec. 81 last and,

@xoeptas to the Hannis Distilling Company, it
oovers five years past. The Distilling Company
of America did not begin actual operations un-
| late in the autumn of 1809. The fiscal year of
1 the companies controlled by it ends on Jul
1 he committee, therefore, considers it ad-
done to wait until complete returns up to the

 

ose of the fiscal year have been received be-

re deterinining the real earning capacity for
th Upon those figures an esti-
mate for coming years cin be formed.

The committee states that it has found
nothing to reflect upon the Integrity of the
Management of the company. A uniform
policy prevails in managing the constituent
Ooncerns and there is no lack of harmony be-
tween the various interests. Until the net
@arnings for the current fiseal year have been
@scertained itis premature to announce what

Hitional working capital may be required by

e different companies. Thatsuch additional
capital is necessary has been made ap-
parent by the investigation Net current
assets, according to Mr_ Little's report,
Were, on Dec. 31 last, $6,419,208 A plan

secure additional capital is under con-

Jeration and with the view of serving the best
interests of the stockholders, and also of secur-

w their coMperation, the committee makes the
‘ollowing suggestions, namely, that the Audit

mpeny of New York be aprointed an inde-

ndent audit department of the company's
unts: also, that the stockholders deposit
it certificates with the

1 The Tripler

On December 26, 1509, the undersigned, at the
sbares of your Company to
alarge amount, consented to act as & Committee
to institute an inquiry into the affairs of the Com-
pany and to recommend such action as might seem
proper. By advertisement published on the same
day the Committee advised the deposit of certia-
cates of stock with The Mercantile Trust Company,
subject to the order of the Committee, In order to
effectuate -the above purpose. Almost immediately
thereafter the officers and Directors of the Company
requested the Committee to suspend this call for the
cost of shares, and offered, If that request should be
compited, with the fulle t possible opportunity for
the Commitiee to investigate the affajrs of The
Distilling Company of America and its constituent
companies. The Oommitiee thereupon suspended
the call for the deposit of shares, returned to the de-
positors such shares as bad been received, and pro-
ceeded to make the Investigation. For this purpose
ft engaged the services of Mr, Stepifen Little, who
forthwith entered upon his work

The officers gave to Mr. Little and to the Committee
ready and full access to all the books and papers of
the different compantes and alded the Committee and
{ts expertsin every way to enable the Committee te
arrive atan accurate concluston,

Mr. Little’s examination has been extensive and
laborious, and has occupled over three months. It
covers the period from the organization of each of the
companies affected down to December 31, 1899, ex-
ceptthat as to the Hannts Distilling Company tt
covers the five years last past.

The Distilling Company of America did not go into
actual business operation until late in the autumn of
1809. The examination, therefore, with reference to
this Company, covers only the formative period
of the Company The fiscal year of all of
the companies ends on July ist Owing to the
Greatness of the undertaking and the vast extent
of the business, which really did not get tnto harmonl-
ous working order until about January 1. 1900, the
Committee is of the opinion that rather than make an
estimate of earnings based on incomplete returns, it
is advisable to wait until the books of the vartous
companies are brought up to the close of such fiscal
year, and then, with the complete figures before them,
to determine the realearning capacity of the current
year, and upon that base an estimate of the camings
for coming years. Under these circumstances, the
Cominittee bas decided upon a postponemensof Its
final report unt! such time as these necessary data
shall be in {ts possession. In coming to this con-

the Committee Is satisfied that the Interests
ompany and Its stockholders will be substan
tally benefited,

It is gratifying to state that the Committee has found
nothing to reflect upon the Integrity of the manage

the Company have furnished the Committee every ald
and facility and have shown 4 complete wiillngness
to Join with the Committee tn the formulation of any
plan or policy which may be considered advantageous
The officers are supervising and controlling the man-
agement of the constituent companies, and in this way
there has been brought abouta uniform policy which
prevails throughout all the companies, and thus all
conflict of Interest has been harmonized.

Until after the accounts are closed and the net earn-
ings ascertained for the Ascal year it will be prema-
ture to determine what additional working capital ts
required by he different companies, The Committee ts
of the opinion, however, that in order to obtain the best
results, further working capital will be needed tn addl-
tion to the net current assets, which, according to Mr.
Little's report,including acerued storage as reported
by the Company, amounted on December 31, 1899, to
$6,419, 204.13, independent of the value of real estate,
plants, good-will, brands, and similar assets, A plao
already under consideration will be perfected to ac-
complish this result. In the meantime the officers of
the Company will continue to codperate with the Com-
mittee and the Voting Trustees for the best interests
of the stockholders, and have agreed upon the follow-
fog as being benefictal:

(1.) That an auditor for all the companies shall
be appointed, who shall be independent of the
Company's audit department. For that purpose
The Audit Company of New York has been desig-
nated.

(2.) For the purpose of solidifying the different
interests and according stockholdrrs an assurance
of conservative permanent management coupled
with a fixed policy, stockholders of The Distilling
Company of Amertca are invited to deposit with
The Mercantile Trust Company, subject to the
order of the Committee, but wilhout any expense
to the stockbolders, thelr certificates of stock
together with appropriate blank powers of at
torney and proxies, receiving {n exehange therefor
Negotiable certificates of equitable Interest tn
said stock, the stock Itself to be placed and re-
main for five years from the first day of July,
1900, in the names of August Belmont, John L.
Cadwalcder, T, Jefferson Coolidge, jr., Willtam
F. Harrity and Alvin W. Krech, who sball
fn the meantime vote thereon under the provi-
aions of an appropriate agreement at all elections
or meetings of The Distilling Company of Amer-
fea. The deposits of stock for that purpose are
required to be made with The Mercantile Trust
Company at its office, No 120 Broadway, in the
City of New York, on or before the first day of
July, 1900.

A large amount of stock has already been pledged
andas soon 4s a substantial majority has been de-
posited application will be made to list such certif-
cates on the New York Stock Exchange.

If the plan to be hereafter adopted by the Committee
is not acceptable to depositing stockholders, or in case
the plan shall not be declared operative, stockholders
may withdraw their stock upon gurrender of their
certificates.

COMMERCIAL.
Faipay, June 1.
There was a marked growth in bullish sent!-
| ment in the speculative community to-day,
that was reflected in a decided improve-
ment in prices, Brokers, a8 & rule, at-
tributed the advance and the larger deal-
ings to the covering of shorts. Operations
of that character were doubtless # factor, but
| certainly were not the only ones. As was the
cape yesterday, the market moved inde-
Pendently of London, Foreign arbitrage
houses traded in a moderate way on
both sides of the account and probably sold a
little more than they bought, Another inter-
eating feature of the market was the compara-
tively smal) dealings in the Industrial group,
and the fact that with the exception of the To-
stocks, pone of them was conspicuous in
the upward movement. Even Sugar Refining,
which led the list in respect to activity, fluo-
tuated within narrow limits and closed at the

same price that it did last night.
The most important and most gratifying de-
velopment of the day was the interest shown in
the railway list. Allof theGranger stocks were
comparatively active and the leading ones
scored uniform net advances of 1% per cent
The heaviest trading was in Chicago, Burling-
ton and Quincy, still St. Paul made a very fair
showing in the matter of activity. Chicagoand
Northwestern jumped up nearly 6 points.
Baltiinore and Ohio issues received attention,
with the result that the common closed 3% and
the preferred 2% per cent. higher than yestpr-
day Union Pacific common, Reading first pre-
ferred, Pennsylvania and New York Central
enjoyed substantial net gains. Atchinson {s-
sues were in demand on expectations that the
preferred tock will be placed ona 5 pear cent.
basis, but the net improvement In them was not
as pronounced as in the stocks previously
named. °

The news that came to hand was not espe-
cially encouraging. Some of the railway traflo
returns reported to-day showed decreases as
compared with a year ago, and advices from
various trunk line points east of Chicago are of
afalling off of several thousand cars a week.
Anumber of industrial plants, particularly in
the iron trade, are being shutdown. On the
other hand, there appears to be a falling off in
the return flow of currency toward this centre,
indicating an improvement in the interior do-
mand for money, and more favorable weather
is reportedin the great staple crop producing
districts of the Northwest. The closing of the
stock market was strong at about the best
prices,

The local movements of money this week are
described by ihe New York News Bureau as
followa: “The known movements of money in
the week ending at the ciose of business yes-
terday show a lighter return flow of cash to
this centre, the gross receipts direct by expres@
agerecating only about as much as the actual
net gain from the interior a week ago, At the
6ime time, all indications point to a further
substantial increase in the cash resources of the
banks this week Government absorptions of
money continue on about the recent scala,
while the disbursements are somewhat lighter
the pension payments showing the falling off
usual about the end of the month. So tar as
may be learned, there has not been as yet an
gain in money from the Alaskan gold fields
or any other outside source and some gold was
avain shipped this week to Canada The move-
ment of gold from the Klondike ts expected
ghortly to set in, but no exact time can be fixed

or this inflow. If the monetary conditions
that prevailed at this time last year are to be
forested this year, money will again begin to

abipped to the interior about the middle of
this month. Last week the smaller banks that
are not on the test list of this bureau and the
Movement of money from the interior by
festetored mail together caused ai gain

In cash to the local banks of abont
ae over the figures indicated by the
ree express shipping and receiving banks,

his week @ fair estimate of this extra gain
would be about $500,000, The regular large
shippers report in the aggregate a gain in cash
this week, on all accounts, of $1,466,600. The
panks this week shipped to the interior direct

¥ OxXproes $1,051,414, and received $3,140,074, a
ain of $2,088,660 on the movement. The banks
font to the New York Sub-Treasurv $222,000. In

previous week the banks received direct by

, & total gain in cash of $3,290,043."
