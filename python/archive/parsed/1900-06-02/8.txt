There was an early decline in cotton owing to disap
pointing news from Liverpool, where the market made
a very lukewarm response to the advance here of
Thursday. Thisencouraged further selling by Liv-
erpool, the South, local operators and the bear inter
esis generally, It was contended that although the
continued rains at the southwest were undoubtedly
unfavorable, atleast in some sections, the weather tn
the cotton belt on the whole was not adverse to crop
conditions but on the contrary was rather favorable
than otherwise, particulariyas the temperature in some
parts haa risen and there is therefore less complaint
of cool mghts. Later on, however, Liverpool rallied
and New York quickly responded, partly because of
heavy buying by Philadelphia interests, the new
ower in the market. A good many covered, too, on
he ground that the heavy rains in Texas could not
{ail to have a damaging effect. and also that there ts
a manifest venaaney te oversell the market, while the
stat!stieal position ls undoubtedly the strongest for
pany years past, A rather dublous outlook In Texas,
which raises about one-third of the crop. ts attracting

MOVE 70 GET IT SHOULD BE MADE
AT ONCE, DALTON SAYS.

The Commissioner Points to Steadily In-
creasing Daily Consumption and Declares
That the Maximam Capacity of Present
Watersheds Will Be Reached in 1906.

Commissioner of Water Supply William
Dalton, in his report to the Mayor for the
quarter ending March 31, again emphasizes the
need of an increased water supply for the city.
The report shows a steady inerease in the water
consumption for the first quarters of 1898, 1800
and 1900, In the report Commissioner Dalton
Sa VR:

“The steady inerease in the datly consump-
tion of water, which has been stated in previous
quarterly and annual reports and in s;ecial
communications, amounting to from 7 to 9 per
cent. of the whole daily average in each sue-
ceeding year, continues unabated, and will, no
doubt, continue as long as the Croton water
system is capable of supplying the increase.
For the past quarter the average daily con-
sumption was:

= i i 1800...... 256,000,000
" s " 1608.... 251,000,000

“At thf® rate of increase in consumption we
will reach the maximum capacity of the Croton,
Bronx and Bryam watersheds in 1906 and ex-
ceed it before the close of that year. In ten
years further the excess of demand and con-
sumption over the capacity of these water-

sheds will be 208,000,000 gallons. Suppuriae
that at this date ali the preliminaries of detailed
surveys of new watersheds, the preparation,
appivval aud filing of detailed maps, the insti-
tution of condemnation proceedings, the prena-
ration of plans for construction, the execution
of contracts and approval of contractors’
sureties were all accomplished and we were
in the position of beginning the work of cone
struction to-morrow, we would still need all of
the time till the close of 1906, all the executive
energy andability that could be commanded,
to build works of 805,000,000 gallons daily capac-
ity. But we are not in that position, Weare
as far from it a3 we hove been at any thre since
Greater New York was established, None of
the preliminary steps enumerated is yet even
authorized

“If all the several branches of the city govern-
ment whose cooperative action is necessary
to set the execution of any planin motion
were toagree upon and authorize the carrying
out of such plan to-morrow we would still
be compelled to lower the efficiency of our
water service for a considerable time after 1906,
for the simple reason that the completion of the
necessary works to assure the present rateof
supply for ten years could not be accomplished
earlier than 1906 or 1009."

Comptroller Coler, when asked what he
thought of Commissioner Dalton’s report, said:
“Ramapo js lifting its head again, The ap-
pearanes of its counsel before the Charter
Revision Commission, and Dalton's cry for more
water coming so closely, tell the story. The

only thing to do tsto pase a constitutional |

amendment exempting the water bond issue
from the debt limit. In the meantime let Mr,
Dalton do something to stop the leakage and
awful waste of water.”

 

PIG TRON SEIZED BY THE SHERIFF.

Charges of Fraud Against the Charlotte Steel
agd Iron Company.

ROCHESTER, June 1.
levied o $5,801.64 worth of pig iron belonging
to the Charlotte Steel and Iron Company at
Charlotte, N. ¥
action brought in the Supreme Court tn Buffalo
by the Old Sterling Iron Company of Buffalo.

The Old Sterling company alleges in {ts com-
jaint that the Charlotte company, through &,

Holden of New York, its Secretary and
Treasurer, falsely and fraudulently, and with
the intent to deceive plalatify, represented that
$75,000 in cash had been set apart for the opera-
tion of defendant's blast furnace, which state-
ment was false and untrue and made solely for
the purpose of inducing the plantiff to extend
credit. All of the men connected with the
Charlotte Steel and Iron Company reside in
New York city.

REAL ESTATE NEWS,

The formal records of doings in realty circles
furnished the interest yesterday and were
more voluminous than they have yet been
this season. The increasing length of the
records leads one to wonder how the market
was considered a very quiet one afew weeks
ago, The transfers and building mortgages
on the Roman Catholic Orphan Asylum prop-
erty furnished the features of interest, although
other interesting transactions in every other
district of the city were by no means scarce.
That agreat deal of building willsoon be going
on ia evident. June is the month when the
suinmer quietness usually hits the market,
but if the ensuing fall bears out the promise
of the last few weeks of this season it will in-
deed be a very lively one. It is very likely,
however, that this will be a late season and
that there will be activity in the market for
several weeks longer than is usually the case
in hot weather, a8 @ recompense for the ap-
parent quietness of the earlier part of the
spring.

Among the transfers on the Fast Side was
that of No. 7 East Seventy-third street to Joseph
Pulitver. An idea of the prices obtained by
the Barney-Sheldon syndicate for the Orphan
Asylum plots may be gained by the figures ap-
pended to some of the transfers, In some
fnstances only nominal sums are given, how-
ever. The main transfer of the day was that
of the property sold to the Union Club en the
northeast corner of Fifty-first street and Fifth
@venue, to which title was taken in the name
of John L. Cadwalader, the lawyer, who repre-
sents the club, and others, Sale of the piece
of property listed at auction yesterday was au-
journed to June s,

Plans were filed by F.C. Zobel, architect, for
an eight-story store and office building, to be
bullt for Catherine Walsh, owner, at 41 West
Twenty-fourth street, at a cost of $15,000; by A.
V. Porter, architect, for improvements, costing
$5,000, to the flat house at 176 East Seventy-
eighth street, owned by Peter McCormack,
and by J. B. Robinson, architect of the Board
of Education, for Imp*ovements, aggregating
$3,00, to the school buildings at Broome and
Sherif streets and at Forty-sixth street, cast
of Third avenue.
