PRINCEOF MELBOURNE WINS

SENSATIONAL FINISH IN THE REAL-
IZATION AT SHEEPSHEAD BAY,

 

Coveted Prise Worth Nearly $15,000 to
Francis D. Beard—Eikbora Captares Sec-
ond Halt of the Double Event for W. C.
whitaey—A Canadian Surprise in Second.

The Coney Island Jockey Club has rarely stood
sponsor for such an eventful day's racing 49 sig-
nalized the close of the Sheephead Bay meeting
yeaterday, It was ushed in by a thunderstorm
which drenched the bie racing enclosure and
incidentally several of the thousands who were
on their way there in open conveyances.

Fortunately for the subsequent enjoyment of

the enthusiasts, they had started for

the rendezvous before the clouds burst and
fuily 12,000 were huddled together in the most
sheltered portions of the grand stand before the
trumpet sounded for the first race. The call,
by the way, came ten minutes after schedule
time, as the rainstorm showed signs of weaken-
{ng and many belated patrons were still on the
road, The clouds melted away seaward after
the first race. leaving a track somewhat sloppy
on top but sound underneath. The rear of the
stand as usual shut off the breeze which fol-
jowed und left the throng at the mercy of old

Humidity, who played havoc with the collars

and cuftsof the men and the dainty summer

finery of the women

‘The magnet which drew the majority was the
historic Realization, @ stake which is generally
regurded as the key to the three-year-old
championship, It ts one of the supreme teste
tests of speed and endurance on the calendar,
the distance being one mile and five fur-
with few opportunities of loafing

longs,
between poles. Only three-year-olds of
the highest class have any chance to @o

through such an ordeal and show up at
the finish and it was gratifying to find seven
such horses ready when the saddling bell rang.
The card showed ten probable starters, but
August Beimont’s Brigadier, W, C. Whitney's
Killashandra, George J, Long's Hindus and G,
BE. Smith's Mayor Gilroy were withdrawn, F,
Gebhard added Lord Baltimore, and long be-
fore bugle call betting of the briskest kind was

the order
The regulars agreed with Francis D. Beard

that his colt Prince of Melbourne had a royal
cbance and he opened at 5 to 2, with Iidrim
next in order at $ tol. H. Eugene Leigh es-
pressed such confidence in the superiority of
bis Belmont winner, however, that Ildrim clos*d
atSto 2, asiight favorite over the Beard candi-
date. Standing ruled a steady third choice at 4
to one and Gulden was well played at7 to 1 by
Owner John E. Madden and his friends. David
Garrick was nibbled at, but Kilogram and the
added starter were ignored.

The start was out of the Futurity course,
four furlongs back from the Judges’ box, and
as the horses paraded quietly from paddock
to barrier there was ample opportunity to look
them over. David Garrick, with Maher on his
back in the cherry and black of Pierre
Lorijiard, looked a trifle on the big side
for such a route, while Standing seemed to
bave only one sound leg to walk

with, When the Candlemas colt broke tntoa

nter, however, these discouraging symptoms

sypeared, Kingston's trim littte son, drum,
satisfied his followers and Prince of Melbourne
moved like the tdeal racing machine. Gulden,
Kilogram and Lord Baltimore attracted little
notice, although the last two had a pull in the
weights, as they afterward demonstrated in the

race.

After the usual skirmishing at the post the
flag fell toafair start and Ptanding promptly
wentto the front. l’assing the stand he led by
alencth, with Kilogram next and David Gar-
riok and Prince of Melbourne in close attend-
ance, Standing continued to show the wa
ground the clubhouse turn and into the ba
tretch with Princ» of Meibourne and Kilogram
Peoging on. Meanwhile Turner on Iidrim seem-
ed content with fifth piece apparently yaner
Pe, Imorwenton that the others would fall in
their tracks, Turning for home the white and
blue of Standing atill caught the eye, but
Iidrim was still waiting, while Spencer took in
perp on Prince of Melbourne and eased him
back Into fifth place, leaving the leaders to
scramble for the rail position.

Immediately the ory went up:
earth Prince js eaten! It is now Kilogram or

nding.

But t @ well-named “Iceman,” Spencer, was
biding his time, and as soon as Iidrim loomed
up with his belated rush Prince of Melbourne
had caught his second wind and was ready for
anything. Standing and Kilogram faded away
when the pinch came, and the race resolved it-
@if into a thrilling duel, in which Spencer
landed Prince of Melbourne half a length in

nt of plucky [ldrim, who beat Kilogram six
lengths. The despised outsider, Lord B

ore, finished fourth after a lively brush with
fogram, Standing and David Garrick, the

‘our being only heads apart at the line.

A truer race has mever been run for the
Realization since it was. founded in 1880 and
Won by the mighty Salvator, with 122 pounds

With 119 pounds up, took 3:51 2-6 to get home in
1902 and Daily America easily eclipsed these

with 2:50 2-5 In 1993, but the Sun-

colt had only to carry 107 pounds.
Dobbins and Bright Phebus gnyoree lein-
urely trips from a time standard in 1804 and

695, but Requital set up anew mark of 2:49 2-5

1808 only to have it wiped out a year later by
The Friar who created the existing record for
the event and course, of 2:48 2-6, but carried
only 115 pounds. Hamburg with 122 pounds up
won in 1804{n 2:81 1-5 and Ethelbert, with 118
pounds on his back took 2:51 2-5 to go the route

t year, An Interesting contrast to these
saures is furnished by the fractional times

én officially yesterday as follows:

Haf-mile, 0:50; five furlongs, 1:03; six furlongs,
1:16 2-5, one mile, 1:42; one mile and an eighth
1:85}4; one mile and 4 quarter, 2:00 1-5; one mile an
bree furlongs, 2:28; full distance, 2:40 4-5.

Owner, brainer and colt were surrounded with
Onthusiasts after the race and the gossip in
clubhouse and paddock was decidedly inter-
esting. As a start off, it was stated that
Owner Beard’s commission amounted to $10,009
but he modestly denied such a heavy plunge. It

known, however, that as a result of some
friendly badinage with Arthur Featherstone
and Kugene Leigh before the race, he offered to
Wager $4,000 that the Prince would beat Ildrim.
The Western pair took the bet, and then Leigh,
{t is suid, offered $1,200 to $1,000 that the

‘amble colt would not win, and was promptly
fake by Mr. Beard, although later on he coul
have secured twice the odds in the ring.

Aside altogether from ciub and ring invest-
Ment, the race was worth $14,725 to the winner,
Bugene Leigh's share amounted to $2,167 and
$1,083 was credited to August Belmont Jor run-
hing third with Kilogram. Spencer's incentive

RACING ON
MAJOR TAYLOR OUTRIDES JAY EATON
IN STRAIGHT HEATS.

 

Another Triumph for the Colored Rider at
Vatisburg—-Floyd McFarland Beats Jimmy
Michael in a Twenty-Mile Paced Contest
at Woodside Park Lake Defeats King.

One more step on the road of Maior Taylor's
ambition “to beat them all” was taken by him
yesterday when he defeated Jay Eaton on the
four-lap board track at Vailsburs, N. J. Tay-
lor’s victory was a decisive one, and after tho
race Eaton,who has always been a board track-
man and a star at match racing, said that he
considered Taylor the best match race rider in
the world. The colored boy was crowded out
of competition with the fast bunch last season,
because he sided with the L. A. W. in the race
control fight, and when he returned this year
he claclared frankly that the greatest ambition
of his life would be to meet the flower of tho
professional ranks, one by one, in match races
and prove himself the faster rider. Last Satur-
day he lowered the colors of the newest and
likeliest aspirant to the championship, Frank
Kramer, who had himself defeated Tom Cooper
the Sunday before.

Eaton had plenty of friends backing him, but
he lost signally. The race was run in heats,
best two in three to decide, and Taylor took two
straight. In the first heat Tayfor trailed be-
hind Faton to the turn into the straight and
then began to let out’ Ho overhauled and
passed Eaton and won at the tape by nearly a
length. In the second heat Taylor caught
Eaton handily, and the pace was ao fast that

near the finish Eaton sat up and Taylor finished
a yard ahead.

The Major did not fare so well ben riding
in a field In the half mile named fdr him. He
chose the outside as the safest place and was
unable in the short straight to catch Kiser who
was sleighriding Cooper. Stevens beat Taylor
for third place by a few inches.

A fiveemile handicap, with prises offered for
the leaders at every lap, made a bruising race
in which the victory of Walthour was well
earned. Kiser's ride from scratch in this and
his (nish in fourth place was a most gallant
one. In the unlimited pursuit race Kodgers,
who won at Manhattan Beach against Ladue,
was the first to quit. Firth, the winner, was a
substitute rider. There were about 4,000 spec-
tators. Summaries

A smart paced race of, ten miles, behin

otor machines, In which Johnny King o
Newark, the amateur who has been hitherto
unbeaten, suffered defeat by John Lake, was
the feature the day at Berkeley Oval yes-
terday, where fully 2,000 spectators, which
is a big attendance for that track, assembled.
The shower delayed the start of the racing
unti] 4 o'clock and then the board track was
so slippery that the novices went down in a
heap at the turns. The contests were rather
dull at the start, but the later events were
snappy and the programme wound up satis-
factorily. Lake began his day's work by
taking the half-mile from, little Walter Smith
in a good finish. Then followed the paced
race of the “has beens,” Titus and Lefferson.
Titus led for the first three miles with Leffer-
son trailing closely. hen it was nip and
tuck for three miles more. In the seventh
mile Titus passed to the front and began to
move too fast for his rival. Ina mile he had
gained fifty perce and this lead he increased
steadily until he won by 400 yards.

In the amateur paced races Lake took the

at the start, Ring and his machine keep-
ng close behind, In the sixth mile the affair
became exciting because of King’s tremendous
efforts to get to the front. For four laps the
were tnaking a neck and neck struggle
hen King lost his pace and fell back forty
yards. He was up close behind again in the
eighth mile and In the ninth he again put forth
every ounce to get the , but his machine
being on the outsddé, had to go too fast for
Bim tn order to accomplish this and King fell
away from his pacnine. He caught on again
and gamely followed to the end. losing the
race by the length of his pacing machine, Sum-

PHILADELPHIA, July 4.—In one of themost
nsational races eyer ridden on the Woodside
Par track, Floyd McFarland defeated Jimmy
ichael this afternoon in a twenty-mile motor
aced contest by 8 yards. Although
PipFariand secured u good lead at the start,
chael being slow to pick up his pacemakers,
the Welsh mideet clung with such bulldog te-
nacity to the big alirorpian's rear wheel, that
the 6,000 spectators were ina frenzy of excite-
ment during the entire twenty miles.
McFarland maintained the lead up to the
twelfth mile, when he was passed by Michael.
It was nip and tuck between thein as they flew
around the traok, the Welshman keeping the
lead until the last lap of the twentieth mile,
when the giant cyclist by aspurt that is very
seldom witnessed on the track, crossed the line
a winner by 3 yards.
Crooks and Shearer made 4 runaway race of
{t in the five- mile motor professional race,
breaking the world’s record by quite a margin.

SAILING IN FLUKY WINDS.

SIXTY*SEVEN YACHTS START IN THE
LARCHMONT'S REGATTA,

 

Sachem Wins the Colt Cup From the Flear de
Lys-A Close Racp Between the Syce, Al-

‘talr and Hussar I1.~J, Rogers Maxwell |
the Hebe Daring a Squall, |

Sixty-seven yachts started in the annual !

regatta of the Larchmont Yacht Club, which
was sailed yesterday on the Sound, Tho races
were very interesting, but a fluky wind rather
spoiled some of the contests from a yachts-
man’s poipt of view. The wind started fn to
blow from the northwest, but it gradually
worked around until at the finish it was almost
south, The Sound was smooth, gentle breezes
made the day comfortable, and the yachts
looked as pretty,as it was possible for them to
do, The Regatta Committee, John F. Lovejoy,
Howard W. Coates and Frank Hardy, were
promptly on hand, and the preparatory signal
was at the advertised time, 11:30 o'clock,

The courses selected were to a mark off Par-
sonage Point, then to a mark off Red Spring
buoy and then home. This was for the larger
boats, The smaller ones sailed over triangles
inside the larger one, With the wind blowing
northwest this made it a reach with booms to
starboard to the first mark. The schooners
of Class B were the first sent off. They were to
race for the Colt cup, in addition to the class
prize. There were two starters, Fred T, Adams's
Sachem and H. R. Walcott’s Fleur de Lys. By
a special arrangement the Sachem had to allow
forty-five seconds to the Fleur de Lys for each
mile sailed, and as the yachts covered 2245
miles, this made the allowance 15 minutes and
18 seconds, The two got away promptly at
1140 o'clock, the Sachem in the lead. On
board of ber were J, V. 8. Oddie, Judge F, M.
Scott, A. B, Jones and Chester C, Munroe,
On tbe reach to the first mark the Sachem in-
creased her lead a little, and continued to draw
away on the broad reach to the mark at the
entrance of Hempstead Harbor, Then it was a
beat home, and the Sachem soon had auch a
lead that the race was not in doubt afterward,
They had to sail over the course twice,

In the next class the Katrina and Latona
raced together, The Katrina led over the
first round, but on the second the Latona got
into @ soft spot and was passed by the Katrina,
the latter winning the race by a little more
than ten minutes. In the emall class for schoon-
ers 8. H. Mason’s new yacht Miladi made her
first: appearance and she sailed against the
Wayward. The Miladi crossed the line first,
but she soon fell astern, The Wayward won
easily, the Miladi giving up before the finish
was reached.

The Minecla was on hand, but as no other
70-footer was in the harbor a special race was
arranged, the Mineola meeting the Astrild,
the Hanan Brothers new yacht. The yachts
were to start after all the others had got away
and when they did come for the line there was
very nearly a foul. The Astrild crossed first
and the Mineola had got the weather position,
but Just as Capt. Wringe tried to send her over
between the Astrild and the committee boat
he saw a small cathoat sailed by W. 8S. Alley
in tho way. He had to choose between the
Astrild and the catboat, and thinking that
the least damage would be done by fouling
the larger boat Just cleared the catboat and

hit the Astrild, but not enough to hurt her
much. The latter gave way when it was seen
that a collisicn was inevitable.

For a time it looked as though things would
be serious. Some of the men on the Astrild
threw themselves flat on the deck, but by skil-
ful handling the two yaohts got clear with
only a scraping. The Mineola had to allow
16 minutes and 16 seconds to the Astrild. As
fur as the Hempstead mark the Astreld held
on to the Herreshoff boat, but then the wind
became light and the Mineola managed to
crawl ahead and had a big lead at the end of
the first round. These boats had to sail three
times around the triangle, and the Mineola
was more than an hour in the lead in the end.
The Astrild had more poor luck uring the
race. The Altair while on the port tack ran
{nto her and carried away a plece of her boom.
The Astrild was able to finish the race, how-

ever. 9
In class K the Altaif sailed her first race
ainst the Syce and the Hussar Il. It was
p and tuck all over the course and in the

end the Syce won with thirty-seven seconds to

spare. On board the Syce were Newberry D.

A Wonderful Performance by John R. Gentry

Lima, July 4.—The world’s half-mile track
record for harness horses was broken this after-
noon by the pacer John R. Gentry, who made
the first mile in 2.06%. It was in a race with Joo
Patchen. The horses got off with Gen-
try to the pole and he kept it all the way.
Patchen never got nearer than a neck, and did
not fall behind farther than half alength. On
the last turn Patohen tried to pass Gentry, and
the race toward the wire was mostexciting. The

80,000 persona who witnessed it cheered excited-
ly. Patchen coulddo no better than get withina
neck of the winner. In the second heat the two
rounds were made in about the same manner,
although Patchen kept closer up and finished a
nose behind, Time, 2:06\.

there were cake walks, exhibitions of
buok and wing dancing and watermelon-eating
Contests, Then some one proposed a game of
craps and three negroes began to play, They
were Joseph Mitohell of 845 Kast 127th
street, William Lucas of 213 West Sixty-third
street and Joseph Stewart of 241 East 1219¢
street.

Mitchell lost almost from the first. Tueas
was the chief winner and pretty soon Mitchel
began to sav things to Lucas that did notim-
prove the latter's temper, Finally Mitohell put
up a stake of $2.50, which he said was the last
money he had. He lost as before, Then he
grabbed the money and started away,

but Stewart, on his fourth shot, brought Lucas
© the ground witha wound in the left breast,
tewart then took Luecas’s pistol away
from him and told the frightened spectators
that they had better send for the police and for

Stewart surrendered to them. tle was taken
