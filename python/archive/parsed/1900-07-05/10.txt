Gill hurled the heavy missile 27 feet 7\4 inches.
In hia anxiety to exceed these figures Clark
encroached onthe ring space ani fouled on

is a cousin of George KR, Gray, holder of the
‘American record for putting the 16-pound shot,
and was born at Coldwater, Ont. Gill is 28
years old, 6 feet 1 inch tall and weighs 165
pounds. The. stamina of the competitors
may be judsed trom the fact that in
ep.te of a five minutes intermission, necessi-
tated by a rainstorm, the programme was
completed in two hours and & half. The
proceedings were enlivened from a spectacular
standpoint by a series of handicap events de-
cided on the track, in which close contests and
fast time were the rule. Swimming events took
place on the bay in the morning, and the eport
ended with a baseball game between the home
team and the New York A.C. Summaries fol-

HOW CURTIS AND ORMEBESR DIED.

Prof. Parker Saye They Might Have Been
Saved if They Bad Turned Back.

The bodies of William B. Curtis and Allan
Ormabee, the two athletes who were frozen to
death on Mount Washington last Saturday, ar-
rived at the Grand Central Depot at 11:35 o'clock
yesterday morning. They were in charge of
Prof. H. C. Parker and F. B. Iigen, members of
the Fresh Air Club, who were on the mountain
when the men died. The party was expected at
8.80 o'clock, and the following members of the
Fresh Air Gub were on hand at that time to re-
ceive the remains of their old comrades:

Montes Y Prot Hallock of Columba Saiversity,
‘0 . . Hal um niver .
Ww. C. Antivns H. C, Wade, Louls Legien,

° e,
Sharp, Be Seaver, Harringto
Prochaska, WC. Taylor snd Robert én

 

utoam, J.
miston.

Allan I. Ormsbee, the father, and Alexander
F. Ormabee, the brother of Allan Ormabee,
were also at the depot when a telegram from
Mr. Igen announced that they would not arrive
for three hours. When the train came in Iigen
and Parker were immediately surrounded by
the group who were in waiting, anxious to.hear
particulars of the manner in which the two in-
trepid olimbers met thelr death. Ormsbee's
father stood bareheaded, and with tears in his
eyes listened to the details recounted by the
survivors of the party. Prof. H. C. Parker of
Columbia University, a slightly built man with
@ nervous manner, who has climbed nearly all
the formidable mountains of the Eastern States
and many in Canoda, said that the story as
published in Tae SUN yesterday of the incidents
{n connection with the sad event was sub-
stantially correct. To a reporter of Tus SuN
he said: :

“We had no feeling of uneasiness regarding
Curtis and Ormsbee. When they did not arrive
at the Summit House as expected on Saturday
night, we believed that they had either aban-
doned the trip on perceiving the storm raging
in the mountain, or turned back after making
the attempt. Two guides went down the moun-
tain that morning and we concluded that they
had met Curtis and Ormsbee and warned them
of the danger in making the ascent in the teeth
of the storm. We afterward heard that this
waaso, but that inspite of the advice the pair
determined to push on.

“As we had no idea that the men had met
with any disaster there was no organizd at-
tempt to succor them. Louis F. Cutter of Win-
cheater, the member of the Appalachian Moun-
tain Club, was simply out for a atroll, when
about two miies down the trail he stumbled on
the body of Mr. Curtis, lying face downward on
the rocky path. There was a cut on his temple,
but otherwise he was not bruised. Mr. Cutter
took a curd out of his pocket and pinned it to
the clothes with the following note:

Monday, July 2, 3900. I found this man about
11:18 A.M. [think he wasdead. Itnink {t fe Mr.
Curtis. Iam going to walk abouta little to find Mr,
Ormsbee and will then return to the Summit

Louis F. CUTTER

“Mr. Cutter was unable to find apy trace of
Ormabee, After peturning he gave the alarm
to the other members of the Appalachian Club.
We immediately started out on a Dorpugh

arch and after hunting In the vicinity of the

mmit for some time I came across the bod
of OUrmabee. He was also lying !ace downward,
and was some distance off the Crawford bridle

th, but was less than a quarter of a milefrom
Phe Summit House, and was evidently making
in @ direct line for the refuge when nature gave

out. His body was covered with bruises, re-
ceived by fallin, and being dashed against the
rooks by the fierce wind. He had no limbs

broken, however, as stated in published reports
of the occurrence

“A stretcher was improvised on which we
carried poor Ormsbee’s remains to the Summit
House, and then went down to the Lake of the
Clouds, where Curtis lay. An examination of
the surroundings showed that the men had out
outashelter in the underbrush, where they
were partially prot from _the elemente by
Mt. Monroe. The cameras which er carried
were placed on the bridle path evidently to a
asa guideto the spot where Curtis stay
while Ormsbee set out ior help. Had they both
stayed there, the fatality would have been
averted, as sandwiches were found in the shelter
sufficient to have kept them until the storm
abated on Monday.”

In reply toa question as to whether the men
could not have turned back and made their wa
to the base of the mountain, Prof. Parker said:

“Yes, I cannot see why they dd not do that
or stay in the shelter until] Monaay."

To this Harry Buermeyer, the life-long friend
of Curtis, who nad little tosay during the sad
recital, replied: "{ can see because I know the
man.” e other members of the Freah Air

ub agreed that the regrettable ending was

ue to the known characteristic of Curtis to

ccomplish any task he set out to do in spite of
a teu ties that would overwhelm younger
stronger men. Prof. Parker, continuing, said;

‘Ordinarily, the Parker bridle path is scale
trail. 1 have been up it doz ns of times, an
have known many women to make the ascent,
but the storm, which listed forty-eight hours on
last Saturday was almost incredible, and sur-
passed anything of the kind thatl have ever
witnessed. The temperature was degrees,
and the velocity of the wind ninéty miles an
hour. It blew so hard that aa panes of glass
were broken !n the Summit House. The last
two miles is the worst part of the journey, as
there is no_ shelter from the woo but
only big boulders and a very rocky path. There
was no snow, but As soon as the rain fell it
froze on the rocks, and in some places the ice
was eighteen Inches thick. Mr. Curtis had left
the shelter and travelled about half a mile be-
fore he succumbed, but no part of this was up-

it. He was about seven miles from the L

oltowing the Crawford path. If in their dee-
perate plight, however, the men had essayed to

‘o hack, might have reached the bottom
fy going 8 ralab down the ravine. in which
case they might se escaped with a few falls.”

F. B. en, who went with Curtis and
Ormsbee on the tour, sald that he left mat
6 v‘clook on Saturday morning as he wished to
make an ascent of the awe Mountains. Th
others took the morning train for the Crawfor

ouse, with the intention of ascending Mount

jillard and then going up the bridie path to
rn the Appalachians at the summi* of Mount

ashington. He said yesterday that he felt no
real anxiety when his companions did not Join
him, as he trusted to their experience as moun-
tain climbers to pull them through, The places
where the men fell were marked with storm
cairns, and it was nearly 6 o'clock on Monday
evening before Curtis's remains arrived at the
Summit House.

The father of Ormabee took charge of his body
on its arrival and it was conveyed to hie resi-
dence at 188 Joralemon street, Brooklyn. The
funeral services will take Riece at the house this
afternoon at & o'clock. The mother of Orms-
bee negatived the idea of polding the funeral
services over both men at the Madison Avenue
Presbyterian Church. She does not feel equal
to a public funeral, and prefers to have the ser-
vice take place at the house in which young
Ormabee was born, The original intention
with regard to Curtis's funeral will be
adhered to and the services conducted
at 10 o'clock t¢-morrow mornin under the di-
rection of the Fresh AirClub. Members of the

Tournament.

Another surprise greeted the players in the
Middle States championsh1p lawn tennis tourna-
ment at Orange yesterday afternoon when
Hall, who beat Larned on Tuesday, was de-
feated in straight sete by Holcomb Ward. It
was a great day for the Harvard contingent,

Ward won from Hali. These t Harvard
experta, with Clothier of PhiladelDhia, who is
outclassed, are left to playin the semi-finals
this afternoon. Davis plays Wright and Ward
meets Clothier. The finais will take place to-
morrow, and the winner, probably Davis, will
face Champion Whitman, another Harvard
crack, for the champlonship.

and fast volieying attack were too much for

Hall, who was falriy carried off his ey in the
first set, and could not recover in #eco

victory over Paret, playing almost perfect ten-
nis, while Stevens found Davis's speed too much
