DOYLE ASSAULTS EMSLIE,

VEKW YORK FIRST BASEMAN KNOCKS
THE UMPIRE DOWN.

 

Both Are Arrested After a Disgracefal Row

lyme Break Even on the Day—Chicago and
Pittsberg Score Dosable Triemphs—Gossip.

The Western teams of the National League
held high carnival yesterday. Of eight games
played New York and Brooklyn were the only

Eastern teams that managed to wina victory

apiece. The Brooklyns, after defeating St

Louls handily !n the morning, were easily white-

washed in the afternoon. The Champions lost |

in percentage, but still have a strong lead of 77
potnts. The New Yorks dropped their twelfth
atraight game at Cincinnati in the morning, but
in the second contest Ewing's tall-enders man-
aged to break their phenomenal losing

etreak. Inoldentally Jack Doyle, first baseman |

of the New Yorks, assaulted Umpire Emalle,
and, after a disgraceful fight upon the field,
both were arrested Doyle, {t will be ed,
is the man who eslugged Umpire Lynch in Boaton
several years ago. The Pittsburgs, who are com-
ing up hill with a great rush just at present,
took both gamea from the Bostons. Tho
Smoky City team may take second place away
from the Philadelphias within the next two or
three days, if not sooner, as they are only two
points behind the Quakers. The Chicagos,
who, like the Pitteburgs, are enjoying a fine
winning spurt, captured two contests from the
Philadelphias, the game tn the afternoon last-
ing twelve innings
vanced beyond the 500 mark und are forty
points behind tho third team, The New Yorks

are still far in the rear, St. Louis leading them |

by ninety-seven points, The results:

CINCINNATI, 8; NEW YORK, 1-—-MORNING GAME.

CinctynaTi, Ohio, guy 4.—The New Yorks
and the Cincinnatis broke even here to-day.
The morning game was a pitchers’ battle for
seven innings and then Cincinnati solved Mercer
and scored six times in the eighth. But for

a muff by Crawford, New York would have
heen shut out. In the second game Hawley,
in spite of uncertain support, did good work

hit the first

after the first inning arrett
In the second

pall pitched for a home run,

inning there was a disgraceful acene in which
Jack Doyle of the New Yorks assaulted Umpire
Emsile. It was in the third Inning and Doyle

was on first with two out. Seott caught Doyle
with a bie lead off first and as the pitcher threw
the ball to Beckley Doyle started for second,
Beckley threw to Corcoran, who ta ged Doyte
as he ran into second, Emalie called Doyle
out. The decisjon did not please the latter,
who remonstrated. He rushed after Emslie
who was walking from second base to the home
priate, but Emslle paid no attention to the abuse
weaped upon him by Doyle. This seemingly
tended to add to the latter's fury, so that he
drew up behind the umpire and bumped him
with his knee in the back. There was so much
force in the bump that Emslie turned angrily
about. It took but a minute for the two to
square off and their arms began to fly. Both
landed several good blows. Doyle, however
had-all the better of it and he soon knocked
the umpire down, Emalie lay on his back
and from the grand stand tt looked as {f Doyle,
who was on top, was trying to choke him. Cor-
coran, Quinn and Steinfeldt pulled Doyle off
the prostrate official and
a y for his arrest. Two policemen climbed
out of the bleachers, collared Doyle and led
him to the bench. Emslie refused to prosecute
Doyle and he was not arrested then, but later
the police decided to arrest both Doyle and
Era fe for disorderly conduct. This was the
only way the police could reach Doyle, since
Emalie refused to prosecute. Dovle then left
the grounds {na cab and soon after he was re-
leased on bond. The acores:

HE LOWERS THE MARK AT THE GAR-
DEN CITY LINKS TO 77.

The Second Round Pas:ea in the Amateur
Champtonship—Hollins, Jr., Pats Shaw Out
—Travis, Harriman, Reid, Jr., Lockwood,
Stuart and Hitchcock Also Survive.

An enthusiastic throng of golfing men and

| women made the links of the Garden City Golf

Club a bright and brilliant scene yesterday, yet
the gathering was not within 1,000 of that at

| Onwentsia at the same event on last Indepen-

dence Day, nor was it as good as the merit of
the gulf deserved. Douglas made a new ama-

| teur record of 77 for the links, three strokes

lower than the mark made by Travis in the
qualifying round, while Harriman, Travis, Hol-
lins and Reid, Jr., won in especially clever atyle,
“Duffers about New York would rather play
poor golf than watch a good match,” sald one
observant critic.

The matches to start this morning represent
an exceptionally strong pairing. The first
players out will be Walter J. Travis, the M. G.
A. champion, who has improved marvellously
on his long game and in putting from the
point he had reached in the last championship,
and Charles Hitchcock, Jr., a college boy who

the firat cup in several open
In 1808 and 1899 Travis was put out of
the championship by Findlay Douglas, but
this time he is notin the same end of the draw,
which may bean augury of success. The seo-

| ond palr will be John Reid, Jr., who shows in
i the brilliancy of his game the benefits of a so-

Journ among the Scotch links, and A. G. Lock-
wood, the English-born player from Boston,

' who has golfed throughout the week witha

placidity that seems to show that he has not as
yet been forced toextend himself. John Stu-
art, the Prinoetonian, will be next out with Find-
lay Douglas, the former champlon, as opponent.
The latter never has been in better trim. The
last pair will be Harry B. Hollins, Jr., who has
been improving inevery successive match and

Herbert M. Harriman, the title-holdef, who has |

shown more reserve force during the tourna-
ment than any of the rest. Taking bis morning
rounds easily, Harriman, no matter how he may

| have been placed, in starting for the afternoon

round has gone at his man in the most dashing
way, and, like the postboy who saves a ‘‘gallop
for the avenue.” he has finished in a most suc-
cessful way. These pairings make a puzzle ex-
tremely hard for the golfing set to solve.

No better day than yesterday could be
fancied for golfing, but if the breeze had not
been a brisk one the weather would have been
excruciatingly hot, There was 4 thunderstorm.

New York Oarsmen Beaten in the People’
Regatta.

PHILADELPHIA, July 4.--The New York oare
men fared rather poorly in the People's Re»
gatta held this afternoon on the Schuylkill
River. The big surprise was in the senior
single shella, when James Juvenal of the Vesper
B. C. beat John Rumohr of the Harlem
Club. The New Yorker took a big lead carly
in the race, but, being pushed by Juvenal,
rowed himself out and was unable to finish.
He seemed to be suffering from a stitch in his
side. He and Nagle did not compete in the
senior doubles. In the race for the Junior
doubles the New York A. C. entry, B. L. Zimm
and J. R. Anderson, broke an oar at the half-
mile mark and did not finish.

A feature of the day was the final heat in the
junior eight-oared shell race It was @ beau
tiful contest between the New York A. ©. and
Passaic River crews for first place and Malta
and Pennsylvania boat clubs crews for ¢hird.
The Passaic oarsmen spurted at the one-mile
mark and won by half a length, the New
Yorkers finishing in an exhausted condition.
The race between the Maltas and Pennsylva-
nians was equally as exciting, the former win-
ning by quarter of a length. Asdell of the
Colursbia club of Pittsburg won the junior
single shells as he pleased.

The Arundel B. C. of Baltimore entered
a crew in the junior four-oared gig race and
finished second after a very pretty and close
