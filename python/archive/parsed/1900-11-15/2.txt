BELIEVES GRANT BROS, WERE INSOL-
VENT WHEN NE WAS TAKEN 1%,

Never Saw Any Profits as Partner-Had His
Expert Goltog Over the Books When the
Other Partcers Signed on Assignment

(ssignee Says Resources Were Depleted.
John 4. Van Sickle of the firm of Grant Bros.,
stock brokers, at 45 Broadway, who made an |
assignment on Monday, authorized his countel, |

Frank Bergen, to mahe at Fiizabeth, N. J.,

last night a statement to the following effect

Ile has been with the flem since 187s, and he-

came a partuer in isv7. He was to receive

$3,000 salary and to per cent. of the profits,

Fe jas never received anything but his salary

Tle believes the firm was insolvent in i807, and

he saya that for a long time it has been losing

its business and securities were be» g withdrawn.

For several months, hesays, the firm has prac-

tieally done no business, The other meanbers

were dis; oved (o pul the blame on his #Loulders
and he resisted the charge. He engaged an

‘expert accountant, Mr. Conant of 141 Broad-

way, who was going over the books and
was at work when the assignment was made. |
The books were found greatiy muddled and had
not been balanced since tsvo No one could
tell the standing of tie firm. Van Sickle says

) that he courts the fullest investigation and that

the examinatlon wiil snow that he is not re-
aponsible for the collapse of the firm but that
{t was all due to the distrust of customers and
the withdrawal of securities. He denies mak-

ting any investments that resulted in heavy
| Josses, As to the charge that he lad disap-

peared, he said he had been back and forward
between Elizabeth and New York dally since
the trouble began George W. Curls, a former
bookkeeper for the firm, had a conference with
Lawyer Bergen to-day and he corroborates
Van Sickle as to the condition of the firm's
books

BE. G, Stedman, assienee of Grant Bros,
had only this to say yesterday about the Causes
of the flrin's iaiure

fhe amount of the asseta and liabilities of
the urm cannot be stated ur til 1 have bad op-
portunity to examine into its affairs and the
schedudes and inventory Lave been prepared,
nor can 1 state the cause of the esalgnment,
beyond the fact that the firm was. indebted
fo an amount greater than It bad the means
to pay, and that the reason therefor appears
to be the recent discovery that its resources
had been depleted in some way, the particulars
of which may be definitely known only. from
therough examination of the fum’s books."

The statement made by the wife of Partner
Van Sickle in Elizabeth on ‘Tuesday night that
the Granta were urying to make a scapegoat
et her husband, was brought to the attention
of the Grants, ‘They bad no comment to make

that Mr. Van Sickle is the nan whom the
Granta hold responsible for their failure there
is no Jonwer @ny doubt. ‘The statement of

/ Mrs. Van Sickle on Tuesday night showed

open hostilities and a well-grounded hettet
in Mrs. Van sickle’s mind that her hushanc
was to be blamed forthe smash up. The gens,
eral be@ef in Wallstreet vesterday waa that
the troubles in the firm would be settled by a
civil suit.

This new attitude is that the genuine worth
of jewelry lies in its artistic excelience, its fine handi-
work and its exclusiveness, and thet the value of

departure from conventional forms and bears the
unmistakable imprint «f the mind and hand of

A cordial invitation is extended to all to inspect
