REY, DR. MILLIS ON CLASS HATRED,

 

He Says the Attempt to Array the Poor
Against the Rich ts a Crime. j
"The Crime of Stirring Ly} Hatred Between
the Rich and Poor” was the subject of the ser.
mon delivered by the Rev. Dr. Newell Dwight
Hillis in Plymouth Church, Brooklyn, last
night. He said, in part
“Since the increase of property means the
{norease of happiness of all classes, men who
love their country and their kind will view
with apprehension and profound alarm th
attempt to array the poor againat the ric
the farmers aguinst the bankers, the manu-
facturers against professional men, the clisses

  
  

  

 

against the masses. The class hatred that pre-
vails in countries where the nereditary Classes
rule has no — excise in this free

land In our country there Is no position
#0 high that the wy fom the forge, the factory
or the farm may not aspire to and achieve it,
The artifiaial nobility of the old nations is an
order fixed and separated from those below,
no matter what their intellectual excellence or
moral culture, But in the republic there is a
natural aristocracy that includes the be't and
the wisest, and any one may Join the nobie class
who chooses to become worthy and wise,

“Midst tistitutions like ours, therefore, the
attempt to stir up hatred and prejudice among

the people ix un-American and vicious, Class
hatred can rear no factories, but it can ruln

to consider that much of the wealth of fleld and

ability, 10ng many men the tmpression
prevails that fabor ilo has produced the
