Twenty-third di-trict is largely Republican andy

been for years past.

‘STATEMENT BY

Mr. Bryan has recently gone into the State

Bryan weeps because Malay assassins are not

white men of Kentucky of their liberty and
yet Mr. Bryan aasents reacily to the | famous
dee!

Not even in Louisiana, Mississippi, Soutt
Carolina and North Caro!ina, where Mr Bryat
party has robbed so many of their ciuzensh

( without their consent, is there to t fo

60 shocking an example of Bryanite Outrage
upon freedom as in Kentucky For in denying
a free ballot and a fair count to the white men
of Kentucky Mr. Bryan's party has destroyed
the very altar Of republican !{berty in that
State AndMr Bryan applauds and hopes
to profit by these atrocious acts of despot
