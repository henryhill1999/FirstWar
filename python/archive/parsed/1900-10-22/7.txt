SITUATION.

 

THE FINANCIAL

 

Fifteen days hence the voters of this nation
will decide the primarily political question of
the election of a President of the United States
to serve for four years, from March 4, 1001,
Incidentally they will also be called upon to
decide a number of other questions bearing
upon their pont foal and material welfare, They
will decide whether the development and expan.

alon of the industrial fabric of the country, which
have been at least ce incident with the Ineum-

f the present Administration shall be en-
larated and perpetu ited or whether the present
nd, economic policies shall be destroyed, and
lng blow administered to the whole indus
mmercial system of the nation. This is
exaggeration of the simple question involved
the fase of the Presidential campaign. Few
nt persons will pretend that the general
erty and development of the past four
were the direct result solely of the elec ton

ipts at the Pacific coast from Australia,

eavy domestic production of the metal ts
together overlooked. All {n all, it would ap-
ear that the country’s gold supply, by reason
the home production and itmportations at
hoth coasts, will beincreased by filly $100,000,000

conservatively estimated that with the resump-
tlon of gold-mining operations in the Trana-
vaal, under the new conditions which will pre
vall under British political administration, the
itput of the mines will, within the course of a
twa.vemonth, be practically doubled. Not

ip source of supply be again open, but
(reat Britain will be able to reduce her enorm-
ous military expenditures on account of the

A working balance appears to have been
struck between the local money market and

Io other words, trade is awaiting only the drop
