PEACE AMONG RAILROADS.

 

WESTERN ROADS COMING TOGETHER
AS THE EASTERN ROADS HAVE COME.

 

Plans Now Developing Point to a “Commu-
nity of Ownership” West of Chicago and
“$t. Louis—A Restraining Hand Laid on the
Chicago, Burlington and Quincy, Which
Sought a New Oatlet to the Pacific.

An apparent shifting of stock interest in the
Chicago, Burlington and Quincy is causing much
talk. Some railroad men believe that Union
Paciflo interests are absorbing the Burlington;
others say that the Pennsylvania Railroad Is se-
curing control, and many, accepting the assur-
ance of Burlington's chief officers, belleve that
Burlington is destined to maintain its indepen-
denoe, but that both the Union Pacific and the
Pennsylvania will buve a voice in its manage-
ment as large stock holders.

Current eventa show clearly that the rall-
roads weat of Chicago and St. Louls are coming
closer together in interest and in actual con-
trol, in a manner similar to that which has

developed in trunk line territory under the
guidance of the Vanderbilt-Morgan-Pennsy!-
vania combination, Ali of the transcontinental
Mnes and their Chicago connections have tacitly

reed to avoid any clashing that may lead to
ower of rates. In order to get there lines into
shape so that they could be kept from fighting
cach other there has been asteady concentra-
tion of control within the past three or four
years. To-day half a dozen men practically
control the situation and comparatively little
talk is heard of aggressive rivalries.

The Burlington, in its independence, has
been seeking an outlet to the Pacific coast
Owners of the other transcontinental lines take
the ground that there js not sufficient business
for another road to the Pacific and arestraining
hand is laid on the ainbitious Burlington and it
8 being brought into line with the other roads
in {t4 territory on the “community of owner-
ship” plan, The syndicate which controls the
Union Pacific is credited with having, bought a
large amount of Burlington stock. he Penn-
sylvania Railroad, which has had a close trafic
contract with Burlington west of Chicago for
several years, js also sald to have become @
Jargo stockholder The Union Paciflo and
Pennsylvania interests are said to have gone
into Burlington just as the Pennsylvania and
Morgan interests went into Baltimore and Ohio
—to insure unity of action and not to obtain
hysical control : i
’ According to general report the Vanderbilt

organ interest which is still a factor in Union

Pacific affairsis exerting an influence in. favor
of the “community of ownership” plan, If such
is the fact it embodies an assurance that the in-
terests of the Chicago and North-Western, a rival
of the Burlington, will be protected, for the Van-
derbilt, influence is dominant in. Chicago
and Northwestern. The President of one of
the principal transcontinental lines is) au-
thority for the statement that there is to

no warring between the railroads west
of Chicago and St Lous. The plans for
concentration of control, be intimates, are nearly
completed, and nitimately the Western railroad
interests will be heli in compact form by
groups. The Great Northern and Northern Pa-
cifle have apparently buried the hatchet per-
manently Phe Union Pacifie is to be the
nucleus of a vast and harmonious system; the
Southern Pactfic and the Atchison are planning
to join ina friendly spiritin new constructions,
and the Missouri Pacific, the St. Louis South-
western, the Missouri, Kansas and Texas and
other subordinate lines in the Southwest are
gradually uniting in a “community of owner-
ship.”*

NEW SUGAR COMPANY ORGANIZES,

Its Stock Is for Sale-Mr. Havemeyer Says He
Hopes It Will Do Well.

The organization of the new National Sugar
Refining Company of New Jersey, which con-
trols the National, Molleuhauer and Doscher
refineries, was completed at a meeting held
at the law office of Corbin & Corbin in Jersey
City yesterday. The company’s capital ts §20,-
000,000, divided equally between 6 per cent.
cumulative preferred stock and common stock.
James H. Post, of B. H. Howell, Son & Co,
was elected President of the company, F. D.
Mollenhauer Vice-President and Treasurer, and
H. D. Corey, Secretary. Besides the officers the
directors are: Claus Doscher, F. H. Howell,
George R. Bunker and H. F. Mollenhauer.
After the meeting the compuny’'s final incorpor-
ation papers were filed. The planta of the
company in Yonkers, Brooklyn and Manhat-
tan, will be started up at once to their full cap-
acity. Some of them have been shut down
temporarily. President Post said in reply to a
question regarding the reported interest of
it. O. Havemeyer, President of the American
Sugar Refining Compary, in the new company:

he stock is for sale. It has not been tied

up so that those who haye taken it cannot dis-
se of it. The Arbuckles may buy or the
ockefellers, if they wish it, und if those who
ave it choose to sell, 1 don’t think, however
sat they will choose to sell to any extent;

Ink the stock was taken generally to keep.”

President Hawemeyer of the American Com-
pany, when agked yesterday if he had any state-
ment to make concerning the new company,
or relatiy® to the sugar situation, said:

“No have no statement to make, The
new, gomp: does not concern me. I have
obtained my information of its formation from
the papers. Three independent refineries have
been bought outright by B. H. Howell, Son &
Co. It is a reputable firm and a wealthy firm
and is composed of good business men. ft

ope they'll do well. ‘The advances in sugar

ave nothing to do with the new company.
This isthe busy season in our trade; activity
will continue until November. Our board de-
cided that this was our time to make money.
So it raised the price of the product, and we are
going to make money--not too much—but we
are entitled to a fair profit, and it looks as if we
were golng to get it.”

BK. & 0. Dividend Ramors,

Renewed strength has been infused into Ralti-
more and Ohio Railroad stock in the Stock Ex-
change within the past few days by rumors
that the directors were likely to declare a divi-
dend on the common stock at the rate of 5 per
cent, These rumors are based largely upon the
personal statements of some of the B. & O
directors that the road would earn about 13 per
cent, on its common stock this year. There is
however, a determined sentiment in the board
against declaring any dividend on the common
stock at present. The betterment expenditures
of the Baltimore and Ohjo, according to present
plans, will amount to several willions of dollars
a year for the next five years

Brooklyn Bankrupts.

David Cohen, a merchant, of 54 Thatford
street, yesterday filed a petition in bankruptcy
in the United States Court in Brooklyn, The
Mabilities are given as $359,887.50 and the assets
at $16,080, 50.

Leo Ehriich, a builder of Bath Beach, has
also failed with liabilities of $39,917.63 and as-
seta, which are mostiy bad debts, scheduled as

$59,706.61.

Albert 8. Stevens, a tobacco dealer of 254
Clermont avenue, has failed, with $9,511.68 in
Habilities and $2,673.55 assets.

a few of the specialties were also exceptions to

SATURDAY, June 2.
As is usually the case at the end of a week in
which the speculative community has indulged
in bullish sentiment, there was to-day a dispo-
sition to take profits on recent speculative
ventures, ‘The profit-taking disclosed the fact
that, with the demand for stocks to cover short
contracts pretty well satistied, there is not
much support from other sources. The pool in
Baltimore and Ohio common appeared to be un-
disturbed by these circumstances and, in conse-
quence, that stock closed nearly two points
There was also some
buying of Southern Pacific on the publication of
au interview with the President of the com-
that a dividend might

 

 

 

good showing for this season of the year. The
improvement in values on the Stock Exchange
this week has been chiefly due to the cessation
of liquidation and apprehension on the part of
the short interest because of the fact first men-
tloned A more hopeful feeling has been
created by the successes of the British forces
in South Africa, by the developments in the
sugar-refining industry, by the acquisition by
the Consolidated Gas Company of its last re-
maining competitor, the Standard Company,
and by more favorable crop weather in the
West, Itis to be noted, however, that all of
these events, several of which are of the first
importance, have notstimulated speculation be-
yond the circle of professional operators. The
publie still holds aloof from the market, except
that the low rates for money and its steady
accumulation at this centre induce some buy-
{ng of both bonds and stocks of the highest
class

The defeat of the anti-trust movement in
Congress yesterday had no effect upon specula-
tion, because the purely political character of
the measure was thoroughly understood. The
Street is now watching railway trafflo returns,
bank clearauoes and trade reports, particularly
the last named, with the view of determining
when the readjustment in prices and the re-
action in business shall have run their course.
At the moment views as to the condition of the
fron and steel industry are somewhat more en-
couraging, though prices are still being shaded
and mills closed. It appears that orders are
being booked at concessions which are satisfac-
tory to producers and manufacturers and, ob-
viously, when a sufficient number of orders
have been secured to employ the fortunate
concerns obtaining them for some months to
come, an improvement in the industry will be
formally admitted,

But no matter how favorable trade and crop
developments may be during the next few
months, the fact remains that the country gen-
erally, and Wall Street in particular, is bound to
proceed with caution in the conduct of their
affairs on account of the Presidential campaign,
Confidence that the present administration of
national affairs will be supported and con-
tinued, though exceedingly strong {n many
quarters, !s not likely to, prove sufficient to
overcome the timidity and prejudice begotten
of precedent.

As compared with the final prices of last Sat-
urday the entire list is higher.
