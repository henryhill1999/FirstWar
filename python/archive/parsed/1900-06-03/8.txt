TROUBLE OVER RAIN CHECKS AT THE POLO
GROUNDS,

There was no ball game between the New
York and Cincinnati clubs at the Polo Grounds
yesterday afternoon as rain which began to
fall a few minutes before the scheduled time
for the contest Ww siart svon pul au eu Ww au
thoughts of a battle on the diamond, The
atternvon being & half holiday there
erowd of about 3,000 persons on hand to see
the sport. They all received “rain checks”
as they entered the grounds on which was
srinted a notice that in case of rain falling

fore four and a half innings were played the
checks would entitle the hoiderg to admission
for the next gaine at the Polo Grounds, This
was not satisfactory to @ part of the crowd
which {s not able to attend the games on the
Polo Grounds except on Saturday afternoons,
The checks would be worthless to them if @
game were played any time between now and
nest saturday, As Lhere was hot even an at-
tempt to play yesterday's game they thought
they ought to get their money bark, or at least
receive a check entitling them 'to admission
next Saturday, After waiting thirty minutes
or the rain to stop the officials formally declared

ne Rae postponed and then about two hun-
ed and fifty of the spectators went Lo the main
office of the Polo Grounds to see what could be
done about the rain checks, They found a
squad of policemen barring their way, They
could not get within twenty feet of the office
and received no satisfaction from either the
police or the employees of the grounds. The
crowd was very orderly and simply demanded
astatement from the club officials on what they
proposed to do about it. They received no
answer, and finally Richard Siche
hant of 172 Water street, who was one of
those who had requested a statement from the
ficials, addrea-ed the crowd. He asked if
fra or «ix business men in the party would give

im their oards, for the Dur pose of standing
together and making a legal tight on the ques-
tion, After five or six men had responded
he told the crowd they might as well disperse
as there was nothing to be gained by waiting
around any longer. He went away and shortly
afterward the management decided to notify
those who remained that the rain checks would
be good any day this season. Mr. Sichel was
Not aware of this action. He told Tas ScN

porter before he left that one of the men who
ad volunteered to see what could be done in &
egal wa woe Clarence W. Clark of 74 Wal
street. The cinnati team made 4 ludicrous
@ppearance on the field. A recent in Cin-
elnnat destroyed all their uniforms and they
ave had to borrow baseball clothing from
members of other teams.

RAIN STOPS THE BROOKLYN GAMF

Rain fell 1, torrents during the last half of

e fourth inning of the game between the
rook and Chicagos at Washington Park
yesterday pieracen and the contest had to be
poandened The Brooklyns had scored one run
n the third on Jones'ssingle to centre, Keeler’s
sacrifice, a base on bails to Jennings, Jones's
steal of third and his slide to the pate when
Jennings went down to second. In the last
half of the fourth the Chicagos oame very near
to tying the score to say noshing of winning
the game. MoCormick led off with a line drive
to right for a base. He was forced at second
by Bradley, but the latter took third on Dona-
hue’s liner to right, the batter taking second on
the attempt to catch Bradley at third With
onlyone out and men op pecend and third things
looked rosy for the Chicagos when suddenly
the rain poured down, putting en end to the
contest. MeGinnity and Farrell for Brooklyn
and Callahan and Donahue for Chicago were
the batteries,

PHILADELPHIA, 8; PITTSBURG, 3.

PHILADELPHIA June 2.—Philadelphia easily de
feaied Pittsburg this afternoon in a game ,which was
chiefly notloeable for the Fablan tactics of the visttors,
Who, toavert defeat, ‘played for rain.” At the end
of the fourth Inning time wascalled To make ita
legal game tt was only necessary to retire three of the

Pitisburgers. President Dreyfuss and Secretary Pul-
Nam ordered Clarke to hasten the game to a conclusion
Dut Clarke declared that hr was manager of the team
and would do as be saw fit. The rain ceased fora
while, and play was resumed, but immediately after

YALE.
Wins the Baseball Game at New Haves by @
Score of ® to 3.

New Haven, June 2,--Princeton outbatted
and outplayed Yale in a long, slow game this

PRINCETON OUTPLAYS

 

result was a big surprise. The story
is briefly told, Robertson, the Yale pitcher,
held out for seven innings. Then he weakened.
The Tiers were waiting for this chance. They
hammered out three runs in the eighth and two
inthe ninth. Yale began to make errors and
every time she made a slip Princeton scored a
run. Capt. Hillebrand by superb batting added

reatly to the work of his team, Hekept Ralph
Hutehinecs, the hyrdler, away from third base
because he went off to the Cornell track games
and afterward took two days off.

Cunha, the big Hawaiian, whoae friends have
been demandi g that he be put behind the bat
for Yale, got into the game in the seventh
Inning. Sharpe, at first base, played the best
game for Yale. Capt. Camp made an. error
that marred what would otherwise have been a
splendid record. There was a big crowd
Present and a lot of old-'ime enthusiasm. The

ale band bape up a continuous programme
and led the singing of all the songs that Yale
has ever known. Finally Princeton's turn

| came and a little bunch of ‘Teers began to sing:
| O Yale, O Yale, how we hear the Fli's wail!

  

 

| Pringeton played a steady game. Every
error that Yale made was singularly costly.
| The Tigera never losta chance toscore. Yale
| lost many use she had no man who could
hit the ball at critical moments. The score:

| Directors Will Decide To-day Whether to Go
Oa or Disband.

'  Winxrs-Barrg, June 2.~ The life or death of
the Atlantic League is to be decided at a meet-
ing of the directors at Allentown to-morrow An
effort is being made to keep the leagueon its
feet, Newark and Jersey City broke up early

| in the week, and the Athletics of Phila-

| delphia lost five of their best players
the other day because salaries were not paid
| Their places were taken, however, by men
whom the Athletios had farmed. This is la
direct violation of the league rulea To-day
| Reading dropped out. Wilkes-Barre, Scranton,
Elmira and Allentown remain and all of these
| clubs are on fairly firm footing. Wilkes-Barre
will release three men to-morrow and reduce
| expenses, Scranton will out down its salary

Mst, which ts above the league limit and El-
nira will be kept up largely by love of the

| game there and subscrip ons of its citizens,

| Allentown, with Biuly Sharshig at the helm, is

' able to go on.

| .The plan of reorganization is te give cranton
the pennant of the games played in ort
race of a month, and add to Scranton, Wilkes-

| Barre, ira and Allentown clubs at Harris-

| burg and Lancaster. Harrisburg would like its
cholce of the defunct Newark and Jersey City
pave. Lancaster is notso anxious, but {t is
oped to transfer the Athletics there and
oweng bop them. Itis so hoped to place clubs

tailed schedule. but the league will not mind
that If ter and Harrisburg can be
secured to-morrow a new schedule will be ar-
ranged at once,

The prospecta, shorn of the rosy hopes of th
enthusias‘s, are thatthe new ement wil
not last until acter. e Fourth of July. The at-
tendance throughout the circuit has been poor,

Brooklyn Road Horses Agatn Beat the Speed

The second matinee of the season at the

pretty half-mile track at Parkway was held

 

 

1¢ There or at Brooklyn oa Account of afternoon, the score being 9 to 8. For Yale the | yesterday afternoon, and, despite the +ide

attraction at Gravesend and the heat and
| threatening clouds, it was largely attended,
The Michsel Reid cup race for 2:15 pacers was
| not decided, owing to the fact that only two

entries were received Later Mr. Reid will

offer the beautiful trophy when it is bo ed

there may be sufficient entries to render its

competition a feature of the local wagon racing
| geas in.

As heretofore Brooklyn horses and horsemen
were in evidence, and the Speedway contingent got
the dust, The contest for the Dariel cup resulted
| in two remarkably fast half-mile heats by the

winner, Daphne Dallas, 2:15%4, belonging to J.
! F. Dingee. She paced the closing heat in 1:063;,
hard pushed by the Manhatian pacer, Sir Eld,

2:14. In the early part of the afternoon Eld
| wassore, unsteady and far from being 4 factor, but
| once he got his legs under him he created not 4
| ttle enthusiasm by his close finish, carrying the
Quartermaster mare to the last ounce of her
| capacity. Senator McCarty’s fast pacer Tobog-
gan, 2:08%, that has been in training all the

season at Parkway Farm at Goshen, started,
driven by his owner. Many fancied his chances,

but he overpaced himself at the quarter pole each
trip and got little chance to get to the winner.

| The big Speedway pacer Jack, 2:12, was not 4
etarter,

As was expected, ex-Sheriff F. D. Creamer's
big bay gelding Latitude, 2:15, easily won the
cernwar Club's cup for trotters, and alter he

ad trotted the last heat in 1:08% Mr, Creamer

| drove the mile out in 2:10%. The big chap
tired at the end somewhat and toed his tal
when the whip touched his back. Neverthelessl
{t wae anmewhat remarkable, inaamuch as the
driver we ghis 220p: unds the wagon was not any

CHICAGO, June 2.—Miss Bennett, the crack two»

start around Chicago at the Hawthorne track to-day
and was easily defeated by Fancywood, an ordinary
filly, whose price was 30 to 1. It ts said Miss
Bennett was sbort, but with a few exceptions the
Southern horses have not been able to win here,
This upset was the feature of the racing. The
rincipal event of the afternoon was the Speculation
Blakes, value $2,000 There were Six starters, of
which Pat Dunne’s Alcedo, 8, by Hesper—Flopement,
was much the best. He won easily from Sam Fullen
and Larkspur. His Excellency, Charles Head
Smith's $10,..00 colt, made his first start here tn the
fifth race. a handicap. He demonstrated his class by
defeaung Eva Hice and oon Roger with the greatest
ease. Garry Hermann, probably the best two year-
