HARLEM’S FINE REGATTA.

—

SURPRISES AND CLOSE FINISHES
FOR THE OARSMEN.

 

 

A Sculler’s Shell Capsizes and « Four-Oared
Barge From Philadelphia Is Broken Cleaa
im the Middle by the Swell From the ofr-
fctal Boat—Vespers Win the Eights.

First-class oarsmen, spirited racing, close fin-
fghes and many surprises combined to make
the thirty-fourth annual regatta of the Harlem
Regatta Association, held yesterday, one of
the most successful in the history of the or-
ganization. Even the rain, which fell plenti-
fully in the afternoon, had no bad effect on the
sport, though it played havoo with the spring
oostumes worn by the women, who made upa
large proportion of the crowd that filled the
club baloontes, bridges and other vantage
points along the course.

The Harlem Rowing Club secured the lion's
share of the banners and four of the coveted
gflken trophies will adorn the walls of {ts boat
house. The Vesper eight which came from

 

Philadelphia to Passaic on Memorial Day
with a big reputation and won the
mile and a half race, emphasized the

victory by an even more decisive win over the
milo course fromm Central Bridge to Gates’s lum-
ber yard which was used for all the contests ex-
cept the one-fourth mile dash, In addition to
the Bohemians and New York A. ©. crews
the Vespers defeated a strong eight from the
Harlem Rowing Club, and the second ‘Varsity
crew of Columbia. The latter was hopelessly
beaten.

The surprise of the day was the defeat lof
Rumobr and Nagle, the Harlem R. C. double,
by Juvenal and Hedley of the Vespers. It was
@ complete reversal of form, as the Harlem
double, which won with ease at Passaic, was
completely outrowed and beaten nearly two
lengths.

Although the water was rough at times there
were only two accidents during the day and
neither was due to the elements alone. Max
Hireoh’s shell capsized in the trial heat of
the junior single through a defective rowlock,
while the Pennsy!vania Barge Club four-oared
barge was broken clean in the middle by the
swel) from the official boat as the crew was
paddling to the start. The Philadelphians were
more grieved at the loss of the boat than the
loss of the race which it involved. They had a
sentimental feeling for the shell, as it had car-
ried their four-oared crew to victory three
times in succeasion for the National Regat‘a.

There was no race for the intermediate
doubles, as the Nassaus, the only crew entered,
declined to row over and receive the prizes
without meeting any one in their class,

In the final neat of the junior single sculls, J.
Nial of the Laureate B.C. of Troy, fouled
Hennen of the New York A.C, The boats were
not damaged, and In the subsequent race Nial
proved far the better sculler, but he lost pre-
mier honors on the technicality, The New York
A. C. scored a brilliant victory In the centipede
race, 4 spectacular event that has not been in-
cluded in regatta programmes for fifteen years.

Cricket.

The rain of yesterday afternoon spotled all local
cricket, not a game being brought to a satisfactory
result, The feature of the day was the opening cham-
plonsh!p contest of the Metropolitan League between
Livingston and Montclair at Staten Island The
Montelairs played a well out-cricket and had six of
thetr opponents’ wickets down for 111 runs when play
had to cease. M. R. Cobb played a good inning of
39 for Livingston, but outside of H. E. Jackson not

one of the other men could make any stand against
the bowling of A. Backus and R. U, Delapenh

The Manhattan and New York clubs played a draw
at Prospect Park. The New Yorks finished one
inning and were disposed of for 56 runs. C. Byers,
who contributed 16, was the only one to obtain dou-
ble figurea A. Cleaver, A. Smedicy and W. Adam
bowled effectively for Manhattan, the latter particu-
larly distinguishing himself by taking three wickets
for no _ runs

The Kings County Club alao began a champion-
ship match of the New York Cricket Association at
Prospect Park. It had the Nelaon Lodge team os an
opponent. The former had put on 53 for 4 wickets
ren the rain came. George Williams and J. E,
Mordaunt each scored 20 runs, but there were no
other double figures.

The Brooklyn Club made 4 good start in ite cham-
plonship game of the New York Cricket Association
at Prospect Park against Kearney, and had put on
49 runs for the loss of three wickets when the rain
interfered with further play. F. A. Pirle batted
well for 25, and G. C. Boxtll added 17 not out

The second eleven of the Manhattans began a game
with the second eleven of Nelson Lodge and the aecond
eleven of Brooklyn began a game with the Carib-
beans, but vile play had taken place before hostili-
ties were declared of} owing to the downpour,

PATERSON, June 2.—The cricket match to-day at
Feast Side Park between team A and team B of the
Paterson club was declared a draw, the former having
one man to Go to bat when time was called. The rain
that fell almost continuously during the afternoon
did not disturb the cricketers. The score was 89 to 63
in favor of team B.

on the Pennsylvania yesterday. He oes to take part

in the shooting tournament at Dresden and later in
the marksmanship contest at the Paris Exposition,
