Parent Road to Operate the Southwestern
Branch—Improvements Contemplated,

Bartimore, Md, April 13,—Positive state-

ments were made to-day that the Baltimore |

and Obio Railroad Company would begin oper-
ating the Baltimore and Ohto suthwestern on
July 1, [tis understood that all arrangements

have been completed for the formal transferof |

the property to the Baltimore and Ohio on that

vo. The agreement, it was learned, was
partly renchedon Monday last, when President
(owen and Chairman of the Board Salomon of
the Baltimore and Ohio and President Bacon
the Baltimore aud Ohio Southwestern went
over the Pittsburg aod Western ona tour of tne
spection and was closed at the conference held
»p Ualtimore on Wednesday last,

Mr William M. Greene, Vice-President and |

general manager of the Baltimore and Ohio

Southwestern, willcontinue in the service of |

t mpany, probably tn the capacity of Third
Vice-President, which oftive will be espectally
sated for him, He will have charge of the
ratiog und traMic departments of the Balti
»and Ohio Southwestern, whien will be
known as the Southwestern division of the
Baltimore and Objo, and will continue his
headquarters at Cipeinnatl,

Bide for finprovements on the Baltimore and
Onio Ratiroad Company, estimated to cost be-
heen 32,000,000 and $3,000,000, will be opened
to-morrow or early next week,

One of the most important improvements
provided for is a cut-off at Mount Airy, to avoid
the heavy grade there. This will require
building of about ten miles of new road,

iding Several tunnels, and will enable the
company to increase its train loads anywhere
from 12to 20 per cent., besides obviating the
peceasity Of using “helping engines.” Over
$1,000,000 will be expended on this work

Other extensive improvements are contem-
pated and the management expects to have
them wall under way by the advent of sum-
mer.

he sum of $25,000,000 has been set aside
for the purpose of carrying out the work
planned.
