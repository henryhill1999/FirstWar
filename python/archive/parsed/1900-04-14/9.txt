Fur Storage

and the repairing of

Furs and Fur Garments.

When you are ready to have the
Furs, or the Fur-lined Garments, put
away forthe season, say the word and
we will send for them, keep them safe
from moths or hurt of any kind, Insure
them against fire, and return them when
you wish,

If there is Remodeling or Renovat-
ing of any kind to be done the Spring
and Summer months are very favor-
able for it, and the cost will be much
less than if you wait until the rush-time
comes; especially as the price of Skins
is advancing.

A GIFT-HINT—SIMPLICITY.

A point to fastidious tastes and slender
purses,

Asimple piece of furniture, if carefully
constructed, and of subtle contour, is an
aristocrat, "Frequent! y, in real grace and
elegance, it will excel an ornamental piece
of many times its cost.

Such aristocrats are here “in alle their

moste pride.” Variations of Colonial and
Old English shapes are especially pleasing.
Tea tables, almost Grecian in their sim-
plicity, froin $9.00, Dainty tea trays from
$10.50; quaint hanging cabinets for re-
serve cups and Baucers—these are merely
hints for tea-lovers, ‘There are kindred de-
lights for all lovers, at factory prices, as
