Eleven Men Contest for the Trophy Pro-
sented to the Club by Robert A. Welch
‘Duryea Leads Up to the Eleventh
Round ~ Mias-and-Out Competitions,

Robert A. Welch gave a handsome piece of
ellver to the Carteret Gun Club which was shot
for yeatorday. The conditions were twenty-
five birds, handicap rise, $25 entrance. Dr. F,
C. Wilson won after a tie with D, J. Jobnaton,
Each killed twenty-three birds and in the shoot-
off Johnston missed his third bird. Dr. Wilson
comes from Savannah, and it te only recently
that he has developed intoa pigeon shot, He
was one of the Georgia team that competed at
Sea Girt last year and ha won the rifle cham.
plonship and the Wimbledon cup. Last
December he tried his hand at pigeon shooting
and did ao well that he thought he would come
to this section to see what he could do with the
cracks. He ebot in his first sweepetakes wo
week ago last Saturday and has improved #0
rapidly that he will hereafter be on the thirty-
yard mark, the Shooting Committee at Carteret
placing that handicap upon him after be had
won the cup yesterday. He made a run of
forty-six straight.

Charles A. Stanley of Cleveland aleo took
part in the competition. As usual, he won
several small eventa, but that was all. Staniey
has been trying to win a cup during the few
weeks he has been here in order to show his
friends at home a prize. There were eleven
shootors yesterday forthe trophy, which was
named the Good Friday cup. At the end of
the fifth round Duryea and Johnston were the
only ones with straight kills, ene aixth
round was disastrous. MeAlpin, dey, Dr.
Wilson, George, Stanley and Johnston all lost
their birds and each one dropped dead out of
bounds, This left Duryea with the only
straight score, Duryea kept the lead without
missing until the eleventh round, when he
drew a twisting driver which got away un-
harined. In spite of this miss he still
led MoAlpin, Dr. Wilson, and. Johnston
were next with two misses each, In the
nineteenth round Duryea lost a left quarterer,
which made him a tie for first place with Dr.
Wileon and Johnston, Edey, George, E.lison,
Smith Chapin and Atkins dropped out when
they saw that they stood no chance to win,
with the privilege of shooting up, In the
twenty-trst round Duryea drew a blue driver,
He hit it hard and It fell to the ground, but
when the dog went to retrieve it the bird
gained a littl: strength and managed to got
over the boundary. Dr. Wilson and Johnston
went out with twenty-three kills. each and di-
vided the stakes. They shot off for the cup,
and Johnston lost. hia. third. bird, @ right
driver, This made Dr. Wilson the winner:

Several handicap miss aud outs were de-
cided. The first was divided between Dr,

Wilson, Stanley and McAipin after they had
killed thirteen. Dr. Wilson later in the after-

noon won another cup, killing six straight

W. G. SUMNER, LL.D.,

Professor of Political and Social Science at Yale Uni-
versity, contributes a striking article to The Evening
Post of to-day on

“The First Decision Under

Expansion.”

The time has come, he argues, now that a definite
step has been taken under the new policy, for examina-
tion and criticism. He points out that the Spanish
war once started, its advocates and opponents were
equally powerless to control the outcome. Prof, Sum-
ner continues with an able and interesting discussion of
the conflict between expansion and the tariff, He pre-
dicts that national vanity will demand the retention of
Cuba and the Philippines.

ROWING.

Newell Senior Eight Defeats Four Other
Harvard Crews on Charles River.

Camparpak, April 13.—The most closely con-
tested class races ever held on a Harvard water
course were rowed on the Charles River shortly
before lL o'clock this afternoon by the crews
selected as 4 result of the inter-club regatta oa
Monday last. Both the Weld and Newell sopho-
ore crews were allowed in the rave owing tu
the breakdown in the preliminary event. The
result was a great victory for the newly organ-
ized Newell club over {ts older rival, the Weld, |
The Newell senior crew won after a hard race
by a boat length and athird fromthe Newell
Juniors, who finished a half length ahead of the
Weld Law school crew. The Wold sophomores
were fourth and the Newel! sophomores last.

The crews were neck and neck for the first
half of the course, After shooting the Har-
vard bridge the seniors galned atrifle and in-
creased it by inches, ending with a beautiful

body work shows the greatest {mprovement
and something like amoothness ie being art-
tained, They are pitted against the Varsity
boats constantly in match races, and as a rule
hive held thefr own in good style

The spring regatta has been postponed until
Monday so as not to confiiet with the baseball
and lacrosse gaines, Dr, Peat expressed him-
self unreservedly yesterday to the elfect that
Coluinbia had a better chance to turn out a
winning crew than in many vears past

Theeraisin rowlog matters at the univer.

OUR GENTLEMEN'S SADDLES

Are made to accommodate peculiarities
of the rider, and not what is generally
done, where the rider ts compelled to sit
only as the saddle allows. In other words
| we fit our saddle to the man, having
everything to conform with his shape,
weight and stature. In that way a ride
is made comfortable and secure.
We carry a large variety of Bridles—
