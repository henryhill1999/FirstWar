FLEECING GALVESTON'S POOR,
Fxorbitaat Rents ( barged —Real Estate Black-
legs at Work.

GALVESTON, Tex., Oct. 12- One of the un-
just practices inflicted upon the atorm-atrioken
citizens of Galveston Is the exorbitant advance
in house rents. ‘There is a great demand for
houses, and especially eruall cottages, and
the owners and agents are taking advantuge
of the unfortunate condition of the stricken
citv. Poor people who cannot afford to pay
the advanced rates are evicted, and those who
can afford to pay the high rates are being forced
to the Limit Cottages that have rented for
sears at $15 and $16 a month cannot be had
now for 'e than #2"

Six and ei@ht-room houses which have al-
ways brought from $26 to $35, according to
location, because rents in Galveston have
alwayve been higher than any other city inthe
State, now rent for $35 to $45 a month. Many
cottages that withstood the storm and formerly
rented for $20 cannot now be had for less than
$80, Complaints are being filed daily, and
the citizens have appealed in vain to the an-
thorities for relief, lLandiords say that there
is a great demand for houses, and that they
have a perfect right to get all they can for
their property. The justice court dockets
are crowded with forcible detainer suits, In

nany cases the tenants sought to be evicted |

1ave been renters of the houses for many vears
Now they must vacate for people who are will-

ing to pay higher rents. In some instances |

some of the landlords who demand higher
renta refuse to makerepairs to the property
saying that they cannot afford to do so while
the high rate of wages prevails. Some of
the houses rented at these exorbitant terms
are minus portions of the roof and nearly all

have the windows out. People are forced |

to occupy therm or remain tn the street

A certain class of real estate blacklegs are |
rying to force poor people to part with ots!
¥iken which their homes were swept and ¢e- !

strove’ by the storm at sacrifice prices, The
effort to gobble up these lots for a song has
prove successful in many instances, and the
property is place! on the market at from

GOT HIS DIARY BY MISTAKE.

Lawyer Davidson Explains How His Savin
Family Catalogue Got Into Coart,

George T. Davidson, who was Mra. Arriba
W. Savin’s lawyer in a sult for a separation,
sald yesterday that the bill of particulars of
his counter claim ordered stricken out by Justice
Beekman on Thursday in her action againsi
him to recover $14,475 was not filed by him
It was filed, Davidson said, by the other side
In regard to the assertion that he did nothing
for Mrs. Savin, he asserts that he procured for

her a $100,000 house at 7 Fast Sixty-seventh |

street, and itscontents, worth $30,000, from her
husband: got her $12,000 alimony; secured for
her $7,000 in cash, an annuity of $8,000 a year

for her daughters, to take effect at her death, |
Nor her dower right in her husband's |

and retainec
entire property, Including the building at 24
New street, worth $100,000

When iitigation was concluded, acoordin
to Davidson, Mrs. Savin demanded that a!
property in his possession be handed over

o her, and refused to recognize any claim for |

services. He offered to settle for a reasonable
fee, but an attempt was made to make him
settle to save himeelf annoyance. Mrs. Savin
sued him and her attorney demanded a hill
of particulars of hisclaim. Davidson says he was
fll then and sent word to his clerks to have his
diary handed to Mrs. Savin's attorney to make
up the necessary account, with instructions
to use all the items bearing on the Savin case
Unfortunately his private diary inate of his
law dairy was given the attorney and a mass
of personal comments of his own was thus
introduced into court,

Davidson says that reference to the memo-
randum handed down by Justioe Beekman
will show that the Justice expressed regret
at being obliged to deprive the defendant of
his counter claim
