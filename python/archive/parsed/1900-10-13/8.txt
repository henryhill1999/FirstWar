‘

duce a very fair line on the actual strength }

of the “ig Four" this year. The Columbla-

Harvard match is by far the most important |

that has taken place this season The Crimeon

eleven has been decidedly bac kward as to form
eo far, and in games with Bowdoin, Williams
and Amberst the team has shown some alarm-
ing weak points, In view of this fact Harvard
men are wondering what can be done against
Saniord's players, who are recognized as the

strongest combination of kickers that
the Crimson has met this fall On
form Harvard, because of longer

experience and a firmly established system of

ooaching, ought to) win The critics have
figured out that if Harvard beat Williams
2 to 0 in twelveminute halves and Williams,
though outplayed, indulged in a scoreless draw
with Columbia in fifteen-minute halves, the
Crimaon should not have a walk-over with
Sanford’s eleven, which will probably be stronger

than it was on Wednesday In order to
keep Harvard down in the score, however,
Columbia will have to play @ more effective
jefence than that shown against Wililams

Harvard's backs are fast and they know how to |

make ground where other men fail. Sawin,
Kendall and Ellis, if they Iine up behind the
quarter back, ought to make Columbia fight
hard to stop their advances In punt
Harvard is have a big
as Columbia bs lamentably
that respect As far aa the
two ruar nas are concerned it
appears to be about a stand-off hiarvard'’s
line ts practically a new one, its chief fault
elng slowness and a lack of ageressiveness
Columbia's line contains at least three of the
best football players tn the lleges itn Wright,
Slocoviteh and Smythe, and eo far it has dis-
played excellent defensive tactics,
plays quarter back for Columbia
Kiiue and Wiite eleven wil begin
with supreme cornfidence With
full back and Week sand Berrien at
the back fleld should put up some strong f

interference does not loom up a steneal
feat for Sanford’s experts, together with

A Fistio Argument Imminent at the Parkway
Driving Club Track—Hed Lawn and
Amelia Pediar the Wisners-Only Twe
Heats of the Pacing Race Finished.

Good racing, bets declared off, after they
had been paid, a heated argument, which came
near causing a flat fight between Billy Snyder
and Dave Laman, were the features of the
afternoon's sport at the Parkway Driving Club
track yesterday. In the first heat of the 2:14
pace, which was unfinished, Amokin, driven
by Maxfield, was run into by Merritt Wilkes,
driven by Moore, at the first turn and Amokin
made a costly break Prince A. won the heat
and the positions of the horses at the finish had
been announced when the judges remembered
that something had occurred at the start of
the heat. They fined Maxfield $25, thinking
he could have won the heat, and declared all

bets off; but those who held Prince A. tickets
had arency received the money.

Argo Director was a warm favorite in the
ce at $100 to 870 for the field) She won
the first heat and her backers put all the money
in the box they could get Then Matt Dwyer
went out with Ked tawn and won the next
three heata. In the 2.22 trot Miss Shaw and
Amelia Pedlar sold in the auctions at $10 each
to $7 for the fleld) The latter won the money
after finishing in eighth place in the first heas,

PLUCKY MISS GAST CONTINUES HER
HARD RIDING FOR CENIURY RECORDS,

Fourteen Handred Miles of the Two Thousand
Completed Last Night Far Abead of the
Hest Women's lime, She Struggles Gamely
fo Beat Will

Though exhausted almost to the Imit of
human endurance Miss Margaret Gast, the
eyellst who ts travelling almost incessantly
over the roads In the vieinity of Valley Stream,
continued her quest for records yesterday
with unabated determination. At 6 o'clock
last night she had ridden 1,400 miles and fought
off two tired spells so severe that to the un-

oo (hey appeared each time as a case of

ollapee, |

The adverse conditions which
the beginning of her great task, and the severe |
efforts which the plucky rider was called upon
so make to overcome the muddy roads and |
disagreeable weather are now telling the in- |

|
|
|
|
'

Hrown's State Record,

prevailed at

evitable tale, and {it Is only by the sheer force
of her undomitable will that Miss Gast la able
to keep in the saddle and continue the monot-

onous pedalling The ultimate object of her

 

trial ia to ride 2,000 miles and set up a new
mark for the twenty centuries for
both men and omen For some
time she has been well ahead of

Mrs. Jane Lindsay's figures, which were the
best previously ore Jited to a woman, and yester-
day set out in earnest to surpass the record |
made by Will H. Brown, who is acting as her |
trainer in the arduous task On Thursday
night she was more than five hours behind
Brown's time, but her consistent pedalling yes-
terday brought her within measurable dis
tance of his figures and in spite of the weariness
with which she is troubled she is now confident

of taking the ‘ead in ler satrug¢g yainst time
by the tune her 1,500 miles is comp! ee

The most trying time that the rider has yet
had occurred late on Thursday night and in the

 

 

 

early hours of yesterday. While on her wheel
she was all right, but on dismouuting on two
easions she went off into such a sound sleep

that It was with the utmost difficulty that she

  

vis awakened to continue her task, Her con.
dition was very sluilar to that whieh
the six-day riders suffer from In

ite of Innuiifest exhaustion shies

wernt pluckily to work yesterday morning and

a'ter a good rest of several hours resumed
riding at 8:15 o'clock. She made only one
round of the twenty-mile triangle, when at

445 o'clock she was agaln attacked with s ea

 

 

 

 

iness Miss (inst rested until & o'clock and
then ate a good breaktast of chicken, steak
ss potatoes, coffee and toast The meal
ir rated her and she set off at a good paca
a nied by William Lawson, Harry Davis
un 1 Froenste:. aud completed the thir-
We ith century at 0:50 o'clock

During the day sie kept up a good pace
throughout and gained steadily on Krown's |

 

time Atéo'clock when the fourteenth cer tury
was completed she had been riding 149 hours
and wes only 1 hour and & minutes behind the |
time made by her trainer, who holds the State
record, At the same distance of her ride Mra
Lindsay had oecup ed 184 hours 49 minutes. Miss |
(iast’s fourteenth century had taken her only a |
tritfe over el#ht hour te aceomnlish, and she
allows herself until 7 o'clock this morning to |
complete 1,800 miles, If she suc 4s in her
endeavor, it will make her total riding time
or the distance 192 hovrs, and she thus flzures
on being twenty-four minutes ahead of Brown
who took 182 hours aad 24 minutes to ride hi»
