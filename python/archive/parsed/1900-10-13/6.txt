The book tells us that Mile. Smith is a woman |
of modest bearing and trreproachable moral
character, and that she has “for years earned
an honorable living as an employee of a com-
mercial house.” She haa lived twice before on |
this globe. Five hundred years ago she was
the daughter of an Arab shelk, and became,
under the name of Simandin!, the favorite wife
of a Hindoo prince named Sivrouka Navaka,
who reigned over Kanara and bullt in the year
1401 the fortress of Tchandraguiri. In the last |
century she reappeared in the person of Marte
Antoinette, and of course had her head cut off
These two experiences are called by Prof
Flournoy the Hindoo or Oriental evele and the
Royal cycle. A third experience is tndicated |
in the title of the book and {s called the Mar- |
tian cycle. In thia Mile. Smith, “by virtue | &

this is another ease of concealed identity, and
that “the name of laopold is only a pseudonym,
under which is concealed the illustrious Cagli-
ostro, who, it appears, was madly in love with

Our organization is such that no other concern in
America is so well equipped to buy books. A million
volumes and more pass through our hands annually. No
library is too large for us to handle nor any collection of
books too small to interest us. We buy all the lots we can
get—big or little. We are continually buying libraries and
collections of books. A few weeks ago we bought the
largest private library in the South, and inside of forty-eight
hours the books were packed, paid for and on their way to
our store.

Our representatives go to New York, Boston—any-
where to look over a library. If our offer is accepted there
is no delay in settlement—a check is given at once. We
pride ourselves on our promptness. Executors and admin-
istrators can turn the library of an estate into immediate
cash—quite a help where a quick settlement of affairs is
desirable.

If you have a library to dispose of write us at once,
giving particulars, and a representative will be on his way
to inspect it within a few hours after receipt of your letter.
Even if you have only fifty or so books you have no use
for, send us a list and we will tell you how we buy small
lots by mail.

“It is very clear and instructive. You have made a good distinction between the
possibilities of a bi-metalic standard and bi-metalic money.

“The information you have gathered into the book as to the course of money in the

Reasons for Their Popularity,

‘our books among our recent
publications have started on
careers with a rush that seems
to indicate that some of them
may be record breakers. For

¥ example, Lilian Bell's new novel,

The Expatriates,

published only a few days ago,
is already well along in its second
edition. Still, this is a story the

;suceess of which was apparent

   

          
   
     
    

from the first reading | of the
manuscript,

It has a fine, healthy Ameri-
canism about it which isa relief
after the morbid tone of much
recent fiction,

Then again, Mr. H. B. Mar

and into another almost faster
than it could be printed,—which
is only another instance of the
almost invariable success of a
really good love story.

There are two causes which
must be considered in account:

don’s story,

The Infidel.

One is, its religious side (it is a
tale of the i days of Method.
ism), and the other, the strong
romantic element.

The critics all agree that it is
by far the best thing that Miss
Braddon has written in fifteen
years, and that’s saying a great
deal.

You won't have to search lon
for the reason for the success of
John Kendrick Bangs’s delight-
ful little volume,

The Idiot at Home

hich is keeping’ the presses
usy. The reason is this: It is,
in a way, a sequel to “Coffee &

complete in itself, and it is
humor of the best and cleanest
sort, the kind of humor for
which there is always a market.
