A chapter on “The Personality of Leopold”
opens with the inquiry: “Is leopold really Jo-
seph Balsamo, as he pretends?” It ts also asked
whether he {8 a pseudo-reality, a kind of allo-
tropio modification of Héléne herself, It seems

he is an autonomous being, very generously
disposed toward Mile. Smith, but also con-
cerned with affairs in which she has no part.

Moreover he dictates poems to her which she

Moe. Smith for a period of five
months and was then displuoed by Leopold.
The book affords specimnens of Leopold's poetry,
and we do not belleve that an) body Is qualified
to say that it ts not poetry which Cagilostro
might have produced.

Other chapters, of course,treat of the Hindoo cy
ole and the Martian cycle and the oyele In which
Mule. Smith had her head cut off. There are pice
tures pertaining to the Martiancycle. One shows
us a Martian landscape with houses anda turtle
{n the corner; in others we have lakes and
palaces; there is a Martian flying machine
and a plant of Martian design, and the filustra-
tions include examples of the written language
that fs used in Mars. It is hardly necessary to
say that if Mile. Smith has really been in Mars,
and has seen and been the things that the book
declares, she is a woman of experience and a
wonder

 

“Shadowings” (Little, Brown & Co.) Mr.
Lafeadio Mlearn calls his latest series of strange,
fantastic studies from the Japanese. Only the

scholar steeped in the lore of old Japan ts quali-
fled to say the interpreter has kept

stories that are trar but even the reader
with a superficial acquaintance with the Land of

inexorably haunted by the unsolvable riddle
of life, Nature speaks even in the thin trillings
of the insect world, and she preaches always

There !s a quality of grim, fey horror, pemiltar
to the product of the Oriental {magination tn
the story of “The Reconciliation.” This is the
legend of a young Samural, who, having been
reduced to poverty by the rutn of his lord,
found himself forced to leave hia home and take
service with the Governor of a distant province
Under the belief that he oould better obtain
promotion by another alliance he divorced his
good and beautiful wife, and married again,
But the seoond marriage did not prove a happy
one, and he found that he loved the first wife
more than he could ever love the seoond. And
his repentance gradually deepened into re-
morse, and in his dreams he saw the wronged
wife sitting at her loom, weaving as when
ahe toiled night and day to help him in the vears
of their distress—or kneeling alone tn the des-
olate room where he had left her. So he re
solved to seek her out, as soon as he could re.
turn; to beg forgiveness and to do all that a
man could to make atonement. But the years
went by. At last his term of service expired
and he was free, and he set out at once to seek
his former cempanion—not allowing himself
even the time to change his travelling garb.
He found her aitting in the inner apartment,
sewing by the light of a paper lamp and waiting
for his coming. The years had not changed
her. She seemed as young and fair as in the
days when he had gone. They chatted far
into the night and at length she took him into
the room that had been their bridal chamber
in former time And they talked of the past
and the present and the future until the dawn
was gray. Then, involuntarily, the Sam-
ural closed his eyes, and slept. “When he
awoke, the daylight was streaming through
the chinks of the sliding shutters; and he found
himself, to his utter amazement, lying upon
the naked boards of a mouldering floor, Had
he only dreamed a dream? No: She was
there;—she slept * © * Ha bent above her, —
and looked,—and shrieked;—for the sleeper
had no face! * * © before him, wrapped
in ita grave-sheet only, lay the corpse of a
woman, —a corpse so wasted that Little re-
mained save the bones, and the long black
tangled halr.” Sickened and shuddering he
out into the sunlight, and, feigning tg-
norance of the neighborhood, asked his way

Answered, he must preaent her with a cup of
wine that had been bought at one hundred

different wine shops. After long waiting the
young girl stepped forth from the sereen and
took the wine cup. She was, as the Japanese
narrator saya, “much more beautiful than the
pleture -beautiful to the tips of her finger-
nails, beautiful, also, in heart and temper
lovelier than anvbody else in the world” They
pledged each other to love for all time—even
for the time of seven existences, and she threat-
ened, if he ever grew unkind, to go back to her
acreen And so the space that she had oc-
cupied became a blank, and they lived hap-
pily ever after. And, aa the od author says
in conclusion: “How very seldom do such th ings
happen in this world,”

Mr. Lewisham was an assistant master
in a emall English proprietary school, He
was 18, was passalle looking and wore ready-

His goings and | made clothes, and his salary was £40 A year,

But he had great ambitions, His bedroom
wails were hung with assertive truths, such as
“Knowleige is Power,” ‘What tan has done

| sketches

man can do” and‘ Who would control others |
must first control himeelf;” while behind the,

door, and against his Sunday trousers, were
a portrait of Carlyle and a manuscript list of
French irregwar verbs, Also overthe wash-
stand dangled a document which he called a
Schema, and in which his future Career was
market out. He hadi the world to conquer.
But suddenly his plans were all upset by the
vision of a straw hat daintily trimmed with
white pinkish blossoms, surmounting a de
mure little face and a pair of hazel eyes, Juat
how those eves affected him and what hap-
pened to the Career are téld delightfully by
Mr. H. G. Wells in “Love and Mr, Lewisham.”
(Fredjerick A. Stokes Company.) It ts an en-
tertaining and a humorous tale, with a touch
of tenderness beneath the surface cynicism,
ani one of the characters, Mr. Chaffery, the
medium, {s as engaging a rogue as we have
met with in a long while.

Mr. James G. Cannon, VicePrestdent of the
Fourth National Bank of thia city, has pre-
pared a very full and at the same time Interest-
ing account of “Clearing Houses, Their History,
Methods and Administration,” (D. Appleton &
Co.). The book is no more technical than it
hasto be, andthoughitean not beoffered as one
of a series of pre-digested political-economic
tracts, like some books that might be named,
it does not require a long financial training to
read and enjoy it Intelligently Mr, Cannon
was led to write it by finding that there waa no
book which gave succinetly a history of the
clearing houses and their methods, and to fill
this want he compiled the present volume,

The book takes upthe subject of clearing
houses thoroughly, beginning with a division

of the “houses” according to their functions,
one class consisting of those which simply
clear notes, checks, &e, the other, of those

   

which clear such {te and also preser ibe mies
for the control of their members, in various
matters. Another division draws the line be-
tween those “houses” that settle balances in
cash and those settling in drafts and checka,
After a chapter on clearing house terms Mr.
Cannon describes the special functions of a
clearing house and tells of some of the experi.
e@\ces of various “houses” in this country, and
considers possible future developments of the
system. In a chapter on the settlement of
balances, Mr. Cannon makes some curious state-
ments. “In a majority of the large clearing
houses,” he says, “certain kinds of money are
notacceptable. At Baltimore, gold coin, green-
backs and certificates redeemable in coin
are used, and silver is accepted only for frace
tional parts of thousands; at Buffalo, United
States Treasury certificates and legal tender
notes, National Bank notes, gold and silver
certificates and gold coin are used; at Bt. Paul,
all kinds of currency except silver coin; at Mil-
waukee, gold coin and currency, and at San
Francisco, Los Angeles and Portland, gold
coin exclusively.” About “17 per cent. of the
clearing houses of the United States settle
their balances entirely on a cash basis; in
Canada, however, all the clearing houses
except the one at Hamilton settle in Governe
ment legal tenders.” Some houses require
that money shall be put up In packages, each
to contain only bills of one denomination and
to consist of specified amounts, $1,000, $5,000
and $10,000,

Most American clearing houses clear only
once a day. Five of them, however clear
twice dally—those at Philadelphia, Fall River,
New Bedford, Detroit and San Francisoo. In
most “houses” there {s a series of fines for mix
takes in calculation, tardiness, 40. An idea
of the work entailed in clearing a check {s given
in Chapter IX., “Typical Journey of a Country
Check Remitted for a City Account.” It is too
long to quote here; but after reading {t no one
will wonder at the charge now made for col-
lecting such checks,

One chapter is devoted to the history of
clearing house loan certificates, one of the
most tmportant developments of the olearing
house of to-day. The New York Clearing
House has issued these certificates in 1880,
1981, 1862, 1964, during the Civil War; in 1878,
during the panto of that year: at this time the
other clearing house aassoctations for the
firat time followed New York's example and
issued certificates. The next local issue was
in 1884, during the Marine Bank panlo; again
in 1890, when there was almost a panio on ac-
count of the great demand for money in the
West; in 1893, during the panto on account
of the gold exports, a total of eight isenes,
amounting to $168,784,000. The value of these
lasties, great though it is, is only in part eax-
pressed in dollars. The loans were made
by all the banks in the c'earing house asso-
ciation to the needy banks, that is, sixty-four
of the etrongest financial organizations of
the country backed with their reserves the
sixty-fAfth bank temporarily in need. This
solidarity of the banks restored confidence,
averted paulo, and hastened the return of
ofdinary conditions. .

The account of the New York Clearing House
is too long to quote; only a few items may be
picked out of the most popular kind. The
began business on Oct. 11, 1853, at
14 Wall street, the clearings that day amounting
to $22, (48, 109.87, and the balances to $1,290,572.38
Since then, the clearing house has cleured a
total of $1,251,423.418,49023, the balances
amounting (o $55,660,345,10612, an average
percentage for forty-six yveam of balances
to clearings of 476 The largest clearings
were on April 1, 180, when they amounted to
$370,228,019.12; the smallest on Oct 80, 1857,
when they came to $8,357,30482. The largest
balance was on Jan 4, of this year —-$19,78s,-

The Jewish Publication Society of America
fasiios “The American Jewish Year Book 6661,”
September 1900 to September 1901, edited by
Mr. Cyrus Adler, Many new features
been added In this new edition, and In addition
to much detailed information, it has been the
object of the editor to bring together in every
fleld the constituent forces of Judaism and of
Jewish life in America. By codéperation with
the American Jewish Elistorloal Society,
preliminary list of Jewish soldiers and satlors
who served In the Spanish-American War is
given, and Jewish services to the Republic tn
elvil life are evidenced by the biographical
now brought together for the first
time—of Jews who have served in Congress and
had an honorable share in making the nation’s
laws. There is also a condensed atatement of the
ecclesiastical, scholastic and national organiza-
tions of Jews aboard and an interesting article
on Judaism in France and the Alliance Jara¢lite
Univeraelle; while a directory of local or@an-
{zations arranged alphabetically by States and
towns, and a report of the twelfth year of the
Jewish Publication Society occupy &@ proper-
tlonate amount of space. In an interesting
article on “The Year" Misa Henrietta Szold,
secretary to the Publication Committee, re-
views the events of the closing year of the nine-
teenth century, as they have affected the Jew
in the various quarters of the globe. Marked
in Austria by anti-Semitio excesses and the
eruel and ridiculous “ritual murder" charges,
in Gallicia by continued distress, in Bessarabia
by famine, in Roumania by an accumulation
of indignities and hardships, the year has been
one of which the retrospect is gloomy enough,
and that gloom renders all the more bright the
happier political and economie conditions
which the Jew encounters in America and
England. The practical usefulness of this
book should insure it the support of all Jews
who are interest d in the welfare of their co-
religionists in all parte of the world.

It is not easy to find a reason for the existence
of such books as “Goops and How to Be Them”
(Frederick A. Stokes Company), by Mr. Gelett
Burgess, This volume ts described on the title
page as “a manual of manners for polite infants,
inculeating many juvenile virtues both by pre-
cept and example, with ninety drawings.” It
is presumably meant to be facetious and In-
tended primarily for the edification of the very
young. Neither the verses nor the drawings that
accompany them seer likely to inspire, even in
a juvenile reader, any feeling other than that of
mild derision. It isa curtous fact that persons
absolutely devoid of any true sense of humor
often imagine that they are qualified to amuse
and entertain theyoung. Which is distinctly
rough upon the wise and wonderful little people,
who are too often debarred from the privilege
of telling some of these would-be wags just
what they think of them. As Mr Dooley, if we
remember rightly, says of the gameof “gol-uf,”
“Caddies is what the players calls the little boys
-—but what the little boys call the players is
unfit for publication.”

“The Dollar or the Man” (Small, Maynard &
Co.) is the title of a series of cartoons by Mr
Homer Davenport. These are reprinted from
the New York Journal and they are prefaced
with an acknowledgment to Mr. William &
Hearst and a picture of that gentleman sitting
onapileof newspapers. His youthful features
are overshadowed by an expression of deep
despair. Mr. Davenport's idea of humor is of
asomewhat simple, primitivesort. fHepictures
thePresident as a very small man and Mr Hanna
as a large, bloated-looking person with a sult
of clothes made of dollar bills. There are
doubtless many intellects to which this sort of
thing appeals as something exquisitely funny,
but it seems a pity that Mr. Davenport does
not learn to draw. Some of his cartoons bave
a certain rough political effectiveness, but at
present he reminds us a good deal of an angry
apoplectic demagogue bellowing loudly and
ungrammatically througha foghorn

An instance in which photography Is brought,
by the processes of careful selection and repro-
duction, very nearly to the level of art is seen
{in the excellent illustrations to Mr. Clifton
Johnson's pleasant volume “Along French
Highways" (Macmilians), Itis, as the author
says in his preface, “a book of strolling, a book
of nature, a book of humble peasant life, inter-
mingled with the chance experiences of the
narrator, lt haa little to do with large towns,
but much with rural villages, farm fireaides,
the flelds, and the country lanes” To those
who love that sort of book it may be recom-
mended
