The cheapest variation of the old awindling

worked in downtown office buildings by a

was out the young man walked in and said

Hello, isn't the doctor here? Well, that’s
tough. ‘I've come way downtown to deliver
those matches which he ordered, There is
40 cents due on the box

The atenographer waa not suspiclous and
she advanced the 40 cents. When the physi-
elan returned he disclaimed ordering the

which might possibly have been worth | 10

yesterday that he found almost no sale now

“There was a time,” he said, “when our sale of

 

 

 

 

  

etchings was very large Every one who
bought pictures at all purchased an etching
or two. Etehings which soid for from $10 to
$15 each may now be bought for from $1 to $2
en and unless they happen to have some
hi-t cal value there is no demand for ther

in the demand for water cx which sold at

BAD COMPLEXIONS

CUTICURA SOAP.

Mi.tions use Cuticura Soar exclusively for preserving, purifying,
and beantifying the skin, for cleansing the scalp of crusts, scales,
and dandruff, and the stopping of falling hair, for softening, whiten-
ing, and soothing red, rough, and sore hands, in the form of baths for
annoying irritations, inflammations, and chatings, or too free or
offensive perspiration, in the form of washes, for ulcerative weak.
neases, and for many sanative antiseptle purposes which readily sug-
gest themselves to women, and especially to mothers, and for all the
purposes of the toilet, bath, and nursery. No amount of persuasion
can induce those who have once used it to use any other, especially for
preserving and purifying the skin, scalp, and hair of infants and chil-
dren, Curicura Soap combines delicate emollient properties derived
from Cericura, the great skin cure, with the purest of cleansing ingre-
dients and the most refreshing of flower odors. No other medicated
soap ever compounded is to be compared with it for preserving, puri-
fying, and beautifying the skin, scalp, hair, and hands, No other fore
eign or domestic loilet soap aver expensive, is to be compared with
it for all the purposes of t, bath, and nursery. ‘Thus it com.
