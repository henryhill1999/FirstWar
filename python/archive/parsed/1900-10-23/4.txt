TO KILL OFF THF “NEW LEAGUE,"

Magnates Have Two Schemes Which Are
Calculated to Effect This Result.

The National League magnates are laying

plans to head off the rival organization known |

as the National Association which waa recentiy
organized in Baltfinore Ihey have two
echemes under consideratior One ia to re-
establish the twelve-ciub cireuit, which will
trike in Washington and Baltimore in the East

and Cleveland and Detriot in the West The |

er ia to form an aliianee with the American

 

cireuit to the Faust
ing to the latest report, if this plan
i ire the American League will be
made up aon of clubs in Boston, Phila-
delphia, B re and Washington in the
Eat, with OC} », Milwaukee, St. Louis and
( eland in the West

The National League will provide the grounds
in all of the Eastern cites and in St. Louis and
Cleveland In other words, the American
League sched would call for games on the
National leag «rounds in these ies while
the big teams were on the roid This would
provide continuous baseball in the cities which
are expected to have franchises in the Na-
tional Association, an arrangement calculated
to frighten off prospective backers in the latter
