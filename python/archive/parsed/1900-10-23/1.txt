John Sherman waa born in Lancaster, Ohio,
May 10, 1828. The branch of the Sherman family
of which he Was @ descendant is traced back to
the Rev. John Sherman, woo came Ww America
from kssex, England, in 1634, with his cousin,
Capt: Join Sherman, from whora Roger Sher-
man, one of the signers of the Declaration of
Independence, was descended. A branch of
the Rev. John Sherman's family removed from
Norwalk, Conn, to Lancaster, Ohio, in 1810,
and |t was there that Join Sherman was born
His father was a lawyer of considerable renown,
and for five years prior to his death, in 182,
was a Justices of the Supreme Court of Ohio,
John Sherman was the eighth of a fam-
ily of eleven children He was onl
6 year old when father died,
and John Sherman, who lived
in Mount Vernon, took char of him and pro-
vided for his education, He stayed with his
six years and was then sent back to]
Lancaster, where there was an academ:, where
he could prepare for college. He worked hard
for two years and could have passed his ex-
amination, but he made up his mind that he
ought to earn his ownliving and got aplace in
the corps of engineers engayed in surveying the
Muskingum country. The place came by politi-
eal favor and he held it only two years. He
wasa Whig and when the Whigs lost the election

out. Charlies Sherman, oe of his
brothars, who had become a lawyer and was
wetting a good practice, took John Sherman
into_his office and had him study law. He
wasadmitted to the bar in 1844 and then to
partner hip with his brother, Thes moved to
fanaield, where Sherman afterward made his
home until a year or so before his death, when
he removed for good to Washington.

His first political place whetted his appetite
for politics, and he took an active part in every
campaign, much to the disgust of his brother
Wiliam Tecumseh Sherman once wrote him
that he thought he should be in something better
than stump speaking. Mr. Sherman was a
good speaker and hecame the best politician
in his county Tn 1848 he was elected a delegate
to the Whig National Convention that nominated
Zachary fasior for the Presidency. He was
alwaves very conservative, and the people trusted
him. When the attempt to Senaal the Miss uri
Compromise was the lasue before the country

e was elected to Congrees by the Whigs. That
was in 184, and from the day he took his seat, in
December, 1855, to the day he resigned his place as
Secretary of Statein President McKinley's Cabe
met he was identified almost continuousiv with
the national government, efther !n the House
of Representatives, the Senate or the Cabinet
He had studied the country’s affairs and hie
ability and force as a speaker made him proml-
nent in the Conaress to which he was elected
He was guick In debate. In four years he |
worked nls way to the chairmanship of the
Committee on Ways and Means and the leade
ership of the House He served on important

Recognition of Ex-Secretary Sherman's Life
Issacd,

WasHINaTon, Oct. 22.--The President's procla-
mation announcing the death of Mr. Sherman
was issued this afternoon, It follows
“To the People of the United States

“In the fulness of years and honors, John
Sherman, late Secretary of State, has passed
away

“Few among our citizens have risen to greater
or more deserved eminence in the national
councils than he. The story of his public life
and services is, as it were, the history of the
country for half a century. In the Congress
of the United States he ranked among the fore-
most {n the House, and later In the Senate
He was twice a member of the Executive Cab-
inet, first as Secretary of the Treasury, and af
terward as Secretary of State. Whether in
debate during the dark hours of our Civil War,
or asa director of the country’s finances during
the period of rehabilitation, or as a trusted coun-
cillor in framing the nation's laws for over
forty years, or as the exponent of its forelgn
polloy, his course was ever marked by devo-
tion to the best interests of his beloved land,
and by able and consclentious effort to uphold
ite dignity and honor, His countrymen will
long revere his memory and see in him a type
of the patriotism, the uprightness and the zeal
that go to moulding afd strengthening a na-
tion

In fitting expression of sense ofthe bereave-
ment that afflicts the Republic, I direct that on
the day of the funeral the Executive oicers
of the I nited States display the national flag
at half-mast and that the representatives of the
United States in foreign countries shall pay in

trious dead for a period of ten days

TRIBUTE FROM SENATOR HOAR,
John Sherman's Services to the Country as
Statesman and Financeter.

Worcrater, Mass, Oct 22--Senator Hoar
anid to-day when he heard of John Sherman’s

death

“With the death of John Sherman, one of
the very few great surviving figures of the
time before the Civ War, of the Civil Wal
and of the great period of reconstruction dis-
appears from view These two illustrious
brothers, one at the front of the civil conflict
and the other the great military leader, will
go down inseparable to the memory Of remote
generations

“It would be hard to find two men more dif-
were alike ip patriotism, in
{ndomitable courage and in far-sighted wis-
dom John Sherman's letter to
when the Rebellion first broke out Was 4 Won-
derful prophecy. His sublime faith in freedom
and in the American people never faltered for
a moment in the darkest hour

“During the longest political Ife in the his-
tory of thia country, unlesa Justin Merrill's
be an exception, he contributed great service
as « leader in a @reat variety of questions of
vital interest to the Republic, but his special
service, was as a financier While he bowed a
little to the storm when the flat money de-
Iieaion prevailed tn Ohfo, he quickly recovered
himself and for thirty vears was the leading |
champion of the gold standard, to estal
which he contributed probably more than any
other ten men.’

INSANE FUGITIVES CAUGHT,

A FARMER AND HIS SON CAPTURE
THREE AT MIDDLE HOPE.

All bat, Three of the Seven Prisoners Who
Escaped From Matteawan Hospital Have
Been Captared—One Shot tn the Neck Geo-
ghegan Had Only Seven Hours of Liberty.
MATTEAWAN, Oct, 22.—Shortly before 7

o'clock to-night three of the prisoners who

escaped from the State Hospital for the Crinil-
nal Insane on Sunday night—Murphy, Clark
and Flynn—were driven up to the State hos-

 

 

pital in a farm vehicle driven by Farmer
Barnes. The men were handcuffed and
shackled. They were still without hats, But
for the insistence of Clark that they stop and
ask Barnes for a chew of tobacco when they
passed his house at Middle Hope
at an early hour this morning it
is probable the men would still be
at large Flynn and Murphy insisted that

they pass by unnoticed, but Clark insisted
on asking for some tobacco They stopped
and the fact that they wore no hats and that
they were practically barefooted, the frail
slippers having been torn from their feet by
their tramp through the underbrush, drew his
attention to them. When they had gone he
pondered over their appearance and when his
morning paper arrived and he read of the
escape, he at once telephoned Dr. Allison and
the attendants were sent out

It is a circumstance which has frequently
been noted that escaped patients almost in-
variably lose all idea of direction They have
on some occasions walked directly toward the
hospital. While Barnes was talking with his
hired man regarding the men and censuring
himself for not having detained them he was
much surprised to see them again coming
down the street in the opposite direction to

which they had gone in the morning
Murphy admitted to-night that he had
lost his way and did not know they
were retracing their steps Barnes and

his men both secured their guns and the convicts
ran. Three shots were fired, one of them strik-
ing Clark in the neck, and the effects were
plainly noticeable when he returned. Barnes
went away with a check for $125, the amount
of reward offered for three men

/To a reporter the men said they were tired
of their chase and glad to get back. They
eald that shortly after leaving the hospital a
discussion arose as to the division of the $49
which they took from Keeper Scally. Foster,
McCarthy and Johnson finally kept it. The
keepers say that the last three men now at large
are the most desperate and will not be so easily

captured. With the money they will undoubt-
edly procure some means of de-
fence The keepers also look = for
an open rupture between these men when

@ question of dividing the money comes up
Johnson is considered the most dangerous
of the lot, and Foster {s burly and will fight
at the least provocation. MeCarthy {ts more
intelligent and is looked upon as being the
one who will elude the keepers for the longest
period of time

Patrick Geoghegan was the first to be cap-
tured. He had been considered one of the
most energetic and daring of any who made
the break for liberty, yet he only succeeded
in getting as far as Low Point, about two miles
and a half from the asylum He was
only gone about seven hours before he was
a prisoner again. He was caught by Keepers
Wood and Taylor near Low Point. It was
about half past 1 o'clock in the morning when
he was brought back. Dr. Allison took him
into his private office and sent everybody
away while he talked with him. But the man
was sullen and had little to say beyond the
statement that he did not know where
rest had gone

The asylum authorities believe from in-
formation received from the chief of police
of Newburgh that all of them save Geoghegan
got across the river. Two boats are reported
as stolen, one at Low Point, in which Johnson
Murphy ant Clarke escaped, and just
above there, which Flynn, Foster and MoCarthy
are supposed to have taken, These three last
named are believed to be somewhere not far
from where Johnson, Murphy and Clarke
were captured this afternoon, Keepers are
closing in on the region from west, north and

ransacking the country in all
them None of these
three still at large is believed to be dangerous
to any person he might chance to meet. John-
son is a large, powertul man, whose insanity
takes the (orm of an tnordinate idea of his own
importance. He was one of the ringleaders
of the plot tc escape, altyough he has less in-
telligence than mo-t of e others. Filson ts

caused trouble in the asylum by making an
uproar at night. He has got ft into his head
that his parole was sent to the asylum, but that
it was destroyed and that he was malicious:s

divorce brought by Ella, Countess Festetics,

of her charges that the yacht Tolna was unfit

for her. The vacht, he says, was comfortable
and at various places where they anchoret
much of the time was spent at the beat hotels

It was at Singapore that the Counteas firet
