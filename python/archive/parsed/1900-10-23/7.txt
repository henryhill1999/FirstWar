away from work and on Saturday night he

and his men were attacked and stoned by a
crowd of women Nevertheless he started
for the washer) this morning as usual

Four hundred strikers armed with guns,
clubs and stones lay in ambush along the road
and a woman stood on watch The foe was
very thick. When she saw O'Hara the woman,
thinking that he was leading the men to work,
oried “Here they come! Instantly a shot
was fired and the strikers oharged down from
all sides. Surprised to find O'Hara alone they
clubbed and kicked him until he was bleeding
from a dozen wounds and left him half con-
eclous on the ground Reviving he made his
way for a couple of hundred yards farther
Then he was overtaken by another party of
strikers and beaten with clubs and left for dead
With remarkable pluck as soon as his strength
returned he staggered along the road for nearly
a mile and finally warned the men who were

starting for

away until a force of policemen came to their
ald

Meanwhile the strikere thinking that the men
would probably reach the mine by rail vad,
lined the tracks. Many them had shotguns
and revolvers Ag the train did not come they
destroyed a big tool house and tore up the
tracks
