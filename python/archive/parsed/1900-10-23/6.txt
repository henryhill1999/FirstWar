Not So Enthusiastic About Giving Up the
Actress He Was Going to Canada to Meet
Her Letters to ‘Dear Sweetheart’’ Pro-
daced tn Cotrt Seem to Surprise Him.

Elghteen-year-old Charles Klely, whose
mother caused his arrest by summoning two
policemen into the Klely apartments In the
San Remo on Central Park Weat on Friday
night, came up before Magistrate Zeller yea-
terday after spending two days in the Weat
Side court prison and was soundly lectured
rhe result of it all was that Charlies promised
to be good and give up the notion of golng to
Canada to meet an actress and the Magistrate
released him

When the case came up first on Saturday
Magistrate Zeller granted the boy a private
hearing. When the young man was led back
to his cell, in talking to reporters he asserted
his Independence in vigorous terms, declaring
that although he didn’t “stand ace high just
at present,” he would show some people sev-
eral things when he became of age, and that
if he were being kept in jail to cool off they
would find him a rather warm article when he
got out. Perhaps Magistrate Zeller thought
that was a result of the private examination
and perhaps he didn't, but at any rate when
Policeman Treanor brought young Klely up

On none of the programmes announced by |

about which so much was said last summer.
Those mentioned included Herbert, Nevin
and several othera more or less well known,
Nothing has been heard of them or their muate,
however, since the concerts of the orchestra
began. It is a pity that the Strauss orchestra
cannot provide the muste for some balls here,
asit was at one time announced to do In several
Wostern cities, It is distinctly a band for
dance music, and any that had
the codperation of these players in its waltzes

social incident

 

 

e orchestra at the

balla in vienna, and it is as provider of dance
muste that his reputation was made. He ta
undenlably a very tmauenetic conductor and

hasall the mannerisms that appeal tothe public

He aways to and fro rhythmically with the
movement of the waltze, rises on his toe

moves his baton caressingly in the plano pas-
sages, and when he plays the violin, clutches
the bow, after he has conducted the opening
yhrases with it, as if he intended to mount the
natrument and fly through the air on it, He
does all these interesting things with an en-
thusiasm, apirit and grace quite remarkable
