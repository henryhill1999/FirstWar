CHILDREN IN A GAS-FILLED ROOM,

Tells the Police—Mother Has Disappeared.
Mrs. Angelina Vergilia of 86 Chrystie street

took three little children to the Eldridge street

police station yesterday morning who, she said,
had been deserted by their mother after the
woman had tried in various ways to do away
with them
The naine of the mother is unknown in the
neighborhood. Nothing has been seen of her
einoe Sunday night. Mrs. Vergilia, cooking her
| husband's supper then, heard <ou'ids as of achild
choking tn the adjoining flat. She would have
| pald no attention to the sounds had not the
actions of her neighbors furnished gossip for
the tenement for two mouths Ever since
“the Sicilian wornan,” as they called the olil-
| dren's mother, her three children, her sister
and a man had moved into the fiat, the
children had often begged a orust of bread
saving that they were hungry and that thelr
mother would give them nothing to eat. Sus-
pecting something wrong on hearing the ohok-
ing sound Mra. Vergtlia went into the hallway.

a widow, and she ts held in high esteem by
her neighbors, Since her husband died Mra,
Shake has had to go out to work to earn a liv-
ing for herself and Agnes. Recently she de-
cided that her daughter had arrived at the
age when girls in similar circumstances take
a hand in supporting the famuy. Agues was
accordingly taken out of s¢)vool and generally
accompanied her mother and assisted her in
her work,

Agnes accepted the change without express-
ing much dissatisfaction, for In the nefahbor-
hood tn which the Shakes live occupauionaddsa

was not long before the widow began to have
trouble with her daughter. Much of this Mrs.
Shake attributed to the influence of other girs

At firet when Agnes Was not in the house at the
