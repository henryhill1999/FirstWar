STIR IN TEMPLE BETH-EL;

DISCORDANT ANNOUNCEMENTS MAD
BY ITS RABBIS.

Bach of Them Afterward Denied the Extst-
ence of Strained Relations -Bat Associate
Rabbi Schelman Insists Mts Powers Are Co-
equal With Those of Senter Rabbi Kohler.

The New Year feeling of mutual amity among

 

 

the members of the wealthy Hebrew congre- |

gation of Temple Beth-El, Fifth avenue and

Seventy-sixth street, has been slightly jarred |

by an apparent difference between the senior
and associate rabbis of the temple. During
the new year service on Monday the senior rabbi
the Rev. Dr. Kaufmann Kohier, announced to
the assembled congregation that on Atonement
Day he would read the names of members
of the families connected with the congrega-
tion who had died during the past year. He
desired that the names of all such be sent to
his address before Wednesday next so that
they might be included in his prayer. No
sooner had he finished his announcement than,
the Rev. Samuel Schulman, the associate rabbé,
arose and informed the eongregation that he
would read the names on the year's memovial
jut on Atonement Day and asked that the
eames of the year's dead be sent to his address
before that service,

According to general report, the congrega-
on Was quite a-flutter a¥ this abrupt announoe-
by Rabbi Schulman, especially as on
Rosh Hashona all differences of the year are

ment

ing and good-fellowship are presumed to usher

in the new year.
Dr. Kohler would not discuss the matter

with reporters yesterday except to say that he
knew of no difference of opinion between Rabbi

Schulman and himself. In answer to a questa
he said that it was only of concern to he th-
congregation who would vend the meanorial
list.

Kabbi Sabulman refueed yesterday to repeat

to reporters the substance of the announce-
ment he made to the conaregeyce on Monday
after Dr. Kohler had asked t names for the
memorial list be sent to his address. Rabbi
Schulman was emphatic, hewever, on the
point that he pot junior to Rabbi Kabler.
When 1 came here from Kansas (ity two
years ago that was made plain.” he said to a
cn reporter last evening. “1 am one of the
rabbis of the synagogue, with coequal wers

devotion, eo that the morning and afternoon
services referred to are but features of the
all-day meeting. You see, the matter is very
ample and apparently somebody ts trying to
make @ tempest in a teapot, when an attempt
fe made to show that, Dr. Kohler and myself
are at odds. Dr. Kohler, | am sure, feels that
the whole matter ts not worthy of newspaper
attention.”

service. Trustee H. 8. Herrman said that the
rabbia would settle the matter between them-

selves amicably, he was sure.

“Probably they have met already to-day

orlal liat,” he remarked last evening.
