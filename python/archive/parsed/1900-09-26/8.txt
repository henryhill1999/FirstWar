[exk® HACTS, Sept, 25.~—The world’s trot-

tng record was lowered here this afternoon by

Ihe Albot to 2,08, which is a reduction of

haif a second of the record made by Alix

at Galesburg, UL, Sept. 19, 1804. The new

veureo.d bay gelding by Chimes, dam Nettie

King, by Mambrino King. Hels a product of

 

the noted Village Farm, located pear East
Aurora, and owned by © J. and
Harry Hamlin of Buffalo. He etill belongs

to the veteran breeder and his son, and to-day
owas driven by the skilful reinsman Ed. F.
rs, who ts the chief trainer for the Damlins
pdhas given to the great gelding most of his
since a colt. The Abbot went into
quarters last year with a record
{ 206's and had shown 80 well publicly that
expert horsemen thought him one of

ibe «greatest trotters ever foaled. This
rth being no regular classes for him

i with extreme fast records, the horse bas
«raduaily prepared for his effort to-day.
Duriow several exhibitions against time he

showed improvement right along, so that when

tie porse landed here a few days ago he had

FIRST: DAY AT MINEOLA.

Bicycle and Trotting Races the Attractions at
Queens Mounty Fair.

“Bicycle Day” at the Mineola fair yesterday
brought out the largest first day crowd in sev-
eral years, The programme included five
cycle races and two trotting events and the
sport was excellent. There were about five
thousand persons present, and while the ex-
hibits of poultry, cattle and farm produce up-
doubtedly attracted many, the spectators in
the grand stand made up an unmistakable
bicycle crowd. An added feature of the pro-
erarmme was Miss Lilian Schafer in equestrian
@xluitiens. Bhe showed a proficient high

school horse, a jumper, and rode a half-mile
running race in a (ockey costume against a
Cea rune, 7 pee ve in 6344 seconds.

@ novice bicycle event, with
final, resulted in ar
youngsters rode
@ close bunch, an

 

interestiag race. The
p o pirecn to the tape in
C, A. Smith won by a length

4s the result of a burst of speed ten yards from |

the ine, There were only inches separating
the second and third men. LaDue mado a
fine winning in the one-mile handicap. There
were twelve starters in the final heat, and coming
up the stretch La Due was pocketed at the rear
of the bunch. Some of those in front of him
wearied and left an opening which LaDue
went through like a ahot and finished first by
@ lenath, Van Cott beat Merkert half a lengt

forthe place, The half-mile handicap was won
by Libschik by alength, after a furious eprint,
in a style that warranted the predictions of hia
fellows of the Orange Wheelmen that he is “a

comer,”
In every heat of the one-n handioap ex-
oept the second some of the riders fell. The

two Bedell boys from Lynbrook were unlucky

in the third heat. John Bedell had his head

out o from a fall in the stretoh and Menus

Bedell was thrown in front of the paddock

during the final heat and had to be carried off

the track Both belong to the Kings County
yheelmen

The two trotting events were interesting be-
cause of the big flelds, but Monk,a twelve-year-
old gelding brlonging to C. H. 1, Hommedieu,of
Islip, won the 2:25 class handily in three
étraight heats, while Gladys captured the
three-minute counwy class. Summaries.

SPORT AT WHITE PLAINS.
Two Harness Races of Eight Heats Take Over
Three Hours to Decide.

About fifteen years ago, when Jimmy Ciold-
smith drove the bay horse Domestic ahead
of Lowland Mary, Dobson's roan mare, and
lowered the White Plains track record of 2:26%,
held by the latter, to 2:25, to an old-fashioned
high-wheel sulky, the track was better than it
was yesterday, the opening day of the Weet-
chester County Fair races. Such was the verdict
of horsemen who took part in the events that were
decided. The harness competitions were ted-
fous affairs, and Mr. Travis gave a poor exhi-

bition of starting It required more than three
hours to get off eight heats: but the spectators
took {t good naturedly, their attention being
somewhat diverted by a man on the infield, who
jumped off a 00.foot ladder into a tub of water
Eight horses faced the starter for the 2:35
trot. Jerome Whelpley with the black mare
Lady Travis won the first heat from James
MecConahan's black stallion Too Soon and
Dave Herrington'’s Master Chimes by a length,
with the others strung out in single file many
lengths back. Too Soon captured the second
heat, Lady Travis having been sent away ona
break: but she easily trotted past the bunch
In the next two heats, finishing as she pleased
Biue Wilkes won the iirst heat ip the 2:15
pace, but was unahle to forge to the front
asain, the black gelding, Sir Arthur, taking
the three following heats off the ree The
rettiest heat of the race was the third, when
Maloney made a fine one-handed drive down
to the wire. In the fourth heat, however,
ho did not have it se easy. Merritt Wilkes
made it warm for him and he was obliged to
use both hands to the best of hia ability
The races to-day are likely to prove more
interesting. They are the 2:2) and 226 trots, with
ten and. sitteen entriv®, resnectively., Judg-
ing in the horse show will also hegin to-day
and a targe number of high-class horses will
be exhibited in the fleld in front of the yrand

SCHORR'’S HORSE TAKES THE STAKE
AT GRAVESEND IN FAST TIME.

Elizabeth M. Runs Away With the Handicap
for Two-Year-Olds— The Specialty for
Three- Year-Old Fillies Goes to MoCafferty's
Fleuron—Gala Day for Jockey Henry.

A stake and two handicaps were the features
of an interesting card at Gravesend yesterday.

The selling eventa filied well and the tempting

speculative outlook combined with fine autumn

weather and the assurance of a good track
brought out a large crowd, Favorites again

proved unprofitable investments as only 4

couple pulled through. This however, was

z tn the | more the fault of the talent than the horses,

some of the unsuccessful first choices having
little beyond paddock and rail bird tips to
recommend them.

Only five of the ten named for the Bayshore
Stakes faced the ordeal but even then the
Plungers went astray. They blindly followed
8. C. Hildreth’s movement to win out Meehanus,
the horse he had purchased last week for a
fancy price. The books offered § to 2 against
the “beef an'” Idol but quickly cut the odds
to 9 to 5, when the new owner's commission
reached tlhe market. Potente, The Pride
and Lieber Karl were supported in the order
named, but the other candidate, Bettie Gray,
was ignored. Burns took the track with Lieber
Kar! at once and holding his advantage to the

end won handily by three lengths, Meehanus
hung on fairly well for five furlongs, but then
curled up, and The Pride beat him two lengths
for the place. Hildreth relieved his feelings
by raising the winner from $1,000 to $2,000 be-
fore letting him return to the Schorr barn

(10 formidable-looking Schorr pair, Silver
Dale and Lady Schorr, were taken out of the
handicap for two-year-olds, first on the card
and in their absence Elizabeth M. attracted
all the heavy play. An enthusiastic contin-
gent from Philadelphia, followed by most of
the regulars, forced her odds from & to 2 to
8 to B avid cashed in without any Incidental
worry as she left her teld in the first few strides
and opened a gap of five lengths. Henry
eased her up nearing the goal and let her gal-
lop over the line four lengths clear of a strug-
gens bunch, out of which Luerana, the Mus-

eteer, Colchester and Scurry emerged, heads
apart

Kamara acceptec the honor of top weight
in the handicap for three-year-old fillies and
the wily bookmakers took the hint_and posted
7to 10. They offered 2to 1 against Motley and
fancy odds against the other three candidates,
The Candlemas filly was altempting to  con-
cede fifteen pounds each te Fleuron and Star
Chime, and as a natural sequence they beat

er, Fleuron, at 10 to 1, winning in a mild drive
»y two lengths from Star Chime, at 15 to 1,
with Kamara struggling gamely at the latter's
throat latch. The time was wretchedly slow,
and half a dozen fillies fretting in their stalls
could have beaten it at least a second.

The MeCafferty party showed the utmost
confidence in the ability of Himtine to beat
his efght opponents in the selling-race dash
which followed the stake event. Fluke kept
them guessing for five furlongs, but Henry
then rushed Himtine to the front and won by a
length and a half from Buffoon, who caught
Fluke in time to secure the place by a head

Although only four horses turned out for
the one mile and a furlong event the boys could
not resist the Rempratt nto crowd. MeMeekin,
the favorite, and Serrano, second choice, al-
iernated in the lead for nearly a mile when
O'Connor came around on the outside with
Andronicus and brought him home a length

in front of Intrusive

Spencer made a complaint of interferemce and
Intrusive was dtequallhed as the chief offender,
the horses being replaced as shown in the sum-
mary. Burns, who rode the Meddier horse,
was set down for two days

Animosity, well played at 8 to 1, won the
closiue event all the way, although ridgden out
at the end to atall off the challenge of Janger-
fleld. The Golden Prince, Luck and Milionaire
eame next in close order, and Brenan, who
rode Luck, was set down for the week, an Shaw's
complaint that he had crowded the favorite
ata criteal point. Summary

TIGERS MAKE A LITTLE MONEY,

Treasurer's Siatement of the Princeton Ath-
lette Associa.ion,

PRINCETON, Sept. 25.— Treasurer George Mur-
rey of the Princeton Athletic Assoclation to-day
gave out his semi-annual statement of the
financiai standing of the aasociation, covering
the receipts and expenditures in all branches
of athletics from Jan. 1 te July 1, 1900. The
report shows that the association te in much
better shape financially than it was a year ago,
when there was a@ deficit of about $4.00. This
year there is a balance on hend of $1,061.11
The healthy condition of affairs is attributed to

tho succeasful basebal! season, whicn netted
a profit of $4,763 74, nearly $2,000 more than the
yrevious vear

The increase is accounted for by the fact
that the last gaine with Harvard was played
here during commencement week instaad of
earlier in the season, us has been the case in
former yoars, The track team ran behind
nearly $1,500, the actual receipts being $1,487.16
The spring season, however, was more ex-
pensive than usual owing to the long schedule
of eventa, although the $4,000 which
pended on the trip of the athletes to Paris was
contributed by the alurnni and undergraduates
and does not figure in the treasurer's report.
The statement of the football association
covers only the menevs received and expended
during the spring term

According to the treasurer's report the total
receipts amounted to $28.440.11. Of this amount
$111.54 was received as a balance fromthe base-
ball association on Jan, 1, while $12,057.88 is
the income from the baseball] team from all
sources, The track association's receipts from
al] sources amounted to $2,868.76, and the foot-
ball aasociation handed in $1,828.02. A
balance of $1,820.72 was brought over from last
years general ¢x pense account, and $5.002 74as
was credited to the same account since Jan. 1,
The disbursements, which include $12,168.87 for
the baseball assoclaUion; $2,868.7é6forthe track

  

 

association, $1,828.02 for the football associa-
tion and $6,422.85 on the general expense ac-
count, amounted to $22,788, which loaves a

balance in the treasury of $1,061.11,

Yorks Lose Twice at Boston —St, Louls Wins,

The Brooklyns now lead the League race by
ten points. The Champions were beaten in a
2 to 1 game by the Philadelphias yesterday, but
asthe Pittsburgs did not play, Hanion’s men
still have a fighting chance w keep in front, In
order to do so, however, they will have to take
a tremendous brace in their general play instead
of indulging in rowdyism to cover up defects.
The New York tall-onders were twice walloped
in Boston and lost the best chanos they have
had in months to climb out of the tail-end place,
St. Louis easily disposed of Chicago and stands
a chance to secure fifth place. The results:

PHILADELPHIA, 2; BROOKLYN, 1.

In spite of the manifesto issued by C. H.
Ebbets, President of the Brooklyn club. on

Monday, to the effect that rowdyiam would be
effectually squelched by him at Washington
Park, there was another disgraceful exhibition
of the national game there yesterday, which
culminated in a fignt and the appearance of
the the police on the fleld, President Lbbets
was in the centre of the me!oe as peacemaker,
not referee, but his work was ineffective, though
after It was all over he made several new threats

The Brooklyns were beaten again because
they could not hit the pitching of Frazer. ‘The
Champions threw away several chances for
runs by poor base-running, though they stole
in al] elght bases off Mclarland. Kennedy
itched magnificent bali and worked like @

veaver. He made a two-bag@er in the seventh
and a single in the fifth: but got no assistance.
The Brooklynas made their only run}
in the second inning when Slagle
muffed Dahblen's easy fiy, which
yielucd two bases Then Dahlen stole thied
and ran in on MoGuire’s fiy to left. Kennedy
was repeatedly cheered for his pitching in
the first five Innings, during which the bi

Quakers couldn't make a run. There hac

been no kicking in that time, either, but the
game had drag@ed along in the most tiresome
manner, the first three innings being com-
pleted in one 5 and three minutes
Flick opened the sixth loning with a base on
balla. McFarland hit to Jennings, who was
playing second base, and looked like an easy
Victim. Jennings, however, made a wild throw
t Kelley to the bleachers, Flick reaching
vc

hird and Farland second. Wolverton nop-
fied to Dahlen and Cross sent a long drive to
Jones. As the latter caught the ball Flick

fowaed toward the plate, there being little
chance to throw him out. McFarland made a
dash for third and Jones threw the ball on a
line to Cross. Umrire Hurst rao down to
see the play at third, never looking at Fick.
and as MeFariand was tonched out the umpire
said so. As a matter of fact MeFarland was
yut out before Flick crossed the plate, for the
atter walked the laet few »ard- to the rubber,
Under the rules the run did not count hut,

of course, Hurst havirg ‘is back turned to
Flick. did not know whether he crossed the vlate
before the out or not

The Brooklyns rushed at the umpire In a body.
They wanted Hur t to declare that Flick’s run
didn't count They gesticulated and argued
for fully five minues while Hur t said he could
not cut the run off as he had not seen the play
The Champions were in bad humor ove this
incident and scowled at the urnpire as they
slowly re‘reated to the bench under fire. Pos-
sibly they forgot that Flick woud never have
reached the plate but for the error of Jennings

As the sixth inning closed 'tmpire Hurst,
rho had been trying to hurry the game, potified
players that he would compel them to play
e innings, no teer how dark {t might grow
The players mer laughed at the umpire and
continued their dilatory tactics,

\With one out io the seventh, Thomas singled
and Single flied to Sheexard. Delehanty
amashed a corking two-bagger to right. Thomas
was rounding third as Keeler picked up the
ball in front of the acore board, Keeler and
Kelley made quick throws to McGuire, who did
not come within a yard of Thomas ag he slid
over the plate. There waa no chance for an
argument, it seemed, for the play was not even
close. But the Brooklyn came tn with a rush
Capt. Kelley and Secretary Jennings of the Pro-

 
     

 

 

 

 

tective Association, which recently declared
against rowdyism, were foremost with their
protests, which, of curse, a msted to nothing

The players were still loafing along in spite

 

of the umpire, who was determined to have
his way n the eighth Flick hit a bail to the
ground that Hirst called a foul. Kennedy

teked It upandthrewto Kelley. Then Kelley,

lahlen, MeGuire aud Kennedy got around the
nmpire and wrangled. They wanted Huret
to call it a fair ball and declare Flick out,

After the Quakers had been flanked the
Prooklyns tried to rally once more, With two
out, Kelley bunted. Cross hit a ball down In
front of the plate. Hurst called ita foul. In-
stantly MeFarland threw his mask and chest
protector in the afr. Delehanty, the Phila-
celphia captain, rushed into the middle of the
diamond and stuck his forefinger on Hurst's
shirt front. Hurst pushed the big fellow away,
whereupon Dei threw tne ball to the ground ti
a race and stormed ground like a madinan

“Play ball!” yelled the crowd once more,
for it was ao dark that many were lightin
matehes and he wepapers Crosse = singlec
and Kelley ran to third Cross stole second

nd McFarland made a sloppy throw to catch

im Kelley had # fine chance to score, but he
stuck to third and Dahlen left both men with
a fy to Wolverton. As the inning closed, the

 

 

 

crowd, thinking that Huret would ecail the
gaine, began to jump on to the fleld

“Play ball'" yelled the umpire, and the
spectators clambered bac\s

“Cail the game! What are you doing, Hurst,
givis g the Champions a chance to wis in tho
dark?"

The Philade phias gathered arouna Hurst

aad protested

Play ball'” “T e@n see!”
engeged now in
and threatening

this dangerous

ordered the umpire.

The police were actively
putting out burning paper
men who were indulging in
fun with arrest. It was so dark that the
spectators couldn't see where the ball was
whenever it was hit. But, nevertheless, the
Brooklyns were able to retire the Quakers
the first half of the ninth. As Jennings

| cane to bat for Brooklyn in the last half, a

WAA OX- |

co czars | Hoyas ie

voice from the Philadelphia bench was heard:

“Flurst, you are a crook!”

The umpire turned and looked in the direo
tion of the bench

“It's me,” cried one of the Philadelphia play-
ers jumping up. “It's me, Dunn ou are a
crook.”

“You say that again,” said Hurst to Dunn,
the pitcher recently released by the Brook-
lyns, who is now with the Philadelphias, “and
T'll attend to you after the game,”

The play proceeded and, amid a wild dem-
onstration, both Jennings and MoGuire struck
out. The Philadelphia players delayed the

ame as much 4s they could by walking after
he ball and defying the umpire to hurry them.
Dunn, from the bench, continued his abuse
of Hurst and when Kennedy finally ended
the game at 6:05 o'clock with a fly to Lajoie,
Umpire Hurst looked relieved,

Hurst turned away from the plate to go to
his drewing room. Duan came toward him
from the bench

“You are a dirty crook, Aluret!" shrieked
Dunn, Hurst, with his mask in his hand, re-
sponded with a blow in the chest

“Get away from me, you glass arm pitcher!"
said Huret, “you are a four flusher and are not
worth bothering with.”

Just then Delehanty rushed
by a crowd of spectators. He
around Hurst's neck and a scuffle enaued in
which Flick took part, too. Some persons
sald both Delehanty and Flick hit Hurst, but
the latter denied this after the game. Hurst
broke away and was grabbed by President
Ebbets. Hurst broke away from Ebbets and
was ready to land a punch when he recognized
the magnate and desisted. The police then
got into the game and the row was quickly
stopped. Hurst said to THe SUN man after
it was all over

“The players caused the wholetrouble. They
let the game drag, ip spite of repeated warn-
ings The people pay to see nine innings, and,
us far as I am concerned, I intend to make the
players do what is required of them, I've not
called a game this year on account of darkness
Play was started to-day at 4:30, and here it is
after 6 when tne last man is put out. Dunn
called me a crook, and that is something I will
not stand for. My reputation tn sports does not
warrant such an insult and ] waa on the point
of resenting it with a good punch in the eye,
when I thought better of it aud Jabbed Dunn
in the cheat with the mask. Delehanty and
Flick did not hit me at all, The Brookiyns
played poor ball-— tos poor to win a pennart ”

‘Who hitevou, Hurst?” asked President Eb-
bets, rushing into the room all out of breath

Oh, that’sallrigiht!” answered the umpire

“They tell me it Dunn!” said Ebbets,
“are you going to prefer charges against bim?”

Hurst made no reply. Then Ebbets hotly re-
marked;

“If you don't, I will make charges against
you, Aurst!”

“All right, Mr. Ebbets,” was the umpire's
answer. “I'll make the usual report to esi
dent Young.”

“Tl wont stand this rowdyism'”
Rrooklyn President in a loud voice
stand it. Ite a shame!”

In an interview late last night President
Ebbets said that he was determined to at leust
make an effort to suppress rowdyism in games
ington Park. He said

first sign of trouble I shall personally go upon
the field accompanied by a policeman and have
the gulity player or players removed from the
grounds at once, no matter whether he is
a member of the visiting club or one of the
Brooklyn players. While this action may seem
to be a little out of order, I think that in view of
the fact that the umpire seems to be unable to
suppress rowdyism that the course I have de-
cided to follow is the only correct one under the
circumstances. That the umpire is powerless to
deal! with offending players in a case like that of
to-day was clearly shown, and I'm going to
try my scheme and jf that fails I'll try some-

 

thing else. It is stop the scrapping or close
the gates, and I have decided to do the former
and give the patrons of the game baseball
and not battle royals as side shows.” The
score:

News of the Wheelmen.

Probably not one rider in 500 when remov-
ing the chain to clean jt thinks of taking stepa
to insure its going back in exactly the same
relation to the sprocket, tooth for link, as it
was. Few cyclers appreciate that thie i# a
matter that makes any difference and not al!
repair men are particular about it. The more
worn a chain is the more important it is to
keep {it running in the aime old way. The
same link of a chain does not engage the same

tooth every time. but in the course of ita
travels the sama sets of links follow
each other over the same teeth. The wear
clicks and jumps, It does it until the new

order of running has worn the teeth and links
into anew harmony. It fe easy when removing
achain to mark one link and one teoth on each
sprocket as they are engaged andin replacing
to engage them the aame way before coupling
the ends of the chain. A seratch on the link
and the sprocket tooth can be made with a
ecrew driver or a scivsor point

 

A new stvle of chain that is being looked
upon with favor by ps trade is one made up
without rivets, the Fnks being S shape and
hooking into each other A Iink can be de-
tached and a new one put in with the fingers
If time proves it practicable it will be a boon
to riders, as a broken chain can be fixed any-
where along the road If the victim carries an
extra link

Champion Jeffries Wants to Fight.

Jim Jeffries was in town yesterday. The
champion, who is looking well, states that he
is ready to box any one in the business

“I am nowin the best of health,” said the

big boilermaker to a reporter of Tur Srv,
“and would like to tackle those fellows who
have been seying all along that I am afraid
I would like to meet Fitzsimmons in preference
to any one else. T beat him once before and
IT wish to show the public that I can do the trick
igaln. He has been making a lot of statements
of what he intended doing. Now let him make
them good.”

There is also talk of Jeffries and Sharkey
coming together for six rounds at Chicago
As the authorities in that city bave placed a
ban on all the big men it is quite likely that the
encounter will have to be Gcecided at another
place harkey says he is prepared to go

not in good humor at the start of the first heat,
breaking almost immediately after crossing
under the wire. He was farin the rearat the
quarter post. Paliner got him going on the
