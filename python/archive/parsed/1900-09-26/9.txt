WEDNESDAY, SEPTEMBER

FINANCIAL AND COMMERCIAL.

Trespay, Sept, 26
While reduced prices were recorded for
stocks inthe early trading to~lay, there was sub-
sequently such a development of strength
that the final figures for most of the issues
dealt in were materially higher than those
of vesterday, There was a considerable con-

creased activity of the bear element, Un-
certainty as to the position that would be
assumed by important operators and capitalista
recently returned from Europe was one of the
reasons for the interruption of the bear cam-
paign in stocks, For another thing @ rally
was considered due.

Rates for money were unchanged and there
was no special difloulty in securing accommo-
dation, Nevertheless, it was common belief
that rates would soon advance and that before
long, also, lenders would discriminate more
or in collateral, The flow of money to
the South and West continues and the Federal
Treasury has been gaining cash again from
the banks, The outlook is for a decline in the
cash holdings of the banks for several weeks
to come. Disbursement of interest by the
Government Oct, 1 will be of some help, but
the amount to be distributed here will be small
compared with the amount that will leave this
ceutre in the mé@antime, Bankers seem con-
fident that while money rates may move up,
there will be no actual pinch in money this fall,
Present conditions in money are certainly
better than at the same season in former years,

r

While mnore men may be induced to atrike,
or coerced into stopping work, the anthracite
miners’ strike is already pronounced a failure
Efforts to involve railroad employees in the
strike have not succeeded and are hardly likely
to. The miners’ strike was brought on by
men, whose real motives are believed to have
been hidden. Many of the miners have shown
distrust of these men. It is probably safe to
gay that there will not be another strike in the
anthracite regions in years. Labor generally
throughout the country well contented
There is plenty of work and the pay is good
It is recognized that this is a time for earning
and saviug and not for striking

The business on the Stock Exchange while
restricted was unusually well distributed. The
largest transactions were in Sugur Refining,
which lost fractionally in price. The effort
was continued to force liquidation by a pool
in the stock. News of the application for an
injunction against the reduction in the price
of gas in Chicago by the Municipal Gas Com-
pany, a subordinate company of the People's
Gas Company, was followed by a demand for
and an advance in People’s stock. There was
coveriug of shorts in Brooklyn Rapid Transit,
with a substantial improvement in the price
of the stock. There was a further fall in Ten-
nessee (coal and Iron on the expectation that
dividends would be suspended. Federal Steel
