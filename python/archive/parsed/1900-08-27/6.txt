Which the Ite ins have given it, be will
prove himself guilty of the very inconsistency
Which he charges uponthem. Other recreants
b gold boldly accept the consequences of their
etion, and, with Mr. Edward M. Shepard,
declare that a (nancial panic would be a small
price ti for the defeat of the Republican
party on the of imperialism. In their
Opinion, the expression of an opinion by the
American people on a purely theoretical ques-
tion, would be cheaply purchased by the pros-
tration of the country’s credit, the ruin of ita
fidustries, and by robbing confiding credi-
tors of thousands of millions of dollars honestly
due to them!

t violent denouncers of the present

all see in supporting the Democratic ticket a
chance for notoriety, and are hastening to
avail themselves of it.
Bryan, possess a certain amount of intellectual
ability, and their power for mischief is not to
be underrated. They, seemingly, are not de-
terred by the fact that Mr. Bryan will, if he
is elected, appoint a Secretary of the Treasury
who will do all in his power to weaken the
supremacy of the gold etandard, an Attorney
General and district attorneys who will be
hostile to corporations and to the employers
of labor, and that he will fill any vacancy that
may occur in the Supreme Court with a judge
like John P, Altgeld, who may be relied on to
give decisions in accordance with Popullstio
principles,

In the present contest, as in that which,
thirty odd yenra ago was waged for the main-
tenance of the Union, the forces of religion
and morality as well as of souad politics and
economics, are on the side of thé Republican
party; but as the country then did not feel sure
that the cause of the Union would triumph,
uotil the event proved it, so, now, thoughtful
citizens may be excused for doubting in ad-

vance the triumph of right.

market, and threatens to apread over the whole
