ALL HANDS PUT UP SUGAR

Because Raws Are Up, They Say—Usaal Stortes

An advance in the price of refined sugar was
made by all the sugar refining interests yester-
ey The Ainerican Sugar Refining Company

6 points in all grades of retined sugar except
Coarse granulated and extra fine granulated

PRODUCERS BLAME MILK DEALERS,

Say the Latter Adulterate the Pare Article |
Supplied Them and Want All the Profits.
Bennett

 

Aastatement was made by James I
of counsel to the Five States Milk Producers’
Association yesterday, after consultation with
members of the Executive Committee of the
assoctation who are here in conneetion with
the war between the farmers and the ety milk
dealers The statement says that it scemebut
fair thatthe public should be apprised of the
motives which are now actuating the farmers,
and continues

“Athough the demand for milk in the elty of
New York bus doubled within ten years the
price haa steadily declined to (he producer until
prior toa year ago, When (he present: move-
ment among the farmers began, the price of
nillk through them had dropped to an average

been continually sold in the elty of New York
and ta to-day for from to 10 cents per quart
The cost of tranaportation is about %4 cent per
quart) The farmer has be Heved and does be-
lieve that between these figures there ts ample
opportunity for the accomplishment of three
things: Virst, a reasonable price to the farmer,

the customer at preaent price and less; ar d,
third, not only a fair, but an extremely profit-

“There bas not only been this diserepaney tn
the price of milk, but the farmers have been
aware that the milk thas sold as pure milk by

uted) before delivery, The public, whom itis
conceded is interested in the milk qiestion,
may jude tor themselves as to how much een-

forts to obtain the very reasonable sum of 2

cents per quart for their roiik, whieh ts now
senroely one-third of the price whieh ih ulti.
mately brings to the consumer Tt certaialy

comes with dl grace from those who have heen
yromoters, supporters and beniflearies of the
Milk bxehange to charge the farmers with the
crime of promoting ao selfish combination
It any concern ought fo be stopped trom the
ature of itsown business tromerying ‘trust,’
it should be this body ofinen. We speak with
the utmost confidence In asserting that) no
farmer or dealer has ever anticipated fora
moment that the price of milk tothe eougumer
inthe eity of New York should be, or can be ad-
vanced!

The Milk Dealers’ Association said vesterday
inoremilk inthe cite than) the
dealers could sell, The shortage in the supply
usually furnished by menibers of the Five States
Association had been reduced, the dealer said,
day by dav untilit was estimated vesterday at
about 1,800 enns, bat the molk sent in from Gute
side sourees more than made up the difference

inthe attempt to bring the milk-distributiing
of the city under one control, had

FINANCIAL AND COMMERCIAL.

MonpayY, May 21.

‘Yo-day's stock murket was a severe disap-
pointment to both speculative factions. Those
who were long of stocks hoped that the settle-
ment of the local gas war would induce several
subatantial Interesta that are directly con-
cerned in the business to come into the market
as buyers of the shares of the various com-
panies with the management of which they
are identified. The bulls also indulged
in the hope that after the British publio
had exhausted its enthusiasm over the
relief of Mafeking, the speculative element
would turn to the atock market, and particu-
larly to the American department, to express
{ts confidence in thefuture, ‘Theshort interest,
or rather the traders who favor the short side
of the market, were as desirous as their
opponents of seeing a higher market to-day
because they had covered extensively on
Friday and Saturday and believed that they
would have an opportunity to put their lines
out again at a higher level to-day.

The opening was flat. The only sustaining fac-
tor was a sharp advance in Sugar Refining,
which was based upon an advance: of five cents
per 100 pounds in the price of refined sugars
that was foreshadowed in this column yester-

day. The bidding up of Sugar Refining
did not, however, offset the moderate
gelling by foreign arbitrage brokers and

the conspicuous absence of a local demand for
stocks through commission houses, There was
not the slightest indication that any one of the
important interests that, as occasion may offer,
endeavors to stimulate the market was taking
an active partin shaping the course of prices,
On the contrary, there was practically no mnar-
ket at all for Consolidated Gas during the first
hour of business, and the only animation in the
stock wax incidental to the uncovering of stock
orders, a circumstance that broke the price 5
points on light transactions, There was a sub-
sequent rally, but notwithstanding the stock
closed 2!, points lower than on Saturday on
sales of less than 3,000 shares.

The early disappointment discouraged trad-
ing andin consequence the total transactions
were unusually small. Sugar Refining sup-
plied more thanasixthof them, and in epite
of phe early advance closed nearly a point
lower than on Saturday Next to it the heay-
fest trading wasin the rafiway list,and Atchi-
son preferred, Union Pacifle common, St. Paul
and Chicago, Burlington and Quincey, which re-
ceived the inost attention, sustained net declines
of a point or more. A numberof the loss active
{asnies suffered even more severely, There was
renewed selling of the iron and steel stocks
which, as it encountered no opposition, lowered

the prices of all of them  matertally.
Without doubt many, tf not all of the
companies engaged in producing and

manufacturing fron and steeland the various
products of both, are making money on old
contracts and can even make a profit at present
prices, The fact that affects Wall Street and
its patronsis that the derand isnot as brisk as
it wasa vearor evensit months ago and that
prices have been shaded accordingly. An al-
most infallible index of the iron and steel mar-
kets is thatforscrap iron, which every manu-
factirer bas to use to an extent with new raw
material, Within the last two or three months
the price of high grade serap has declined
nearly 50 percent

The reaction in gas securities extended to
People's Gas, which was sold inoderately by
houses with close Chicago connections. Ttinay
be inferred from the source of the selling that
Chicago speculators and possibly investors at
that centre also are beginning to appreciate
that they liveina virtually bankrupt and cere
tainly a discredited municipality, and also that
the wholesale exodus of working people from
the city because of the actlon of the labor
unions islikely to reduce the volume of busi-
ness and therefore the profits of every local
enterprise. In the late dealings a long dor-
mant short interest in Third Avenue was dis-
turbed and on transactions aggregating less
than 3.000 shares aoonet advance of 5's
points was récorded. This movement started
covering in the other local traction stocks,
notably in Metropolitan Street Railway.
Finally the entire list responded fractionally,
but the improvement was not sufficient to wipe
out the declines that had taken place except in
@ very few The was fairly
steady, but very quiet, and the average of final
prices was considerably below that of Sature
day

What might have been foreseen in the cotton specula-
tion happened to day=that 1s, heavy liquidation bs
bull interests discouraged by the continued dulness
of the speculation, duiness and depression jn spot
markets, the weakness in cotton goods and other fab-
ries, the general decline in staples, the multiplytin
evidences that the boom in general trade has reache
its culminatiom the sharp deciine at the Stock Ex-
change, the dulness at Manchesterand finally a fall
in prices at Liverpool Purthermore, the weather was
fine and crop advices were generally favorable. The
South sold the next crop heavily. The buying was
mostly tocover shorts, The result of the day's de-
velopments was a sharp decline, especially on thie
crop.

Loulaville and Evansville Bond Decision,

In the suit of the New York and Security
Trust Compuny against the Louisville, Evans

ville and St. Louis Railroad Judge Woods of t
United States Cirenit Court at leaanapele bee
handed down a decision that seriously affects
the bond issne of the railroad) The decision
declares in effect that the $470,000 of the second
mnort@age bonds which were not exchanged
for the Consolidated 5a issued in 1880 are the
only bonds of that issue alive and valid. Sec-
ond mortgage bonds on the Eastern division of
the road to the amount of $2.330,000 are held to
be invalid because they were exchanged for
the consolidated mortgage bonds. Most of
wee bonds are believed to be held in Louis-
ville.
