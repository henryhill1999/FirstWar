referred to the Ways and Means Committee

Mr. Gardner (Kep, No J.) moved that the

subject now on the statute books was practically

declared the bill passed

Mr. Gardner then called up the bill giving the

4 States jurisdiction over goods made by prison
labor

Mr. Bailey wanted to know why the commit.

tee had not included a provision making goods

manufactured by trusts also subject to the laws

of the States. The State represented in part
by the gentleman who stood sponsor for the
bill was than any other the home of
trusts, and trust-made goods were inflicting
more injury upon the people than goods made
by convicts. Why, heasked, had not an anti-
trust provision been incorporated io the bill

Mr. Gardner said the Committee on Labor
had no jurisdiction in the matter. it properly
belong d to the Judiciary Commitiee

Mr. Williams (lem , Miss) said the impres-
sion thatthe committe» was more anxious to
prot ct the trusts could be removed by an
amendment to the bill inaking goods manufaec-

OLDHAM TO NAME

NEBRASKA ORATOR CHOSEN TO MAKE
THE NOMINATING SPEECH,
Decision Made by the Nebraska Delegation
After a ference With Bryan—Editor of
the Omaha “World-Herald” to Represent
Bryan on the Platform Committee,

LINCOLN, Neb, May 21. William D. Oldham
of Nebraska will nominate William J. Bryan for
President at the coming National Convention
of the Democrats at KansasCity. Theselection
was monde at a meeting of the Nebraska delega-
tion here to-day a‘ter a conference with Mr
Bryan, and the presumption that he was chosen
by Mr. Bryan is strengthened by interviews
with members of the delegation

The delegation elected James (
national committeeman, WH.
chairman of the delegation and R. 1. Metcalfe,
editor of the World-Herald, formerly edited by
Bryan, as the Nebraska member of the Com-
mittee on Resolutions. This is taken to mean
that Mr, Metcalfe will be the medium through
which Mr. Bryan will communicate his platform
views to the committee, At the conclusion of
*the conference, the perty drove to Mr
suburban farin as bis cuests

Mr. Brvan states that nothing was done other
than the selection of the gentlemen named
The Vice-Presidency matter was not brought
up in any form, Mr. Oldham corroborate
this. He says that it had been agreed among
the delegates before the conference that this
matter should be put off untilarrival at Kansas
City. Sevegal of the delegates are privately in
favor of the selection of Towne, but say that
they propose to be guided by Mr. Bryan. As
matters now stand any action the delegation
might take would be regarded, they say, as in-
dicative of Mr. Bryan's personal wishes.

Mr. Oldham is one of the best orators in the
State. Heisat present Deputy Attorney-Cen-
eral. Heisa Southerner by birth Nebraska
will ask of the convention the honor of present-
ing its favorite son and believes it will be cheer-
fully granted,

12TH'’S TROUBLES AT CREFEDMWOOR.

A Marksman's Attempt to Cheat— Whiskey?
Yes, "Twas a Wet Day and They Needed It.
Stories from Creedmoor, L. f, concerning

troublous times which the Twelfth Regiment

had there on Saturday have been drifting into
town, Three men of the regiment came pretty
near getting and keeping marksmanship medals
to which they were not entitled when they re
turned to New York on Saturday evening.

n actually did get the medals,

to surrender them be-

fore they reached the city. The third was
detected {n an attempt to secure one. Col,

George R. Dyor said last night that the trouble

was due to the fact that the men were recruits

and didnot know just what the requirements

Within afew months the regiment had

recruited more than six hundred men, he said,
bringing its membership up next to the Sev-
enth's. It took to Creedmoor 650 men, of whom
657 qualified as marksmen Those figures
spoke for themselves as to the general work of

the regiment at the range, Col. Dyer said
Col. Dyer said that two of his men who knew

no better had presenved their score cards and
rec'ived medals when they had shot only at
the 100-yard and 200-yard targets, and not at
the 400-vard target. This fact was discovered
by Lieut.-Col. N. B. Thurston of the ‘Twenty-
second Reg ment, {inspector of small arms
and Co}
Dyersentforthe men They had not signed
the cards or got any one to sian them, but had
merevy handed them in because they were told
to do so, they said, and had received the
medals. The medals were taken from them,
The third man in trouble over the markaman-
ship question hada darker case. Col, Thurston
eaid last night that when the man handed in
his card for the 300-yard range it recorded a
total of 12, while 15 was required for qualifica-
did not qual-
a mise

tion. He told the man the score
ify him and the man sald that there was
as the footing should
Rain had partly obliterated some of the
figures and the scorer was sent for,
He had not signed the card, he sald) The
man then said a friend had made it out for
him, and afterward he confessed that he had
done it himself, as the range had closed after
his first shot, Col Thurston told him that he
wasa liarand a would-be thief and that it was
as bad to steal a marksmanship medal aait Was
tosteala watch. Hesent the manto report to
Col. Dyer. Theman's 100-yard and 200-yard
scores were all might

As stories that the Twelfth men were
drunk at Creedmoor, Col. Dyer said that
three men were drunk, but that they were not
disorderiy. He said aso that owing to the
weather the Major hagsaid that he would not
be responsible for the health of the men if they
were not permitted to drink. Col, Thurston
said that they were thoroughly under Col
Dyer's control on Saturday

A despatch from Creedmoor published yester-
dav said that several non-commissioned officers
had been reduced to the ranks and several pri-
vates diseharged. Col, Dyer suid that there
was notruth in the statement and that no one
had been punished, He was satisfled that the
record was a good one

mena, County Antrim, Were passengers aboard
thesteamship Anchoria,which arrived yesterday
from Glasgow and Moville, They came in the
steerage in charge of the stewardess, They
are Thomas, Mary Ellen, Annie, Robert and
Jennie Graham, aged respectively 11, 10,
9, 6 and 3 years. Mary Ellen acted as
the mother of the three youngest, and
felt mighty proud of her job. Their
real mother died in childbirth three years ago
and the father lived only a year afterward
The relatives of the children th Ireland were
too poor to take care of them, 80 they were sent
to the almshouse at Ballymena, The children's
aunt and uncle at Lynwood, Livingston county,
this State, were informed of the children’s
plight by another aunt living at Ballymena
The Lynwood aunt and uncle then sent tickets
to bring the children here. They will be de-
tained untilthe Lynwood relatives appear a

the check to Jimmy Dime for Mahoney's
Appearance, and put on a show that proved
Inst night to be one of the best ever
held at the club. The first) bout was
for ten rounds at 115 pounds, between
Johnuy Hines of Williamsburg and Hush
MePaiden of South Brooklyn, The latter's
seconds threw up the sponge in the tourth

round, The next bout was for ten rounds at
125 pounds. It was between Jack Derricks of
Woodhaven and Billy La Rose of Brookiva
Derricks was too imuch for La Rose, who re-
fused to fight back. The police stopped affairs
in the first round and Derricks got the verdict

The third bout was the stellar event of the
night Johnny Reichman of Williamsbure met
