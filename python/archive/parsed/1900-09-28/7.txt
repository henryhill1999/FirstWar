The route and plans of construction for a
rapid transit tunnel to Brooklyn reported to
Chief Engineer Parsons were adopted by the
Rapid Transit Board yesterday, nobody dis-
seuting and the Mayor absent The plan is
to extend the Broadway tunnel to Bowling
Green and under Whitehall street to the Kast
River, Crossing under theriver, the tunnel will
reach the Brooklyn shore at the footof Jora-
lemon street between Furman street and the
shore line, run under Joralermon street to City
Hall, where there will be a station; then under
Fulton street to Flatbush and Atlantle avenues,
where for the present will be the tersyinus

The river part of the tunnel with its ap-
proaches, from Bowling Green on the New York
aide to near the City Hall in Brooklyn will con-
aist of cast fron tubes of fifteen-foot inside
diameter, forming practically a separate tunnel
for each track. Two loops will be built at the
Brooklyn City Hall, one below the other, One
of thease will be used for New York trains. The
other will be constructed with a view to the
future when the extension of the tunnel fur-
ther into Brooklyn will necessitate the running
of local trains within that borough. The sim-
ultangous building of the two superposed loops
will mean a saving of money. ‘The approaches
to the loops, from Henry street on one side and

from Smith and Jay streets on the other, will
be wide enough to leave room for four tracks
The plans also provide for an additional
loop on the New York side, beginning under
Broadway. somewhere near tachange place,

TRADERS’ DIRECTORS TO MAKE GOOD.

They Will Assame the Losses of the Wrecked
Inserance Company To Meet To-day.

The examination of the papers submitted
by the State Insurance Department in the case
of the Traders’ Fire Insurance Company, the
reports of which have been found to have been
falsified, waa completed yesterday by Assistant
District Attorney Unger, to whom the case has
been turned over with the view to determine
what persons can be held liable for the falsifl-
cation of the company's report Mr Unger
naid yesterday that he had not finished with
the case by any means, as the examination of
the papers in his possession had shown him
that the company had been wrecked and that
some one was responsithe for it. To determine
who the persons were, he said, 4 more extended

investigation would be undertaken at once
by the District Attorney The facts already
obtained by the State Insurance Department

will be laid before the October Grand Jury and

the indictment of those officers of the company
who signed the falsified report will be asked
for Mr. Unger was very careful to say that
it should not be inferred trom this that he had
concluded that no other persons could be held

“As to the directors, all of them are respon-
sible in a civil way for any lasses that may

have been incurred, but that is a matter for
civil action. Senator Depew, | am informed,
has the director habit He and others are
interested in so many companies tbat tt is a
hysical impossibility for them to give atten-
fon to their management, As long as they
stand ready to make good losses, the law is
satisfied.’ ;

In his examination of

that more persons had been in

stolen tank on the coals, heat the rivets that
held it together and then break them off with
a chisel and hammer

Zeltner wen' to the Bedford avenne police

Touls Parry, an Itatian barber of East New
York avenue, was convicted in the County
Court in Brooklyn yesterday of forgery inthe
second degree in having forged names to cer-
tifleates of citizenship and sold them to Italians
who were unable to pasa the proper examination
in the courts. The complaining witness was
Salvatore Cerri of 780 Stone avenue. He tes-
tifled that he wanted to get a place in the Street
Cleaning Department, but his application was
rejected because he was not a citizen. He
explained the matter to Perry, who promised
to get him a certificate on the payment of $12
Perry, it was alleged, secured a duplicate cer-
tifleate and then erased the orginal name by
means of acids and inserted Cerri's name
The certificate was subsequently found to be
worthless and then Cerri caused Perry's arrest
Perry was formerly an interpreter. employed
intheSupreme Courtin Brooklyn. Itis believed
that he did a big business in making citizens

definite action.

FINANCIAL AND COMMERCIAL,

Tacnanar, Sept. 27

There was considerable activity in the early
dealings in stocks to-day, with a substantial
improvement in prices, I|.ater the transactions
were somewhat reduced in volume, but there
was little shrinkage in values, so that the closing
figures disclosed good gains for the day for most
stocks. The impetus to operations at the be-
ginning was derived from the general belief
that effective measures were maturing for the
termination of the strike in the anthracite coal
revions. The subsequent check in the trading
was due to the fact that the more urgent demand
for stocks to cover shorts and for other purposes

 

had been st pplied

It ia hardly to be supposed that the ending
of the coal strike will be followed by a sustained
upward movement in stocks. The precipita-
tion of the strike was not specially unsettling

With clearer weather at the Northwest, some decline
there and nothing sthuulating in the English cables,
wheatat first declined slightly Che Northwesern
Miller says the outputof flour will probably be reduced,
owing to dullness of trade, the relatively high price of
wheat and high ocean freight rates, which prevent ex

In the absence of frost or rain cotton prices were

determined bythe crop movement which was large
and accordingly led to a decline though there was at
one time a temporary raliy due to predictions of
colder weather everywhere in the cotton belt, rainin

‘Texas, Loulsana and Alabama, and covering of
shorts. Hut the receipts were large, larger not
only than last week but also than a4 year
ago, the estimates for New Orleans and Houston
tomorrow were inereased, and tt looks to
many as though the receipts at the ports
this week will be 25,000 bales larger than
for while the quantity

the same week last year,
brought into sight seems Yivel'y to be over 100,000
bales more than last week. The speculation, too, was
a smaller aud far less enthusiastic affair than
recently. Europe and the South did little, the buat
ness was confined largely to local operators, and the
remarkably small stocks on both sides of the water
and the distinctly bullish tenor of the detatled official
State reports now being received cut no figure in the
market, unless it may have been to discourage any
very aggressive operations for a decline.
