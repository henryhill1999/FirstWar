DIGGING GOLD IN NEW JERSEY.

Yellow Metal Found tn Gravel Brought Up

New Bronswick, N.J., Sept. 27.—It ts sald
that gold was discovered recently on the farm
of George C. Belloff who lives just beyond the
Piscataway Poor Farm on the Stelton-New-
market road. The gold, it is sald, was dis
covered by Mr. Belloff while digging a well and
he gave the matter into the hands of J. F

standing that if Mr Bowman worked

“JUNE” BATTIN INCOMPET

Son of a Newark Millionatre Will Be Gent to «
Sanitariam.

Sylvester 8. Battin, better known in Maiden
lane and in Newark as “June” Battin, was ad-
judged yesterday incompetent to manage his
own affairs. The decision was reached by a jury
in the Fasex county court house. The commission
was appointed by the Chancery Court and con-
sisted of Judge Frederick Stevens, Dr. David
L. Wallace and J. H. 8. Clarke. A guardian
was appointed and young Battin will be put
in@ sanitarium. He concurs in the arrange-
ment, saying that he wants to be put out of
reach of temptation. It was charged in the
complaint that he wasted his income in drink

and riotous living

Battin is 88 years old and has been in the
Jewelry business since boyhood. He was 4
member of the firm of William Kerr & Co., and
drew something like $10,000 a year profit for sev-
eral years before leaving the firm. He went
into other ventures later with disastrous results,
and last July he disappeared while employed by
Louis Strasburger & Co, of 9 Maiden lane. The
allegation was then pace that about $10,000
worth of diamonds departed with him. The
firm is said to have recovered everything, and
Battin returned to Newark. His father t4 a
millionaire and is the President of the Manufac-
turers’ National Bank of Newark. He was
formerly President of the street car lines in
Newark, and made a large sum of money_by
selling his stock to the reorganizers.
grandfather was Joseph Battin of Elisabeth,
the maker of the first automobile in this country,
a steam carriage, which he operated in 1866 nntil
forced to stop because it frightened horses in
the streets. goseph Battin died about five
years ago. He willed a large portion of his
estate to the Christian Scientists,

BLAIR REPLIES TO CROUCH.
Says He Himself Advanced Money to Support
the GriMith Child.

George Blair, Superintendent of the Out-
Door Poor, arrived in the city yesterday after
@ week's trip up the State. He was much
disturbed by published statements about the
case of George Crouch, who was arrested and
locked up in the West Thirtieth street station
on Monday night on the charge of Edna Griffith
She accused him of failing to support her child
Mr. Crouch said the proceeding savored of
blackmail and that he had paid Blair $000 for
the support of the child, though required to

ay only $3 a week and that when he refused
© put up $400 more he was threatened with
mn Mr. Blair made the following atate-
ment:

“The case was brought before me in October,
1899, and Crouch requested that Edna Griffith
be sent for and asked what she would accept
and not prosecute She said that if she got

400 at once she would take care of the child,

rouch said he did not have the money and |

offered to pay for the child's care until he was
able to settle. She refused to wait unless he
paid for her support alao
months, $1u a week, and after that $5 a week
1 urged him to settle the case as I waa being
annoyed too much. I have for months ad-
vanced him from $30 to $40 and was obliged to
rye after him to get money due me have

is letters, in which he asks me to be lenient.
He now owes me $41 and his refusal to carry
out his contract compelled me to act, as Miss
Griffith tnsisted upon the case going forward
All this can be verified by his counsel, who of-
fered to lend him the money to wind up the
case. I notified his counsel that the case would
go to court in ten days ”

Mr. Blair left the city last night for a trip
through the South.

CONE MUST PAY.

FISH DEALER

Court Holds He Violated Law in Exposing
Trout for Sale in Close Season,

Supreme Court Justice Gaynor tn Brooklyn
handed down a decision yesterday in favor
of the State of New York in the suit begun
by Game Protector J. Warren Pond against
Charles H. Cone, a wholesale fieh dealer at
107 South street, Manhattan, to recover $104
and costs, the penalty for having exposed
for sale brook trout during the close season,
Fight brook trout were seized on March 16,
last. Mr. Cone put in a counter claim for $1,500

damages he had sustained to his business owing |

to the action of the State Game Protector during
the years 1896, 1897, 1898 and 1899. Heeontended
that he had correspondents throughout the
United States that were sending trout to him,
and that the trout seized by the State Game
Protector in March last had not been caught
in the State of New York but in the State of
Massachusetta, He held that the seizure
of the fish under these circumstances was an

infringement on his rights and that the State |

should pay him for the damages he had sus-
tained, as the Game Protector had no right to
seize the fish which had not been caught in
this State.

State Game Protector Pond contended that
it was immatertal where the fish was caught,
as the etatute forbade any person selling
of exposing for sale brook trout during the
close season, The fish were seized because
ther were exposed for sale and this. he con-
tended. was a violation of Section 105 of the
State Game and Fish laws. Justice Gaynor
decided that the fact that Mr. Cone had exposed
the fish for sale during the close season made
ita violation and gave judgment for the State.

by Chief Devery last Thursday afternoon in a
very unsteady position on the corner of

Macdougal and Houston «streets, was put on |

trial yesterday before Commissioner Abell on

charges of intoxication and conduct unbeocom- |

ing an officer. Sergeant Petty of the Mac-
dougal street station testified that when Wicke
was brought into the station by Chief Deverv's
special policeman his uniform was covered with
mud and his breath wasn't that of a sober man
On one side of his face wasa lump as big sa an
orange. The Chief came in very indignant soon
afterward.

had been eurreriog, from gastric catarrh and had

ELEVATED PLATFORM TORN UP.
Overhang Third Rat! and the Shoe Made
Splinters Fly.

The Brooklyn Rapid Transit Company put
into operation, yesterday afternoon, the new
third rail electrical service to Bath Beach by
way of the Fifth Avenue Elevated road to
Thirty-sixth street and thence by the old West
End Route. The first train over the road made
the trip to Bath Beach without accident
the motor car with two passenger coaches was
drawing into the atation at
on the return trip, the shoe which
fits on the third rail caught the edge of
the platform and ripped it up from end
to end. Several persons who were standing
on the platform barely escaped injury from
flying splinters. It was afterward found that
the station platform hung several inches over
the new third rail which was recently laid.
The motor car was slightly damaged.

what warrants had been obtained The cases

fenders were brought into the police courts

orders to stop all soft coal nuisances in the
city. He expected they would soon have
several cases in court

DO YOU WANT AN APARTMENT

OR A DWELLING HOUSE,
5 READ THIS!

There never was a time in the history of New
York when there was such’a large and abun-
dant supply of housing to let tn proportion to

emand as this year. The resalt ts that
hundreds of owners are offering reduced
rents, while others, though nominally main-
taining the old rents, make concessions in the
way of free occupancy. No tenant can be sare
that he is obtaining the terms he Is entitled to
according to the actual condition of the mar-
ket without an extended tour of investigation
and of diplomatic negotiations with agents.
Save yourself the necessity of a personal search
and of useless debates by inserting an adv. itn
THE SUN stating the kind of accommodation
you want and the approximate location, This
will secure for you the best terms the market
has to offer.
