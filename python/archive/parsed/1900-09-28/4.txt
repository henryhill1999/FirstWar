Brooklyn's victory over the Boston team at
Washington Park yesterday was marred by sev-
eral outbursts of disorder on the part of the
players and the ejection of Capt. Kelley of the
Champions in the sixthinning. Kelley haa pub-
Holy declared that he will kick against umpires’
dects in spite of the wishes of President
Ebbets and Manager Hanlon, It was in the
most exciting part of the fray that Kelley

showed his power over his employers In the
first half of the sixth inning, with Hamilton on
ong bunted in front of the plate Far.
n't @et the ball quickly and threw high
who had to Jump in the air to get it
hed the bag with the throw a id Um:
t called him safe. Kelley left his
the run and yelled that Lona had
on his foot Instead of the bag and was
consequently out
in the last half of the inning Keeler bunted
s. The latter threw wide and Tenn
ed to leave his base to nab the ball,
was there almultaneously, but Hurst
m out This was too much for Kelley,
it the umpire full tilt He was assisted
roar by She rd and Keeler, who in-
it the r 1 was wrong. Kelley
re o sit down when ordered to do so and
Hurst put him out of the game. Many spec-
tors t at Hurst for what they said was
infairness, but there were others
mmended the umpire for having the
nerve to give his decisions without prejudice,
{fn the next inning Hurst made two close decis-
lo ist the Bostons, which drew excitable
\ several of the beaneaters

Barring these disorderly incidents, the game
was a good thing to look at. It was filled with
ays and went along so rapidly that

ipleted in one hour and forty minutes
Tt was a battle of pitchers, too, MoGinnity
taking the honors from the long-le@ged Willis
Modinnity, after a rest of two days, showed
thatheisby nomeans worn out. Hehad terrific
speed, a fine change of pace, and his raise ball

FOOTBALL.

CAMBRIDOR, Sept. 27,.--The Harvard "Varsity
eleven continued its slump of Wednesday after-
noon in to-day’a practice, in two ten-minute
halves it was unable to score against the third
eleven. On the other hand the third eleven
was able to force the ‘Varnity’s centre for
considerable gains and secured the ball from
the ‘Varsity on downs when the ‘Varsity had
carried it to the third’s 16-yard ine. 80 there
waa little comfort for the large number of old

coaches who flocked to Cambridge anxious
over the poor showing the ‘Varsity has been
making, That the coaches appreciate the
sertousness of the situation will be
realized when it ie known that
Dr. W, A. Brooks, ex-captain and ex-head
coach; W. Cameron forbes, ex-head coach; B. G,
Waters, ex-captain and ex-head coach, and
R. M. Emmons, ex-captain, were on hand anx-
iously following the practice, Besides these
notables, Malcolm Donald, ‘90, one of the best
tackles Harvard ever had, came out for the
first time, while Jack Moulton, ‘98, end rush,
Dudley Cochrane, '90, celebrated for his
puning, with Coach Lewis and Head-coach

Jibblee were active inthe coaching. Waters had
on his old leather sujt, exhorting the players.

he practice to-day was held op the ‘Varsity

eld for the first time this year. This was not
wholly an advantageous chang Hereto-
fore the four elevens of the ‘VaPsity squad
have used the freshman and class football
flelds, while to-day all four were forced to prac-
tice on one gridiron. This forced two elevens
to walt while the other two played a practice

ame. The preliminary work in tackling the

ummy, sprinting and falling on the ball was
cut out today

New Haven, Sept. 27.—Dick Sheldon, who
played on the Yale eleven three years ago and
since then has been conapicuous as a member
of the New York A. ©. Joined the Yale foot-
ball squad this afternoon, He was put to work,
but did not get a place in the line-up. Sheldon
is a clever athlete and he will be a valuable
man provided he cankeep up in hia studie
and play the game. There were two me
injured In the practice this afternoon. The
are Ferguson and Elliott of the third and fourth
elevens. Neither is seriously Injured) The
yractice was flerce as usual while it lasted

{cBride and Cutten ain did the coaching
and they made ehinee huro Oleott who was
Capt. Brown's running mate as guard on the
‘90 eleven returned this afternoon. He was
at once put Into the game as centre rush on the
"Varsity. He seems to be the man selected
for this place as Hale has been made a fixture
in the back fleld. Olcott ts a strapping big
fellow. and very strong. The coaches believe
he will make a fine centre The return of
Oleott changed the line-up this afternoon. It
was:

*Varsity—Centre, Olcott; usta, Brown and
Goss; tackles, Bloomer and Kunzig:; ends, Coy and
Gould; quarter, Fincke; half backs, Miller and Chad-
wick; full back, Hale

Second Eleven--Centre, Tomlinson; ards, Boyne
and Hamiin: tackles, Hooker and Frances; ends,
Wallace and Dupee; quarter, Wear; half backs, Wil
heimy and Adams: full back, Hyde

The ‘Varsity line will probably be changed
again before the opening game of the season
with Trinity on Saturday. Beck was not able
to play to-day and will probably be out of the

ame for some time. The manager of the

*rinceton team was here to-day conferring
with the Yale manager, but the manager: de-
clined to inake any statements after the con-
ference

The second day of home practice for Col-
umbia brought with it another new batch of
candidates. O'Gorman, Romig, Pitake, Kohrs,
Dugro, Bruce and Twyeffort were the new-
comers, although Bruce made his mark at
quard last year. The only elementary work
done was in getting the men down the fleld on
kicks and tackling the backs upon catches
The prettiest arop kicking seen for some time
at Columbia was by Ashley. Sanford was en-
thuslastic andrepeatedly said thatthe Western
boy was the best drop kicker he had ever
seen The line play was begun
on the ‘Varaity's ten vard line,
with the ball in the hands of the “scrub” te
After gaining a few yards the latter were
on downs, and Weekea punted out of de
In two fifteen-minute halves the ‘Varsity scored
only once on a fine run by Weekes, who made
thirty yards through guard for a touchdown
Van Hoevenberg made a second long run on a
catch of a kick, but play was stopped before a
touchdown could be scored The college team
held the ‘Varsity in good style, and frequently
broke through the line for small gains Twyefe
fort, the new half back, broke his collar bone
early in the play and had to leave the field.
Burchell was moved to tackle and Bruce placed
at hia old position of guard inthe 'Varsity line-
up. O'Gorman did fair work at fullt and
may be the man forthe place. Hennen was on
the fleld and is expec 4 to play to-day. The
‘Varsity lined up as follows

McCallom, left end: Austin, left tackle; Bri
giiard: Murphy, centre: Ache, right guard: Burchell,
right tackle; Ashley, r ght end; Van Hoevenberg and
Goodman, quarter backs; Weekes. right half back;
Holman, left half back; Goodman full back.

WHITNEY COLORS IN FRONT:

KILLASHANDRA SCORES WITH TOP
WEIGHT IN THE OCEBEANVIEW.

mu @ and Telamon Capture the Other
Handicaps at Gravesen errane and
Cherries Back Up the Gol ch Filly and
Talent Breaks Ev on the Day.

The soaroity of stake features seemed to
make little difference in the attendance or the
quslity of the sport at Gravesend yesterday,
Those who were not tempted out by the weather
made the trip with a view to winning Morris
Park expenses and a fair proportion succeeded,
as after a false atep in the first rave, three fav-
orites rolled home in cheerful sequence.

W. C. Whitney arrived in time to see his grand
filly Killashandra win the principal event on
the card. This was the Oceanview Handi-
cap, for three-year-olda at one mile and
a sixteenth. The speedy Goldfinoh filly
was always at odds on although she
receded from 7 to 10 to 8 to 10 owing to per-
sistent play on Gonfalon and 4 mild plunge on
Withers which cut his pricefrom 10 toi to 8to 1.
Killashandra carried the topwelght but that
did not prevent her from racing around on
the outside of Gonfalon and opening up 4 eap
of nearly three lengths, Turner steadied her
on the curve for home, and Henry went for
her with Hildreth’s colt. It looked ike a hot
drive for a few momenta but when Turner
found he had the best mount, he kidded along
to the end and won with a [ot to spare by @
neck. The others were strung out with Gree-
nock In third position

The handicap dash for all ages lost much of
its attractiveness through the withdrawal
of Voter. The plungers jumped to the conclu-
sion that the other Keene candidate must be
a real good thing and they made him @ steady
7 to 6 favorite It was a case of take your
ick between Meehanue and Modrine while
Musette, the only other one left in after the Voter
scare subsided, went to the post at7 tol, Odom
took the top weight, Modrine, to the front in
the first sixteenth with the utmost confidence
Unmasked raced himself to death in outfooting
Meehanua, but lasted long enough to poke his
nose in front of Modrine. The latter forged
ahead again and won easily by two lengths
from Meehanus who tackled Unmasked again
and beat him half a length

The full fleld of seven accepted for the two-
yoer-ong handicap with the odds slightly in
avor of Silverdale over Telamon, The Rhymer
and Fake. The Rhymer tried to spreadeagle
his fleld and almost succeec but_ Henry
persevered with Telamon and dre the Hanover
colt home by a head. Dr. Barlow beat Kim-
berly a head in a lively contest for the short
end of the purse

Serrano started the favorites’ wave. by
beating Compensation a length and a half in
the second race on the card. Spencer went
on an exoursion with The Tournament horse
but moved up strongly toward the end and
snatched the place by a head from Alsike
Nea ly all of the eight two-year-old fillies in
the selling dash found a following, but Cherries,
the logical as well as actual favorite, ran up to
Luck, when Shaw called on her and won cleverly
by a length and a half

The surprise of the day was reserved for the
aixth race, in which Radford carried so much
money that his odds dropped to 1 to &
had a troublesome passage, but finally took the
overland route and had the race in hand at the
last sixteenth pole Henry ceased riding, but
young Miles on the 60 to 1 shot Belgrade, kept
on flogging and won by half a length before
Henry woke up. Summary

NEWS OF THE WHEELMEN,

the Duties of ‘‘Bike Cops"’
Cases of Scorching.

Discussing io

There is an active discussion going on among
local riders concerning what is the duty of a
bike cop,” in a case of “scorching.” It might
as well be noted that those discussing it are
all in a greater or lesser degree “scorchers.”
The inspiration of it all is a couple of recent
occurrences in which it is alleged that a “bike
cop,” who was standing beside his wheel on
a roadway, thrust his bicycle in front of an
approaching “scorcher” in order to compel
him to the choice of stopping or taking a big
tumble. One rider is said to have taken a
tumble because he could not stop in time and
it ia this case that a clique of clubmen are dis-
cussing The set who are interested are those
who know all the “hike cops” Y name and
know how fast they can ride. Most of them
ride them es on their ability to “run away”
rom this or that officer. A reporter of THE
Sun. happened innocently to get in a group
of the indignant ones yesterday and what he
heard was not flattering to either side of those
in ved in the question. Said one who took
the lead in the agitation

“We've got not i s letting ‘cops’ do that
‘ones place is to ch t
and catch him. That's what he's }

If he can't do that he has no busi
fob He has no right to put anytl

CLOSE CALL FOR CRESCEUS,

LION RACE BY ONLY A NOSE.

ley Herr Mak Hot Pace for the Oham-
pion and Wias Two EF
Trotter Arion Not Dangerous
First Heat-Itana Captures 23:36 Pace.

Boston, Sept. 27.—The 15,000 persons who
went to Readville this afternoon witnessed
the five greatest heats ever trotted in the race
for the stallion championship of the world,
Cresceus, George E. Ketoham's chestnut horse,
proved his right to the title of “king of trotting
stallions” by winning the event, and his owner
receives the lion’s share of the purse of $20,000
offered by the New England Breeders’ Asso-
clation. David Cahill'’s Charley Herr made
a hot pace for the champion, winning the first
two heats in eaplendid style and only missed
by a nose in getting the third. The heata
were wonderful for the Keadville track, the
first three being trotted in 2:07, the fourth
in 207% and the fifth in 208%, and Cresceus
added this championship event to his two,
three and eight heat record races

The day was an ideal one for the noted trot-
ters and seven responded to the word. Idolita,
the eighth entry, was drawn before the start,
Besides Cresceus and Charley Herr, there were
Lord Vincent, Grattan Boy, Arion, Jupe and
Benton M. There was great applause when
the horses came out for the first heat, Jupe,
Arion and Cresceus being the favorites with
the crowd. Ketcham’'s trotter waa the most
fancied in the poolroom, selling at 100 to 80
before the animals appeared on the track and
was then barred from the betting. After the
first heat he was again auctioned at 100 to
40. After scoring several times the horses
got away, with Grattan Boy tothe pole. Arion
passed him before reaching the quarter and
Charley Herr went up into second place at
that mark. The quarter waa coveréd in 51
seconds. Arion maintained his lead until the
half and three-quarter poet had been pass
in 102% and 1:84%, respectively. Comin
around the turn Charley Herr began to craw
up on the local stallion and headed him in the
stretch. There was a hard fight between the
two, but Arion could not increase his speed,
and Charley Herr won by half a length. Cres-
ceus broke immediately after the start, but
came home an easy third

In the second heat Charley Herr took the
lead at the word and never was headed. Cres-
ceus went into second place at the first turn,
but on the back stretch Grattan Boy moved
up and headed the champion. Rounding into
the home stretch, Cresceus went after Hert in
a great burst of speed, but Kelly plied the whip
vigorously and succeeded in winning by 4&
length. Cresceus went out for the third heat
and at the quarter was halfa length in the rear
of Charley Herr. At the half, Cresceus had
lost a little and Grattan Boy gave him a goon
the turn for home, but Ketcham drove his
horse under the wire {in a eplendid finish, a nose
to the good. It was so close that many of the
spectators believed that it was Charley Herr's
race

Cresceus was over &
on the backstretch in the fourth heat, with
Grattan Boy on his flank. Both moved up-at
the second turn and then Cresceus went up
into a winning lead of twolengths The cham-
pion led all the way in the fifth and deciding
heat. Charley Herr gave him a hard “go” to
the three-quarter post, but Cresceus inerecaod
his speed and won. Horse and driver received
a great ovation, and Ketcham was forced to
go into the grand stand and make a speech.

Ituna won over the favorite, Fred W., in the
2.16 pace, after the latter had captured two
heats. The other two events on the card were
left unfinished until to-morrow. Summaries

Rain yeaterday morning made the track
heavier and slower than it has been. It re-
quired only one heat in each to dispose of the
2:26 ang the 2:2] trots unfinished from Wednes-
Gay n the former “Gipsey” Haight went
out from the start and won the heat and money.
Charles Welland's Russell T., piloted by Mo;
Bride, did the same act In the 2:21 class, and
then Mr. Welland turned around and put the
welding in the 2:18 trot, the first heat of whic
he won in handy style, His owner reasone:
that Russell 1T.'’@ Speedway training, in his
own and Mike Teonard’s hands, fitted him
for golng a race every day; but he was unable
to get better than second place in the next
three heats, which were won by an Ohfo bred
horse, Mike W., a son of Pat Shank's Elyria,

Helen D., a clever pacing mare owned by
J. W. Daly and driven by Dan Maloney, was
picked to win by the Westchester county boys,
She is a handsome green mare that has gone
trial miles in 215. Elsie E., however, the mare
that Willlam Freer recently sold to Mr, Wei-
land, stepped out and took the first two heats
from Helen D. in a hard race down the stretoh
In the third heat Wesley and Minstrel made a
drive for it down the stretch. They wero
going under the wire necks apart, all
under the whip, when Elsie made a akip at the
wire. She caught in a stride or two, however,
and finished first. The judges, much to the
astonishment of the experta, set her back to
sixth place for running and awarded the heat to
Wesley. Helen D. easily won the fourth heat,
when, on account of darkness, the race was
put over until to-day
There was only little improvement in the
starting and much time was lost in repeated
scoring. Summaries
