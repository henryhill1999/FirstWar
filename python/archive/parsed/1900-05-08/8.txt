GATES BOSS, SELIGMAN OUT.

RESIGNATIONS rROM AMERICAN
STEEL AND WIRE BOARD.

 

 

The Seligmans Wont Stay Hecause Gates pid
Not Retire—He Comes Out Smiling Broadly
and Goes Up to the Police (Court, Where
Seligman and Strauss Vestify a Little.

Henry Seligman and Frederick Strains of
J. 4&W. Seligman & Co abruptly left the meet-
{ng room of the directors of the American Steel
and Wire Company yesterday afternoon Phis
was at about 1:16 o'olock, after the meating had
been going on nearly two hours Questioned
aa to whether Chatrman John W. Gates had re.
aligned, Mr. Seligman said

“No, but we havé "

Subsequently this statement, whieh had been
presented by them to the directors, was made

publie:
To the Board of Directors the American Steel and
Wire cement

GHNTLEMEN Je have to-day resigned from
the directory of the American Ste fund Wire
Company because Mr. John Wo Gates did not
at to-day’s meeting retire from the taniges
ment of the company, a4 we had been given to
understand that he would do

Our reasons for continuing to art
tors until now may perlaps deserve further ex-

lanation, On the morning of the April meet
ine of the board we received Assurances
from sources on which we thought our-
selves entitied to rely that the resig-
nation of Mr. Gates as chairman would
be offered about May | While it is true
that by continuing in the board we exposed
ourselves to possible inisconsimiction, we
risked this, in the belief that by delay we should
accomplish that which every one must recog:
nize as demanded by the best interests of the
company, namely, Mr. Gates’ retirement trom
the management, and we realized that under
the by-laws of the company to force Mr Cates’
retirement was practically impossible, and that
these assurances promised more substantial re~
sulta than the contemplated attempt to lores
his immediate resignation

“Mr. Gates, however, continues to control the
company, and, under these cireunistances, it
becomes impossible forus longer to eontinne in
the directory; and, in order that the stock.
holders of the company may fully understand
both our reasons for continuing in the board
and for resigning from \t, we shall give such
publicity to this” letter we may think
proper, Yours truly,

HENRY SELIGMAN,
* FREDERICK STRAUSS.”

When the board met in April, after the an-
nouncement by Chairman Gates of the shutting
down of twelve of the company’s mills because
of overproduction and slack business, Mr. Sel-
{gman and Mr Strauss vigorously eriticised Mr,
Gates to his face and in this eriticiam, it has
been reported, they were backed up by Thomas
Dolan of Philadelphia, another director The
meeting yesterday broke up soon after the
withdrawal of Messra Seligman and Strauss
Mr. Gates, when he carne out, smiled broadly at
the group of waiting reporters He said that
no other directors had resigned and that the
vacancies would probably be filled at another
meeting ina few davs. Hesaid he didn’t know
that he would go to Kurope now as he had con-
templated

Max Pam, counse! of the company, denied a
report that Mr. Dolan had intimated that he
would resign

Subpemna servers had been hanging around
the board room and when Mr Gates went up to
the Tombs Court to answer George A. Lamb's
complaint that he had given outa fajae state
ment of the conditiof_oel the company a@ lot f
people went alone Magistrate Zeller over-
ruled the motion to distuiss the complaint raada
by Delancey Nieotl | tor Mr Gates at
the last sitting and Robert Bo Armstrong
New York correspondent of — the Chicago
Record, waa called as the first witness, Other |
witnesses who were present were Elbert H Gary |
President of the} aden ib Stee! Company; Henry
Seligman, Frederick Strauss and Max Pam
Mr. Gates, looking lke a prosperous Western
wranger and chewing the end of an unlighted |
cigar, seemed to take but a moderate interest |
inthe proceedings. Mr. Armstrona was asked |
10 give in detail an interview he had with Mr |
Gates, DeLancey Nieoll objected that the es- |
sence of the offence alleged was to ‘concurin a |

 

as direc

as

 

written” false report

“We have that written report, your Honor,’
said Mr. Hymes for Mr. Lamb. “It is printed in
the columns of a newspaper. We propose to
show by this witness that the defendant eon-
curred in that report and caused it to be pub-
lished ”

On Mr. Hymes’a assurance that the written
report would be developed later the Magistrate
yermitted the witness to testify that Mr Gates
fad efused to answer any questions about the
affairs of the American Wire and Steel Com-
pany, but in answer to questions said some-
thing about the condition of the trade geuer-
ally. The witness took no notes, He did not
write the interview in'the New York Herald
embodied in the complaint. Upon failure to |
show connection between the Herald and the
Chicago Record report, the witness was dis-
missed and his testimony was stricken out

Henry Seligman identified the January re-
port of the company

“What change was there in the affairs of the
company between the date of that report and
the 16th of April?’

 

 

“Sales had fajlen off. I do not know how
much. I do not know that it was 431-8
ercent. IT knowa man named Pam | met

im ata meting of the Board of Directors in
April. Lhad talked with Pam = pnor to April
about Mr. Gates. 1 talked with him at the
meeting of the} board about Gates and about
his connection with the company,”

This testimony was elicited under a constant
fire of objections from Mr. Nicoll ‘The witness
waa not allowed to give conversations he had
had with Mr. Gates and others Mr. Pam
testified that he had had a conversation with
Mr. Seligman about Mr Gates

“Were you private counsel to Mr. Gates when
you had that conversation?”

“T have been private counsel to Mr. Gates for
a longtime. Idid not see Seligman asa result
of a private conversation with Mr. Gates”
That was all that waa educed from Mr Pam

Mr. Frederick Strauss testified to the tact of
his resignation trom the American Steel and
Wire Company and sald that he had had a con-
yersation about Mr. Gates with Mr. Seligman
He was not permitted to tell what the conver-
sation was

Judge Gary's testimony was even briefer
than that of Mr Stranss All he was able to
gay Was that he knew nothing about the affairs
of the American Steel and Wire Company in
April orany other time. The Federal Steel
Company, of which he was President, was not
engaged in the same line of productlon

Mr. Nicol! made a strong plea to have the
complaint dismissed, but the Magistrate fixed

the next hearing for Wednesday morning at il
o'clock

Steel Company's mills oliet

FUTURE OF LONG ISLAND R, R,

New York Central Fqnally Interested With
the Pennssivania.

First Vice-President John P Green of the
Pennsylvania Railroad, in confirming the
statement that the Pennsylvania road had

bought control of the Long Island Railroud,ex-
plains that the deal waa not made without a
thorough understanding with the New York
Central Railroad and says furthermore that the
New York Central willbe invited to take half
the purchase. In the absence of President Cal-
laway, who waa reported to beon lis way home
from the West yesterday, the New York Cen-
tral people were disinclined to make any public
statement rewarding the raatter

Unofficially, well informed officers of the New
York Central said that the Long Island Railroad
purchase meant as much to the New York Cen-
tral as ‘it did tothe Pennsylvania Both Inter-
eats will be benefited, andthe development of
the Long Island road will be of great industrial
advantage to Long laland. Pennsylvania men
will probably operate the road, and similar
methods will be applied as have been applied (o

A good jadge who recently visited the

mines declared that one of them was, as far as its development at the time indicated, ‘‘the

best gold mine in the State of California.”

Since then additional development has disclosed

even richer ore and greater depth. A winze beginning at the 100-feet level was recently sunk

one hundred and twenty feet in very rich ore,

Four gentlemen of this city had these properties investigated in April by an emi-

nent and successful mining engineer,

In his report he says:

“The ore veinin the

winze, from the tunnel level tothe bottom, will average four feet thick that will yield

from $15 to $20 per ton, at a cost of $2 perton for mining and milling.”

Any business

that can turn out its product in immense quantities at a cost of $2 and sell it at from $15
to $20 deserves tne attention of investors, It may be a lded that the gentlemen for whom
this examination was made have now invested largely in the stock of the company,
