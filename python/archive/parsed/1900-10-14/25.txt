WASHINGTON, Oct, 19
ernment, through the Jewish Colonisation
Society, has made a contract with Brazil by)
which over $5,000 Roumunian Jews will emigrate

fourmmanian Gove

to the lutter country in the near future, This
unnouncement is mude by the Treasury De-
Partment, after receiving the report on the

Subleet of the immigration of Rourmantan
Special Immigrant Inspector Robert

in July

by
Watchorn, who wus sent to Roumunia
to investigute the subject

Mr. Watchorn's report says that the Rou-
manian Jews who recently arrived in New York,
1.000 in number, without money or friends, were
“neouraged to leave their country by the Rou-
Manian Government These people were ad-
mitted to the United States under bond. There
Will be no more immigration of this class to
the United States on account of the contract
with Brazil and the danger of an undesirable
influx is thus removed

Jews

Mr. Watchorns report is an Interesting
one and tells of the resources of Rourmania
and the reasons for the great emigration of
Jews from there The f beanian Covert
ment is doing all it can to rid the countr of
Jews, and by making a contract for shipping

a larwe colony to Brazil it has practically ae-

complished its purpose The laws of Ron-
mania have made tt extremely hard for
Jews to make a living there The Gove
ernuent ts, however, anxious to negotiate
t loan, and in July the Parliament of that
country ousted the Minister of Finance and
Foreign Affairs, who was unfriendly to Jews

 

ind placed a man in charge of these offices
who is disposed to provide leniently for
this class of people It was found by the Rou
manian Government that it would be extremely
dificult to obtain a Government loan while
& practical persecution of Jews was being
earried on by the Roumanian Government
The United States Government is not threat
ened by the coming exodusof Rourmanian dews
