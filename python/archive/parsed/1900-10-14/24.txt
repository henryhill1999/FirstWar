Du Maurier, ¢. M) Barrie and Anthony Hope
as well as half a dozen other a ithurs who
could be named, have made much more from
the dramatic rights of their novels than they
ever did from the sale of their works in book
form. It waa, indeed, the success of “Trilby”
and “The Prisoner of Zenda” that first directed
the at ton of managers to the value of pop-

 

nlar novels used in dramatic form, and started

stage since those two works were give, but
nobody ewer suspected that the demand for the
dramatic use of novels would ever go as far as

lietion writers now work with one eye on the
stage, and books are being read by actors aud
managers in the hope of finding there material
that may dramatic form. Some
{dea of the extent to which writers of fletion now
rely on the stage as a means of {increasing the
profit of thelr work may be gathered fromn
the fact that Marie Correlli’s novel, “The Master
Christian,” was acted asa play before the book
was published in this country in order that
there might be no possible dispute as to the
ownership of the dramatic rights when the time
came finally to put the book into theatrical form,
Hall Caine is said to have earned twice as much
out of “The Christian” through its use as a play
{n this country as he did from the sale of the book
a®a novel: and his rival, Miss Correlli, proposes
to make her work just as remunerative. Dra-
matic rights in books are now protected by every
possible precaution, for the publisher and the
novelist know that a certain degree of success
Ina book is bound to be followed by a demand
to use it on the stage

It seems impossible that the manager should
be able to use up during the coming season
their supplies of plays written in this way,
{f any reasonable number of them should meet
with su So far most of them have pros-
pered, although it is not asserted for a sing'e
piny of this kind seen lately that it isa sufficient
masterpiece to stand on its own merits as a
play without the vogue of the novel behind it
Managers are naturally indifferent as to the
causes which produce successes so long as they
have one on their hands. If the public crowds
the theatre it isa matter of indifference to them
whether they came to see the play and liked it
or whether they merely came hecause they had
read the novel and wanted to sea its figures on
the stage

There have been recently various predic.
tions as to the coming decline in the public's
interest in dramatized novels. It has been
aaid that their vogue, which has now lasted
for two years, not to include ite beginning with
“Trilbv” five years ago, would certainly end
soon, but exactly the reverse has happened.
Two dramatized novela just now before the
public are crowding two of the theatres to their
fullest capacity, and the same thing has hap-
pened in two out-of-town cities where drama-
tized novels were performed as a preliminary

at the Kagle Nest, almost within sight of the Court
House in Bellefonte, where, after quenching its thirst,
it curled up on a rock for a sleep. The an!ma!s are
especially bothersome tn the Crider Settlement, tn the
Alleghanies. They come down from the mountains
in groups and raid the farmers’ sheep and pig pens

On one of the mountain branches of the Pennsyl
vanta Railroad two bears came out of the woods and
stopped on the raflroad, taking thelr own time to get
out of the way, while the engineer was compelled to
slow down to keep from running over them and risking
the wrecking of his train. Thus far few of the ani-
mals have been killed by hunters

Mafeking's Clever Ape in London.
From the London Telegraph

Mafeking's ape, who displayed so much intelli
genee during the famous siege as to merit a claim
to be the “missing link,” and so much antipathy to
the nefarious practices of the Boers as to entitle him
to the benefits of civilization, bas been brought
to this eountry by the officer who trained him, and has
proved an object of curiosity to the camp at Salisbury
Plain. Its principal duty in the beleaguered town
was to ring the alarm bell the moment the Roers
commenced firing, and it performed this work In se
indefatigable and conscientious A manner as to metit
the approval of all the residents, Having sounded
the toesin and warned the inhabitants, the ape scurried
of to its underground hombproof hole, thus proving
that it thoroughly realized the danger to itself as wella
to others, It is reported that the antmal is shortly
to be offered for sale. Surely a comfortable home
will be provided for tt after diMeult duties well per
formed.

Mrs. King's Nervy Old Hen.
From the Weston Leader.

Mrs. R King ts the owner of a courageous and
capable old hen, of nondeseript breed, that she
wouldn't trade for a whole flock of blooded poultry.
It isthe only hen tn Oregon, perhaps tn the United
States, that ever fought and killed a hawk. The
batile occured a few days ago, when 4 chicken hawk
swooped down upon a band of baby fowls of which
the old hen was the mother. The hen didn't squawk
and run, calling upon her offspring to follow her, but
with a ferce and well directed peck buried her bill be
neath the hawk's left wing. It was a solar plesus
blowandaclean knockout. The hawk seemed sur
prized and dazed. Itfeebly arose, flew aimlessly
against a clothesiine, and then dropped Into the gar
den, stone dead. That hen will be queen of Mrs
King's poultry yard on Wild Horse Creek as long as
she survives

KING OSCAR AND ARTIST ZORN,

Tatter's Frankness in Dealing With His Rosal
Costomer Aboot a Recent Portrait.

The most conspienons object in the Swedish

pavilion at the Paris Exposition is a splendid

 

full-flgure portrait of King Osear IL, painted
in oil} Anders Zorn, the artist whose work
was so popular in this counters during and after
the World's Fair. It has heen widely repro-
diced as the latest portrait of the popular
monaret There ia a later one by the same
artist, however, and an amusing story is told
or ming it

When the portrait whieh now adorna the

Swedish pavilion in Paris was finished King
was so pleased with it that
herlains to Zorn
nted the artist to goto work at once

Olacar he sent one

Yes,” answered Zorn, in his usual shrill nasal

looking anvthing but 4 Yes,
ves allright’ But tell his Majesty that I don't
want fo paint him in uniform Il don't
it, and Lam not going to do it. Will
sure totell his Majesty thar?

Yes
and then he returned to the castle and told the
King that Zorn was overjeved by the honor
shown him and would be happy to begin work
on the new portrait at a stated date and hour
in fullest

with the message

replied the chamberlain with a smile,

     
     

Phe King, whe p aes measure
the liteness expect of princes, was more
punctual at the first sitting than the artist

When Zorn, a little late, was ushered into the
roval presence he discovered at onee that the
King was in uniform

Why,” he exelaimed unhesitatingly, in pretty
mueh the same tone he had used to the eham-
herlain, “I said T didn't want to paint your
Maiest n uniform!

T beard nothing about it,” declared the King
witha glance of surprise at the indiscreet artist
Well, well, well muttered Zorn, w e he
put his easel in order Burt then UU tell wour
Majesty something. If T have to paint your
Majesty in uniform T shall have to eharge my
large price

How much is

It is 25,000 frances,

Zorn But if vour Majesty will change clothes
Mil only charge my small price, whieh is 10,000
francs

Well,” mused the King, trying to look very
serious That's a very bie sum, 25,000 franes
Whe. mv dear Zorn, Pi tell you what I'll do
I think FE sholl have to change elothes

Phe King retited to his private apartments
for a short while, and when he appeared again
to resume the sitting he « dressed os a pri-
vate citizen fhe portrait was finished in

thing more spectacular than a mere balloon

ascension when that show is advertised

One Burke of Bilssfield, Mich, was the aero-
naut who came on for the fair this year. He
broveht an apparatus with him that made

people hold their breath when they neard of it
His plan was to have a large wooden cannon
attached to his balloon instead of a basket. At
ad stance of twenty feet from the cannon and
suspended by a light rope from the balloon he
had aparachute, Before releasing the balloon
he was to crawl into the cannon At a signal
the balloon was to be released, andat a helght
of 2,500 feet he was to pulla trigger, there was
to bea tremendous explosion, and surrounded
by flame he was to emerge from the cannon,
shoot through the air in the direction of the
parachute, grab it as he passed and with its aid
descend gracefully to the grourd

Burke of Blissfield made a hit here even be-
fore he made his first ascension. The adver-
tisement of what he was going to do brought
out atremendous crowd, Burke got into the
cannon and the balloon sailed away. When
about two thousand feet from the ground the
aeronaut was seen crawling from the mouth of
the eannon, which was pointed directly towa rd

could stay in the cannon was limited any way,
and sohisonty chance wasto get out through

Three Missoor! Men tn a Tob.

From the Carthage lress

While going down tn one of the big @x17
the Missourl Hlanket Veln Zine Company, located at
Prosperity, Saturday, H.R. P. Miller, C. B. Sharkey
and FE. H. Roothman were the victims of an accident
Mr. Sharkey is general manager of the company and
the two gentiemen with him were Lis guests They
were lowered to a certain point, which was only a
short distance above the water in the sump This
water Is about eight feet deep and dirty, siimy stuf?
The three stood in the tub and examined the solid
rock walls and the general appearance of things

When they got ready to be hoisted to the surface
they pulled the wire whieh connects with the signal
bell. ‘Three rings means hoist. They gave the wire
three Jerks, buton the third pull the wire beoke with
out making the bellring. Hence the signal was only
two rings whic means to lower the tub To the eon
sternation of the three men, the tub, in
the «<ignal, shot down into the sump. In fact, the
moment the signal wire broke they realized what
would be the result. As they started down Mr, Miller
climbed the rope and kept out of the water. Mr
Sharkey Jimped and swam to the ladder on the side
Mr. Boothman stayed with the tub and went waist
deep into the water, where he had to remain till their
stouts to holst could be heard at the top.
