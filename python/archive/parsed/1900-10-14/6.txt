those at Ceylon and the West Indies

Alfred advises that the elective ele-

svall share in the control. His term-

ent ts anti-military and it is certain that

» will seek the quickest exit from the present
ng Incompetence of JuntoroMcers hold-

ng magisterial positions, The result of the
sotion, rmoreover, has been to reject Sir Henry
ampbell-Banonerinan's advocacy, rey eated af-
ter his own election, of the plan that the former
Boer institutions be continued and that noth-
ne be done to make the Boers feel that their

idependence has been lost

It is not #x pected that Ceci] Rhodaa will have
iny advisory volo@ in the settiament. His
Bot h Africa angus Con@ress at Caps Town

roa to Mr es has only sucearded tn

that he will ask Mr. Rose-lnnes to reéetabiish

a sensational reor@anization will be disap-
pointed. The Queen will hold a privy counsel

Salisbury's plana on the next day Thera ts

also ba some shuffilng of minor poste, according |

 

ntrumor. Lord Salisbury wil) have to
find a pear to sucesed Lord Cadogan as Viosroy
of Ireland

Lord George Hamilton ts not a brilifant
man, but he has had much administrative
experiance and it ig thought that he wi
much leas likely to make a fool of himself
a cleverer man. Mr. Hanbury ts probably
1ext to Mr. Chamberlain the ablest man in the
overnment, although “the man In the street”
knows curiously little of him. Early thls rear
e was asked to succeed the Duke of Norfol
as Postmaster-General, but he refused because

the 4t was not accompanied by a seat in the

Ihe result of the election was forecasted

by Mr. Chamberlain who was confident that
tie mafority would be not less than 110 and
wae fair ertain that it would reach 135. He
tate! vesterday to a friend that the general
eection iad furnished him with only two seri
ous disap] itreants, one the suocess of Mr
Labouchere in his contest for redleotion from
Northampton and the other the triumph of

the Liberal candidate in Rugby, which is a
part of the country over whloh Mr, Cham-
berlain has long revarded himself as political
lerd Paramount Not only did a Libera
wrest the seat from one of Mr. Chamberiain’s

On Tuesday the Court of Appeals handed down
a decision of great interest to the voters of thls
State in the Coffey case, from Brooklyn It
involved the question whether a county com
mittee chosen by a@ political party under the
provisions of the Primary Election law has the

| power to expel @ member for party dis

ire to pay ht
dues, Upon this question the stood
4 to 8 the majority holding that no
Buch power exists. The prevailing opinioo
was written by Chief Judge Parker and the
minority opluuon by Judge kdear M. Cullen of

or other misconduct, except at

 

  

 

Brooklyn The Chief Judge treats membership

In the Buffalo Fish Company's casa, to whloh
we referred last week, the decision was also
made by a divided coun, four Judges of the
Court of Appeals voting to sustain Mr. Justice
Latubert, who heard the case at Spectal Term,
and three voting for reversak ‘The majority
hold that the provisions of the New York Game

cout
may werefore lawfully be possessed in New
York at a time when it would be illegal to
possess pike and pickerel taken from New York
waters “It is aimply a perversion of the
statute,” observes Judge Dents O'Brien, “to
hold that the mere possession by any person,
within this State of the fish described In the
statute during the close aeason ia a violation

of it, without regard to the place where it was
procured or to the manner in which {t was
obtained.” He also suggests that such a oone
struction would operate harehly against the
owners of private fish ponds {n which the Ash
are private property. Such a proprietor is
possessed of the fish, and would have to open
the pond to let them out in order to avold the
