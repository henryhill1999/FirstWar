ber of Harlem women have come forward
both as speakers and workers in behalf of the

Republican party and their work has not been

entirely without result in the local and State

campaigns Among these women have been

a number of good talkers, and as many of them

are thinkers as well they have been able to

present arguments by which their listeners,
were they men or women, have been impressed
In the present campaign women are taking
a more prominent part than in any previous

Moat of the women hava spoken before In
political campaigns, and their faces are familiar
to the men who attend political meetings
What they say is listened to attentively, and
they are rewarded with applause when they
are through. It wasn't until the other day
that a new woman speaker came to the front

She came unannounced. She was not asked
to speak, in fact no one who happened to be
at the meeting knew that she could speak
Bhe knew herself that could address an

but she did not that

that were in her heart, she was going fo make
a reputation for herself that any woman miaht
well be proud of. She is Mrs. Mary P. Smith,

a young colored woman, and is to-day one of

the picturesque figures in the campaign

Mrs Smith is a Republican from the bottom
of her heart, and before came to the
front as a speaker she was quietly working
on her own account among the voters of her
race, putting the truth before them and trying
to make them that their tr more
than those of any other people in all the land,
are bound up with the Republican party Al-
though a young woman, she has a rare knowl-
edge of her people, and she feels a sense of
shame come over her every time she hears
of a negro who is going to vote the Democratic
ticket If she can get that negro’sa address,
she will descend upon him in short order and
if she doesn't make him promise to vote for
William MeKinley, she will at least make him
admit before she leaves him that he is de-
liberately doing the wrong thing when he
votes for Bryan

It was enthusiasm for the Republican party
and gratitude for all that it has done for her
people, that induced Mrs. Smith to
a Republican meeting in this city several weeks
ago. She became so interested in the work
that the Republican speakers were doing in
the city, that she decided t& attend all the
meetings she could. She went to them after-
noons and evenings, but always as a listener
She had made speeches before the literary
society of her church, and once or twice had
addressed smal! audiences in the South, dur-
ing local campaigns, but the idea of speak-
ing at a public meeting in thia city did not
eceur to her until about a week ago, when
she attended a meeting at the Commercial
Travellers’ Headquarters at 737 Broadway

It happened to be a day when some of the
women who have been doing campaign work
in various parts of the city for the Republican
national and State tickets were scheduled
to speak. Mra Smith noticed that the men
in the audience listened to what these women
had to She became excited and finally

wien one of the women speakers asked if there |

weren't any women in the audience who wanted
to sav something, she sprang to her feet and
walked up the aisle to the platform

There was a murmur of surprise, as it was
acarcely expected that a colored woman would
respond to the invitation. Menin the audience

It was as much what she said, ae the way

and caused them to applaud with such vigor
The wav that she put the matter left no doubt
in the minds of her | that the duty of
every colored man was to vote the Republican
ticker It convineed every man, too, that any
colored man the speaker got hold of would have
to be an extraordinary man not to vield to her
argiments

When Mra Smith finished her speech and
started to walk back to her seat there was an
outburst of applause that was deafening Men
Jumped in the air and yelled their approval of
the modaest-looking colored woman, and those
in charge of the meeting crowded around to
congratulate Mrs Smith on her speech If her

Just at present the colored men in the neigh-

know that if they don't get out of the way they
will be button holed and made to tell exactly

very nice looking voung woman, and she hasa

when Mrs Smith bittonholes a colored Demo-
erat she is and there is no way of

entless,

 

argument it means an unpleasant half hour or

A SUN reporter who interviewed Mra. Smith
at her home the other day found her @ very
earnest person If there ia one woman in all
tie land who loves the Republican party it ts
Mrs Smith, and she does not hesitate to show
her affection

“Why.” she said to the reporter, “how any
man, white or black, can vote a Democratic
ticket at this election ia a iiystery to me, Is
it possible that the men of this town, whiteand
black, have forgotten the period of meal tickets
and soup kitchens that fell to them four years
ago when the Democrats were tn power? It
jan't for me to point out hie duty to a white
man, and whenl refer to white men L simply
do so in utter surprise that they can have so

short a memory. The period of suffering
and hunger that the poor went through in 1806
under Grover Cleveland, compared with the

abundance of all the years of the Mo sinley
Administration, makes [tt so utterly unwise
for any main of bralas to support Bryan that
lanamaved when Lhear that people are going
to vote for him

‘Just as sure as tam talking to you at this

Cleveland. And if the white man {4 to suffer

“People have asked ine why T am such an
enthusiastic Republican and whr T cannot
see anv good {n the other side Well, in the

first place, 1 am a wreat lover of my people,
and it was the Republican party that freed
the colored man and then gave him the rights
of a citizen. Everything that has ever been
done for the negro has been done by the Re-
publican party. That is a matter of record,
and no man can deny it The records of other
parties show absolutely nothing done for the
colored man. A few colored men, who are
popularly supposed to wield a little influence
in some of the districts in this and other cities,
have got small offices, for which they are ex-
pected to turn over a lot of colored votes to the
Democrats They catch a few foolish colored
men, but the number is growing less every
year, and I hope to see the day when every
man of my race, and the women, too, are vot-
ing for Republican candidates

It is Democratic influences that are taking
away the privileges of the colored man in the

South If the Democrats could do tt they
would disfranchise every negro, but let us
hope that they will not be able todo that. Fv-

ery now and then in our municipalities some-
thing crops up to show the feeling of Demo-
erats against the colored man Even on the
eve of a great election, when even the colored
vote is worth having, they cannot conceal the
fact of their hatred for colored men
look at the way the Democratte
men assaulted the negroes in the recent race

pounds, with a pair of eyes that aeem to look

in chaparajos and sombrero ia seen directing
the excitable cowpunchers of the Cauley ranch,
and the ease with which he plays the part has
attracted the attention of those who have been
privileged to see the genuine article and has
aroused in them the belief that the part is not
entirely assumed

In this they are right. The big individual
who on the stage directs cowpunchers with
the ways of a professional and off the stage
is the company's baggage master, is familiarly
known as Ble Slim, and cattle punching is only

that he send the writer ‘a blue shawl suitable to

spread of the consumption is due almost wholly
tocontagion, andthat. therefore, it is very im-
portant that they receive training in such habits
as will limit the probability of inoculation. It
will undoubtedly be necessary to provide a re-

FERGY’S WOODCHUCK BAND.

17S THREE MEMBERS VICTIMS OF
THELR AMIABLE QUALITIES,

Fergy Organized a Band With Them and Sow
a Fortane Ahead When a Sportsman Came
to the Camp and They Acquired the Dan-
gerous Habit of Eating Smokeless Powder.

Firikip, Wis, Oct 5 = From a tangled wind-
fall of logs near the camp the bullet-like head

of a woodchuck protruded ‘The animal, a

It stared about and then grinned widely. Evi-
dently it was not alarmed or pleased or angered
It had no The other man picked
up the shell of an exploded cartridge which
lay near the fire and started to throw it His
backward arm was caught by Fergy, the guide,
and the shell removed from his loose fingers

“Don' do it," said Fergey ‘Don’ never throw
shells at ‘em They're th’ mos’ harmlesses’

CATS AND DOGS ON SHIPS,

LONG VOYAGES MADE BY THEM OV
DEEPWATER VESSELS,

Dogs Apt to Stick to the Ship and See Little

    

of Strange Lands—-Globe-Trotting Cats That
Are Great Wanderers-Some That Come
Hack and Others That Don’t Want To,

Dogs are not infrequently carried on deep.
water ships, and so there are some dogs that, go-
ingon voyage after voyage, come to be grent
travellers, visiting all parts of the world and
seeing life in inany ports. Wherever a vessel
having a dog aboard is tied up, there the dog
is likely to mount guard upon it as a wateh dog;
it might in fact be carried for that purpose,
Thus a dog whose home was in Norway, brought
here in some Norwegian vessel, might waftca
over the ship here to-day and three months
later stand guard over her in Rio Janeiro; and,
in whatever port the ship might be, warning off
intruders not in Norwegian but in the universal
dog language perfectly understood in al! the
ports of the world

At the same time it might easily be that the
dogs thus carried would make some acquainte
ance with the ports the vessel visited They
would be likely to move about more or less o@
the wharf at which the ship was tied up, an@
to explore the near territory It might be that
a dog belonging on a ship would go ashore with
the captain or the mate, and so learn his way
about. Or it might even be that a dog would
make his way by himself into the heart of @
maritime city and find his way back to his ves
sel In fact, either because of his own intele
ligence or because somebody looks out for him,
the dog that goes to sea does not get lost ia
foreign ports. The vessel is his home, where his
friends are, and he sticks to the ship

While it is not unusual for such ships to carry
a dowitisa common thing for deep water vessels
A big ship might have two cats
A cat ora kitten might

fo carry cats

aboard or even three

be carried for a pet, but the common purpose
of carrying cats ona deep water ship is to catch
rats, and in this work they do good service,

And eats are invariably treated kindly aboard
shipasinfactall animals are. But no such tie
to the ship as that which exists
in the case of the dow Phe dow sticks to the
Vessel, the cat more often strays. The cat hae
not the dog's intelligence nor does he excite
anything like the same degree of affection on
the partof man Astar asthecat is concerned
he does not appear to mind this much, if at all,
and cats are most likely to wander. Cats may
stick to the ship, indeed, in various Cases fora
longer or shorter period, a round voyage or two
or longer, but they are likely to go finally,
The cuts likeliest to stick to a vessel are those
brought aboard young or those born aboard,

Cats go ashore more than dogs do when a ship
isin port and tied up ata wharf, They like to
get off and prowl around. Lacking the Intellfe
wence of the dog they are less likely to be able
to find their way back to where the vessel is
tied up in case thew should stray away; being
away trom the ship more, they are more likely
to be left behind when the ship sails

The cats thus left are likely to hang around
the waterfront. They may find food at the
warchouses along shore, or on the wharves,
or on the vessels tied up alongside. It is @
common thing to see a cat ona vessel ata wharf
here. He might be one belonging to the ship,
or it might be that he Jumped aboard from the
wharf and tnade for the cook's galley for some-
thing to eat, whieh he would be pretty sure to
wet if there anybody there to feed himd
Phe cat that had been left here in this port by
some vessel might sail on some other ship; one
going possibly back to the port whence the cat
came or one going as likely to some other.
hus a cat that had come to this port in a ship
from Liverpool and had strayed from the vessel
he while he might in fact stay here and live
and die here, might, bunging around the watere
front, board a ship bound for Melbourne. Goe
ing ashore there the cat might stay there or
nivht take ship again, perhaps, for Liverpool
whence he originally came, or as it might as
easily be, for San Francisco, or for Bombayd
It would be the same with a New York cat tha®
ret out upon his sea journeyings from here
This might be a cat from along shore that had
found his own way aboard some deep sea
vessel, or it might be a cat or a kitten that some
member of the ship's company of a vessel
about to sall had picked up and carried aboards
rhis cat would of course be just as likely as any
other cat to go zigzagging in great long
stretches from one port to another, over many
seas, to sojourn for a time, here and there in
many a strange land. In some one of these
faraway places the cat might, Indeed, remain;
or might keep wandering over the face of the
earth) but it is by no means impossible thaq
chance would lead this cat some day in a porg
in some remote corner of the earth, aboard 4
ship that would bring him back to South street.

But while inany cats are this great wandere
ers and thus don't seem to care, there are not
wanting instances of cats that do care, of cate
that wait in ports where their ship left them,
for the ship te come back. In one such case,
that of a cat that belonged on an ocean steamer,
the cat was ashore when the steamer satledg
leaving her behind, but carrying off her kittens,
The eat lived on and about the wharf till the
sieamer’s return, and was the first creature
up the gang plank, when that was thrown
ashore. A cat left in New York by an oyster
boat from up the Sound stayed on the wharf
or in its nelahborhood till the boat got back
on the nest trip, and then jumped aboard, glad
to get there again. The mate of a British ship
lving at a South street wharf told about @
eat that waited for her ship, a story with @
somewhat unusual ending

This cat came at Greenock, Scotland, aboar@
a veasel bound for St. John’s, Newfoundland
There, catlike, she went ashore and was ashore
when the ship, leaving her behind, sailed for
Genoa. From Genoa the ship eame back te
t. John's and there was the cat, waiting for
them, as she had been all the time, around abouts
the wharves, since they went away. She
umped aboard, glad to get back to the ship
and its people. This trip the ship sailed for
Carthagena, Spain. There the mata of the vese
sel, ashore one day, bought two small dogs
and a hedgehog, which he took aboard and
carried into the cabin. While these animals
were being looked at thera, the Scotch ca?
that had walted on the other side of the Atlane
Johns, over one trip of the vessel,

ve uboard clad to cet back again,
walked sein When the cat saw
what it was those (here were looking at, not
faneving, apparentiy, the idea of being supe
planted on the ship by these odd creatures
picked up in Spain, she turned and walked out
of the eabin again, and jumped ashore and never
came back.

CURE FOR CARNATION RUST, '

A Fungus That Feeds Upon It Discovered ty
F. HW. Blodgett of Bedford Park.
Geneva, N. ¥., Oct. 13—Frederick Rarvey
Blodgett of Bedtord Park, N. Y¥., whose ape
pointment to the President's University scholare
ship in botany in Columbia University was
announced in THe StN, was until within a few
weeks assistant in botany at the State Agrle
cultural Experiment station in this city. He
made the important discovery while here that
that the fungus plant Dorluca filum feeds upoa
the rust plant, which infests carnations. Care
nation must is widely dispersed and florists
have lost thousands of dollars since 1801, whem
it attracted attention because of its ravages
Carnation rust is distinguished from other rust
colored troubles of leaves by the presence of
brown spores, which are liberated by the burete
ing of the blister in which they are formed
Each blister contains hundreds of spores, and
each spore is capable of germinating and dee
veloping igto a fresh spot of rust. The sam@
fungus infests the rust of the asparagus and
it may be that either by growing garden as-
paragus in the greenhouses with carnations
or by spraying the carnations with water in

which dariuca infested aspar bas been
broken, sufficient abundance o rluea may
be obtained to check the ravages of the rust.
