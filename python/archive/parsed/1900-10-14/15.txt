Gradually, and with wreasing interest
the new fashions unfold their dainty
at the very enticing openings of the pronunent
dry goods establishments, revealing untlin ited
possibilities for individuality in dress, a feature
which cannot be overestimated as a means
of attaining indisputable success. The
tion of winter garb and how to have it made is
in the mind of every woman who makes at

charms

pretensions toward smart effects in dress, and
the same variety which can be so helpful to
the womin wth individual artistic ideas may
prove the doom of the next one wie lacks

 

this quality, unlaas she is wise enough to put
herself into the hands of a skilful dressmaker

It is said that no gift of the gods is more
valuable to a woman than good taste, which is
the faculty of judging along well-defined lines
of artistic discrimination 4 woman is always
eafe with her inheritance of good taste, while
genius is apt to turn the tide of her forces into
one channel and her to a great extent
of this refining element which is inherent in
her nature if she is truly feminine in her finest
instincts. She has a wide fleld for her powers
of distinction this season, for there is every-
thing in the way of decoration 80 easy to ex-
aggerate, a charming variety of skirts, and
every kind and condition of coat from the Eton
to the long garment which almost sweeps the
floor

It will require some discernment to decide
on the apecial modes which will lead later,
as the models in sieht just at the moment seem
to be a culling from the most desirable points in
the summer blended with
features, most of which

is of tucked mouaseline with a red velvet wrist-

are appliqué designs of velvet well covered
with French knots and edged around with gold
braid. An example of this is in orange velvet
