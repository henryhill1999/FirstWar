What the Great Registration Means

The registration In this city and generally
in the cities and towns of this State and
throughout the Union, wherever nc rmal
political discussion and division continue
@o exist, indicates a degree of tnterest in
the coming election which even exoceds
that manifested in 1896.

Why ‘a there this pr found ¢oncern?
Does it mean that the Amertoan people
want eilver substituted for gold as the
standard, and Huyan for Me KINLEY 4s
President?

Why are commercial travellers ext ibiting
“ra for
goods made contingent on feat of
Bryan? Why ts it that so many orders on
file with manufacturers are marked “vol {
if Bryan is elected "?

The greatest registration of ¥
that wise and effectual method of protecting
the purity of the ballot box was adopted
ig distinguishing this national
because the American people are deter-
mined that the policies which have brought
to them prosperity and to this « intry
honor and glory shall not be set aside at d
reversed. They have qualified themselves
or are about to qualify themselves to get M {

ment against it so terrible that never again

situation in New Harnpsbire ts obvious to

tudinous and in n instances’ deserving
of high political honor; but one of them,
and only one, is entitied for the next elx
years to the seat now occupied by the Hon

WILLIAM EF. CHANDLER

That one is the Hon. Wiiuram E, CHAND- |

LER himeeilf

Although this distinguished son of the
Granite State was one of the founders of
the Republican party, and his political
experience runs back for nearly half 4

century, he is the youngest man of his age

in public life to-day. His mind is as enter- |

prising, anid his independence as cour-
ageous, and his loyalty to cause or principle
as firm aa they were during the Adminis-
tration of AxTnun or the Administration
of ABRAHAM LINCOLN.

There is a lot of publio usefulness left tn
Senator CHANDLER. ‘The Senate cannot
spare him yet. The Republican party
needs his services at the post which
he now holds, and the Republicans of New
Hampshire owe it to the reat of the country
that he shall stay there

Will Canada Have a ‘* Cold Storage’
System?

The Conservatives of the Dominion seem
to have made up thelr minds that a sub-
stantial and attainable boon must be eub-
stituted for the iusory * trade preference ”
plank in their political platform. The
Canadian farmers cannot be convinced
that Great Britain will ever tax the food
products of other countries for their bene-
fit and the Canadian manufacturers do not
want such a concession, because they fore-
see that they would have fo pay aruinous
price for it by admitting British fabrics
duty free. If, then, the agricultural! inter-
est is to be won over to the Conservative
side, some promise must be made to ft,
for the fulfilment of which the prospective
beneficiaries may look to Ottawa instead
of Lendon

Str CuarLes Trrrrr has shown himself
equal to the emergency. He proposes
to use the public funds of the Dominion
for the purpose of providing cold storage
and effective transportation of perishable
food staples, such as are produced tn Can-
ada and consumed !n Great Eritain, That
is to say, in the matter of placing perishable

commodities on the British market he |

offers on behalf of the Conservative party
a promise to place Canada on an equal
footing with New Zealand, Australia, the
Argentine Republic and the United States,

At present, the Dominion sends to England |

but a amall fraction of the food supplies
which are benefited by cold storage and
quick transportation. This will be ren
dered clear by a glance at some statistics
In ten months of the last fiscal year Great
Britain imported 885,116,388 pounds of
butter, whereof Canada furnished only
27,479,200 pounds. Of bacon Great Britain
{mported from al! the world 570,829,280
pounds, of which Canada contributed but
86,748,560 pounds. Of the vast quantity
of eggs consumed in Great Britain Canada
forwarded only about 4 per cent. Her
contribution of fresh meats, poultry, vege-
tables and fruits was even more insignifi-
cant, Here, according to Sir Cnantrs
Trpper, is a field In whieh the Canadian
farmers might obtain great advantages
at the hands of a Government that had their
interests at heart, Why, he asks, should
not Canadian fresh beef and mutton under-
eel] the beef and mutton of New Zealand
{in the British market, and why should not

 

 

 

Canadian poultry, butter and eggs under-
eel) ewimilar commodit 3 imy rted into

England from Denmark and Normandy?
For what purpose, he adds, could the publie

funds of the Dominio he better expended
than in improving the position of Canadian
food producers inthe markets of the United
Kingdom?

There is no donbt that this proposal has

been received with favor not only by the
Conservative but by the independent press,

In short, both Mr. Parrerson and Mr
Tromas are arch enemies of the corpora-
tions so far as their candidacy for the
Senate is concerned. They can’t help It
if corporations are friendly to them.

For the sake of marking the progress
of the fine arta in Colorado we wish we had
espace to copy the Denver Republican's
aketch of Governor Tromas tattooing the
arch enemy with such indigo legends as
* Liar!,” “ Political Turncoat!,” “ Corpora-
tion Attorney and Booster!,” “ Demagogue!,”
“ Manipulator!,” “ Pretender!,” and 60 on,
The arch enemy should have been repre-
sented as tattooing the Governor at the
same time with similar compliments.

Amid these amenities of politica and

| Journalism in Colorado we should not forget

the vreat lesson that while a Bryanite has
to howl against corporations, he has no
objection to making money out of them.

Phe conditions of the election, of course,

differences of opinion concerning the com-

There is no known formula for an exact

Hamintron. The fact that his

which treats him as not a native American
hecause he was born in the Island of Nevis
in the West Indies. Yet HamiLton, under
the strict provisions of the United States
Constitution respecting the qualifications

The theatrical season in this city has
opened with a larger number of theatres
ffering amusement to the public than ever
before, Many of these playhouses will
aged on the “eombination” plan,
which provides a succession of plays and
nlavers ateach house. Having played their
ute the required number of times, the
layers pasa on to their next stopping place
y entertain other audiences, In a number
of theatres in this city, however, stock
companies are established, working more or
leag on the system of the “ palmy days ”
of the drama, and giving plays ina better
manner than was the custom in those
earlier times

{t our principal German theatre fs a stock
company working strictly on the “ old
lines." The company at the Irving Place
playa modern dramas and classical pieces,
eomle operas, and Poasen mit Gesang,
and when a German star comes ala Gast,
the company supports him, just asif it had
been hired especiall

This isthe old {dea ofa stock company
In the palmy days, companies such as this
were at all the theatres in Europe, Great
Britain and this country; in those days the
great actors, not then called stars, travelled
alone, and relied on the local company to
provide the cast for their plays, So Gar-
nick travelled about England and Ireland;
Mrs, Stppons made her famous success tn
Edinburgh with the ald of the local com-
pany: Macnheapy’s first visit here was made
alone, and on his second visit he brought

ly one actor, Mr. Rypvgr, to play the
vosite parts.” But the performances
of the stock companies of those days would

not sult us to-day. They were good tn their |

way, but valuable chiefly forthe training
they gave to the actors, and, tt may be
questioned, though It smacks of theatrical
heresy to do go, if the advantage to the

actor ought to outweigh the disadvantages
to the vidience
Hesidea the German company, thera

the same as the German company, Per-
haps the jast English-speaking stock con
pany here was at the Fifth Avenue Theatre
when {t was managed by DANIEL HARKINS,
about twenty years ago, BooTH played
with the local company then, and Mop-
JESKA; and Many ANDERSON 'S first per-
formances in this city were given with
a local company in the old manner, At
the Murray Hill and the American theatres,
the actors wet the training that the © lovers
of the legitimate” say was the strongest
element tn the old stock system: and as
several of the original members of the
company at the former theatre have ol
tained better positions in other companies
it seems that the training has stood them
in good stead

At some other theatres there are #
called stock companies, which in almost
nothing resemble the atock companies
of the old days, These companies take
their names from certain theatres, ant
wenerally begin their seasons att
playhouses, But there is little or no rota

Let us begin with India, where, until
recently, Buddhism seemed to have
almost extinct, even in the very lar f .
birth. Now, however, an organization has
been set on foot in Calcutta for the propaga
tion of Buddhist opinion. ‘his association
was started by Ceylon Buddhists, and tis

 

| presided over by Mr. DHARMAPALA, & Cey

lonese well known in Eurepe and the United

States. It has received the adhesion and
support of influential natives of India
some of whom contribute articles to its
journal, while others have gone to Ceylon to
etudy Buddhism there. A principal object
of the soclety, namely, to obtain possession
of the ancient temple erected on the spot
where the BcppHA obtained Nirvana, has
not aa yet been successful. Weare assured
however, that the organization ts full of
vitality and aspiration, and it seems to Prof
Davips by no means tmprobable that it
succeed in spreading to a considerable
extent once more in India the faith of the
greatest teacher and thinker that India
