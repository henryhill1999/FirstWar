Dr. Greene’s Nervura
Makes People Well.

  

ZOW few people know what it is to be well! How few
know what it is to rise in the morning with clear head
and desire to work-~ full of energy and GO!

Few indeed!

More people crawl out of bed, weary-eyed and heavy-
bodied, fecling a load chained to their feet to drag about like
an iron ball, In fact, that just what Disease is--an iron
ball a terrible drag which spoils a man’s powers and blasts
his life.

Disease is cowardiy. You mustresistit! Attackit! Cure
it! Weakness of blood or nerves grow daily. It is gradual decay;
allthe more dreary, because the victim IS able to drag around.
Dr. Greene’s Nervura, blood and nerve remedy, is the only sure
retredy, the one which will benetit sufferers when all others have
failed. This it does, simply because it is the food and medicine
Nature intended for the blood and nerves when, through over-
work, abuse, or any other cause, they haye become weakened and
exhausted, It is a wonderful cure, and the benefit and health and
strength it brings are permanent.
