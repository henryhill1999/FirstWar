Hetd, Who Owns Half the

Desirable Monopolies

Crar of Newfound-

Interested.

On One Side Are
Other is BR. G.
Island and Its Most

and Is Known as the
United States

land The
Quenec, Oct. 12-00 the day following the
: ons in Canada, namely, on Nov. 8

eral elect!
cae, general elections will be held in New-

foundland, and will be perhaps the most itme-
portant and far-reac hing that have ever oc-
that colony. On the one side are

urred it
aaa the forees that can be marshalled |

arrayed all

by the Gover
Bond and Mr. Morris, while opposed to them

are the tremendous Influences wielded by the

tie! iaire R. G. Reid, popularly known
aa th zar a Newfoundland, and reputed to
be the largest landholder on earth

The international {mportance of the contest
{a found in the fact that Mr Morine, the leader

f the opposition, is a Canadian who is under-

stood as favoring the annexation of Newlound
land to the Dominion of Canada, W hile bis op-
ponent, Mr Bond, who recently succeeded
Bir James Winter as Prime Minister, isan ad-
vocate of closer relations between ‘nd island
colony and the United States, He was the
author of the Bond-Biaine cenvention with
the United States, which the British Govern-
ment refused to ratify because of the protest
made by Sir John A. Macdonald, and the thea
Conservative Government of Canada, who de-
clared that @ sister colony should not be per-
niitted to give a preference to the United States
against the Dominion, ‘This protest was made
on the eve of an election in the Dominion, and @
very bitter feeling was engendered in New-
foundland by Great Britain's acquiescence
in it, the Imperial Government being accused
of acting as election agents for the Canadian
Conservatives, Notbing did more to stir up
a bostile feeling to Canada in the island colony
than this interference in her affairs by tlhe
Dominion, because she could not herself se-
cure a desirable reciprocity treaty with the
United States,

There have been frequent demands since
for the withdrawal of Canadian opposition
to the Bond-Biaine treaty, but so far without
avail, The Newfoundlagders point out that
every British West Indian island is allowed to
make « trade arrargement with the United
States, and naturally enough they ask them-
selves why the same privilege should nut be
theirs. The American republic, trom its posi-
tion and immense population, is Newfournd-
land's best customer. Canada takes virtually
nothing from Newfoundland, while the island
exports large quantities of fish to the United
States and has immense advantages to offer
the Americans in the proacution of their own
bank fishery
land is not, Ike Canada, a rival
United States in manufacturing and agri-
culture, but importa large quantities of
agricultural and manufactured products

One of the main planks of the present politl-
cal platform of Premier Bond Is a firm de-
mand on the British Government for the rati-
fieation, ccf: continued protests of the
Dominion of Canada, of the reciprocity treaty
that he negotiated tm 1890 with Secretary of
State Blaine at Washington. In the present
state of mind of the people of Newfoundland
it will be diMcult for the Imperial author
further to resist their wishes, without oon-
tributing to the growth of a sentiment of an-
nexation of the island to the United States

Mr. Bond announces as another feature
of his programme the curtailment of the privi-
leges confe:red on R. G. Reid, who owns nearly
all the franchises and a large part of the mineral
areas of the colpny. Publle opinion on the
island is about evenly divided In respect to
the Reld contract with the Government. But
for his aid the colony would have had to de
fault. On the other hand, he owns the ralil-
way, the dry dock, the telegraphs, the bay
steamers, the lands, the forests, the mines
and the atreet railway and electrio cars of
St. John's. The leaders of the present Liberal
Government of the colony and thelr followers
throughout the island are now asking whether
{t is desirable In the tnterest of the country
that he should own the Legislature also, for
Mr. Morine, the leader of the Conservative
opposition, is the counsel for Mr. Reid, and
his promise to resign that office i
comes to power is not deemed satisfactory
by his opponents

It is known that the Relds are large cone
tributors to Mr. Morine’s election fund
are employing all their influence and their
army of officials and employees throughout
the country toward the overthroy
administration, which has refused them the
desired legislation to a
of the various Reld franchises in Newfoundland

of the inland resources of the island

Though Newfouncland ia one-sixth larger
than [reland, fully half of it is owned in fee
simple by R. G. Reid, who began life as a poor,
boy in Sootland, without money
After making agood deal of money in Australia,
and much more asa contractor in the construc-
tion of the Canatian Pacifi
fered in 1893 to construct a railway right acr
the island of Newfouncland, nearly six hi
miles long, for $15,000 a mile The Govern
gave him the contract, but when the road w
bullt it was in financial difflculties and co
neither equip nor operate it Mr. Reid came
toitsrelief. He contracted to equip the road ar

run it, assuming all loss in connection there
with for a consideration of an annual mall sut
sidy of $6),000 and a grant of 5,000 acres of land
for every mile of railway
sole proprietor of more than two and a half
million acres of land. But as money grew
scarcer with the Government, Mr. Reid offered
to do without the annual subsidy and to run the
rallroai free for forty years if atthe end of that
period {t should be his own property, and on
condition that other land concessions be given
him as well as the railway and telegraph mo-
nopolies of the island,

When these conditions were agreed to, there
waa a loud outery that the whole island was
being handed over to Reid; the Legislature
waa petitione! and the Governor refuse! his
assent to the bill until Joseph Chamberlain,
Secretary of State for the Colonies brought
his influence to bear upon him. Since that
time, the Reids—". G. and his sons—have es-
tablishe! pulp mills, opened up mines of all
kinds, operateia number of Clyde-built steam-
ships about the coast in connection with the
railway, constructe! an electric railway in St
John's, the capital, and arranged for the build
ing of a mnodern hotel there Now they have
suddenly paused in their work of development-
awaiting the result of the coming elections, and
affording the electors ample food for reflection
in the meantime
