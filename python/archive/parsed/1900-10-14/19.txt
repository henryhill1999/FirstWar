and Roosevelt and the Republican State and
Legislative tickets
It is an important fact, often stated before
| but worth repeating, that every candidate on
| the Republican electoral and State tle kets in
Colorado this year aa well as the members of
the Advisory Board of the National Republican
Committee was an Bryanite in
1408, In this statement alone can be found a
strong indication of the revulsion of feeling that
has taken place in four years. It is enough
| to discourage and frighten the Fusion managers,
} but it is not the only sign that their cause is
| fast dying ifnotalready dead. Theyare plainly
rattled, and in their desperation they have done
l what other misguided politieal leaders have
done before them. Feeling the around slipping
| from beneath their feet they have turned their

the reorganizer and leader of the Republican
party in the State, Senator Wolcott, He repre-
the bone and sinew of the Republican
organization, and they have opened the torrents
of seurrility upon him in the hope of dodging
the real isaues of the campalan
In way that Blaine and Conkling
and other organization leaders were attacked
Woleott is being attacked, with this difference,
that there appears to be no limit to the vili-

He is called a llar and a villain of the

M'KINLEY'S
STATE MAY

The Peril to Her Interests Involved in Bryan's
Election Clearly Seen-Prominent Demo-
crats Out Against Him-- Republicans Likely
to Elect Their State Ticket, Too,

St. Paut, Minn, Oct. 12.—-Minnesota Re-
publicans now have the political situation well
in hand) The apathy which prevailed in this

State is rapidly vanishing The real dangers

to be apprehended from the election of Bryan

have been shown to the voters by the varied

| interests of the State in such a way as to bring

the question down to a personal matter

One of the greatest industries of Minnesota
is the lumber trade. Thousands of men are
employed in the mills and in the woods getting
out the logs Preparations have been made
for the largest cut in the history of the State
this winter if MeKinley is reelected, and until
this fact is assured the largest lumber con-
cerns will hold back. They are ready to send
their men into the timber now, but only as many
as are actually needed to repair roads and get
ready for the winter's cut are being sent. Thia
has become known to the lumber workers and
as their employment depends upon the output
of the mills it t@ already having its effect. The
past four years have found employment for
all of them and the wages have been good, #0
that if the election of Bryan is likely to deprive
them of of such employment
they will not vote the Democratic ticket

The mining interesta are similarly situated
Iron mining is the principal industry fn the
northern part of the State after the lumber
trade Next season's output of iron ore
promises to that of the present year,
which was largest ita history. If the

the possibility

exceed

the in

| election of Bryan will depress trade, as it is ex-

pected to do, the output of the mines will be
restricted to the actual demands This affects
not the miving Dut also the
ore railroads, of which there are a number and
of which more are tobe constructed in the spring
if conditions warrant it Next to the railroads
come the Lake carrying the great
fleet of ore vessels that find employment through
the operation of the mines

Then there is the manufacturing and Jobbing
trade of the Minnesota cities, all making plana
for expanding with a continuation of the prea
ent Administration and plans for restricting the
output in case of Bryan's election

These are strong factors in the campalgen in
Minnesota and it cannot be said that there Is
Dem

declarations and are making the same plana

Committeeman, and a leader of the Democracy

situation when he said a few days ago

“If Bryan cannot stir up the enthusiasm of
the votere in other States any better than he

Fusion State officer who aceompanied him
through the State, “his star will surely set

As well as can he gleaned from Indications
the Republican State ticket will have a plurality
of all the war from ten to fifty thousand and the
plurality for McKinley would cause no surprise
if it reached 70.000 This would be less than
17,000 more than the plurality of four vears ago,
and it isestimated thatthe voting population of
the State has increased 100.000 since that time

There are 600,000 qualified
the territory of Greater New York, the
established rule among politicians being to
divide by six the ascertained population of
4a constituency and to add to that total 5 per
cent, additional in the case of a very large city,
in whieh the disparity between female and
male residents is much less than in a rural
district. The sopulation of New York as
shown by the Johe oensus Was 8,487,200 and
Ohe-sixth of that is 672,850. An addition of
25,000 would bring up the tolal number of quali-
fled voters to 600,000, approximately, In the
Presidential election of 1806 and in the ensuing
Mayoralty election a full yote of 5 was
polled {n’each case, and it is not generally ex-
pected, despite the great growth of the clty
Since consolidation, that this year’s total vote
Will be much tn excess of 650, 000

This would leave $0,000 voters to be accounted
for. ‘The process of accounting for the ma-
Jority is easy Some New York citi-
zeus have not lived in one address the thirty
days required to qualify them for voting
Others did not obtain citizenship papers within
the ninety days before election, Other again,
though the number of these is «mall, are dis-
qualified by criminal conviction from exer
Cising the right to vote and still more are men-

pitals, some others in public institutions and
4 larger number are either out of the State on
business on days of registration or expect to

very large number of ita citizena connected
with the railroad transportation or steamship
business of the country, and it is, too, the pest-
dence of a number of travelling men whose
buslest time is the autumn

But all these deductions do not amount col-
lectively to 40,000, leaving a emall fraction of
Voters, perhaps 10000 in all, who will not
or do hot register and therefore cannot
vote at any election however momentous and
iniportant It is a pecuilarity about such cit-
izes, Which all observers have noted, that the

| SENATOR CHANDLER'S SEAT,

SEVEN NEW HAMPSHIRE MEN AFTER
HIS SENATE CHAIR,

A Namber of Dark Horses Also Cherishing

Hopes on the Subject-—Congressman Sul-

loway's Double Chance—Chandler's Popular

Strength—Causes of the Opposition to Him,

Nasnua, N. HL, Oct. 18 The struggle among
the friends of a half-dozen candidates for the
United States Senate from New Hampshire
which has been carried on with more of
apirit for the past year and a half has now,
three weeks before the election of the Legisla-
ture, culminated in a ery of “anybody to beat
Chandler." The aituation and
in this State the Senatorial contest overshadows
the Presidential or any other local
or State question

On the one hand stands Senator William
FE. Chandler, backed by only two of the dozen
or more Republican daily papers in the State
and by only a few of the men who are recog-
nized as the party leaders. Against him are
pitted seven avowed candidates, representing
every faction of the party and nearly every
part of the State. These include Congress-
man Cyrus A. Sulloway of Manchester, who
was recently nominated by acclamation for
his fourth term in Congress from the First
New Hampshire district, but still an
active candidate for Senator Chandler's seat;
Judge Henry FB Burnham of Manchester, a
prominent lawyer; Congressman Frank @G
Clarke of Peterborough, who has fer four
years past represented Second § district:
Gen. Frank & Streeter of Concord, the chief
New Hampshire attorney for the Boston and
Maine Railroad; ex-United States Senator
Henry W. Blair of Manchester, who now
practising law; exeCongressman Henry M
Baker of Bow, noted as a generous contributor
to the national and State campaign funds
and Col. Henry G. Quinby of Laconia, who
is prominent in Masonic, Garand Army and
other fraternal and societies. In addi-
tion to gentlemen and their friends,
Senator Chandler haa to meet the
of many party leaders all over the State and
that of a majority of the Federal officeholders,
in spite of the fact that it is generally agreed
that the Natlonal Administration desires the
reélection of Mr. Chandler

Notwithstanding this opposition It now ap-
pears the anti-Chandler elements that so
great is Mr. Chandler's popularity in the party
that {t is doubtful If the seven opposition cane
didates can together poll enough votes to con-
trol the joint convention of the Legislature,
and orders have been given to secure the elec-
tlon of State Senators and Representatives
who will, first, last and all the time vote. for
anybody except Chandler. This state of af-
fairs has caused not afew dark horses to come
out of thelr pastures with a view of securing
a few votes here or there in the Legislature
which will form the nucleus of a boom to be
worked up after the Legislature hecomes tired
of a deadlock Among these secondary can-
didates may be mentioned John B
Smith of Hillsborough, an indefatigable party
worker when he takes bold) Henry M. Putney
of Manchester, United States Comrnissioner
to the Paris Exposition; James O. Lyford of
Concord, Naval Officer of the Port of Boston
Gen. Charles H. Burns of Nashua, another rail-
road lawyer, and last, but not least, Gov. Frank
W. Rollina of Concord, the originator of the
Old Home Week idea. While none of these dark
horses has said he is a candidate and while
some have declared that they would not take
the office, their friends have been urging the re-
spective fitness of each for the place

It may here be mentioned that the result
of the Republican Congressional Convention
in the Firat district a month ago has had an
unexpected effect on the Senatorial fight. The
of Manchester, where the convention
was held, has two prominent candidates for
United States Senator, Congressman Sulloway
and Judge Burnham. Sulloway was credited
with having the ereater following outside Man-
chester, while Burnham was conceded to have
a majority of the wards of that city. In the
Congressional convention the friends of Burn-
ham engineered a deadlock so that in five bal-
lots none of the four candidates could secure
They then sprang the name of
Congressman Sulloway for reelection and with
the withdrawal of the four original candidates
he was nominated by acclamation

The purpose of the Burnham of
course to eliminate Sulloway from the Senatorial
race, leaving the field of Manchester clear for
his chief local rival. But the trick proved
a boomerang. Sulloway ted the Cone
gressional nomination while not withdrawing
from the Senatofial race, and is, therefore, a
sure winner of placeif not of first money More-
over, the situation strengthens Sulloway
compared with Burnham, because the men
who aspired to represent the First district in
the House naturally wish now to have Mr
Sulloway promoted to the Senate that they
may renew their fight for the vacancy which
will be caused thereby Sulloway atands
next to Chandler as the candidate of the people
He is the tallest man in Congress, very Demo-
cratic in his tastes, and as chairman of the Pen-
sions Committee during the last session gained
many adherents among the old soldiers through
advancing pension legislation. His action
in continuing inthe Senatorial fight after accept-
{ng the renomination for Congress haa embit-
tered many who helped to nominate him

Senator Chandler, whose independence of
action has not endeared him to the would-be
managers of New Hampshire politics, has a
unique political record extending over nearly
half a century At the age of 21, in 1854, he
took a leading part in the organization of the
Fremont Club in Concord, becoming its first
secretary It waa from this club that the
Republican party of New Hampshire was
formed. In the following year he was elected
a member of the State Legislature, where he
served for three years, being Speaker of the
House for the last two terms It was in 1864
that he began his career in Washington, firat
as Solicitor of the Navy Department and next
as Aasistant Secretary of the Treasury. He
resigned the latter office in 1867 to become
a delegate to the Republican National Con-
vention, after which he became secretary of
the National Committee. In 1882 President
Arthur made him Secretary of the Navy and
in the three years during which he held that
office he laid the foundation of the present
navy of the United States

Since 1887 he has represented New Hamp-
shire in the United States Senate. There he
has been conspicuous, Among the com-
mittees of the Senate on which he has served
are those on Inter-tate Commerce, the
Census, the Navy and Post Offices and Post
Roads At the present time he is chairman of
the Committee on Priviiewea and Elections
and in that eapacity opposed the seating of
Senator Clark of Montana

The principal objection which the opponents
of Mr Chandler urge to his reélection is his
attitude toward bimetallism. Senator Chandler
himself says that he stands fairly and squarely
on the platform adopted by the Republican
National Convention in Philadelphia last June,
and that hia“ vote is as sure against free silver
coinage by the United States alone aa that of
any Republican His candidacy was indorsed
by anumber of the influential labor organiza-
tions, including the International Brother-
hood of Blacksmiths, the Iron Mouldera’ Union,
the Machine Trade Helpers’ Union, and the
Washington branch of the Pattern Makers’
reague of North America

The whieh Mr. Chandler
counters from newspapers and poli-
ticlans in his own State, is sheared the
rank and file of the Republicans It arises
largely from the free useof his satirical tongue
aod pen. The opposition of the Boston and

Maine Railroad te Mr Chandler's reelection
which is counted upon by his rivals the
chief means to bring about his defeat, does
not apparently disturb him. He says that what-
ever the subordinate railroad men who aspire
to succeed him or to rise by his downfall may
declare, the real owners and managers of the
railroad will not interfere Their course
aix years ago when Mr Chandler was reelected
bears out the statement Mr Chandler seems
to have more confidence and less worry than
any ofthe men who seek his shoes.
