DADY MAY GET 8100,000,

Probably Entitled to That Compensation tf
He Doesn't Get the New Havana Contract.
Special Cable Despatch to THE SUN

Havana, Oct. 18. —Now that the Ayuntamiento
has decided that the contract for sewerlng and
paving the city must be put up at public auction
threa appraisers will be appointe| to decide
thea int that Mr. Michael J. Dady of Brook-
lyn, N.Y, can claim for drawing the old plans
and for whatever work he may have performed
The Ayuntamiento will name one of the apprals-
ers, Mr Dady will select another and these two

will decide on the third. It is estimated that
the amount to be paid to Mr. Dady will not
exceed $190,010. It should be paid to him by
the successful bidder for the work. If some

one should underbid Mr. Dady and then refuse
to pay the amount decided on by the appraisers
the matter would have to be fought out in the
courts Mr. Dady has the opinion of two Secre-
taries of Justice that he is eutitied to tils
pensation if the contract is not awarded to him

lemuel Eli Quigg, who accompanied Mr.
TDady to Havana, sailed for New York to-day
on the steamship Mexico. Before leaving he
sald he thought the decision reached by the
Ayuntamiento was a good one for the city.
