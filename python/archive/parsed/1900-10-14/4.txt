Opposite the Methodist compound tn Pekin
+ the residence of a Huang ‘Tai Tzu, or vellow
virdle man, a inan who is of direct descent
from the royal family Now, the Chinese
jouse has no chimney, but at the risk of belie
ont of the fashion the foreigners prepared fo con-

ousea One of thera

chimneys, it happened, rose exactiv opposite

the front gate of the yellow gird'e man’s house
Now, all this man’s fren, were girls Of
ourse, he wanted to w the ren He

   

 

called in the geomancer, who, on @axvamination,

discovered that our enimney had destroved

 

he Feng Shua of his place

One day the old man dressed himyelf tn his
hest silk garments and came over to call on the
foreign teachers He spent half an hour or
more in pleasant conversation on various

topios which led up to the luck of the place and |

portance of male children,

 

the value and
and then explained the nature of his visit,
which was to ask If the foretan teacher would

not taar the chimney down to a4 level with the |

highest ;e >! of the roof in order that his *miser-
able hom, might be blessed with the hope of
male offspring

Of course, the forelgn teacher consented, the i

{mney was torn down, and, hehold, as a con-
firmation of the acumen of the geomancer and
the power of the principles of Feng Shua, the
rellow girdle man's next child was a boy!

Within the walls of the cit, of Fuchao there
!s a hill witoh the inhabitants of that city look
upon as very Irnportant as governing the healt
and oontrolling the general prosperity as well
as happiness of the eity and people. In the
earlier daya some Finglish mi-+sionarles bought
property and built upon that when the
people, fearing that the Feng Shua of the cit
would be Injured, arose and destro: ed the entire
property of the mission, consi*ting of a chur
rchoothonte and dwelling Again, the death
of an official tn Hangchao was belleved b
tha people to have rested from a mis-lon build
ing on a hi'l not far from his official revidence
‘The peonle here were more considerate than
thore in Fuchao and reque:ted the missionaries
to accept a site ina diverent part of the elty
which thav, of course, conveanted te

 

For many years the Methodist mission tn
‘lientain had great difloulty with both offictals
and people because of a stroet chaps! located
Just inside the east gate ofthe city. The reason
@iven was that the vhape! destroyed the Feng
Bhua of the place. Eiforta were made again and
again to settle the matter, but always without
snecess. Finally beth the officials on the one
hand and the missionaries on the other grew
tired of the constant trouble, and the former
offered either to buy the chapel and property
or to give in exchange a new site They were
asked to select a site, and, if they were able to
find one which was satisfactory and give a auf.
ficient amount of money to erect a suitable
chapel, the missionaries would move A site
was found, a chapel was erected, and every-
thing was moved away from the old chapel,
which atill stands in the old place and doea not
eeem to injure the Feng Shuasines the forgigner
has gone

All these Feng Shua difficulties do not occur,
however, between the Chinese and the mis-
elonary, When the railroad was being sur-
veved from Tientain to Pekin innumerable
difficulties were found in the way, and the first
thing that had to be done in leaving Tientsin
waa to cut a half circle in order to get around

 

 

 

 

      

the thousands of graves When 1@ railroad
was being surveyed fr ( ? \
the same difficulties occurred Wher
was proposed to make a cut through a moun-

tain the first cueation that arose was as to
whether making a cutof that kind would spoll
the Feng Shua of the place, for a range of t

to the north of a elty or a plain acts a prote

tion against the bad wind of the north, the
fame as the inound thrown up around 9 gmve-
