FINANCIAL AND COMMERCIAL.

Tumspay, May 22.

The facilities of the New York Stock Ex-
change were utilised almost exclusively to-day
{u conducting a vigorous and apparently suo-
ceasful campaign against the short interest in

! Sugar Refining and American Tobacco, The
| two mtocks supplied considerably more than
half of the total transactions, and in only one
other stock, namely, Brooklyn Rapid Transit,
did the dealings exceed 10,000 shares. It seems
alinost superfluous to add to the above ataie-
ment that the dealings were more purely pro-
fessional than at any time since the retrograde
movement in the stock market began, The
advance in Sugar Refining was accompanied by
the usual rumors of asettlement of the war {n
| the refining Industry. It was specifically as-

 

serted that the American Sugar Refining Com-
pany had purchased the Doscher plant.

This report waa unequivocally disposed of by
the President of the American company shortly
before the close of business. That official
admitted, however, that there is alittle improve-
ment in the refining industry that may proceed
futher because of the seasonable demand for
refined sugars and the moderate advance in
raw sugars

The sharp advance in the price of Sugar
Refining stock shows that actual holders do not
yet appreciate the fact that their security has
been placed permanently upon alower dividend
basis than ruled up to the time the last quarterly
dividend was declared, and that @ further
reduction ts probable. Even if the
American Sugar Refining Company shou'd
secure control of all its competitors, {t {ts
estinated in the trade that {!t would
be unable to pay more than {t fe
paying at present, upon the new capitalization
required to effect the consolidation. There
were indications to-day that a considerable
part of the demand for Sugar Refining came
from @ brokerage concern that has recently
been selling calls upon the stock, The max-
imum advance of more than 7 points in the
price apparently tempted purchasers of the
calls to exercise their options and this, in turn,
compelled the sellers of the privileges to adjust
their position in the open market. Ata reao-
| tlon of nearly 2 points from the highest price,
Sugar Refining closed 4% per cent. higher than
yesterday

The transactions in American Tobacco when
reduced to full stock were only 30,000 shares,
but the demand for the stock was suffictently

 

urgent to lift the price 4 points and
|leave ft with a met gain of 3% per
cent. The market for {t was apparently

influenced by the same considerations that
shaped the fuctuations in Sugar Refining. On
light transactions Continential Tobaceo en-
foyed a sympathetic advanceofa point. There
were alternate spasms of buying and selling of
Rrooklyn Rapid Trans t that made the stock
| thirdin respect to activity, but did not make
any netchange in price at the close. Outside of
| the three stocks mentioned, the transactions
were almost nominal. The prices of many
{ssues improved because of the ease ‘with
which the leaders in the limited and profes-
sional speculation advanced, On the other
hand, anumber of speculative favorites of a
few months ago sustained net losses of several
points. Foreign arbitrage houses sold about
15,000 shares on balance and reported the mar-
ketat London forall classes of securities as
duiland uninteresting

A significant decline {n the price of British
consols was accompanied by rumors of a further
| lssueofthemin connection with preparations
| for defensive measures, While shipments of
specie to Europe have not been formally an-
nounced, {t is understood that at least $1,500,000,
and possibly twice that amount, will be shipped
to Parison Thursday. The only domestic news
of !mportance was the announcement that the
Treasury Department had called $5,000,000 from
| the depositary bank, and further amounts as
| may be required to redeem the $25,000,000 of ex-
tended 2 per cent. bonds that have been called
for redemption. This action corfirms the state-
ment made in this column several days ago,
that one purpose of the call redeeming the
bonds {s to reduce the deposits of the Govern-
ment {inthe national banks. The closing of the
stock market was irregular

A slight advance in wheat early in the day was due
to better cables than nad been expected, dry weather
in the Northwest, complaints of damage by Hessian
flyin MePherson county, Kan., frosts in Russia, a
moderate foreign demand, covering of shorts and a
little new buying. Paris advanced 5 centimes for
wheat and 40 for flour, while Liverpool declined only

provement was soon lost, however, and a fractional
decline ensued on profit taking, light rains in the ex-
treme Northwest and cloudy weather over the whole
Northwestern belt with predictions of showers, gen-
rrally favorable crop reports and the protracted dul
ness of the cash demand. Minneapolis wired that
there was a slight trace of rainin South Dakota and
Minnesota and that Northwestern markets were
heavy Nevertheless covering of shorts caused A
