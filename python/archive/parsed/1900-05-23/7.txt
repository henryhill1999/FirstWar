NO CUT RATES TO ATLANTIC CITY.

Trenk Lines Rega Proposed Rates From
the West as Too Low.

* Special excursion rates were discussed from

Aifferent points of view at the meeting of the |
Trunk Line Passenger Committee tn thiscity |

yesterday A majority of the committee de-
gired to give the railroads in the Central Pas-
eenger Association the privilege o° running
cheap summer excursions from (Cincinnati,
Cleveland, Indianapolis and intermediate
points to Atlantic City and return. An active
minority oppewed the application of the Cean-
tral Passenger \ines on the ground that the ex-
cursion rates to Atlantic ( ity yere rade at so
low a figure that they enabled persons to come
en to New York at much less than the regular

rates
A two-thirds vote was necessary to give the
titioning lines the pri yilege asked for,
ut more than one-third o ;
voted against the proposition This is the
first time within th ree years that sus h jin appli
cation from Western lines has been ref.sed
The complaint of the Michigan Central Rail-
road against the Nickel Plate and Lackawanna
ines for granting reduced party rates to 500
forwewiana enroute from the Northwest to
Europe was referred to the Joint Passenger

Committee, The membera of the Trunk Line |

Committee contended thatit waa not their
business to interfere in the matter Special |
fates were granted to several projected excur-

fore noon and then advanced rapidly under
heavy dealings within two houra to 117 The
last sale was at 1i5's, Or atanetadvance of 44%
potnts forthe day. Of course there were res
pDewed Wall Street reports that the sugar trade
war had been settled, but H ©) Havemeyer of
the American Sugar Kefining ( pany said
that he knew nothing of any settlement The

dvance might be a squeeze of t “shorts

ut hedidn’t know what “those fellows over
there (on the Stock Exchange) were coir

Another man intr “d in the A e
Bugar Refining Co npany said that at this
geason of the vear thera is avery big and nor-
mal demand for refined sugar, Denials thatthe
war was settied were obtained from represen lage
tives of Arbuckle Brothe

the forelosure of a mortgage by the Union

NEW FLYERS TO THE WEST,

Pennsylvania to Shorten the Time to Cleveland
by Foar Hours.

For the purpose of meeting the fast train com-

petition recently started by differential linea tn

western territory the Pennsylvania Rallroad

will put on two or three new flyeraon May 27
The feature of this new departure that attracts

the moat attention among railroad men is a |

daily express from Clevelandto Pittsbur@ and

New York. This new train will shorten the |

time between Cleveland and New York four
hours and ita continuance will necessitate a ree
adjustment of al) trunk line schedules between
the pointa named Cieneral passenger agents

of competing lines sav that thia move of the |
Pennaylvania road will force an iasue on fast |

train service which may disrupt the joint pas-
senger agreement

Tomspay, May 22.
The facilities of the New York Stock Ex-

 

| change were utilised almost exclusively to-day
| {un conducting a vigorous and apparently suc-
' cessful campaign against the short {interest fn |

Sugar Refining and American Tobacco, The
two stocks supplied considerably more than

half of the total transactions, and tn only one
| other stock, namely, Brooklyn Rapid Transit,

did the dealings exceed 10,000 shares. It seems
almost supertiluous to add to the above state-
ment that the dealings were more purely pro-
fessional than at any time since the retrograde
movement in the stock market began. The
advance in Sugar Refining was accompanied by
the usual rumors of a settlement of the war tn

the refining {ndustry, It was specifically as- |

serted that the American Sugar Refining Com-
pany had purchased the Doscher plant
This report waa unequivocally disposed of by
the President of the American company shortly
before the close of business. That official
admitted, however, that there is alittle{mprove-
ment in the refining industry that may proceed
futher because of the seasonable demand for
refined sugars and the moderate advance in
raw sugars
The sharp advance In the price of Sugar

Refining stock shows that actual holders do not )
yet appreciate the fact that their security has |

been placed permanently upon a lower dividend
basis than ruled up to the time the last quarterly
dividend was declared, and that @ further
reduction ts probable. Even if the
American Sugar Refining Company shou'd
secure control of all its competitors, {t ts
estiinated in the trade that !t would
be unable to pay more than it ite
Paving at present, upon the new capitalization
required to effect the consolidation, There
were indications to-day that a considerable
part of the demand for Sugar Refining came
from a brokerage concern that has recently
been selling calls upon the stock. The max-
{mum advance of more than 7 points in the
prie® apparently tempted purchasers of the
calla to exercise their options and this, 'n turn,
compelled the sellers of the privileges to adjust
their position in the open market. Ata reao-

which the leaders in the limited and profes.
