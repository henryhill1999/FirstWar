DR. PURVES INSTALLED,

He's Now Pastor of the Fifth Avenue Presby-
terlan Church—Dr. Patton and the Bible.

The Rev, Dr. G. T. Purves was Installed as
pastor of the Filth Avenue’ Presbyterian
Chureh last night. The Key. Dr. David
G. Wylie, Moderator of the Presby-
tery, presided and with him = on the
platform were President Patton of Princeton,
and a number of other well-known Presby-
terian clergymen, The new pastor satin a
front pew until he rose to go to the pulpit to
pronounce the benediction

Dr Patton preached the sermon He de-
jored the modern tendency to discredit the
fible and declared that despair was the only
alternative for taith in the Gospel tle saidin
part

“Coristian religion is either a revelation or a

 

|
phase in the process of evolution Suppose |
we regard it as revelation, Then comes the |
inquir us to the seat of the authority
and this question cannot be dodged or
evaded. Wheat is it a revelation of
and within what) area omust we search
for its authority’ How shall it be measured by |

metes and bounds? If Christianity is a piece of
information from God itimust be found some-

where, The area of their authority is in the
seriptures- inthe Old ang New Testaments, We
cannot believe that the Bible is the word of

God and then say that the only things in it of |
importance are relative to human conduct !
“Let us suppose that Chri-tianity is nota
revelation, but a part ofa great process of evo-
lution Let ous take the anti-supernatural
theory of Christianity and consider the Bible
simply asa record of religious experiences of
people dead and gone. There were no miracles,
therefore no incarnation the doctrine of in- |
carnation is gone, There was no decline and |
fall, and sin is simply a term for incompleteness |
of development, so the doctrine of atonement |
ismone. Whatisleftof the dogmatic content |
of the Scriptures? Not a shred. And that is
|
|
}
|

 

what we are coming to. Nothing lett) but
etheal matter and instruction as tohow we
shall trent our neighbors,

“Bat the ethies of Christianity are not enough
We rust take of the Bible allor nothing. If itis
revelation we cannot minimize it. We must go
back to the old gospel or onward to
spar

Moderator Wylie then asked the constitu -
tional questions of the new pastor and of the
yweoocle. Inhis “charge to the pastor’ the Rey.
br Robert R. Booth said that not only Presby-
terians, but all others who think, would appre-
ciate hin if he would preach the fulness of the
doctrine as embodied in the Presbyterian Con-
tession of Faith

Ihe charge to the people was delivered by
the Rev. Dr Wo M. Smith,

Father Ryan, sometimes cailed the
Priest of the Confederacy,’ was unveiled

rough granite cross, seven feet high, It was
erected by the Pickett-Buchanan Chapter of
the Daughters of the Confederacy, who re-
ceived from all over the South contributions
toward its cost. It stands in himwood Ceme-
tery, where the unknown Confederate dead are
buried, and about it isa fence of cannon balls
and bayonets

This was Confederate Memorial Day and at
the unveiling all those who went out to deco-
rate the graves of dead Confederates were
present, Several military commands, the
naval reserves, acompany of veterans of the
Spanish war, many ex-Confederates in uni-
form, with many women gathered, about the
memorial when the naval post band plaved

It developed to-day that at Portamouth,
where Confederate Memorial Day will shortly
be celebrated, Postmaster Samuel L. Bur-
roughs, a Republican, asked permission of the
Department to close the Post Office on that
dav. The desired permission was given him.

QUEER BEAST LOOSE IN THE BRONX,

 

Attacks Two Trathfal Fishermen and Fancies
a Blue-Clad Leg.

Frank Kauffman and Henry Landendorn,
young men who live near the Invermere Hotel,
in The Bronx, are telling of an encounter with
a strange beast, which they deseribe asa cata-

mount, While they were returning home late
on Monday night through the salt meadows
from a fishing trip, they say, they saw an ani-
mal following them. Supposing that it was a
dog, they paid no attention to ituntilit sprang
upon them with a vicious growl

Kauffmann, who wasin the lead, struck the
animal on the head with his walking stick but
the stick being a light one the blow only seemed
to make the animal more savage, It rushedon
the men but they kept it off by kicking it. They
kept up arunning fight for about five minutes,
they sav hen Kauffman stumbled on a
heavy club and dealt the beast a blow on the
neck which sent it howling into the woods
Tbe men say the beast had soft dark fur and
eyes which “fairly biazed in the darkness.”
Each of them carried a string of fish and eels
and they think theanimal was attracted by
their cateh

Policemen Brittain and Clarke, who are on
duty at night just across the Mount Vernon
line, have also recently seen a strange animal
A few nights ago it dashed out of the woods at
Brittain and snapped at his trouser legs. He
beat it off with his nightstick, These policemen
think a wolf attackeu them

effect that no one who had not been a inember
of the society for two years should hold office.

MAN TALKS TO MOTHERS' CONGRESS,

Tells Them Man Never Loves and Should Have
No Part In the Care of Children,

Drs Moinks, la, May 22.-A sharp discussion
ollowed the reading of a paper by Dr. Oscar
Christman of the Kansas State Normal Sehool,
at the Mothers’ Congress this afternoon In
the course of Lis address Dr, Christan said

“The father should be relieved from the care
of the children, It is his duty to provide for
the mother and child. Women should Tre
lieved from the drudgery of housework, espe-
cially from cooking, so as to give their time to
eare of the child. ‘The present course of college

training is too much for the reason and not
enough for the motherly duties. Hverything
we do for our girls is to make them marriage-

 
 

 

be

 

able and then put them on the market. Why
not educate them for marriage?
“Man never loves: he only reasons, What is

called love in man is only sex feeling. Man jas
through his reason taken burdens from women
to make them better able to care for
children.”

The theory that the father is not equally re-
sponsible with the mother in parentage was
vigorously denivd by the women speakers, and
£0 Was the assertion that there was no true love
in men
