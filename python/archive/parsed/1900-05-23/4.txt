heralded as such phenomenal players, it Was ex-
pected that the Stevens boys would be beaten

would be defeated when they began the game
and did not play with thei vim. In the
first half each side seored four goals. During
the intermission the Stevens boys were told by
their friends that they eould win and in the sec
ond balf they played an aggressive game and
scored two goals more, winning the game by 6
goals to4

Saturday's game takes the place of the match
with the University of Pennsylvania The club

    

 

had expected to play th imrocks, chate
ions of the aenior league, o ne 16, but the
fatter, after promising to come, declined to play

and negotiations were opened with other teams
of the same league. The Capitols responded
favorably, with the proviso that the match
should be played earlier AsOld Penn consented
to cancel her date the schedule was changed as
above indicated. The Capitols were not quite
as atrong as the Shamrocks last vear, but they
defeated both the Sherbrookes and the Torontos
and rank very near to the top among Canadian
teats

On Decoration Day the Crescents will play
their old rivals, the University of Toronto,
whom they have beaten for two successive
seasons and naturally expect to defeat them
again

Information From Paris Not Satisfactory to

Managers of Our Athletic Teams,

Whatever information has been received from
Paris regarding the request made by the Inter-
collegute AWA. A.A. that the Sunday games at
the international meeting in that city be aban-
doned is of such a contradictory and unsatis-
factory nature that Manager Langenberg of the
Princeton track team was in New York vester-
day prepared to cancel all arrangements made
for sending the team abroad. He first visited the
otiee of A.G Spalding, the director of sports
for America, who is now at. Paris trying to
obtain the concessions desired by the American
iniversities, but eould not obtain any definite
information from James EB, Sullivan, who isin
charge of Mr. Spalding’s athletic affaira during
his absence

Mr Sullivan said that he had cabled to Paria
askivg the result of the newotiati na, but had
received no repy, From indirect sources it ap-
pears that the American director's ellorls were
only partially successful ‘Phe most the bx oo-

ion managers are satd to have agreed to is to
change as far as possible the finals of events ove
curring on Sunday to another day. This condi
tional surrender is by no means satisfactory to
the managers of the majority of the American
college teams, and unless the Prench author.
ities recede stil, further it is almost certain
that the principal. teams will not go
abroad. It is pointed out that under such a
provisional agreement as outlined in the brief
cable despatches receives here the Exposition
managers would have the Americin teams at
their merey if the trip to Paris was undertaken,
aod the athietes might have to compete on Sun-
day or remain idle after ineurring the great ex-
pense of the journey, and wateh the represent.
atives of other nations carry off the houors

Mr. Sullivan stated that the matter would be
settled one way or the other when Director
Spalding returns from Paris. He is expected to
sail to-day, and the presumption is that a eom-
promise! yas been effected which is of too com-
plicated a nature to be properly defined in a
cable message, This explanation was not suf-
ficient for Manager Langenberg, who says that
uniess the request is granted immediately
Princeton is prepared to give up the idea of
sending ateam, and he is anxious to obtain in-
formation at once, so that he can notity the
steamship company that the berths already en-
wawed will not he required

The Pronceton manager also visited the office
of the United States Comunsdoners to the
Paris Expositionand had a conference with Wil-
lard Smith, who represents ( onuiissioner Peck
while the latteris at Paris. The result was that
a cable despatch was sent to the Commissioner
asking fora definite and immediate answer to
the proposition of the Intercollegiate Associa-
tion. A reply is expected to-day
