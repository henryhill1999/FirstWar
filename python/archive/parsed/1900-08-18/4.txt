Canada Wants to Play Our Team-Firat Date
Booked for Taylor,

It was announced yesterday that J. H. Tay-
lor’s first match in this country, as now ar-
ranged, would be on Friday, Aug. 24, at the
Deal Golf Club. He will then play the best ball,
thirty-six holes, of the profeasionals, RK. B. Wil-
fon of Deal and Willie Norton of Seabright.
The proposition fa a very bold undertaking for
Taylor, as both of his opponents are men of
more than ordinary skill, who know the course
likeabook. It will beamatch well worth watch

ing

Things are getting to a cructal state in the
North Jersey Shore Teague. The fight for

the team championship, now held by Deal,
seems to have narrowed down to @ race be-
tween Seabright, Deal and Holly wood, ‘o-day
the meeting between Hollywood and Deal
comes off at Deal, ‘To comply with the condi-
tions of the League matches each team must
play six men on a aide, but they may put in as
many as they please by mutual agreement.
It is likely that twenty, at least, will be on each
side. Which side will win Is the question of
the moment along the coast from Spring Lake
to Seabright. There are bets depending on
the result, too, from boxes of candies and
gloves to real wagers where money counts,

 

The Royal Canadian Golf Association has
notified the United States Golf Association
that it has selected Saturday, Sept. 1, as the
time for the third renewal of the International
team match. The links chosen {s that of the
Quebeo Golf Club. The conditions call for
teams of ten, selected from the golfers of the
two countries. In the first match, played at
Toronto in 1898, the American team won by 27
to 7, and laat year, at Morris County, the home
team won by 93 to 0. The date selected clashes
with the final day at the women's champion-
ship and also with the Newport open tourna-
ment. It ia likely, therefore, that the United
States Golf Association will demur to the date
selected.

 

Aside from team matches to-day there are
Governor's Cup contests to be held at the North
Jersey, Flushing and Monmouth Beach links
and, besides, there are competitions on at
nearly every links in the Metropolitan Golf As-
sociation, for the stay-at-homes keep the game
litely, and at the summer resort links the old
game ia booming

 

STAMFORD, Aug. 17..-A bogey handicap for
women for prise offered by Mrs. Charles
Stewart Smith was played on the links of the
Wee Burn Golf Club this afternoon. It was won
by Miss Genevieve Hecker. The scores were

Miss Genevieve Hecker, 5 down; Misa Julle Edna
Capen, ¥ down; Miss Li!lian Holbrook, 14 down; Miss
F. M. Jones 16 down; Miss Weed, 16 down.

Some others played but did not return cards
The bogey figureffor the course ts 46, Mise
Hecker, Metropolitan champton, equalied this
going out but fell behind some coming_in,
taking 50. She practises frequently on the Wee
Burn links, giving her attention principally to
certain points in which she was a trifle weak {n
the M.S A tournament, such as putting. She
will leave for the Shinnecock links next Wed-
nesday afternoon.

 

Aug. 17.--George Low de
feated Mungo Park of Bennington, profes-
sional of the Mount Anthony Club, 17 u
in a thirty-six-hole match, on the Edwano
links here to-day. The only features of the
day's play were several fifteen and twenty-foot
puts by low

Cuicaao, Aug. 17.-Bruce D. Smith of On-

pionship of 1898

 

Jerrenson, Aug. 17.—The semi-finals in the
women's tournnment have been closely con-
tested and the battle among the leaders in the

YOUNG BOXER IN

 

THE HOSPITAL,

 

George Keily, an Amateur Featherweight,
Knocked Uaconscious at the Greenwood,

George Kelly, 18 years old, of 12544 Twenty-
eighth street, Brooklyn, is lying in the Seney
Hospital in a dangerous condition as the re-
sult of a knock-out blow received at the Green-
wood A. C. on Thursday night, in a 10-round
bout with Michel Myers, also 18 years old, of
190 John street. It was a “try-out” night at
the club and the closing set-to of the night was
between Kelly and Myers, each of whom
welghed about 115 pounds and seemed in good
coudition. The youngsters were well matched,
but Kelly seemed to have done the most effective
work until about the middle of the ninth round
when he carelessly lowered his guard and re-
ceived a fierce blow on the jaw, which felled
him to the floor, He struck heavily on the back
of his head and was unconscious when picked
up and carried to his corner by his seoonds.

On his removal to the dressing room he
etill remained unconscious, and there being no
physician around a hurried message was sent
to the Seney Hospital and Ambulance Surgeon

si] responded. He succeeded tn partially
Sovtving’ the injured boy and movel hkn in
the ambulance to the hospital. Although

badly hurt the doctors think that he will re-
cover, Whether the injuries were caused by
the blow or the fall on the floor the doctors
could not determine

The policemen at the club arrested Myers,
Edward Dougherty, the referee, and Mine
others as aiders and abettors of the flgaht \Vhe

prisoners were arraigned yesterday morning
before Magistrate Bristow in the Butler street
court. Myers was held in $600 bail, pending

BANNOCKBURN AGAIN.

SCHREIBER'S HORSE WINS HIS FOURTH
SUCCESSIVE RACE.

Plangers Continue in Luck—Only One Fav-
orite Fails to Make Good—Douro, McAddie
and Trillo Prove Good Investments —
Draughteman Nearly Brings Off a Coup.

Baratooa, Aug. 17.—The track here had
dried out considerably over night with the
result that it was in fairly good shape although
slow by the time the racing began. The large
crowd on hand saw some good sport and better
still four favorites won, but they were at short
prices.

The day began with a race for maiden three-
year-olds and upward and eleven responded
to the bugle call. Douro seemed to be the best
of the lot and was backed down from 2 to 1 to
7 to 5, but Mordelmo, Lord Ogleby and Dreughts-
man were backed, the latter from 60 to 1 to
80 to 1, The race was easy for Douro who
led all the way and won by two lengths from
Draughtaman. Lord Ogleby, who finished
third, waa poorly ridden by Mitchell.

The second race had fifteen entries, but was
reduced to seven, which left the race at the
merey of McAddie whioh was made a prohibitive
favorite. Burns, his rider, allowed Likenesa
to show the wey to the last furlong and then
McAddie took the lead and won easily by two
lengths. A poor lot took part in the third
race which found Dolly Weithoff a hot favorite,
but she could only finish second. She led
until fifty yards of the wire, but could not ge
away from Elsie Barnes, who got up in the fal
we and won by a jength. Bannockburn
scared all but Alsike and Einus out of the fourth
race and he was a red-hot:favorite. The trio
raced heads apart to the stretch. Then Ban-
nookburn drew out and won his fourth con-
secutive race easily Py five lengths. Bam
Hildreth won Trillo out in the last race, whic
was hia firet appearance in his new owner's
colors. Trillo opened at 7 to 10 and went to
8 to 6. Just before post time there was a big
plunge on him and Trillo's price fell to 4 to 5.

le led all the way and won easily by two lengths
from Sparrow Wing. Summary:

Racing Gossip From Saratoga.

Samatooa, Aug. 17.-The leading business
men and hotel keepers of this place want clear
dates of thirty days for the Saratoga meeting
next year and have made up a petition, It is
said that the petition will be taken to Albany
and also placed before the Jockey Club.

Another rumor in town fs that the villagers
want Walbaum to run in opposition to Sheeps-
head Bay. He will run next Saturday simply
because it will end the week, but he refuses to
run the extra five days which the Jockey Club
has allotted him. It is a certainty that the bulk
of the crowd will leave here to-night before
the meeting ends in order to be present
when the Sheepshead Bay meetir opens,
Andrew Miller, F. R. ditchcock and Jack Fol-
lunsbee, members of the Jockey Club, ure now
in town and it is said that ther ure acting for
August Belmont, President of the Jockey Club.
Their presence {s reully due to a desire to seo
how the racing is going on here. Those who
remember thelr visit last seuson and the re-
sults which cuused Jockeys er and Willie
Martin to be set down for an indefinite period
are now looking for more action,

Jack Joyner, trainer of Ethelbert, gave it
out to-day that the horse has nok been Injur
beyond a slight bruise which will heal up in a

few days. Joyner, who hes gare of Jockey
Danny Maher, is also authority for the story
that Maher may not be seen on the metropolitan
tracks again this season. He is under contract
to Pierre Lorillard, whose horses @0 to Engand
in September, and Maher wil with them.
Maher has only been in the dle once since
his fall from Harry Reed at Brighton Beach.

BRADY MAKES A SUGGESTION.

or Sharkey Post a Forfeit and
Jeffries Will Cover It,

There is a possibility that Champion Jim
Jeffries may yet entertain a challenge from
Rob Fitzsimmons, provided the Cornishman
agrees to go about it in the properjway. Billy
Brady says that it is customary for pugilists
when issuing a defi to post a certain amount
of money. This he declares Fitz has not done
as yet.

“Let Fitzsimmons put up a reasonable re-
tainer,” said Brady yesterday, “and we will
show how anxious we are to fight. The idea
of Fitzsimmons demanding the championship
{a all bosh. Jeffries gave him every chance
in the world to meet him, but he declined until
the last moment. The public will not take
him seriously until he beats Jeffries. The
boilermaker is the champion by right of con-
quest, and he won it by hard, consctentious
work. Suppose Jeffries should agree to meet
Fitzsimmons on Aug. 81, if Bob is fortunate
in whipping Sharkey. What compensation
would he receive, after training zealously, if
Fitz made up his mind after Aug. 24 to give

Jeff the coid shoulder? Fitz would have noth-
ing to lose, because he has no money up, while
the champion will be out both time and cash.
Then very few persons take into consideration
that Aug. 81 falla on 4 Saturday and is the day
following the Corbett-McCoy mill. The at-
tendance would naturally not be 80 good as
it would if the affair took place at a later date.
So you see Jeffries would be ata disadvantage,

*But to convince the public that Jeffries is
eager to fight I will suggest that Fitzsimmons,
or even Sharkey post $5,000 in good Uncle
Sam's collateral at once, with the understand-
{ng that this money should revert to Jeffries in
ease Fitz or Sharkey are unable to fight on
Ang. 31. While this amount would not be
enough to pay Jeffries for his trouble it would
be satisfaction, and would prove conclusively
who does and who does not want to fight.”

The Date of the Fitz-Sharkey Battle Mas
Been Changed.

selected, falla on a Saturday. The Futurity
will be run at Sheepshead Bay on that day and
the managementin its desire to cater to the
satrons of the turf decided upon the change.
Both pugilists are seemingly satisfied with the
ahiftas it willgive them extra tine in which to
get into condition

HARNESS HORSES IN TRIM.

ANDY WELCH ENTHUSIASTIC OVER
THE RESULTS OF THE CAMPAIGN,

 

Says the 2:08 Trot at Cleveland, Which Cres-
cous Won, Was the Greatest Hace of All
Big Year for Stallions—Barney Demarest
Getting Ready for a New Start~Gossip,

“Attendance and interest in trotting this year
{is greater than ever before,” said Andy Welch,
the well-known bookmaker, yesterday morn-
ing. He had just arrived from Glens Falls
and Saratoga, where he has been looking over
both the trotters and runners,

“It has been the beast racing and best betting
season I ever saw,” Welch continued, and
that epeaks volumes for the general prosperity
of the country, It would be pretty hard for
me to designate the beat race I have seen this
year, At all the meetings I have attended
there has been good racing, Pinned right down
to one particular event, however, I should
say that the 2:08 trot at Cleveland was about
the warmest battle I have seen, It was the
first start of the year for Cresceus. In it were
John Nolan, 2:08; Charley Herr, 2:10; Grattan
Boy, 2:08, and Kingmond, 2:09. John Nolan
had been reported as going 80 good that a
big crowd of the speculators thought he had
no chance to lose and in the auctions the morn-
ing before the race, he sold for $200 to $60 for
Cresceus, $10 for Charley Herr and $15 for
Grattan Boy, Tommy Britton and Kingmond tn
the field, Just before the race was called Nolan
sold for even money against the fleid.

“Tt was in the firet heat that Nolan gave one
of the finest exhibitions of trotting that it has
ever been my good fortune to see. When they
got the word, Britton and Grattan Boy went
away infront, while Cresceus was in third place
and Nolap last. The latter went to a break
after passing the half and Foote had to pull
him to a standstill before he would hit @ trot
again. That left him more than a distance out,
but he fairly flew afterward, his flight of speed
from the three-quarter pole to the distance
flag being wonderful. It was good betting
when he struck his gait that it would be im-
possible for him to save being distanced, but he
got inside the flag all right. It was certainly a
grand performance, and to my mind one of the
big features of the race. Cresceus, in the mean-
time, went after the leaders. Tommy Britton
at the three-quarter pole could no longer stand
the pace put up by Grattan Boy and dropped
back. Then the great battle between Grattan
and Cresceus began. The drivers flourisned
their whips freely and the race belonged to
either until they were nearly to the wire, when
Cresceus showed his head and shoulders in
front.

“In the second heat there was one of the finest
exhibitions of speed 1 have ever witnessed.
Ketchem took Cresceus in haud at the start
and, with Britton lapped on him, went to the
quarter in 804% seconds. Nearing the half
Cresceus drew away from Britton aod was three
lengths in front of him at the three-quarters,
Nolan was at least five lengths behind Cresceus
when Foote began to drive and {t was a horse
race, sure enotgh, He cut down the stallions
lead to a length, but Cresceus kept up his clip
and finished the last quarter in 82 seconds, while
Foote pulled up inside the distance.

‘Cresceus’s great three heats at Columbus
was, of course, a more remarkable performance;
but as a contest | liked the Cleveland race. So
far this seems to be the year for stallions. 1
don't believe there ever was such corking good
ones. When was there ever_a quartet that
could beat Crescens, Grattan, Boy Dare Devil
and Charley Herr? And look at Arion, 2.07%.
They say he is equal to showing good tn fast
company this year. Every one o them {is so
fast that the least mistake on the part of either
would lose the race

“Because of the horses going so fast the noml-
nations for the $10,000 Charter Oak Stake, which
close next Monday, are being watched with the |
keenest interest. More curlosity ts manifested,
and more inquiries are made asking what horses
are likely to enter than ever before in the history
of that stake. This is because it is an open
thing. No horse you can name that Is eligible
to start {n the event has anywhere near a cluch
on winning it, Last year it was different. F Maid ©
body thought lord Vincent would win n
the minds of most of the posted horsemen
there was nothingthat could beat him. It
is very different this year, 1 can tell you. 1
believe tt will be one of the greatest guessing
races of the year.”

James A. Murphy, former owner of Star
Pointer, 1:59%, has been spending several days
at Saratoga. He Is drivinz a natty team made
up of the brown gelding Fred B., 2.10%, by
Reveille Gyp, by Black Squirrel, He took
his record in a race at Indianapolis in Septem-
ber, 1897, and was a falrly good race horse
He is looking great, goes without checks and
travels fast. The other side of the team is the
fast Chicago snow horse, Mohican, 2.18%, also
a brown gelding and a good match for Fred
B. He ts said to be by Henry Clay. In June,

896, he trotted to his record ina race at Omaha, |

Mr. Murphy looks upon him as one of the best
road horses in the country and believes he is
able to beat anything on the snow. The pair
and two pacers that are Chicago champions,
will be shipped to Dave MeClary at the Charter
Oak Park track next week, and the man who
trained and drove Star Pointer to the world's
fastest record will get them into shape for the
fall driving, when Mr Murphy wil’ bring them
to New York and join the brushing bi.gade on
the Speedway

When MecClary priced the young pacer, Maury
Tolnter, a full brother to Star Pointer, 1:50',, to
N. W. Hubinger for $10,000 the other day at
Charter Oak Park track, Mr. Hubinger natur-
ally wanted the price shaded somewhat. Mo
Clary said he would not take $9,909 for him.

“Hut I'll tell you what I will do,” he
further said. “If [don’t show you_a mile right
now on this track {n 2,06 or better, I will let you
have him at your price, if you will give me
$1,000 more than my price in case I do it.”

Mr. Hubinger figured on the chances for a
moment and then concluded to take the horse
at $10,000 Another notable purchase was
made by Mr. Hubinger this week in the green
trotter Willard, by Dexter Prince, out of Wild-
may, by Electioneer; second dam, May, by
Wildidle. _ He was foaled at the Palo Alto farm
in 1806. Willard was in the California con-
signment to the Madison Square Garden sale
last November and was bought by M. B. Smith
of Hartford for $270. He was placed in the
hands of MeClary at Charter Oak track, who
worke him about six weeks and said he was
one of (oe fastest green trotters in the world.
He recently showed a mile in 2:19, the last quar-
ter in 813, seconde, and is sald to be going faster
now. The moment Mr. Smith priced the colt
to Mr. Hubinger for $2,500, the latter said: “I'll
take him,” and that settled it. He would have
been willing to double the sum, but Mr. Smith
did not learn that until it was too late.

The ban which was placed on the well-known
trainer Barney Demarest, at Readville last
August, will be off next week. Barney has
been quietly getting a string of good ones to-
gether at the Morristown, N. J., track, to be
ready for the time when he would again ‘be free
to mount a sulky. His first appearance will
be at the Syracuse meeting next week. He
will take his horses from there to Hartford,
and will have them at the Empire City track
meeting, the following week. In ae string
are Ivandorf, 216%; De Witt C. Flanagan's
roadster Martha, the green mare that won a
race at the last road riders’ matinee; Kitty

udson, Carldon, 2:10%; Linsign, 2:15: Little
Sdgar, 2°10, and two green pacers.

MoLaughlin Matd Wins at Newburgh.

NEWBURGH, Aug. 17.—This was the lastday of
the midsummer meeting of the Newburgh Drivin
Park Association. The fun opened with the 2:1
trot and when one heat had been decided 4 terrible
wind and rain storm came up. It flooded the track,
but all records were beaten In getting itready again,
and before the racing ended at 7 o'clock to-night the
track was in good condition, In the 2:18 trotthe

that was made favorite, He took the first heat The
Fishkill borse, Times Herald, amid wild excitement

   

won the second heat from L. L, and then
the mare McLaughlin Mald from New York
broke in and captured the third. In spite
of this L's friends stuck to him.

They were more loyal than ever when he took the
fourth heat, in which he landed second to the Fishkill
horse, but was placed first because of Times Herald
running. The latter was placed thir e race
now was plainly for blood. The partisans of the
jorses were very demonstrative and when McLaugb-
fe Maid performed the unexpected In the fifth heat
by coming up the stretch with a great Durst of speed
and thrusting her nose abead of the favorite pande-

LAST HEATS AT GLENS FALLS,

Johnny Agan Picked to Win Fast Pace, but Is
Beaten by Harry O.

Gurns Fata, Aug. 17.—The Grand Cireult
races closed to-day after the moet successful
meeting, considered from the point of the
spectator, ever held on the track. Of the
twelve events scheduled only one was decided
in straight heats, and only two out-and-out
favorites were winners, The track was fairly
good to-day, although a little slow, the result
of Wednesday night's rain. In the opening
event, the unfinished 2:14 trot, Nell Gwynne
was not headed in the decisive heat and shie
got a new record,

In the 2:19 pace Annie Thornton was a 3 to |
favorite. The first heat she lost in front of the
wire to Tom Calhoun, both finishing under the
whip. Then she went on and took the next
three, not being headed. Joe Watts and Mr.
Middlemay were the choice of the 2:28 trotters,
with the odds slightly in favor of the latter,
notwithstanding Watta became the favorite
after the first heat had been taken by Middle-
may, on account of the epeed shown by him
in coming up to second place from a bad break
made on the last turn. The next three heats
ustified this confidence of his backers in him,
n the third heat Middlemay led to the grand
stand, where Watts responded to the oall and
shot ahead like an arrowr

Winola was the choloe among the 2:14 pacers,
Belling at $100, Sidney Pointer $40, and Oscar
L. 810, the feld a sinall price. Some of the best
pectn of the ingotng was seen here, The
avorite wou the first two heats. In the third
Pointer led off, with Oscar L. tight to his wheel,
They maintained this relative position to the

tretch, when both spread themselves for @

rive to the finish, where Oscar won by an
eyelash, The last quarter was cov in
80%, seconds, Oscar getting a record of 2:08%.
The other heats were then taken th Oscar,

 

with a hot brush with Pointer and then with
Win la, ho had laid up and then «
or first mone

he talent picked Johnny A as pe beat
of the 2:10 pacers, with Is d Wilkes, r, asa
ood second, Agan set the pace for the first
reat, but Island Wilkes beat out, Miller
giving a TR EPane finish, Pio gat bac
ouched Wilkes twioe with the rod and sho
under the wire a winner. In the second heat

Wilkes broke and Agan won without a fight.
Agan quit in the third at the stretch Harty
©, drove Wilkes to a break in front

oft ,
Lottie Smart led in the third heat to ti atretch
and then gave up to Harry O. fhe fourth heat
was a pretty contest, with Wilkes making the
fight of his life. Harry O., however, was not
headed, Summaries:

Aug. 17.-It took only two more
beats to wind up the unfinished 2:10 pace at the Val-
ley track this afternoon. In ths opening betting yes-
terday Daisy Fider was a hot favorite and ruled the
some inthe pools today. Afier the third heat the
judges were not satfefed with the way Heidrick
drove the mare, and Billy Myerg was substituted.
He was unabl» to stem the tide, and many hundreds
of dollars were burnt upon her, The sace had 4 sus

great race between the old rivals, A. A. Kent
of the Pastime A. C. and P. J. Walsh of the
New York A.C., who were the back markers
on the @-foot mark. The pair ran locked all

the way and the judges could not te
them at the finish. Kent wishes bee
up for the prize, but W oh ee at
he dead heat be run off accord to ;
In apite of his lack of confidence, Ken’ the
better stamina and won the decider by @ yard
and a half in eight seconds.

M. Crewan, the athletic Hoeman, looked
like pulling off the final heat of the arter-
mile handicap, but he weakened in the last
stride and Arnold of the Union Setélement
A. C. won by a few inches. Summary:
