THE DELAGOA BAY AWARD,
This Government Haas Decided to Accept
the Judgment of the Swiss Tribunal.

Wasninaton, April 11.-The Government
has decided to accept the award of the Swiss
arbitration tribunal in the Delagoa Bay
railroad claim, in which Mrs, Frederick
CC. Penfleld, an  Ameriean citizen, who
js the widow of Col. MeMurdo_ of
Kentucky, one of the builders of the
roai, was heavily interested. A copy of the
tribunal's decision was received by mail at the
Stato Department to-day, and information has
reached here also that Portugal will pay the
award. The actual cost of censtructing the
road was estimated at $4,000,000, Portugal
was willing to pay this for contiseating the
property, but the tribunal fixed the amount of
indemnity at only $3,000,000, with interest at
the rate of 5 percent. from the time of confleca-
tion

Owing to the smallness of the award which
this Governmentand the Government of Great
Britain, the third party to the arbitration, be-
Heved to be unjust to the claimants, there was
some consideration given by the United States
to the
bunal’a decision It has been
however, that such a course would be a severe
blow to the principle of international

ANTI-FXPANSION SPEECH,

He Will Deliver It in the Senate on Tues-
day Next on the Spooner Resolution.

HOAR’S

WasuinGtTon, April 11.—Senator Hoar will
deliver his Philippine speech in the Senate
next Tuesday, the subject of it being the
Spooner resolution reported from the Philip-
pines Commiitee by Mr. Hoar’s collengue,
Senator Lodge, giving the entire control of the
islands afterthe !nsurrection has ended and
until Congress shal! provide a_ perfect
form of government, to the President of the

United States, Mr. Hoar’s attitude on tha ex.
pansion question has not changed, and his
speech will be an argument of great length in
support of his contention that the United
States has noright to interfere with self gov-
ernment by the Filipinos. Tne Massachusetts
Senator at first thought of reciting his entire
speech as written, a feat that would require
the time of three or four ordinary sessions of
the Senate for its accomplishment
decided now, however, to so curtail his speech
in its delivery astocomplete it in one after-
noon. He will do this by skipping portions of
ofthe speech and brnging it all together in
the record

Some oft Mr. Hoar'’spolleaguesa have endeav-
ored to make him se@ the wisdom of not de-
livering any speech af all, on the ground that
as his attitude is well known ft is unnecessary
forhim to say anything, and that for him to
antagonize the Spooner resolution which has
the almost unanimous party support, will
merely injure him politicaliy. The Senator,
however, thinks it bis duty to fully explain his
views on this most {mportant question, aud he
will do so,

THE

NEW BATTLESHIPS,

They Will Have the Heaviest Batteries of

Any Ships in the Navy.

Wasurnaron, April 11.—The Naval Board on
Construction will this week complete the
detailed plans for the three battleships
authorized by the Naval bill for the cur-
rent year, and the Navy Department will
then send descriptive circulars to the big phin-
builders to enable them to prepare bids, The
geveral fcatures of these ships have been ex-
plainedin Toe Sun. A new idea adopted by
the board is to have the vessels armored com-
pletely instead of only partly. Krupp armor
is provided for, The main armor belt. 8
feet wide, will taper from. inches over
the vitals of the vessel to 4 inches at the
how and stern, just half the maximum
thickness of the vessels of the [Indiana
class. The U-inech band sides will be pro-
tected by 6-ineh armor, Anothernew feature
will beasignal tower. The battery will be
heavier thanthat on any ship of the navy, with
12-inch guns tn two turrets, four S-inch in two
turrets, twelve U-inch guns, six on a side,
twelve 3-pounders, four wautomatic l-pounders,
four rapid fire 1-pounders, two fleld guns, two
Gattlings and six 30 millimetre automatic
guns

The speed requirement will be 19 knots, with
rejection as the penalty for 1 knot lesa speed
development, thus making the vessels the
fastest ships of their class inthe world, In
tonnage they will eqnal the biggest battle-
ships, the board having decided oh between

WHITTIER IS VINDICATED.

DEPEW GETS CONFIRMATION OF THE
STORY OF BARBARA FRIETCHUIY,

a Delegation From Freder-
ick, Wd., Who, After Telling Him the
Poem Was as True as Gospel, Were An-
tounded When He Said That Barbara
Was One of the Idols of His Childhood,

Wasiitncrosx, April 21,-A large delegation
from Frederick, Md, appeare! before the
Committee on Claims of the House and
Senate to-day in behalf of the claim of the city
of Frederick for $200,000, The beautiful little
town of Frederick, “graen-walled by the hills
of Maryland,” occupied rather a conspicuous
and unfortunate position during the war, Part
of the town was rebel and part unfon,
and feeling ran hgh, One summer, it
was in Ist, Gen Jubal A.
thought to pay a visit to Washing-
ton, and as ‘an escort took along
Ile hoped to
Kivethe Pederal authorities a surprise party
and thought he might be fortunate enough to
take possession of the seat of government.
En route he called at Frederick, and as a sou-
venir of his visit he suggested to the citizens of
that place that they, being loyal sons of the
South, should contribute $200,000 toward the
support of the Southern Army, and particularly
that part of it under his immediate command,
As the citizens displayed some reluctance to
comply with his request, under threata Gen,
Karly pressed them, and the householders
therefore wentdown tntotbelrstrong boxes and
the housewives into their stockings and pros
duced the ready money, with which Gen. Early
marched away, The delay occastoned by this
financial! transaction gave Grant time to throw
into Washington a part of his army, and when
Gen. Farly reached the city, Instead of finding
itguarded only by a few department clerks
and convalescents, as he had been led to be-
lieve, he found a fair sized army looking down
from well-made breast works, prepared to give
him the warmest reception he could ask, He
therefore returned southward without calling
on Lincoln or on Congress, as he had hoped,
So to-day the delegation asked Congress to re-

fund the $200,000, whieh they contend not

only saved Frederick but the nation’s Capital,

It was toward the end of the hearing that
Senator Depew drifted into the comrmnittee
room and took his seat, All the members of
the delegation recognized him atonce and a
Whisper ran around the room, “There's
Renator Depew,”’ Mr. Depew bowed and

smiledatthe recognition of his entrance. A
few moments later the hearing clased and Mr.
Depew blandly remarked:

‘There ts one question which [ would like
toask-one which I have Jong desired to have
unswered, and which, I think, is of great
historical interest, You gentlemen should be
able to answer it botterthan any one else,
refer to the story of Barbara Frietchie.”

Immediately half a dozen of the delegation
sprang forward, Onthe poem of Whittler rests
Frederick's claim to fame, ant vo loyal citizen
of that burg would think fora moment of des
nying the truth of the story, So every one of
these who volunteered to spenk was prepared
to swear by all that was good und holy that the
poem was as true as the Gospel, The testimony
was cumulative, First Col. Goldsborough, a
veteran of the war and an old resi-
dent of Froderick, stepped forward
and announeed that he had — known
techie well, thus establishing the
fact of her existence and her identity, Senator
MeComas of Maryland supplemented this ine
formation by the announcement that he had
seen the flag itself. Atthisa murmur of in-
terest and approbation ran around the room,
An elderly man, J.C. Hart, said that he had
known Barbara personally very well. He knew
the house and had often seen the flag in the
house,

The testimony was getting stronger and
stronger, Mr. Hart, however, nearly ruined
the case when he said he was under the ime
pression that not Barbara, but another woman
who lived afew doors awoy, waved the flag.
At this the loyal members of the delegation
gave Vent to strong expressions of disapproval,
and Mr. Hart retired in confusion, Col, Golds-
borough then said that he was certain Mrs
Frietchie,whowas intenselypatriotic, had waved
the ag asthe Confederates retired from the
city As the Confederates under Jackson
slowly retired at_one end of the street, the
Federals under Burnside entered at the other
end of thelstreet, Mrs. Prietehie flung the flag
to the breeze as the Confederates withdrew
and the Federals cheered it as they entered
the town. An oMicer on Burnside’s staff wit-
nesse:| the episode and wrote to Whittier about
it, and the poet obtained from the Postmaster
of Frederick the information on which he
based the story

senator Depew followed the testimony care-
fully, nodding his head approvingly as each
witness gave corroborative evidence. “Bare
bara Frietchie,” he said, “was one of the jdola
of my childhood \s plaved aronnd my
mother’s Knees, and later when I culled
wisdom from the school primer, my heart
throbhed in sympathy with the old gray.
haired woman who so valiantly displayed her
patriotism and defled the enemies of her
country.’

The delegation looked aghast at this, but
finally reached the conclusion that the
Senator had his dates mixed and
thought the incident nappenert during
the War of 1812. Douglass Hargett, clerk of
the County Court, offered the statement that
his father had witnessed the episode; had often
told him of seeing the old woman, her seanty
gray locks floating in the wind, supporting the
flag while the Confederate troops marched be-
low. The climax came, however, when John
H. Abbott announced that his wife had stood
with Barbara Frietehia while she waved the lag
and that he had the flag at home, framed and
hanging onthe wall, and invited Senator De-
pew tocome and see it

“That's right,’ said Senator MeComas, “IT
have seen the flag there myself many times.”

There was nothing more to be said. Whittier
had been vindicated. Barbara Frietchie had been
honored, Senator Depew was delighted at his
suecess In eliciting this valuable information,
and with bis face wreathed in smiles announced
that he for one thoughtit was worth $200,000
to have this question definitely settled, and
that it was probably because of the flag incident
and the poem which tollowed that Early made
the city pay the ransom.

UNDER WHOSE FLAG NOW?

Spaniards in Cubn and Puerto Rico Had
Until April 11 to Declare Allegiance.

Wasninoron, April 11.—The year given to
Spanish subjects tn Cuba and Puerto Rieo
by the Paris treaty of peace within
which to declare thelr political allegiance
expired to-day. At the date of the last
report from Cuba in regard to the namber of
Spanish snijects inthe island who had made
affidavit that they would continue their
allegiance to the Spanish Crown, about 11,000
names had been so registered, The requirement
as to the registration of political afiifation
concerned only persons born in the
Spanish peninsula, There are about 150,000
such in Cuba, and it is apparent there-
fore thatan overwhe!ming majority have de-
termined to casttheir lot with the future gov.
ernment of the island, whether American or
native, unless the registrations have increased
heavily in the past month, That partofthe
treaty governing this matter provides forthe
protection of Spanish subjects born In the
peninsula in the territory ceded to the United
States by Spain. In regard to the determina-
tion of the nationality of these subjects, the
treaty saya:

“In case they remain in the territory, they
may preserve their allegianeeto the Crown of
Spain by making, before a court of reeord,

t year from the date of the ex-
ratifleations of this treaty, a

! aration of their Uectsion to preserve
such atlegianea, — in fefault of whieh
declaration they shall be held to have re-
nounced it, and to have adopted the nationality
of the territory in which they may reside,
The civil rights and politieal status of the
native inhabitants of the territories hereby

tte the United States shall be determined
the Congress.”

Ali spanish subjects in Puerto Rico who
failed to make declarations within the year
ending to-day become by that failure, and

THE PACIFIC CABLE BILL

APPROPRIATING $3,000,000
PASSED IN THE SENATE,

BILL

It Provides for the Laying of a Cable,
Under the Supervision of the Navy De-
partment, From San Francisco to Hono-
lnlu—A Tilt Between Tillman and Pettus.

Wastinetos, April 11.-The bill appro-
Printing #&3,000,000 for the construction,
inalntenance and operating of @ Pacifle cable
under the Navy Department was taken up in
the Senate to-day, Tho report of the Com-
mittee on Naval Affairs explains the bill, It
says

“It provides for the laying of a sub-marine
cable from San Francisco to Honolulu, the
work to be done under the supervision of the
Navy Department, which has made the survey,
und determined the practicability of the routes,
In this work the bill provides that the Navy De-
partment may use any of its ships that can be
adapted to the task of laying the cable, and tf it
needa other ships that it may charter them
wheraverthey may be found. In addition to this
it is provided that the Seeretary of the Navy,
in his diseretion, if he flnds it is not practicable
to lay tho cable by the force of his own Depart-
ment, may contract, under specifications and
due advertisement, for the coustruction, lay-
ing and equipment of the cable provid dforin
thia bili, All wires, cables, insulators, bat-
terfes, instruments, and other materials and
appurtenances should be of first-class quality.

“section } provides that the cable, wires and
other instruments materials, appliances and
appurtenances necessary in the work of laying
said cable shall be of American manuiacture,
provided that the same be procured at a cost
not exceeding 12 per cent. above the price the
same can be procured in forelgn markets.”

In reply to questions, Mr. Hale, chairman of
the Committes on Naval Affairs, said that the
estimate of thres millions was merely for the
cable to Honolulu; that afterward the question
of further extension could be decided, and that
the route might be from Seattle or San Fran-
cisco, north by the Alaskan Islands and Japan,

Mr. Pettus (Dem., Ala.) moved to strike out
fection 5, which provides that the cables, wires
and other {ustruments shail be of American
manufacture, provided they ear be procured at
acost not exceeding L2 per cent, of what they
can be procured for in foreign markets. He
asked why the Government was to be taxed
for the { manufacturers, and he de-

henetle of
clared the proposition to bean absurdity.

Mr. Tillman (Dem. 8. C.) said that a8 4 mem.
ber of the Committee on Naval Affairs he had
consented to the section, and he suggested that
fs it might prove to bean advantage to the iron
industry of Alabama, it should be accepted as

straggling at all. Alabama ia master of the
gituation, both as toiron and coal. Senators
know that this thing is wrong. Rhode Island
isatthe present moment the head centre of
the protective policy. If the Senator from
Rhode Island (Mr. Aldrich, could have his
way, if he could control the whole subject,

Mr, Pettus’s amendment was rejected yeas,

MURDERED MAN IN A WELL,

Headless Rody of a Farmhand Found—Last
Seen Engaged in a Quarrel.

Grawsy, Maes., April 11.—The headless body
of Kasinius Kamnisky, a Polish farmhand,
familiarly known as “Jack” was found in an
unused well on the farm of Monroe Keith in
this town late last night, and another Polander,
Francisco Umilian, who was a fellow worker
with “Jack,” was arrested for the murder, He
was arraigned in the District Court at North-
ampton to-day and was committed for trial

The wife of Umilian was first arrested as an
accomplice but was released. In the well also
were found the murdered man's clothes, The
body was partly placed in a sack,

The dead man disappeared on Dee, 31 and
was last seen while harnessing Mr. Keith's
horse, At that time hia employer charged him
with stealing two pounds of butter. “Jack”
denied the charge, hut Cmilian declared to
Mr, Keith that “Jack” was the thief. When the
farmer and wife drove away the men were
quarrelling flercely. That was the last seen of

Jack” uotil the body was found, It was first
thought not strange that “Jack” should disap-
pear, as he sometimes went away on a apres

ments, and some say that jealousy over the
Prisoner's wife was the cause of the murder.

milian stoutly denies the charge and so does
his wife. Both men were about 34 years old,
