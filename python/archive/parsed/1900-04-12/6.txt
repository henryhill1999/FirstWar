EW THEATRICAL THINGS,

eMULIUOUS MELODRAMA AND A

19 Femiuine Antagonista Fight With

Mabe! Paton, classable as heavyweights,
and they fought to aio finish with

failing to make her belligerent with ordinary

fully unla lylike in her ear, that she became

fighting 1 ad. The stake wasa lover, whom each
had held aud Jost in turn, and the referea wis
g malignant misshapen who gleofully counted

“One, two, three” for them to begin, At the |

Auguste Van Biene has just had two things

BLANCHE WALSH LEFT THE HOTEL,

 

Quarrelled With Melbourne MacDowell in
Omaha—They Are Playing “Cleopatra.”
Omana, April 11,.—The Melbourne Mac-

Dowell-Blanche Walsh company is playing

“Cleopatra” here at the Boyd Theatre. The

performance on Tuesday night did not go as

smoothly as usual, and the audience departed

| wondering,

A partial explanation has leaked out. Both
of the stars were stopping at the Millard on
Monday night, andon their return from the

| theatre they had a quarrel. Mies Walsh refused

writhod together until Miss Eaton was cut in |

the fovearim, whereupon she stepped back
wih naughty exclamations of anger, and Miss
Eaton luughed devilishly, They respondea
with alacrity to the call for the second round, in

which Miss Otis soon lost her wits, left her body
pnguarded and was stabbed to death, That
wasanepisodein “Woman and Wine,” anewly

{mported melodrama, which was performed
Jast night in a Broudway theatre, and not nt
the Star, but at the further up Manhattan, The
two oetresses Were impersonating Parisian

outeasts, and it was away along in the
third wt that they came to the
bloodshed. The body of the dead one was

found by the police, and with it wasa profll-
gate young Faoglishman who had threatened
the life of the slain woman, and who, being
copfused by drugged absinthe, believed him-
‘Jfa murderer, It required a fourth act of
' and judicial proceedings to disprove the
eiroun stantial evidence and set the guiltless
prisoner free,

This play was just about tha hottest stuff
thot ever got before an upper Broadway audl-
ere, to amaze the parquet and delight the
gallery Its high temperature was of
the “Sapho"” nature to the extent that
degenerate women figured in it, but
most of its heat eame of the London
hindct melodramatic Intensity, The action be-
gan with the enticement of a young law stu-
éeot from bis rural hom. by a siren, and as he
was enacte! by the rather amall Howard

 

 

 

,

Kye and she by the rather big Miss
© is, the physical aspects of the captiva-
thn made the audience laugh. It was not

lovg, however, before the general excellence of
the vet ng, the amplitude of good scenery and
th: rcugh strength of the play commanded re-
tpest downstairs and enthusiasm upstairs,
There was derisive laughter often, itistrue, but

that was by the cynics, and they wero
ournmunbered by those who liked
the piece out and out. The evening
was not half through __ before the

applause got along first rate without the aid of
the ushers, and the chief exponent of villainy,
none other than the fair Miss Otis, was hissed
roundly in the true Bowery manner, Tried
elements of success with the populace were in

  

the piece abundantly. The wayward. hero
had George Osbourne for a blind father
and Minnie Dupree for a gentle

eweetheart, to say nothing of a comic pair to
turn brave at the aes eeteree. There were
money lenders and money stealera to make
trouble for the good folks, a jockey. to be
bribed to lage a crucial horserace, and other
things familiarly sure to make @ play sueceed
in «a suitable theatre, Will they at the
Manhattan? Perbaps so. The management
+e med to have faith inthem, asthe company
ealled for fair salaries, and the mounting was
lavish. Ascene on aracetrack with a four-in-
hand coach, another in a dance house with
gorgeous revelry, and a third in a court of jus.
tice with a full assem biage, were crowded by
action that was for the most part well ordered
and effectual.

 

\ new play acted at the Murray Hill this
week Ja new, which {s an unusual thing at that
theatre, It is further interesting in that its
author, Ralph Stuart, is the leading man of the
stock company. “The Peacemaker” {s in only
one act. A husband and his wife have an im-
material disagreement, and a bachelor patches
ftupforthem. This worthy friend has read
thort stories and gone to the theatres fre-
quently, judging by the way he goes about his
amiable task, He gets the wedded pair to
agree toa divorcee, and leads the conversation
in such a way as continually to remind them
of how much they love each other, It is, of
course, a trite subject, reminiscent of
the Jast act of “Young Mrs, Winthrop”
an! a hundred other plays and books,
ut it (s always effective when well treated
humorousiy and sentimentally. In "The
Peacemaker” Mr, Stuart has not strayed from
the conventional method, but has stuck relig-
jously toit. He brings the pieee to a pretty
ending with a quiet and natural love scene,
Where the reconciled husband and wife sit by
thelr red flre, with the room otherwise dark,
nd thoughtless of all the reat of the world,
tr Stuart's little comedy has the advantage of
being excellently acted, He playa the bachelor,

dwin Nieander the husband and Georgia
Nelles the wife. Miss Welles has played so
many parts expertly, from the silly Ann
in The Girl T Left Behind Me,” to arch Celia
in"As You Like It,” that she mav be made the
éuceessor to the late Hannah May Ingham in
the still vacant place of leading woman in the

   

jonnelly company. Her performance in “The
Peucemuker’ isa good combination of aenti-
Mentand humor, The longer play of the billis
Turned Up," the extaavagant farce in which

Nat Goodwin acted thirteen years ago. It
shows its age, though some of its fun ts etill
oternt.

 

he revival of apopular double bill at the
American this week completesa cycle of Gile

“Trial by Jury,” make a more appropriate
couple than itis usually possible to arrange,
The same composer and the same librettist are
Tesponsible for both, and while the themes are
totally different, there is the same vein of
humorand melody, Thus the two operettas
form a homogeneous entertainment that could
be attained only when the music of both and
the text of both came from the same coilabora-

But Miss Walsh is in no wep to blame. It is

THE OPERA,

Nordica and Van Dyck Sang Last Night for
the Last Time This Season,

Mme. Nordica and M. Van Dyck were the
artists of the opera company who made their
last appearance during the present season at
the performance of "Tristan und Isolde” at the
Metropolitan last evening. M. Bertram sang
Kurwenal for the first time here and acquitted
himself creditably. He is likely to be heard
frequently in the role next season, He sang

well and displayed leas than usual of his in-
flexible manner,

M. Van Dyck's Tristan was again a source of
delight to those who find pleasure always in
the work of this extremely thoughtful and fn-
telligent artist. In view of the fact that ho is
pot likely to be a member of the company
another year, it is Simei to add a word of
praise for his incomparable achievements in
certain operas, Where will there ever be such
a Siegmund as he, or such a Tannhauaer?
Other singers may give greater beauty of tone
to their interpretations of these rdles, but cer-
tainly there will never be greater dramatic ex-
Pressiveness or eloquence imparted to them.

Mme. Nordica's Javlde needs po praise how,
and Mme, Schumann-Heink’s Brangaene is
gne of her best performances. M. Paur con-

ucted,

Shore Drive Entered While the Family
Was at Dinner-One of the Chief Pieces
Stolen, a $10,000 Diamond Necklace,

Curcago, April 11.—The robbers who en-
tered the residence of O, W, Potter, 130 Lake
Shore drive, on Monday night and car-
ried away diamonds and other jewelry
valued at $16,000 have not yet been
caught. Tho robbery was not reported
to tho police until late Jast night and a
score of officors have since been working on
several clues. Tho plunder which in value
exceeds any haul made by thieves in Chicago
for several years consists of diamon Js, rubies,
emeralds, opals, silverware and watches, Fol-

lowing is an itemized list of the stolen jewelry
as supplied by Mra. Potter:

One diamond necklace containing 145 stones, rang
{ng from 4%5 carats to,'¢ carat, value $10,000

One diamond ring, $1 000

One solid gold narrow ring, set with five diamonds,

1,500,
$ One ring set with Ave sapphires, $1,200.

One pearl cross, $500

One breastpin, set with pearls, $500.

One breastpin, set with pearls, $500,

One breastpin, set with moonstones, $400,

One miniature pin, §60.

Aside from this lot of jewela Mrs, Potter told
Capt. Haas that many other valuables had been
taken which would foot up at about $2,500),
making the total amount of booty $16,400,
Many of the stolen geins are heirlooms, and it
is believed that they were stolen by some one
who was acquainted with the house as well as
with the customs of the family.

Mr. Potter's family consists of hig wife and
daughter, Margaret Horton Potter, whois a
writerof some note. Her recent book, “The
Social Lion,” attracted some attention, Many
of the articles stolen belonged to her. The
Potter residence {sone of the most imposing
mansiona on the North Side, and stands at the
corner of Burton place and the Lake Shore
drive, The robbery is supposed to have taken
place at 6 o'clock, while the family were at
dinner, It was asecond-story affair.

Chief Kipley. of the Volige Department
charges that the labor troubles have made
such demands upon the department that he
cannot properly patrol the reatdence district.
Nevertheless, to-night be issued an order to

vatrolmen that is liberally laden with sarcasm,
{fe calls attention to the Potter robbery, allud-
ing to it as the biggest robbery of the kind in
the history of the city, and concludes by saying
that a Police Department, comprised of 400
detectives and 2.500 patrolmen, should be
ample to cope with the half dozen
climbers known to be in the city,

SEARCH FOR A FATHER—NEW VERSION

porch

Foundling Arrested for Annoying the Sis-
ters at the Asylum,

Henry J. King is looking for his parents, and
the search landed him tn the Yorkville police
court yesterday, He was charged with ralsing
a disturbance at the New York Foundling
Asylum at Third avenue and Sixty-eighth
etreet and refusing to leave there when the
alster superioress ordered him todoso, King
{9 28 years old and lives at O04 Lexington ave-
nue. He wasafoundiing at the asylum, and
he called at the institution a number of times
recently and demanded that he be informed
who his parents were. The Mother Supert-
oress told him that she did not know, but he
insisted that she must. On Tuesday night
King waa arrested on complaint of Dr. John
Howland of the asyluw, Dr. Howland made a
charge of disorderly conduct against him in
court. .

“Itis ungrateful for you to annoy the sisters
who nurtured you,” said the Magistrate

“Tonly want them to tell me the name of my
parenta,” replied the prisoner, “I know they
ean, for have received a good education
through them and they have given me money
They said it was from the charity fund, but I
think it came from my parents,” ;

Magistrate Mayo suggested that If King did
find his parents the discovery might cause
him unhappiness and bring sorrow and em-
barrassment to them. ben Nh

“That does not alter my determination to
learn who they are,” answered the man, When
he was 5 years old, he said, the asylum
authorities sent_him to a family living at
Newtown, Md. He remained with his foster-
parents until he was 20 years old, when he
came to this city. He had been earning his
living here aince. He was now an clevator
attendant aniinthe last two years the aisters
of the asylum had given him sums of money
amounting to $500 to help him along,

Dr. Howland said there was no record at tho
asylum showing who King’s parents were.
The sisters had given smal! sums of money to
him for charity's sake when he was out of

work, z
Tho prisoner promised not to annoy the
people at the asvium again and was dis-

charged. He returne] to court later in the day
to aak the Magistrate's advice as to how he
could flod bis parents, He had been to ask
Archbishop Corrigan’s assistance, he said, but
the Archbishop was busy and could not see
him. Magistrate Mayo said he could not give
any advice in the matter.

ZOPICS AROUT TOWN,

 

He strolled into the corridor of the Waldorf-
Astoria, At his heels trotted or rather slunk 4
fairly good-looking fox terrier, It was plain
that the dog knew he had no business there,
A uniformed attendant touched the man onthe
arm, “Bog pardon, sir,” said he, “you must
not bring that dog in here.”

“Dog, dog,” exclaimed the man; “dem th’
dog. Ltold him to stay out,” and he made as
iso kick the dog, which darted out of the
Diacve,

“That's my hardware dog,” said the man,

Hardware dog?” said a bystander. “Queer
hame: why do you call him that?”

Why? why, every time I kick at him he
Makes a bolt for the door,” and he burried on
and was lost in the crowd beforo the bystander
had a chance to hit him,

 

“Tho advertising business would be all
right,” said the head of one of the big adver-
tising companies, “if the people you did busi-
ness for would pay their bills in cash. You
thought they did, did you? Well, some of them
do, but a good many of them don't, and then
you get loaded up with truck that you have to
dispose of at the best flgures you can get. Can

you think of anything more discohraging
than getting down to your office in the
morning and meeting a man who wants
to pav his bill with 500 pounds of

his medicated candy that you've spent your
good money to advertise? No, I guess you
ean't. Well, inthe last year I've had to take
Merchandise enough to steck «a department
store. I've had tons and tons of stuff. L have
had threw tons of candy alone, I’ve had gro-
ceries, dry goods, novelties, clothea ani about
everyihing you can thinkof, We laugh when
we read inthe country papers that wood ant
coal and fresh vegetables and the Ike will be
taken in payment for subscriptions and adver-
tising, but right here in New York city that
sort of thing is going on, only onalar@er scale,
and it's no laughing matter, either, Wouldn’t
itjar you?”

 

“It's afunny thing,” sald a man who was
eating shad, “but you can’t get a good piece of
shad in any of the middle-class restaurants in
this town, Teat shad every day about from the
time the fish first appear tn the North River
until they disappear again, I've tried every
restaurant worth trying, and you can get shad
good only in the cheap restaurants and in the
very expensive ones, In the restaurants in
between these grades you might just as well
eat hay as theahad they putup, I don’t know
why it is so, but it is. The shad is a big
‘lah and I don't) know” but that one
reason they are never served right in the mid-
die-ciass restauranta is that they cook three or
four fish at a time, and not having trade
enough to dispose of them as soon as they are
cooked, they keep them warm until called for,
Inthe cheap restaurants where the trade ie
Digger the fish are disposed of as 8von as they
are cooked, and in the expensive restaurants
the fish is always cooked to order. But what-
ever ia the reason for it, its a tact that in the
midd.e-class restaurants you can't get good
shad, and to serve shad that is not good in the
mniddie of shad season ia a crime; a restaurant
keeper who does it deserves t¢ be shot.”

There's anew game in town and it’s played
for drinks, It is called Smiling Tommy, Bust-
neas was overin Wall Street yesterday when
Tue SuN reporter stopped in the office of one of
the big banking and broking concerns and there
was 4 crowd around one of the desks, “Leta
Pliny Smiling Tommy,” said one of the brokers,

“How? demanded the others,

“bvery man hold up his hand with as many
fingers extended as he cares to.”

liands wentup., Seventeen fingers were ex-
tended, The proposer began counting with
the first person to his right. He counted
around until he reached seventeen and then he
Bui “You're it.”

The seventeenth man set'emup, “It beats
dice,” said the proposer, “and vou cant do any
fixing beforehand and cheating is im possibie.”’

“How many eggs do you suppose New York
uses during the Faster season?” asked the man
who knew it all, “Well, Pll tell you, Last week
was the firat week of the Faster egg trade and
New York received and got away with 106,287
cases of eggs. They run thirty dozen toa case
making a total of 38,203,320 eggs. This week
isa record breakerand the average promises
to be 24,500 cases a day, That means for the
six days in the week 52,020,000 eggsor an
average of thirteen eggs to every man, womau
and ehildin New York. Think how many hens
New Yorkers are keeping busy, If there was
only one hen working for each of the 4,000,000
people in the New York market ahe would have
to work evefy day for two weeksto supply the
demand for this week alone,”

Hospital doctors were under discusston.
Every man inthe party had had hospita! ex-
perience at some time or another and each had
a good word for his particuiar doctor when the
discordant man caine in, “I tell you what it

blooded men among them. Iwas in one of the

“Hemight,’ assented all the party. “But the
man was going to die anyway,”

Vive men were discussing the Alaskan gold
fleldsin the Hoffman House corridor yester-
day and they all began talking learnedly about
Cape Nome, Four of them knew all about the
cape. Two of them had invested small
amounts tn mining schemes there, The fifth
sturtied them all by asking ‘Just where is
Cape Nome ?”

“Why, it's in Alaska” sa'd one.

“It's in Alaska,” echoed the others,

“Where in Alaska ?’ demanded the fifth,

"Welll’m dummel'” exelaimed one of the
mon with money invested,

“Thought so,” said the fifth man: “every.
hody is talking about Cape Nome and i dont
believe one Out of ten people know where it is,
They think it's inthe Klondike region, They
even put theirmeneyin it without looking itup.
Tye looked itup, On the west coast o! Alaska,
a little north of the contre, there is a peninsula
which ends with Cape Prince of Wales. That
cape is the nearest point to Bast Cape in
siveria. Cape Nome is on the southern part of
this peninsula, and is: between Golofnin Lay
and Cape Kodney. It's nowhere neer the
Klondike.”

Vandalism has risen to lofty heights in the
