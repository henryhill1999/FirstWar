tionus format Tuxedo and Boaton earlier in
the season, devotees of the sport anticipated a
wemorablecontest, It would be hardly fair to
suy they were disappointed, ae, although Miles
won {a straight sete, Stockton contested every
polot plucktly and soientifoally.

Miles wou the tose and his varied service at
once began to tellin hie favor, and he got away
with a love set, The Britisher covered the
court In # remarkable way, and it was e prac-
tical (upossibility for Stookton to score, The |
Boston man fared somewhat better in the
second set and it looked for a timeasifhe
wight pull through on the puzzilog “railroad”
service for which he ja noted. Miles, however,
was prepared for the emergenoy, and with un-
erring grille shots, and “boasted forces” from
the malo wall to the Dedans, he took the
second eet by 6 to 2. He had been forcing the
pace to each an extent up to thie stage that the
goore showed nine straight games to his credit,
and when they started in on the third set both
were fairly on thelr mettle, Stoekton's superb
physique enabled him to stand the pressure to
the end, bas he could not handle Miles’s ter-
yiflo sidewall forcing, and the Engiishman won
out by 6-0, 0—2, 0—2,

Mean while the racquet court was the scene

BASKETBALL,

Knickerbocker A, C. Defeats Seventeenth
Separate Company in a Bough Game,

The meeting of the Knickerbocker A. O, and
Beventeenth Separate Company of Flushing
teama {nm the second series of games for the
Metropolitan champlonaship drew a fairly good
crowd to the Twelfth Regiment Armory )ast
night. The championship ie thought to be be-
tween these oluba, as they both defeated their
antagontets on the opening night, but the
meeting of the old rivals, the now West Side
A. OC. and Pastime A. O., proved almost as in
teresting as the game between the more ex-
pert teams.

Rough play was the order of the night and
the aggressiveness of the players led to fre-
quent mishaps, one of which was so serious
that (t necessitated the injured man’s with-
dsuwal from the game,

The Eniokerbooker A, C. and Seventeenth
Keparate Company teams were the first to line
hp. The cherry diamond tossere were in fine
form, but their clever passing was blocked ef-
fectually by the stardy guardsmen, and it was
ten mitpetes before Brocker scored for the
Knickerbocker A. O. by @ neat goal from the
field, thrown at a difficult angle. A few min-
utes later, when Tooker of the Flushing team

was trying for a goal, he was rushed by
Brocker, who landed on the fallen man’s peck.

Pitcher Hughes Hesitates to Sign.

Sacramento, April 11.—It is by no means
certain that Piteher Hughes will play with
Brooklyn this year. Hughes led the League
twirlere last year and feels that he is worth as
mach asany other pitcher. He will not state
what hie figures are but admits that Brooklyn
has offered him the equivalent to $2,600—the
$2,400 iimit of salary allowed by League rules
and $200 forear fare. Tbe hitch {s over the
clause which practically signs @ man forfour

ears. Hughes insista that this be eliminated,

iis indepeudence {s due in a large measure to

the fact that the Sacramento team Is masiog a
stroug effort to retain his services and to the
additional feat that he ie contemplating going
{nto the saloon business here.

Yale Loses Her Best Baseball Pitcher.

New Havew, April 11.—Yale University un-
dergraduates to-night are very indignant over
the fact that C. P. Cook, who was regarded aa
the estar pitcher of the ‘varsity nine, was
not permitted to go on the Easter trip with
the team which started South to-day. It

was stated that Cook is a little back in his
tudies and the faculty would not permit him
o go aong with the nine. This practically
shuts out Cook from pitching for the remainder
of the season, and the Yale boys who had been
expecting much from hie work in the big
games are grievously disappointed over the
situation. Cook ran into a similar expertence
last fall when he tried to. make the ‘varsity
football team, the faculty then Interfering be-
cause he was behind in his scholarship stand-

adjourned without doing anything in the matter
Routine business and private matters were at

turned over to the Fxecutive Committees, as were
other matters of detail, Racing men who called to
make negotiations were referred to Vice l’resident
George Pope, but no one succeeded in obtaining
an Interview with bin. Cooper and Kiser are the
chiefs among the racing men who have been
hanging upon the d cision that was expected
yestorday., In fact, it depended upon what kind
of arrangements they could make whether they
went abroad or remained here during the racing
Season. It is now taken for granted that there
will not be any general employment of racing
teams, but the fate of Cooper and Kiser as American
representatives at Paris is still unsettled, there
being some expectation of an exception in their
favor being made by the A. B.C

The annual election of the Hrooklyu Bicycle
Club was held on ‘Tuesday night and it resulted
in an emphatic triumph forthe independent ticket,
the members of which represented the eyeling
element as against the social element represented
by the regular ticket. It was understood that if
the regular ticket was elected that the word “bicy-
cycle” would be eliminated from the title of the
club, The election was the most spirited and
nolsy one ever conducted by the staid old club.
After 1t was over thers was a celebration by the

victors that suggested a housewarming. The

Brady Answers McCoy,

The fact that Kid MeCoy has come out witha
desire to moet the winner of the Corbett-Jeffries
combat has spurred Biily Brady to action, and
yesterday the latter posted $2,000 with Al
Smith to bind matters, Brady looks upon the
Kid as an easy proposition for the champion
andis very eagerto clinch @ match. Jeffries,
according to Brady, is ready to meet the Kid
one week after the boilermaker's combat with
Corbett. Toareporter of THESUN Brady said
yesterday

“Jeffries has been longing to meet MeCoy for
some time, and now that the Kid has signified
hia willingness to do business, itis rather

oodnews tome, | willleave the money which

have posted with Al Smith up for ten dave
and this ought to be ample time for MeCoy
to cover it. Even if. he gets defeated by
Sharkey, Jeffries will fight him, and if he says
eol williet Jim tack e MecCoyone week atter
the Hoosiers encounter with the Sallor. has
been decided, lam very confident thatJeffries
will whip Corbett and [will bet either Corbett
or MeCoy orany one else any partof $5.0000r
$10,000 that he will Knock Corbett out, pro
vided, of course, his seconds do not jump into
the ring to save him. it Jeffries can beat
Corbett ina punch, he will do it just to show
tome people that heisagreat fighter, Jefries
will also bet Mecoy that he will knock him out
il they ever meet.”

When MeCoy was aeen later he said: “T
will cover Brady's forfett to-morrow and
take him up on bis propositions, Brady wily
goon learn that I ain anxious todo business
