the following statement:

“Both boards met jointly to-day and the
Third Avenue directors formally asked us to

arantee the bonds issued yesterday, The
Getropo itan directors asked what they wore
to get as compensation for such guarantee;
for, under the law, one company cannot guar-

tee the bonds of another unleas Chere Is a
ease or utraffic arrangment, Then tho Phird
Avenue directors made their pro position
that wa lease their property t vat is,
the Third Avenue line aud all, its
controlled lines for M0) years. Because of the
incomplete condition of the Third Avente and
subsidiary lines the Metropolitan directors con
sidered that it would take three or four years
to put the property in shape. So with that
fact In mind the following terms were agroed
upon: The Metropolitan agrees, first, to guar-
antee the principal and interest of the Third
Avenue bonds; second, to pay to the Third

venue company for the first four years of the
ease the net earnings of the system above
fixed charges and operating expenses third, to

ent. on the capital stock, and, Mth, for the
paiance of the term of the lease to rays per
cent. This proposition, which was signed by

Directors of the Third Avenue company, was
accepted and ratified by the Metropolitan
dfrectors, aubiect tothe approval of the stock-
holders of both companies.’

NEW YORK CENTRAL AFFAIRS,

Bufialo Wants a Union Station— Vanderbilts
Get Much of W. H.'s Stock Back.

President Callaway of the New York Central
and Hudson River Railroad received yesterday
a delegation from Buffalo representing the
city government, the Pan-American FExposi-
tion Company and the Grade Crossing Com-
mission. Expecting a large attendance at the
exposition next year the people of Buffalo want

the principal railroad lines to unite in building
4 union station on or near the passenger sta-
tion now occupied by the New York Central,
There were about twenty-five Buffalonians
fn the delegation. ft. B, Adam was chairman
Alderman Charles H. Avery was secretary and
ohn N, Seatcherd also was present. The
uffalo men told President Callaway. that
uffalo was willing to sell the abandoned
famburg Canal, adjacent to the New York
Central's property, ou liberal terms, fora site
for a union station,
President Callaway suggested that the Buffalo
peor le appolut as committee to prepare a plan
of ust what they want, and he promised to
eubmit the plan to the New York Central di-
rectors. He assured his visitors that it wasthe
policy of the New York Central to endeavor to
comply with any reasonable requests of its
matrons. Within the past two or three years
he Central has expended more than $1,000,000
fin complying With the requirements of the
Grade Crossing Com mission in Bulfalo, Tracks
pave been depressed and bridges have been
uilt over Atreet Crossings,
The annua! meeting of the shareholders of
the New York Cuntral will be held in Albany
ext Wednesday. Practieally the present
Board of Directors will be relected, although
there Is some talk of admitting a representa-
tive of the Pennsylvania Raiiroad into the
board. In consequence of the close, relation-
ship now existing between the New York Cen-
tral and the Pennsylvania the suggestion has
been made that the community of interest will
be promoted by each line having repre-
sentation in the directorate of the other, Some
of the_meon largely interested in the Pennesyl-
vania Railroad ure known to have invested
eonsiderably in New York Central stock, and
vice versa,
An interesting fact with regard to New York
Central stock holdings is that avery large pr
ortion of the $52,000,000 of stock sold) by
William H. Vanderbilt several years ago and
distributed by Drexe!, Morgan & Co. to foreign
capitalists, has found its way back into the
hands of the Vanderbilt family. Por
years, J. Pierpont Morgan as the representa.
tive of foreign holders was able to vote the
roxies of these forefan holdings, amounting
o about one-halfof the capital stock of the
New York Central, At the approaching annual
meeting the Vanderbilt proxies will far exceed
amajority of the stock and the foreign hold-
{ngs will not be far from $15,000,000,
Speaking of _the recent — blockade of
freight between Chicago and Buffalo, in conse.
quence of scarcity of cars, President Callaway
eald yesterday “The freight blockade is a
thing of the past. Everything now is moving
emoothly. For awhile the New York Central
was compelled to handle 25,000 and 20,000
cars daily, Now we are handling between
38,000 and 17,000 daily, The volume of traffle
continues large, but there is no trouble in tak-
dng care of It.”

of the Carnegie Company, 14,

Mr, Carnegie
accounted for bis presence in New York
atthia time by saying that fu April he would
rather bein New York than in Florida, Mr.
Sehbwalbsaid he had just run down from At-

| CANADIAN

Iantic City to talk over a little business with |

Mr, Phipps, in which business the public

would not be at nll interested even ff they |

knew all about it. Mr. Phipps thought he had
aright to come to New York without giving
the reason for his coming. Mr. Sehwab re-
turned to Atiantic City last evening,

After locating the three steel magnates
above named aSun reporter went to @ man
usually informed as to what fa going on in the
Carnegie Company and asked him how it hap-
pened that Messrs. Carnegie, Schwab and
Phipps arrived in New York about the same

time and what they had come here for.

“Give itup,” said the man: “I don’t know
the first thing about it.” ;

Then he looked out of the window
and added

"There has bean some talk about. the
Cramps and the Carnegie Company uniting.
Let Carnegie be one side of a triangle and the
Cramps the other. Howdo you find the base?

Carcaao, April 11.—At a conference to-day
with genera! passenger agents of the Chicago-
St. Paul roads the representative of the “Soo”
line of the Canadian Pacific made a demand for
differential rates to New York by way of Mon-
trea). He refused to withdraw the present cut

he demand made by the Canadian Pacific's
lino for differential rates greatly aurprised the
officials of the other roads, Two years ago the
Canadian Pacific and {ta competitors in this
country agreed that the Interstate Commerce

Commission should act as arbitrator of the
question of the right of the Canadian Pacific
to differential passenger rates. The commie-
sion came to Chicago to hear testimony and
arguments in the case. The decision of the
commission was that the Canadian Pacifico was
not entitled to any differential rates.

For atime the Cansdian Pacific made a pre-
tence of abiding by the decision, announcing
that its rates would not be less than any made
over lines of the United States, Soon It an
to quote rates open.y based on impracticable
railund lake routes. Finally the second clase
rate from St. Paul to New York was reduced
to$25, The lines running Eaet from Chicago
entered into an agreement not to accept pro-
portions of the cut rates from thelr Chicago-
St. Paul connections. The latter pointed out
the tuct that the Canadian Paelfle could not
make «rate of $25 from St. Paulto New York
without the coSperation of the New York Cen-
tral road, and they considered ft unfair for the
New York Central and the lines owned or con-
trolled’ by it to discriminate against them in
favor of the Canadian Paetie

Phe Vanderbilt lives felt the weight of that
protest and have mantfested a willingness to

Wepwnespay, April 11.

There wasn further falling off to-day in the
transactions in both departments of the Stock
Exchange and the market was even more pro-
fesaional then for several days past, Operations
| for European account were curtailed by the
| Spprcace to the Easter holidays, ia con-

sequence of which the London Stock Ex-
| ehango will be closed from to-morrow after-
noon until next Tuesday morning. A

similar suspension of busipeas here from
the close to-morrow until Monday morolng
also tended to restrict trading and induce
speculators on the long side of the market to
reduce their liabilitles, Notwithstanding these
circumstances foreign arbitrage houses bought
about 25,000 shares on balance, chiefly Union
Pacific and Northern Pacific common stocks,
Both closed fractionally higher than yesterday,
though the selling of the first-named was very
heavy, particularly by brokerage houses having
private wire connections with Chicago, They
were also conspicuous sellers of Steel and Wire
common, which sustained a net logs of 1% per
eeht,

The bull pools in several stocks, notably in
Brooklyn Rapid Transit, in Baltimore and Ohto
preferred, in Missouri Pacitic and in Sugar Re-
fining, were able to resist the selling move-
ments in those stocks, Federal Steel, Loule-
ville and Nashville and Southern Pacific also
proved superior to the prevailing tendency.
There was pronounced weakness in Contl-
nental Tobacco in the early dealings, but the
market for it railied in the last hour so that the
net fluctuation was unimportant, The etate-

ment of the operations of the company
forthe firet year of Its existence, which was

submitted to the stockholders at their meeting
to-day and which ia printed in an adjoining
column, explains recent selling of the common
stock. Itappears that the company paid only
two quarterly dividends upon its preferred
stock for the first year of its operations
because its earnings did wot warrant
the payment of even ‘ of 1 per
cent. more upon that stock. The Treas-
urer’s report says that In considering these
figures itsnould be borne in mind that they
“represent the efficient conduct of the business
fora period of only a little more than six
months.” Itremains to be seen whether the
holders of the company’s shares will accept
| this plausible explanation of the non-fulfil-
ment of the forecasts relative to earnings that
were made when the company was organized,
with the sama degree of confidence that they
exhibited when they acquired their stock,

The most important development to-day was
the announcement of the terms upon which
the Metropolitan Street Railroad Company has
agreed to jease the Third Avenue property, of
which it has acquired control, Those terms
seem to be fair to both parties to the contract
and justify the recovery in the price of Third
Avenue stock. That movement appears to
have disturbed an over-confident short in-
terest, and to-dav's news ia not likely to in-
crease the peace of mind of those who may still
be short of the stock,

There was a farther advance in the price of
sight sterling that brings the rate to within ‘s
acent per pound of the figures at which gold
will be a ebeaper form of remittance than bills,
The explanation of the movement is that
Europe is again borrowing money in this mar-
ket because of the lower rates for money pre-
vailing here. For the same reason foreign
speculators are carrying here the bulk of their
recent purchases of securities, In the final
dealings the stock market rallied, chiefly on
the covering of shorts,
