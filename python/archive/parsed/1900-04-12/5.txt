Expansion.

In the House of Representatives yester-
day, in the struggle against the Puerto
Rico bill, the party of WILLIAM JENNINGS
BRYAN made its third conspienous and
Critical attempt to defeat the policy of na-
tional expansion, and lost.

The Democratic tight to prevent Hawaii's
annexation, led by the Hon, ARTHUR PUE
GorMaN, after the treaty had been laid
before the Senate for the second time by
President McKinury was tho firat; oppo-
sition to the treaty of peace with Spain,
which made the Philippines United States
territory was the second, and yesterday
saw the third.

In each case the dominant Democratic
desire was to bar the Republicans from
the political prestige of extending the
boundaries of American dominion, In
the defeat of the Puerto Rico bill
there was still a chance to muddle the situ-
tion so that expansion, at least beyond the
Bandwich Islands, would fail, Happily,
Destiny was too strong forthe opposition,

No one can honestly deny that Puerto
Rico has got, by the bill just) passed,

new allegianea, So far

COMMITTEE ON DISTRIBUTION

There is nothing at the portal to explain
the genesis of the Committee, or to indi.
cate what it is that the Committee is dis-
“ributing. Further investigation, however,

The story of the ‘Committee on Distribu-
tion "and of the partnershipcloaked by that
imposing, if somewhat vague, title to pub-
lic confidence is queer enough to deserve
attention,

The J. D. Ricwanpson of the Committee
on Distribution isthe Hon, Jawes DANTEL
RICHARDSON of ‘Tennessee, leader of the
Democratic minority in the Fiftv-sixth
Congress, compiler of the publie document,
in ten volumes
and Papers of the Presidents,
1897," and author of
resolutions introdueed at. the
session with the frankly avowed purpose of
restricting the profits of certain industrial
corporations to four per cent, of the actual
cost of their products. The Hon. James
Danren Rrewarpson served for years on
the House Committeo on Printing. He was
chairman of that committee in the Fifty.
third Congress, and Demoeratic member of
the same in the Fifty-fourth Congress and
in the Fifty-fifth, both of which were Repub-
Hiean, He did not sever his direct connee-
tion with the Government printing presses
until last December, when his party pro-
moted him tothe leading place on the Demo-
eratic side of Wavs and Means, and he went
at the same time upon the Committee on
Rules, as the acknowledged leader of the
minority. The Ricu-
ARDSON'S relations the Government
Printing OMee will appear further along in
this narrative

The A. R.Sporrorp of the Chicago signe
board is the Hon. AINSWoRTH EL SporronD,
formerly the Librarian of Congress, and
now the Chief Assistant Librarian, His
name is well known fo students of
historical and political literature and to the
general public on aceount of his long ex.
perience as custodian of the nation’s books.
It is familiar to publishers and authors,
on aveount of his funetions for many years
under the Jaws of copyright

The Barcrvs of the “Committee on Dige
tribution” is Mr. JawEs 8. Barcus, at one
time of New York, but mere recently of
Terre Haute, Indiana. Mr. Barcusisa push-
ing young gentleman who has achieved

We now go back to the beginnings of a
great enterprise which has enlisted the
political skill ofa RrcHARDSoON, the scholarly
industry of aSPOFFORD, andthe rare genius
of a Barcrs.

Some time inthe winter or spring
the Hon, Joe Barney of Texas happened to

remark in the presence of the Hon. JAMES

DANIEL RicHARDSON that it would bea good
thing to reprint the messages of the Presi-
dents
that if BAILEY would introduecea resolution
to that effect, he wonld not only put it
through the Committee on Printing, but
also undertake the work of compilation,
Accordingly, as chairman of the Com-
mittee on Printing, Mr. RicHarvaon
wesonted on June 11,
‘

| RrcHARDSON'sS committee. It

 

of 1894 !

Mr. RicHarpson at once suggested |
‘ rent resolution to print

1894, @ rey 'b

recommending the publication, by the
Government Printing Office, of a mis-
cellaneous public document containing
the messages of all the Presidents,

together with their inaugural addresses |

and proclamations, The recommendation
was favorably received, for every member
of the House felt the need of such a com-
pilation. The old “Statesman’s Manual”
brought the record down only to the end of
Pierce's Administration, and, moreover,
that compilation has been long out of print.
Mr. RicHARDSON stated with truth that a
new collection of the executive messages
and papers would be a valuable addi.ion to
the list of Government publications. The
House promptly authorized the printing
of such a document, under the supervision
of Mr. RicHaRpson's committee, and pro-
vided for an edition of 6,000, A month
later the Senate concurred.

The next step was the adoption, by the
Joint Committee on Printing, at Mr.
RicHARDSON’s instance, of a resolution
authorizing him personally to take charge
of the work of compiling and editing the
messages and other papers, and giving him
“full power and discretion to do this work
for and on behalf of this committee.”

Two years later, on April 11, 1896, Mr.
RICHARDSON announced that the first vol-
ume of ‘House Miscellaneous Document
No, 210, second session, Fifty-third Con-
gress” was ready to be delivered by the
Public Printer. He offered a joint resolution
directing the Public Printer to deliver the
volume, and ite successors when published,
to the Superintendent of Documents, to be
distributed to such persons as the Senators
and Representatives might designate, ac-
cording to their respective quotas. Mr.
DINGLey inquired if thia resolution came
from the Committee on Printing:

“Mr. RICHARDSON=No, Sir

“Mr. DISGLEY—It had better go to the Committee
on Printing

“Mr, RICHARDSON~I conferred with the chairman
ofthe committee. The whole work, | may say, is under
my supervision, Isaw all the members of the com
mittee in the Senate and in the Mouse, and all agree
that this resolution should be adopted now, as the
first volume fs about to be delivered to Congress.

“Mr. DINGLEY- Allright. Imotice that the chair
man of the committee !s not present.

“Mr. RICHARDSON -1 know

‘Mr. DINGLEY And the gentleman knows he tsin
favor of the resolution?

"Mr. RICHARDSON

Thereupon the House passed Mr. Rica-
ARDSON'S resolution, and he promptly
moved to reconsider and to lay the motion
to reconsider upon the table,

At this time Mr. Rrcuarpson stated, in
response to questions by members, that
the compilation would probably make four
volumes in all; that the work would prob-
ably be completed in a twelvemonth from
that date; that no estimate had been made
of the cost to the Government; and that he,
Mr. Rrerarpsonx, had devoted a great deal
of time and labor to the work. Mr. McMr-
LIN asked him what would become of the
fractions of the edition; that is to say, of
the sets left over after the equal distribu.
tion to Senators and Representatives, Mr.
RICHARDSON replied that under the general
Printing law the fractions would go to the
Superintendent of Documents, ‘to be by
him distributed mainly upon orders of
members of Congress.”

I have seen the

He favors it.”

Ten days later Mr. RicHarpson’s resolu-
tion for the distribution of the ‘Messages
and Papers” according to quota, came back
from the Senate with this amendment:

’ Provided, that In the distribution to the Senate
and House of Representatives the fraction shall itn
each case be delirered to the compiler

And in this the House concurred,

The next month, May, 1896, another
resolution passed the House and the Senate
authorizing the printing of 15,000  addi-
tional eoptes of “Messages and Papers,”
and specially providing that of this larger
edition also, the “fraction” in each ease
should go to the “compiler.”

The possible size of the resulting “ frate
tion” made over to Mr. RICHARDSON was
the subjeet of diseussion in the House ata
later date. Mr. Consoniy of Ilinois, a
member of the Judiciary Committee, figured
the gratuity at about 500 sets, worth ata
very moderate estimate $10 a set, or 85,000
inall, Myr. HEPBURN was inclined to think
the number of sets would be somewhat in
Mr. RICHARDSON brushed
the question aside by saying that he had
not counted the fraction. He had given
away some sets to “literary men through-
out the United States, but had not yet sold
and did not know that he ever

exeess of 700,

“u eopy,
should,”

The first commercial aspect of the affair
was presented in the shape of a resolution
offered by Mr. RicHtarpson himself, on
May 4, 1896, authorizing the printing of
1,000 sets “for sale.” The faet that this
resolution, although referred in the regular
eourse to Mr. RICHARDSON’S own commit.
tee, was never reported and pressed through
the House, seenisto mark the time when the
larger possibilities of private proflt latent
inthe Messages and Papers” impressed
themselves upon the compiler's enterpris-
ing mind, “ Fractions” became a matter of
comparative insignificance fromthe moment
of the inception of the remarkable scheme
that led to the partnership with Barers,
the employment of poor SPOFFORD, and the
organization of the “Committee of Distri-
bution” for the purpose of exploiting the
general public

Vherefore, after Congressman RicHARD-
son bad once determined to make for him-
self what money he eould by the sale in the

| open market, according to the methods set

forth in his friend Bakevs's great work on

Thus was the way prepared for the willing
Barcus aud his merry men,
In the spring of 1897, somebody at the
| Senate end of the Capitol, deting in Mr.
RICHARDSON'S interest, injected into the
Sundry Civil Appropriation bill this amend-
ment:

“That the Publle Printer be, and he is hereby, au-
thorized and directed to make and deliver to JAMES
D. RICHARDSON, the compller of ‘Messages and
Papers of the Presidents,’ without cost to him, dupli
cate electrotype plates from which the compilation
“Messages and Papers of the Presidents’ ts pub
lished.”

This extraordinary provision passed the
Senate without attracting attention, When
it came tothe House, however, on May 11,
it became the subject of critical inquiry and
some indignant comment. One gentleman
asked if this was the James D. RicHARDSON
who was then serving as a member of the
Fifty-fifth Congress. If 80, he wanted
to know why the Government should
manufacture, at ai eost of $3,000
or more, for Mr, RichHanpson’s private
benefit, duplicate plates of a public docu-
ment. It was stated that these plates had a
high value commercially; a responsible firm
was willing to pay the Government $10,000
for them. Was Mr. RICHARDSON going to
claim copyright in his own name on a
public document which he had compiled in
the course of his committee work? Would
not every member who should assist in the
preparation of a public document of general
interest: be equally entitled to appropriate
the results of his labors? Mr. Cannon said
that the Public Printer’s estimate of the
cost of the plates was $8,600. Mr. Con-
NOLLY remarked:

“Ifthe edition provided for now shall be exhausted,
that has been pald for out of the Treasury of the
United States, then the public can get no more vol
umes of this kind except they Zo to the counter of
ibe gentleman from Tennessee and buv them.”

Mr, WALKER of Massachusetts said:

“Ifthe gentleman from Tennessee is to have these
plates they may become a very valuable franchise to
bim. Iam not willing that he should have such an
advantage as would prevent any other man from set
tng up and printing these books if he choose to du
so * * * Tshould Uke to have placed in the Re
ord a complete statement of the gentleman from
Tennessee asto the exact effect in his view of this
amendment, so that the statement may,be binding
upon him and upon Congress."

Thus forced to speak for himself and his
partners in the proposed entéfprise, Mr.
TCHARDSON made @ statement which does
not seem to have been accompanied by a
single blush. He admitted that he had
volunteered to do the work of compilation,
but he had found it a bigger job than he
expected; besides, Congress had required
him to make an index, He didn’t Know
what would be the actual cost to the Gov-
ernment of the plates for which he asked,
He thought it might be $1,200; but the
gventieman from [ilinois said it would be
over $3,000, and the gentleman from
[linois was probably correct, The copy-
right question he dodged with great ine
genuity until he was pinned down thus:

“Mr. HROWN-—Will the gentleman kindly answer
this’ Does he understand that when he shall receive
the property in these plates he would be entitled to
copyright the work?

Mr. RICHARDSON=No, not at all, This
ment does not give me any right tocopyright
You cannot copyright a Government publication
The law is explicit on that subject

But alittle later in the same discussion
occurred this passage, Mr, RICHARDSON
being the speaker:

deluged with communications from their
constituents inquiring whether the agents
of Barcus do in fact represent Congress.
So scandalous is the imposition practised
upon the public under cover of the ‘Com-
mittee on Distribution,” that both Con-

arose in the House a few weeks ago to
denounce it to the Hon. JamEs D. RICHARD-
SON'S face. The ugly word used by Mr.
Eppy was " fraudulent.”

And what did the Hon, James D. Ricu-
ARDSON reply? That he had nothing to do
with the sale of ‘‘Messages and Papers,”
except that Congress had voted him a
duplicate set of the electrotype plates,
“of course with the understanding that
these plates could be used by any pub-
lisher to whom I might lease them
or rent them;" that such methods
were not authorized by him, and that he
did not believe they were authorized by
Barcus; that Mr. SPOFFORD had been em-
ployed ‘to assist, in an honorable way, in
the sale of the work;" and that his, Ricn-
ARDSON'S, Only connection with the matter
grows out of the fact that the “ publishers”
pay him a ‘small royalty!”

It strikes us that there is a greater scan-
dal in all this business than the petty
swindling practised on Western farmers
and others by the employees of the “'Com-
mittee on Distribution,” whose story we
have pew told.

Which Must First Be
Settled.

Indications begin to appear that before
the meeting of the Presbyterlan General
Assembly at St. Louis next month a
considerable movement for the revision
of the Westminster Confession will be
under way. The speeifle stumbling block
put forward by those who want” the
changes made is the doctrine of eleetion.
It isthe distaste for the teaching that in
His foreknowledge Gop predeatinated a
eertain part of His creatures to eternal
damnation, which induced a like attempt
several years ago, but ended in the accom-
plishment of nothing.

The trouble is that the real cause of the
current criticism of the Presbyterian
standard is far deeper. It goes to the very
foundation of the whole Confession, or to
the authority of the Bible, and it is so revo-
lutionary in its consequences that even
those most affected by it do not dare to
invite that logical conelusion. They are
undertaking, therefore, to make a diver-
sion from the main point by training their
the chapter “Of Gop's

The Question

guns solely on
Eternal Decree,”

Now, that chapter, like all the rest of the
Westminster Confession, relies for its sup-
port on an array of Seviptural proof texts
solely. It is also an Integral part of that
system of faith, and cannot be wrenehed
away from the rest without the entire
structure tumbling to pieces, as was dem-
onstrated so thoroughly when an attempt
at revision was last made, As the whole is
necessarily built on the inspired) infalli-
bility of the Bible as the Word of Gop,
with the declaration of which the Con-
fession logically begins, any proposition
for a revision which does not start with it
sets out by begging the question. More-
over, it is the one question which is now
absorbing the thought of Christendom and
revolutionizing the belief of a large part of
it. Is the authority on whichall Protestant
belief is solely based sound and indispu-
table as being Divine, or is it simply a col-
lection of fallible human literature of
doubtful authenticity?

What is called the “higher criticism " of
the Bible pretends or assumes to save out
of it a modicum, of which the ‘conecept,”
essence merely, is inspired,
but that most a vague and
shadowy authority only. The Pope, in his
Eneyelical on Seripture in 1803, was logical
therefore in denouncing as intolerable such
trickery as that of the hedging crities who
argue that “in a question of the truth or
falsehood of a passage, we should consider
not so much what Gop has said as the rea-
son and purpose He had in mind in saying
it.” Of course, the mind of Gop is fathom-
less by man, and if the Bible cannot stand
onthe plain meaning of its language, it is
without foundation,

If then, there isto be anything like a rea-
sonable revision of any Christian ereed or
formulaof faith the question to be settled
tirst of all is whether the Bible is of man or
of Gop, is true because supernaturally and
Divinely inspired or is open to eriticism
and is without final authority as a human
production merely. To strike only ata
particular feature of a standard of faith
when Christian criticism is destroying the
very foundation of the whole system, is, of
course, mere child's play or a cowardly
subterfuge to divert popular attention from
the main eonsequence of the destructive

or the real
leaves at

enterprise,

The Westminster Confession has no vital-
ity except as it gets its life from the theory
of the inspired infallibility of the Bible,
Upset that theory and it is dead, root and
branch, and with it goes all Christian theol-
ogy, asthe Pope's Eneyelical, from whieh
we have quoted, shows he clearly com-
prehends.

As we hear the iron heels of the Hon,
GroveERn CLEVELAND'S polysyllables stamping
the Princeton sands in the old familiar man-
ner, we have new cause to be grateful that the
delights of fishermanship have not driven
the cares of statesmanship from that noble
breast, But if the plesiosaurus had made an

IN SOUTH AFRICA,

The last twenty-four hours’ despatches show
widespread activity on the part of the Boers,
which may be attributed to their knowledge of
the crippied condition of the British mounted
troops, and of which they are taking advan
tage, The reported Boer victory at Meerkats-
fontein, which is said to have caused nneasi-
ness in London, is probably only an exaggera-
tlon of the affair at Keddersbure, near where
there isa place called Marsfontein, which may
have given rise to the confusion of localities
So important an incident, if it is other than
suggested, would certainly have been oflelally
reported before now

The matn point of interest for the moment,
however, is Wepener where Gen, Brabant has
been beleaguered sinea Monday, and to where
Lord Roberts is hurrying assistance. Accord-
ing to reports the Boer forces in the southeast
of the Freda State can not be less than 15,000
strong, Which seems an exaggeration even if
they bave been rejoined by the burghers who
had made their submission to the British after
the occupation of Bloemfontein, But whatever
their strength they appear to be in numbers
sufficient temporarily to upset Lord Roberts's
plans andto compel him to follow their lead
instead of playing hisown hand. If it be true
as stated in a Cape Town despatch that the
107 miles of railway between Bloemfontein
and Norvals Pont require 15,000 men to
assure ft against interruption by the Boers,
some idea can be formed of the force which
will be required to watch over the whole of the
lines on which the British army now inthe
heart of the ree State and on the southwestern
border of the ‘Transvaal wil! depend for its very
existence when it begins to get near Johannes-
burg and Pretoria, the oljectives of the war

The flehing on Tue near Flandsiaagte in
Natal seems to have been insignifleant, butthe
Boers are reported to have several heavy guns
mounted in commanding positions, anda con-
siderable force intrenched in the Biggaursberg
Mountains, northeast of Ladysmith. In eon.
sequence, the heavy guns mounted at Durban
were to be sent up again to Ladysmith, For
some reason not stated some of the regiments
in ‘Natal and Gen, Hart are being sentround
to Cape Colony, or are reported to be, though,
unger the new arrangements with Portugal, it
is just possible that they may have a more
northerly destination, and be sent into Kho-
desta through Beira. Should they really be
going to Cape Colony the pressure on Lord
Roberta's army must be greater than we have
yet been informed of

A Pretoria report states that Gen, Methuen is
moving on Hoonstad, about seventy miles
northeast of Boshof. It is unlikely, however,
that his advance will be pushed until the com
mandos to the south have been disposed of,
and the troops that have been seut after them
from Bloemfontein are again disposable for the
forward movement from there, The proelam-
ation issued by Lord Roberts warning the col-
onists against hostile acts under pain of the
utmost rigor of military law, is an unmis
takable indication of his anxiety about his
communications and of the existence of
disaffection among the colonists, On the
whole the British public would appear to have
etrong reason for dissatisfaction withthe way
things are going, and untess they are speedily
set right we may look for an explosion of feel-
ing that will react disastrously on those re-
sponsible for the war. Court and Chartered
Company favorites are continued in commands
inspite of their failures, while unfortunate
but less favored Generals are sent back to
England, and War Office negligence goes un-
punished, hardly even censured, for the aacri-
fice of the lives and health of the rank and file.

 

A Site for the Sherman Statue,

To THE Eprtor or Tue Sun Sw; Concern-
ing the choice of a site forthe Sherman statue
which will not destroy the trees and landscape
beauty of Central Park, allow me to suggest us
suitable for the purpose, the ground bounded
reapectively by Seventy-second street, Seventy-
third street, and Amsterdam avenue and the
Boulevard. This territory has been already
advocated as a site for the Sherman statue
and the favor the idea has been accorded has
led to the popular name of Sherman Square
being given it

It ought to be comparatively easy to design
the necessary expanse of architectural setting
at this point which will be required properly ty

APARTMENTS AND PRICES,

The Experiente of a Connecticut Couple
Who Went to Live in the Metropolis,

To rme Eprror or Tar Sux—Sir: Why in |

thunder doean't somebody build a flat in down-
town New York somewhere in which fair ace
commodations may be had at a possible price?
Do you want to know why I ask? Yes? Well,
Nisten.
and we own in a right good town in Connecticut
ten houses, of from five to seven rooms each,
rented to families of from three to six persons,
which bring us tna monthly rental of $100,
a vory fair return on the capital invested. Itts
a little low, perhaps, but the renters are relin-
ble and permanent and we prefer that to more
with greater risk

We have been boarding In our town for sev-
eral years, but concluded we might as well try
New York awhile, 80 about four weeks ago we
eame hereto find a place, thinking that ten
houses ought surely bring enough revenue to
get usone here. We found out in about two
minutes’ talk with a real estate agent that we
were mistaken,

Then we thought we might get a flat fur-
nished, That idea lasted about six minutes,
Then we coneluded to look foraroom, One
room ~that was enough for us so long as it was
big enough for us to get around in; 80 we
started forth merrily to find it. Being in town
to see tho sights, we wanted to live downtown
among them, 80 we selected the territory be-
tween Twenty-third street and Thirty-sixth
street, and being respectable, we did not want
to get any further away from Fifth avenue
than we could help, We did not pick out new
and pretentious houses, but just quiet, plain
ones, and the first one we went into, in Thirty-
second street, had just the room we wanted,
but the price asked was $15 a week. We
couldn't stand that, and the lady showed us a

hall room for $5 a week; but, as one of na
would have had to sleep out in the hall, and I
wouldn't agree to bo the one, my wife objected,
and we moved on to the next place,

There they had room and board, and the
price was $30 a week forthe two of us, That
price meant a mortgage on our property at
home, and we declined

We next found a pleasant place that my
wife thought was just too lovely for anything,
but the landlady wasn't at home and we were
Tt was auch aniee, quiat,
plain-looking place that my wife wouldn't look

The landlady was al
smiles and said we eould have the room for
$22 a week. Think of that, will vou? One
room atalmost as much per week as we were
getting forten entire houses, accommodating
ten families, aggregating forty parsons,

We got out without committing a breach of
the peace and went around into another street,
wheres we found a nice place and a smooth
Jandiady who told ua we eould have one room
and breakfast for $24.50 a week. That was
some better than $22 and no breakfast, because
‘we gota pretty fair breakfast, we could live
twoorthrae weeks without starving plumb to
death on the balance of our income, though we
couldn't have anv washing done, or see many

THE BANNER OF THF TOST CAUSE.

Gen, Joe Johnston on the Geneats of the
Confederate Battle Flag.

Torrr Eprror or Tur Stx-—Sir: In March,
1s], the Confederate Congresa adopted as
their emblem the so-called “Stars and Bars."
Tt was invade up of three horizontal bars of red,
white and red, with a blue union {nthe upper
left hand corner, on which were displayed thir-
teen whitestars in a cirele, thus giving the his-
toric red, white and blue, which tri-color ap-
peared in all the succeading changes,
semblance of this tothe “Starsand Stripes” led
to confusion, mistakes and lose of lifain the
first battle of Pull Run, or “Manassas” as the
Confederates designated it, and shortly after
that action another flag wes born to the Con-
federaey, in September, 1861.

The battle flag wasthen adopted. Thia, in
the Janguage of heraldry, was a red fleld
chareed with a blue saltier, with a narrow
border of white, on which were displayed thir-
teen white stars: in other words, a blue St.
Andrew's eroas on a red ground, This was
easily distinguishable and waa never changed,

The Stars and Bars were in ‘63 supplemented
by the camp flag. This wasin size and shape
like the other, except it was white with no
stripes and the hattle flag inthe upper corner,
next the staff Tr.was found defieient in actual
service, In that displaving «o much white it
was opt tobe mistaken fora flag of truce, andon
Fob 24, 1855. it gave piace to the last flag ofthe
Confederacy, the outer half being a red vertical
bar. Appearing so late in the war, it waa notso
familiar as the others; in fact, was compar-
atively littl: known

Confederate, Gen Joseph Fecleston Johnston,
for further information on the subject. His
