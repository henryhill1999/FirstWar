earme late this fall and the leaves remained
long on the trees, making the favorable sea-
son for etill hunting very short. Drv weather
conditions prevailed throughout the fall and
the deer had a great advantage over the hunter

in the forest the dry rustle of the leaves and
the eracking Limbs betraved his presence

More deer were killed in the last few dave

RAWHIDE HAMMERS,

 

 

And Mallets and Maals Also Made Oat of the
Same Material.

“The conmmon idea of a hammer, no doubt,"

| said a dealer in tools, “would be that it was an

implement made to pound with, and having
a head of iron or steel The pounding part of
that would certainly be all right, but not al!
hammer heads are made of metal: there are
some hatomers, in tact, with the head made
of rawhide

“Where the head would be on an ordinary
hammer there is on the rawhide hamuner,
eet at right angles across the endof the handle,
a short section of iron pipe The rawhide that
forms the han @oer head is first ent into an

ohiong strip, wlich is then, beginning at one
end, snugly rolled up = The roll thus formed ia
put through an iren pipe, being made long
enongh so that it will project an inch or more
at either end The ends of the solid rawhide
are trimmed off flat and true, like the face of
any hammer, making this a two-faced hammer.

“The rawhide hammer is used for various
purposes, largely in place of a mallet: for in-
stance, for pounding on punches, and on chisel
handles [rt is used where pounding is to he
done on polished metal surfaces: it serves the
vurpose witheut scratching the metal inw-
ide hammers are made in various sizes

“Then there is a rawhide implement that is
ealled a mallet, in which the head is formed
in the same manner as the rawhide hammer
head, but joined to the handle direct, without
being held there in a holder The rawhide
matlet isalsomadein varioussizes: it isa smaller
and Helter tool than the hammer

“Another rawhide pounding tool is the raw.
hide maul, heavier than the hammer, and made
in various sizes The head of the rawhide
maul is nude of disks of rawhide laid together
toa sufficient thickness and held together by
iron caps top and bottom, throueh which, as
of course through the rawhide as well, the
maul handle passes The block of rawhide

 

| thus made ts turned into the usual maul form

Built up as it is of compacted lavers placed
eross wise of the handie, the striking surtace
of the maul, as is the case with the hammer
and the mallet inthe manner in which they are
made presente the rawhide in a mass edge
wise The rawhide maul is used, for example,
by artificial flower makers, pounding all day
long on dies and punches cutting out flawers
and leaves

“These rawhide hammers and maliets and
Mauls cost about three times as much as cor-
fospopding wooden mallets would cost—they

about ten times as long.”

As toa clothing trust, Mr. Pookin said

“A trust in our business, while it would be
highly desirable, would be @ complicated thing
as the styles of carments and their prices are
changing all the time. inthe case of the Sugar
Trust, for instance there is no change at any
time in the product itself The Suwar Trust
has enabled the people to have sugar so cheap

has created such an enormous demand that

“If, however, the West Side firme and the
other bie firms could make a combination
by which the comission agents could be

brought into an agreement binding them not
to sell cloth to any manufacturer outside of
the combination the trade would improve
atonce Atrust of some kind would eventually
follow by which, while the consumers would
not pay more, the workers would earn twice
as much and the manufacturers would all have
living profits This is a case indeed where the
wipal benefleuuwries of the trust would be

wresentatives of a number of other cloak

 
 

manufacturing firtos said that, while a trust
would benefit both ermplovers and emplovees
a great number of the manufacturers were too
much engaged it competition with one
another to take kindly to it None of
the small manufacturers would have con-
fidence enough in lis brethren in the trade
to go into a combination with them A mem-

 

her the cloakmahking firm of S Rothschild
& Brother said

“It is true that a labor union isa trust, which,
when il is strong enough, can carry tts demands
as to waves and hours of work, but the spirit
of competition keeps the cloak manufacturers
80 far apart that a trast, while much to be de-
sired would be impracticable under present
conditions  Fven the Manufacturers’ Associa-
tion, which Was several times organized to
resist strikes, hung together very loosely

Several manufacturers were asked how the
amal lemployers could get the cloakmakers
to aecept such low wages and to work under
such hard conditions when they could wet
higher wager under better conditions in the
large factories, One reason they said was that
many of the cloakmakers were orthodox Jews
and the sinall manufacturers kept their shop
closed on Saturday, the Jewish Sabbath, and
open on Sunday, while the large employers
kept their factories open on Saturday and
closed on Sunday This, however, they ad-
mitted was hardly a strong enough reason to
account for the ettuntion entirely

Mr. Levy, ex-Seeretary of the Cloakmakere’
Trion, gave another reason Inthe small fre

count would rather work for a «mall boss at
half the wages he would wet ina larwe factory
than work in a iaree factory where he has no

Here re a serious obstacle to the deter-

in the reluetanee of the Legisiatures of various
States to assent to the surrender oi territers

of forcing such surrender. When, in the early
years of the century, States were admitted
into the Union, their boundaries in nearly
every case were indefinite, being based upon
the recognition of parallels of latitude and
longitude from which the minor degrees were
omitted Asa consequence of this the boun-
daries of many States, except such aa were of

boundary of New York, the eastern boundary

and as the amount of taxable wealth in such

the courts for settlement. Aa the railroads,
however, have increased, and as the laws rex-

ALBATROSS HARD TO KITT.

Kemarkable Story Told by a British Officer in
the Soath Pacific.

Mr William J) Reed writes from New Zealand
that an albatross was recently caught on the
steamer Star of New Zealand = Jt was killed,
das Was supposed, by being strangled and was
then wrapped iu an old meat cloth and putina
siow chest for refrigerating. The body lav
in this chest for ten days at a temperature
varving from zero to is degrees FF ‘Then
one of the sailors said he heard the bird making
a tole Mr Coombs, the first engineer, took
the bird outef the box and down to the engine
room, Where it moved tts head, opened ita beak
aud looked around with wide open eyes The
lowel partofthe body and the legs were frozen
stuf ‘The bird was then put out of its misery,

Another story of a suuilar eort that need not
be repeated here seenis also to show that the
Albatross is exceedingly tenacious of life

Probably the most remarkable story ofan
aibatross ever told was that of a bird which
was found dead on Sept 22, I8e7, on the beach
near Freemantie in South Australia. Around
ila neck waa fastened a small piece of tin upon
which had been scratched in French:

Tulrteen shipwrecked wen took refuge Upon Crozet
Isiatids on Oct. 4, 1687.

This remarkable information was at once
cabled by the Governor of South Australia to the
French Government, which ordered the trans-
port Meurthe, then in the Pacific, to proceed as
fast as possible to Crozet Islands. Whenthia ves-
sel reached the islands it found the camp of the
shipwrecked men and a note from them saying
that they numbered thirteen and were the crew
of the three-master Tamaris, owned in Bor-
deaur Their ship had driven ashore and gone
to pieces and they had lived there for some
time on fish and bird eggs They added that
they had just built a boat out of the wreckage
of the ship and were about to start for Pos-
session Island, a hundred iniles away, where
they thought they would, very likely, be picked
up by a whaler

The Meurthe at once went to Possession Ial-
and, but no trace of the men could be found
Their little boat had undoubtedly been swamped
on the journey over thestormy waters

The winged messenger that had borne to
civilization the news of these castaways had
made a journey of over two thousand mile
with few chances to rest on the way This
wonderful flight will rank with the best of the
many stories that are told of the albatrose's
remarkable powers and endurance on the wing
Sailors believe the “Man-o'-war-bird” sleeps
on the wing and naturalists tell us that its
immense wing bones are as long as its body
and that it is capable of flying feats that are
unequalled by anv other bird

Like most ice-breakers, the Permak was built

that she should be remarkably shallow forward

The idea which suggested Admiral Makaroff’s
acheme of construction was that the tee of the
Nortbern sea in stimmer, has so sheht a resigte
ance that it cannot withstand the shock of #,00
tons displacement and 16,000) horse power,
Upon that principle he drew his plans

The Yermak was completed in Mareh, 1899,
and was immediately put at work. On April

them to St. Petersburg ‘Three days later she
found twenty-eix other vessels tast behind
an ice bank. She sailed into that bank as @

football team smashes an opposing rush line,
opening a channel through which the ioe.
bound craft came out. A third trip resulted
fn setting ten more ships free, while, a little
later, she atlacked the ice packs at the mouth
of the Neva and brought out ninety vesselg
which bad been held in the river for weeks

Her performances surprised and delighted
the Russian naval officers and Admiral Mae
karod Was congratulated and tuid that all he
bad to do was to set wail for the Pole and ite
disvovery would be his) ‘The Admiral was
pleased, but not unduly elated, and simply said
that he would require more tests before he would
be satisfied. So, in July, iso, the Yermak
was sent further porth. On July 25 she struck
the ice north of the northwest coust of Spitz
bergen, in jatitude 8) degrees 20 minutes north
and longitude ® degrees 21 minutes east

From there she proceeded north slowly,
smashing the ice before her as she went She
ran into ice flelds of from 4.08 to 4.77 metres
in thickness and these were broken up without
the slightest difficulty At times she encoun-
tered ice 14.0 metres thick, rising 61% metres
above the surface of the sea Smashing into
these flelds, ahe sailed on northward as serenely
as if through tropic seas

On July 26, having been out a little more
than twenty-four hours, the Yermak struck
another of theee towering ice packs and the
comparatively weak underpurt of her hull
was plerced by a spur of the ice and she sprang
@leak. The bole waa temporarily stopped up
and the trip continued The ice breaker
pushed steadily northward, breaking tee of
every kind, form, height and thickness which
she met, untl about the middle of August.
Then she struck hard against a low lying block
of Ice, the old hole was made larger and, on
Aug. 17, the vorage was abandoned and the
Yermak put back tu St. Petersburg

Shortly after her arrival there she was sent
to Elawick, it was sald, at the time, for ree
pairs. Nothing could be learned then about
the extent of the repairs or what they would
be. Now, after more than a year at the Arm-
strongs' yards, it comes out that the Yermak,
under the personal supervision of Admiral
Maharoff, has been provided with @ great,
new bow and is being otlierwise improved and
refitted to start again on her pole-hunting
vovage early next summer

Some American naval officers are inclined
to be doubtful of the success of the under.
taking, if for no other reason than that the lee-
breaker will nut be able to carry coal enough
for the voyage and an attending collier will not
be able to go far enough north to be of service to
her. Lord Brassey, the great English naval
authority, i* inclined to the belief that the Yer-
mak will ultimately be suecessful in the under-
taking set for her, the belief being based solely
on what she has done already. Lord Brassey
in the latest Naral Annual says

“The experiments thus far have shown that
the Yermak, with 7,500 horse power ~that is,
with the forward engine of 2,500 horse power
uncoupled - is able while running with moderate
steam, to break through the polar ice north of
Spitzbergen, which is many vears old and con-
siderably compressed. If in so doing she
sustained some injury to the comparatively
weak bow below the thick ice belt, it simply
demonstrates that the forward part of the
ship must be considerably strengthened in ite
whole extent, probably in the same manner
as is now being done at the water line. It fe
obvious, for instance, that the forward screw
of the Yermak can be of no use whatever in
polar seas and, therefore, the wholeforward
engine and boiler can be done away with. The
saving in weight resulting therefrom can be
utilized to strengthen the bow and give it the
same iesistance in the lower part which t&
pow has at the ice belt.”

 

DYED FLOWERS.

e Color Scheme of Natare Efecte@
y Chemists and Florists.

The green carnation had a very brief day
and the general public looked askance at It,
There seemed to be a universal feeling that the
dyed flower was an offence against the principles
of esthetics and that admiration of the floral
monster indicated unwholesome degeneracy of
taste Recently, however, French scientists
have taken up the artificial coloring of flowera
and a series of lectures has heen given at the
Sorbonne by a French chemist who has made
aspecialty of this particular subject.

According to this professor the problem of
eoloring flowers by artificial means haa for
several centuries past interested chemists. io
1708 a scientisthamed Magnal caused a sensation
by producing tuberoses of a most exquisite pink
ordinary tuberoses being colored by plunging
them inte the juice of phylotagne. Bome
twenty-five years later Comparetti, a echolar
of Padua, made himeelf famous and added
distinction to the last days of lis town by fure
nishing for the decoration of churehes and
cemeteries wonderful wreaths of black cone
volvulus, Having made a fortune he at last
agreed to tell his secre! and declared that he
had colored the flowers by putting their stems
in common ink. The scheme didn't work when
tried by the townsfolk so (hee tecmned Paduam
