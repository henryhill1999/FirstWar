required as reserve aginst the linger deposits,
leaving $4,608,000 applicable to surplus aecount
and bringing that item upto $12,278,000, The
surplus reserve is now nearly twice as large as
it Wasa year ago The statenent aga whole
makes a most satisfactory exhibit

Prior to the publieation of the bank etate-
ment the stock market developed a much firmer
tone than prevailed at the close yesterday,
particularly in railway list This was
partly because many operators thought prices
had receded enough to warrant taking back
part of their stocks in expectation of a favor-
able showing by the Clearing Hotse institu-
tions ‘There was also acontinuation of good
buying on a moderate scale through commis-
tion houses The iron and steel stocks were
inclined to lag until the late trading, the specu-
lation in the entire group being adversely af-
fected by the stock-jobbing operations of the
speculative element in the management of the
American Steel and Wire Company. Follow-
ing the publication of the bank statement the
demand for stocks became more animated
and the closing was inthe main strong

The most noteworthy trading was in Nortb-
ern Pacitic common, which was exceptionally
strong throughout, Southern Railway corme-
mon, in which there was a sudden revival

the

of apeculative interest; Union Pactflo come
mon, Sugar Kefining, Brooklyn Rapid
Transit, Atchison {issues and the fron and

steel stocks The total transactiona tn stocks
this week were the largest ever recorded in a
similar period, being 6,874,000 shares, or an
average of 1,259,000 shares a day, counting
Saturday's business as two-fifths of the day.
The transactions in bonds, although large,
aggregating over $17,590,000 par value, have
occasionally been exceeded.

Considering that there have been no espe
elally important deyelopmenta affecting values
this week, the Stock Exchange markete have
made a most excellent showing both as regards
the volume of business and the manner in
which prices have Leen maintained, The re-
action at the end of the week was not more
than might have been expected and it certainly
was desirable, if business in Wall Street is to
continue upon a safe and healthy basis. The
trade reports indicate that the speculation
in stocks is on a very firm foundation

Railway traffic returns are slightly larger
than the enormous returns of @ year ago, and
bank clearings, even after making allowance
for the enormous speculation of this centre,
are materially larger than a year ago. The
gain outside of New York is 8, per cent. as com-
pared with the corresponding week of last year
and over 6) per cent. larger than in 1898 = In-
cluding this city, the increase over last year ts
81.7 per cent. as compared with last year and
over 82 per cent. as compared with two years
ago. The most inspiring reporta come from
the iron industry, in which the activity is con-
stantiy increasing and prices are steadily ad-
vancing. The orders for railway equipment
are unprecedented. Export orders are in
some cases filled with difficulty, owing to the
unusual domestic demand. In no manufact-
uring line is the situation described as booming,
but thera seems to be a substantial, gradual
growth. About the only finportant industry that
has not participated tn the improvement is the
manufacture of textile goods This branch of
business is held in check, principally by unsea-
sonable weather.

Ove of the most Interesting developments
this week has been the collapse of several
bucket shops, discretionary account ocon-
cerns and alleged brokerage firms that have
lured victims to their games by various devices,
principally by professing to have special in-
formation regarding future market move-
nmients It appears to be the policy of all
these concerns to work the publio as long as
the course of prices is against the prevail-
the

ing disposition of public, that is,
to buy stocks. As soon as ventures
in bucket shops and discretionary pool
concerns begin to slow profits in favor

of their patrons, these concerns Invariably
put up their ehutters. Unfortunately, in most
cases, the swindlers escape their fust deserta,
aud in due time resume operavuions under new
names Some satisfaction ia to be derived
from the fact that a few arrests have been
miade this week, still it is doubtful if concerns
ot the character described will ever be entirely
suppressed, since there is always a large num-
ber of persons whose gullibility 1s exceeded
only by their eagerness to make money without
working for it and earning it
