Lospon, Now 2+- The alarm, hot fo say
nic, which prevails in several important
Dashes of Aritich industry on acesunt of

the enorinous growth of American competition
now occupies the foremost place in public ate
tention It is discussed on all platforms by
leaders of opinion, and it ia the chief topie in
the serione press There ia not the sl@htest
doubt that «a thorough awakening of manu-
facturers in nearly all lines bas already taken
place The contrary ie the case among the
rink and fle of the workers, who really control
the situation The sharp rise of the cost of |
living is jmpelling the latter to increase their
demands to the still further embarrassment |
of their enaplovers

Tne situation would be radically changed |
if labor's request for higher wages was accom |
panied by an offer of greater effort and in-
creased output during w@king hours This,

 

|
however, has in no cate been <nmeested On |
the other hand, it will he strenuously resisted, |
and the policy of minimum work for standard
pay will be persisted in, according to the presen! |
Ontiook, until disaster to British trade has been |
frretrievably accomnpisthe !

Tord Koachery delivered a strong worrn-
ing last week, and vesterday Mr Herbert As-
quith, MP. told the heads of the Cham r
of Commerce what to expect He admitted
that the present prosperity of Great Britair
ree enormous and unprecedented, but he
pointed ont that England waa net holdinw
her own, Germany and the United States |

had stepped out from the rearto thefrontranks, |
Inatead of Fngiand enioving the supremacy
of trade, as was confident!y predicted half |
a ntury ago. she was now Aghting for ever
tro of ground with all her availabe strength
fn overy international market j
There are some obvious reasons for this,” |
said Mr. Asquith, “not due to shortcomings on
our part. We have lona ceased to enios that
relative superiority in natural advan'trges with
which we started upon the race. Look peross
the Atlantic and what do we fee? a nation
which In point of numbers i# almost, if not
quite, double our own notion, sprung to a large
extent from the same > nurtured among |
the same free tradi endowed In at least
as full measure a» we with facility of invention
and spirit of enterprise, occupying a country |
unrivalled in extent, and with a diversity cf |
natural resources, and enjoying throveh« ut |
the whole of that vast territory the incaleulahle |
boon of internal free trade. Can we wonder |
that such a nation, under euch circumstances

|

tock,

ons,

and conditions, is the most formidabie of our
Industrial competitors?
The case of Germary is on a somewhat
diferert footing. (iermany for industrial |
purposesis nota country exceptionally favored
by nature, and the rise of Germany into the
front rank of commercial powers is the most
remarkable tilustration to be found of the
practical value of education, organization and |
concentration, The days are happily gone |
when it is safe to indulge in the foolish sneer |
that the German emun and wove from materials
supplied by his own inner consciousness, The
Game sleepless industry, the same tenacity of
she same training and moulding of

given the German In turn first military su-
premacy and then political unity, have enabled }
him to overtake and, !f we do not mend our
ways, will enable him to outrun his more favored
rivale in the industrial struggle of the world.”
But Mr. Asquith failed to point out the fal-
lacias of governing organized labor in Great
Britain, which are fatally handicapping the |
trade of the country. Instead, he directed
attention to the more general defect of lack |
of education, especially technical education.
Tt can be readily understood that no public man
in England dares to antagonize the working
claases by boldly telling them that British
trade Is being destroyed by the suicidal policy
of the trades unions, which forbid members
