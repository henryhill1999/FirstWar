more mounts than any other American rider,
of his brother, Sam Loates,
the best of the English bors, has had a “lee
up” on nearly 250 more horses since the season
began on March 24 last The race between
the rivals caused consi ferable interest in Eng-
lish racing circles,which reached a culminating
point when the last table was published, show-
{ng that on Nov. ® both Lester Relff and Sam
Loates had guided his mount first past the
post on 183 occasions.
A peculiar feature of the struggle was that
after this interesting stage was reached both

Reiff and Loate « had a speli of ill luck. At
Tincoln, the meeting in” progress when the
pair was neck and neck, Re i? drew a blank,

while the only win credited to Loates was a
blo« diess victory on Emily Melton, that waiked
over for the Doddington Maiden Plate At
Liver, obon Nov. 7 Keiff rode Adm ral Dewey
to victr ry The following day he failea to
acore, but om Nov. 8 he guided The Scotehman
II to victory and on the closing day of the
meet got home in front with Old Clo. Sammy
Loates failed to land a winner in the four days,
andthus after the publication of the table I ester
led by one wil with a total of 24, which he
has slightly increased since, according wo de-

Interscholastic Ethics,
