in the centre of the drawing room, with his
nterpreter on one side and his associate, the
Murza Hiassan) Koras-anis, on the = other,

the diMlculties of the interpreter, who is him-
welf a Persian, were great, but he eucceeded
in giving the audience a fairly clear idea of
the doctrine the teachers wished to impart.
He sald that the tenchers present had come
on thetr long journey trom the East to bring
to the people of the West the truth that had
heen mercifully revealed to the followers of
God in their ancient lund
There is but one God,”
“and He alone is supreme

pated by Bach more than a cen
Wagner. Time tn {ta most fronical
gigs never played a more fantastic prank than
incarnating in the person of & sole: peri-
wig-pated old cantor in a Keepy Germuan town
the very divinity of musta. From Bach all
musical blessings flow, ail musical blessings
must flow; and no matter how remote the
future, or fugactous musical fashions, Baoh
will be the keyatone of the art. But this tsa
commonplace of musical criticism.

Though the Oratorio Society showed more
famillarity with the score than Lt did last spring,
there was muoh to find fault within the per-
formance. Yet criticism here may with propriety
wear the mask of graciousness. Rather should
the feeling be one of gratitude toward Mr.
Damrosch and his associates. ‘lo recapture
the fine old churchly atmosphere behind the
bars of Baah's musio would in these latter
dars be aa difficult aa to tell what songs the
sirens sang—a question which long purzied
Sir Thomas Browne. There was a« brilliant
quality in the work of the chorus last night;
brilllancy and solidity. But ft was not always
informed by deep religious seatiment. Here
again time and place were unfavorable--a
cathedral ta the only fit environment for thia
master work. There was some muddiness
of tone in the choral ainging; and the leading
ef parta wes not always clear in “Cum Sancto
Spirito”—a number that otherwise was capi-
tally executed Mrs de Moss, a newoomer,
with an agreeable, well trained soprano voice,
aang with much earnestness the aria “Lauda-
mus Te,” with thejviolin obligatoof Mr. David
carefill in her
delivery of the Bachian ornaments, and al-
together made an excellent impression

Miss Stein has been in hetter voice, but she
never sang more artisticniir the solo “Quit
Sedes,” with its quaint obligato by the acid-
tened oboe d’amore. In music of this sort
\lisa Stein ie always happy. Mr. Baernetein
«gave the “Quoniatn” nobly in his mellow baas.
The air has aleo an obileato, Intoned by a hunt~-
ing horn. The tenor part was in the compe-
tent handsof Mr. Van Hooce. The orchestra

was not always pleasant to listen to; it wabbled |

unrhythmically in company with the organ,
and in the {ntroduction to the Gloria there
was no precision of attack However these
defects—and many others, too, did not blur the
beauty of Bach's long Gothic Une of barmony
And bow modern it all ist How moving, tender,
dramatic and emotional! It would be a great
thing for mate culture in this city if the Ora-

| Ilowever, ta addition to thie ataple buel
nese current reports disclose eporsd! pear
| chases of improved property for investment,
j partic larly of mereantilea properts whiet
has for montha at a tine been wholly absent

\ from the brokerag* news. Several store and
loft buildings in downtown wholesale districts
have within a fortieht been bought by in-
Veetors, some of Whom were owners of adjoln-
ing or neighboring premises, The prices pub}
lished in connection with these transactions
are siggestive of the general situation In the
| investment branch of the market. The aix-
5 warehouse No, 126 Bleecker street, for

example, this week sold at, it was said, $48,-
600, although transferred in 1890 for an ex-
pressed consideration of 675,000. Iast week
@ five-story warehouse in Houston atreet,
a block away, went at $55,900, which ten yeurs
ago brought $90,000, In 1890, lots In the vicinity
were quoted at $30,000 which three years before
j had been rated at $25,000, and the inflation in
this locality was more or less typical of the
condition of values throughout the city.
The industrial panic of 1803 olosed a decade
of unprecedented expansion In real estate,
an expansion which in the closing years of
} the period took on a highly speculative char-

acter. In the process of liquidation which
| followed enormous quantities of property have
| passed through foreslosure proceedings, and
it is estimated that s5 per cant. of this property
has been bought in by plaintiffs at the value
of the mortgage enoeumbrances. The liqul-
dation waa regarded as practically concluded
by the time of the consolidation of the greater
city, when the process was renewed @4 @ con-
esquence of the tremendous increase in the
city tax, However, two potent influences have
helped to modify the effect of liquidation on
land values, One of these waa the atrength of
the financial institutions which lend money
on rea) eatate, and the other was the reaurt
to new types of housiag—which, by providing
increased tenantry on a given lot, eerved more
or less effectually to maintain the ground rent
which the lot was capable of yielding. On the
other hand, the multiplication of modern
buildings which went on during that period of
low prices for materials and labor, resulted in an
undue depreciation in the value of the build-
inge of antiquated type, partly by depleting
their tenantry and partly by reduoing the rental
value of the square foot of housing. But
owing to the high cost of construction building
activity has now for a year or more been as
near to a standstill aa s possible ina great city,
while three or four years of expansion in popu-
lation and industry have eerrved to take up
much of the surplus housing,

During the past seven years of MHquidatton
and revolution in building construction there
has been no encouragement for the lovestor
to place money in real estate, except in the form
of a well-sequred mortgage. Now, however,
that the period of change and uncertainty is
over it ls possible once more to asseas accurately
the mean earning capacity of property and to
fix the purchase price acoordingiy, Owners
who have investment property to eel! are gene
erally willing to accept a price fairly represent-
ing present earving capacity, but up to now
intending purchasers have refused to buy exe
cept at prices heavily discounting possible
further contraction in rents, The elimination
of uncertainty as to renta and the fact that a
vast arnount of foreclosed property is offered,
in many tnstances at less than its intrinsio
value, are circumstances which cannot fall to
assert themselves with increasing force in the
investment branch of the market.

The ourrent brokerage reports also show
some tendency onthe partof builders to resume
work. But this work is directed more especially
to the completion of operations abandoned by
financially embarrassed predecessors and to-
ward the production of new housing {n localities
that have been recently neglected or where the
demand has caught up with the supply.
