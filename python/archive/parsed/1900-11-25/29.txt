GREAT CHINESE BOOK BI

(bout the time of mariniim danger the wind
Syddenly veered to the northwest, greatly en-
eouraging the firemen and their assistants
The structure next in fron! of the one pulled
down was flied with hookeasee containing
sone of the choicest volumes in the Han Tin
Vniversity, particularly a vast work called
after its Imperial patron, Yunw 14 Ta Teinl
a cyclopadia of Chinese literature of immenw
compass, never printed, but copied by hand.
‘This ie supposed to be the solecopy tn the Em-
pire, and, owing to the depredutions of un-
principled Han Lin scholars, was far from coui-
plete, for in China “he who steals a book i«
not a thief,” since literature is honorable, and
fits tools are often alike indispensable and un-
@t-ainable.

When it was probable that this building would
burn with the rest the contents of ifs boxes
wero unceremoniously tumbled into the yard
where wnany of thein were soon buned under
mounds of other books and lost to sight. Au
@itempt was made to rescue this great cvelo~
peedia of learning. but although several hun-
dred volumes were collected, many others
disappeared, some pit: hedinto the yard, where,
with bushels of orher voluines and maiu-
ecripts they were thrown into the lotus tank
and covered with rubbish 'o prevent them from
taking frein amass, Alu later period wher
they had been thoroughly soaked with water
from the fire engines aud by numerous rains
end had begun to rot, an order was issued
to heap earth upon thein to prevent them tron
infecting the neighborhood. Tne execution of
this command constituted the formal funeral
of ali that remained of the ancient Imperial
Academy of China’

In the entire area of the Han lin Yuan the
only buildings which escaped the fre were a
hall called the Ching € Ting Chow empty ea-
cept for eleven stone tablets on whieh are cat
the sayings of the sage Chieng tzu) and others
the hall containing the evelopwdia mentioned
and three amall pavilions behind it. The frat,
like several others, was <tored with Han Lin
essays and with the siereotype blocks of nue
merous Chinese works, especial!) poetry,

which, when ounce ignited, added greatly to |

the fury of the flames. ‘Those blocks whiet
remained were scattered about the premises
er were used as materials for barricades or
As flrewood.

FIGHTING TRE DANGBR OF FIKE

During this period of excitement! the ser-
vants’ quarters behind the Minister's house
were thought to be doomed, and moet of them
avcordinaly had their window and door-frames
knocked out and all their contents removed.
The dread of fire was so great that no place
for all thie material was thought to be safe
short of the canal, Armies of Chinese men
were engaged in furious demolition of wood-
work, while long lines of men, women and
bova made the long Journey to the front gate
with whatever they could anateh up, such as
door frames, blinds, boards and timbers, all
of which might much betier have been piled
up in some safe place for future use. Huce
armfuls of packing exceleior were borne tri-
umphantly to the distant canal, women tod-
died along with amal! baskets of horse fodder,

Fach day (here was @ gathering both of Chile
nese and foreigners upon the lawn, to examine
the growing pile of clothing and other stuff
brought into the legation under the regulation
previously referred to. This may be a fitting
opportunity to explain in detail the method
of dealing with confiscated goods The area
enclosed by the numerous legations being ex-
tenstve, it waa inevitable that many Chinese
families who had no connection either with
foreigners or with the Boxers should find them-
selves gradually encircled with troops, making
entrance and exit increasingly difficult, and a
prosecution of their ordivary business impos-
sible

The owners of two foreien stores on Le

visiting the stores became evident by the whis-
ting of bullets and the Killing of one of the
workmen the owner of the larger one gave
notice that whoever wished to take any of
the remaining articles was weleome to do

for a few days made looting legal, and so facili-

STORY OF HELP COMING

June 28—There is a story current
ing about a Chinese who has got through fromm
Tientsin, and who brings the word that our
relief army is starting “next Monday in three
columns" The country about Pekin is said
to be full of troops, and it is very difficult to
get in, and still more so to get out There
were six casualties yesterday, one fatal The
Chinese have got a gun in operation against
the Su Wang Fu, and are now throwing bombs
into it, so that gentlemen had to eo over to
get the schoolgirls out of a building which
was In danger, and is now affre. & French
marine Just brought in killed, and another
wounded. There are tow twenty-two cases
in the hospital, and the place is in considera-
able danger from the bullets, the windows
being blocked up with sand bags

Preparations are niade for a general attack
which is expected at noon, and there is vigor-
ous shooting for many hours Toward evening
an alarm is sounded of another @eneral attack,
When a gun opens fire on the house in the south
stables, The Italian wun is hurried over from
the Su Wang Fu. and taken up into the second
etory of the threatened building. The fire is
from the houses surrounding the open square
known as the Mongol Market, where the Chinese
have made a new gun platform. The build-
seemed about to be demolished, but the
attack suddenly ceased as suddenly as it be-

and was a complete failure All night long
there was a perpetual fusillade, so that it was

The twoestory building attacked

cannonade which need not be continued much
longer to bring the house entirely down, ‘There
were two guns at work of different calibre
Not all of the shells exploded, perhaps none
of them, but one killed @ inule whieh is to be

from the Fu to say that the shells have made
a large breach in the rear wall, and now in the
front one also ‘The gun is nearer, and the

seen in the Fu, which is found to be the great
rear hall, and which cannot be put out Amid
fierce yells of the Chinese soldiers, who see
victors in sight, the attaok is pressed One ot
the Japanese came over to the British lega-
tion from the Su Wang Fu to borrow some
fire extinguishers, and remarked that last night
when the Chinese came in the Japanese poured
hot water on them, and now he would like
