THB WHIPPING POST IN DELAWARE.

Nine Prisoners Whipped Yesterday, Inclading
Twe Boys. 15 and 17 Years of Age.
WILMINGTON, Del., Nov. 24.—Crowds of mor-
bid spectators found much to interest them at
the quarterly whippings of culprits in New
Castle jail yard to-day. The youthful prison-
ers who had their backs bruised by the eng
of the oat-o-nine-tails were John Auker, w!o
has not yet turned the age of 16, and Williar
Bradley, 17 years old. Each received ten bashes |
across the bared back, and after this mandate

 

of the Court had been carried out by Sherif |

‘Taylor the lads were led to cells to serve four
mowhs. This penalty they brought on them- |

selves for stealing three cases of perfume, ,

valued at $38. The goods were stolen from &
car of the Pennsylvania Railroad Company.
About 160 persons, aome of whom were woren,

and many visitors from other Statics, gathered |

inthe ‘all vard to witness the whippings

Auker was the first of the young culprits to

His alight form and youthful face caused pity
tor him. His eye was tearful, but his courage
was admirable. As Sherif ‘laylor began to
ply the cat across his bared back the muscles
of the boyish criminal quivered perceptibly.
although Sheriff Taylor plied the lash lightly,
great red welts were raised across the white
flesh, and in one place the te der flesh woe
broken. Young Auker bore his punishment
with fortitude, and did not utter @ complaint.

Bradie:, who ia three) ears older than Aujer
took his chastisement in the same cool manner
as his companion. Red tenme were fornid
