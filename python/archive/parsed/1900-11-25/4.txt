Joun HarsenRroapes,

The fact that the Chamber of Commerce
letter followed so quickly the Bishop's address
in St. Paul's Chapel was a mere coincidence
The question had been under discussion among
certain members of the Chamber of Commerce
for several days and the action taken was de
aided upon as early as Thursday Mr. Jacob
H. Schiff was one of the prime movers {n the
dm)! for a meeting, but all who were asked to
permit the use of their names on the circular

consented promptly

From conversation with several signers of
the circular yesterday !t was learned that no
definite plan of precedure has been decided

upon.
“1 do not think any of the gentlemen who
signed the invitation to the meeting has @ dis-
tinct idea as yet of at is to be dene or what
e best tobe done sald Mr J) Harsen Rhoades
evening hat will be left for the meeting
{tacif to decide. \Veall know Lhe state of affars
in the city, and while {t may be uncertain just
what we siould do, it is plain that it is high
time something was done There {3 4 feeing
that an investigation set on foot by Mr. Croker
is not sincere, that it Was started merely to
forestall other and more serious inquiries, and
that it would result at best only in the over-
bas of one litv for the purpose of cor-

meeting to eonsider
