THE RISK IN GUVERNMENT BONDS,

The collapse in Third Avenue Railroad stock
has, naturally, had an unfavorable effect upon
other stocks of a kindred character and upon
the industrials generally. People say to them-

selves that ifa concern which has so long en-
Joyed a reputation for wealth and solidity, and
which has had among ita directors men of so
high standing, can unexpectedly »rove to be
a hollow sham, others equally fair seeming
may turn out to be equally deeeptive, and that
it ia better to keep money out of them than to
put it into them, The great steam railroad
companies have, on the other hand, rather
gained than lost in publie estimation, and their

atocks Rave held up wonderfully agaiust the
adverse influence of the Third Avenue catas-
troplie, Inereased earnings ®y all of them are
reported, and a corresponding increase of their
dividends is expected,

No Jess surpAsing than the fall in Third
Avenue Railroad stock has been the recent
rise in Government bonds, The possibilities of
profit to the national banks offered by the re-
funding acheme of the proposed Ourrency Dill,
the passage of which by Congress seems now
to be assured, and which wore pointed out in
this column last Monday, have led to a sudden
and large demand for the bonds which it is
proposad by the bill to convert into thirty-year
2 percents receivable at par as security for
bank circulation. For the new 2 per cents, de-
liverable when Issued, 100 is freely bid, whieh
of course alds 6 per cent, to the value
of the bonds convertible into them, These
are the 5 per cents due in 1804, the
4 per cents due in 1907, and the 3%
per cents payable in 108, and they are
selling at figures on which they will yield,
if held to maturity, barely one per cent. per
annum. Even for the non-convertible 4s due in
11:25 the bid is about 147 '.,at which price they
pay only about 2 per cent, per annum to hold to
maturity,and for the few millions of 2 per
centa, payable at the pleasure of the Govern-
ment, 10% is bid without bringing out offers,
These quotations by no means indicate as
some people vainly imagine they do, the high
credit of our Government. They only show
thatthe national banks, being virtually allowed
to buy the 2 per cents with paper promises that
cost them nothing, can afford to give for them
very much more than they are worth as in-
vestments toe purchasers who have not the
same priviuese

Why the non-convertible 4s of 1995 shouil
command the price they do is not very clear
Tnvestors who buy them at that price will get
from the investment, as has been said, a pet
{income of only 2 percent, per annum, andthe
profiton therm as security for bank circulation
is notonly small, but precarious, The money
required to buy one $1,000 bond of 18125, say

€1.575, will vield, iflent at 4 per cent. $55 per
annum, The bond itself will yield only $27.50,
and the $1000 of currency issued upon it,

deducting the 5 per eent. redemption fund and
the tax ot one-half of one per cent. will vield,
atd percent. only $33 more, making 608 0
altogether, orcnly $7.50 more than could
got forthe money the bond will eost. This is
assuming that the enrreney can Le lent out at
4percent. tut if the rate should drop to$
per cent. the total yield to the bank would be
reduced aceordingly

However this may be, the fact rematns that
the national banka are in the market for Gov-
eromont bonds at prices which few investors,
if any, can afford to pay Should the banka
absorb the bonds up tothe full limitof thar
capitals. as the new currency bill permits, they
Will take at least $508,000,000 of them, and, if
the provision for aatablishing in small towne
banks with capitals of $25,000 has the effect
expected from it, the amount may be consi ler-
ably inereased, In anv event, Government
bonds will cease to be desirable as investments
except by the banks, and the interesting ques-
tion arises: What willtheir present holders,
and those who would otherwise become
holders of them, do? Apparently, they will
peek other investments, and in that event,
what will they find that will sati<fy them’

The problem is of special interest in this
Ktate, to trustees under wills and other inatru-
ments whose powers of investment are restrict-
ed either by the terms of their trusts or by law
hiity vears ago, when it was easy to get 7 per
cent. on bond and mortgage of real estate and
Hood pereent. on Government and New York
State bonds, creators here of trusts of personal
Pfoperty usually gave no directians respecting
the manner of investing it, and our
ruledthat In the absamee of such directions
trust funds could not be invested otherwise
than on bond and mortgage of real estate and
in bonds of this State and of the United States,
exceptat the personal risk of the trustees, In
one case, indeed, the executors of a will
Were hell by the Court of Appeals responsible
for a loss fnourred by their not promptly
felling stocks owned by the testator
at the time of ha death, and investing
the proceeds as tha law preseribed, This
decision led to the insertion by our lawyers in
Willsand other instruments creating trusts of
personalty, of permission to trustees to go for
{nvestments outside of the class required by
the courts, but with carefully drawn limits to
their powers in this respect. In the case of
eavings banks, insurance companies and other
fiduciary institutions acts have been passed by
our Legisiature extending the range of invest-
ments allowed them, sothat now first mortgage
bonds of railroal companies not only of this
but of other States are included within it.
Brill, oven under these more liberal conditions,
the demand for investments suitable for trust
money hasinthis market driven up the price
ofthem until they yield only 3‘. and 3 per
cent, perannum, Tf, now,.the proceeds of some
hundreds of millions of Government bonds
held by truetees and institutions are also to
seek reinvestment, there is no telling what the
effect wi!l be

Judging from the experience of the past the
way things will work will probably be this:
The present holders of Government bonds,
Outside of the national banks, will, sooner or
later, ba tempted by the high prices offered for
them, to sell them and look for other invest-
ments. They will select the safest and best
raliroad, municipal and eorporation bonda,
and bid forthem prices at which their holders
will, in turn, be tempted to letthem go. They
will also take the risk of taxation and offer io
lend money on bond and mortgage of real es-
tate at alightly lower rates than borrowers are
now paying, with the result that the present
lenders wil! accept a return of their money
rather than consent toa reduction of their in-
eome. In this way there will be let loosen mass
of money for investment in what are now
regarded second and third class securities
which will materially ladvance their price and
create in them a lively speculation

An illustration of what is likely to take place
is furnished by the results of the Government
bond purchases just before the crash of 18u3,
During the twelve years beginning on July 1,
187, the vear of the great refunding into the
4a of 1907, the total amount of theae purchases
was $1,187,000,000, or at the rate of nearly
$100,000,000 a year. This, too, it must also be
remembered, does not represent the whole of
the money disbursed for the purpose, since
Jarge premiums were pail on many of the
tonds, those on the 4 per cents of 107, having
been, in 1480, as much as 30 percent. which,
however, is lesa than the 37°. per cent. premi-
um now bid for the 44 of 1925, which have only
twenty-five yearsto run. against the twenty-
eight years which the 4s of 1107 had in 1889,

The $1,200,000,000 and upward thus paid
to Government bondholders frem 1870 to
1891 was obtained from the people by taxa-
tion, and was, therefore, a real addition to the
wealth of the country. It represented that
amount of excess of production over con-
sumption, since taxes cannot be paid from any
other source, How greatly the pouring of this
flood of wealth into the hands of the sel ers of
the bonds stimulated euterprise and led to
speculation the record shows. Thousands of
milea of new railroads were built; new mines
were opened and old ones extended, towns
were laid out and Jots in them sold at fancy
prices; and induatrial undertakings were
lauached, not indeed on the colossal scala of
the great trusts of 1896 and 1800, but still on
one groat enough to bring on, in the autumn
of 1800, a revulsion, whieh would have been
Mose d'sastrous than It was Dut forthe opera-

tbe

eourta

tion of the Shermen act, which, by creating
$54,000,000 of fresh currency a year, staved
off the final crash until 1803

An illustration of a similar kind of earlier
date but equally instructive, is fvrnished by
the experience of Great Britain .n ‘824 and
1825, The enormoua public debt of th. country
Contracte! for the prosecution of the wars
Against Napoleon Bonaparte had been bearing
interest at 5 and 4 percent., but in 1824 the rate
on £70,000,000 of it was reduced to 3% per cent,
and payment of the principal offered to the hold-
ers who would not consent to the reduction,
Those who aceepted the offer of payment went to
work to reinveat the money, and the result was
an era of wild speculation inall sorts of bubbles,
until, finally, in December, 1825, a crash came,
which nearly bankrupted the Bank of Eng-
land, The severity of the catastrophe was
intensifled by the failure of hundreds of little
country banks, which had iseued against their
Assets on the plan now advocated by some
eelf styled currency reformers, millions of
pounds of notes which they could not redeem
when the pinch came, This fact led to the
suppression in England and Wales of all bank
currency excepting that of the Bank of Eng-
land and to the restriction of its issue in Seot-
land and Ireland to the few banks then in
existence, In England and Wales too, the
notes of the Bank of England have ever since
been limited to denominations of £4 and
upward, all currency of less denominations
being of gold, silver and copper.

Forewarned, forearmed, An intelligeateom-
munity like ours ought not to be the victim of
the deceitful show of prosperity which the new
currency bill tends to create, but as Dr. John-
eon said ef secoad marriages, hope triumphs
over experience, “The thing that hath been,
it is that which shall be, and that which {s done
is that which sho!l be done, and there is no new

thing under the sun,”
