SINKING FUND

The attention of investors is called to the very strong Sinking Fund provision to
retire this issue of bonds, It provides for the payment to the trustee of $95,000 per
annum, payable semi-annually. This money is to be invested by the Trustee in
Denver and Southwestern Bonds at a price not above 110 and interest, such bonds to
remain uncancelled in the Sinking Fund; or, in case bonds are not obtainable at the
price of 110 and interest, then in bonds of the United States or of the State of New
York or Massachusetts,

The interest accruing on the bonds thus purchased is to be added to the semi-
annual payment into the Sinking Fund and invested in turn in like manner,

From the total issue of Denver & Southwestern Bonds of $5,500,000 $577,000 have
been reserved to redeem the same amount of Midland Terminal Bonds, which have
also their own sinking fund calculated to retire them before maturity; therefore,
whether or not all or any part of the $577,000 Midland Terminal Bonds (reduced since
January 1 to $560,000), are exchanged for an equal amount of Denver & Southwest-
ern Bonds, the sinking fund of the Denver & Southwestern Bonds has to take care of
only $4,923,000 of Denver & Southwestern Bonds,

Asauming the Trustee can obtain bonds at 110 and interest, the following state-
ment shows approximately, at intervals of five years, the amount of bonds which
will have been retired :

1929.......-.--... 4,939,000

Nore—If bonds can he obtained at any time at a price below 110, the issue will
be retired even more rapidly. If not obtainable at 110, the retiring will be propor-
tionally retarded,

LEGALITY

All legal questions incident to the formation of the above corporation, also all
questions as to the legality of the provislons of the mortgage, have received the
approval of Messrs. Storey, Thorndike & Palmer of Boston, and Messrs. Carter &
Ledyard of New York. Acopy of thelr opinions will be submitted on application,

E SHIPMENTS OF COPPER ORE

 

DURING THE WINTER,

 

Unfounded Charges of Manipulation of the
Copper Supply—Lost Cripple Creek Veins
Recovered—-A Big Supply of Ore on
the Docks of the Lake Iron Regton,

Hovouton, Mich., March 1.—All-rail ship-
ments of copper are heavier now than at the
beginning of the winter season, and the open-

last spring, The Calumet and Hecla fs accu-
mulating the usual winter store of crude cop-
per for summer shipment to the Eastern
smelters, but beyond this, little metal Is re-
maining inthe Lake Superior copper district,

The commercial position of the metal ts
strong, with every promise of rematning 80,
The advance in price which began nearly two
years ago, was not due to manipulation, as ts
still believed in Europe and frequently echoed
on this side of the Atlantic. The visible sup-
ply of copper In the world was gradually re-
duced from 180,000 tons to the small figure of
80,000 tons, which is less than the actual con-
sumption of six averago weeks, The great
awakening in American Industry, beginning
two years ago, was coincident with increased
activity in Europe, and copper joined tron,
steel, tin, zine aud nearly every other metal in
a sensational advance, Iron and steel doubled
thetr prices and so did copper, though It has
now receded to 16 cents per pound, around
which figure {t will probably remain for at
least two years to come,

There has been manipulation in the copper
mining shares, but there is a lack of evidence
of like action in the actual mining or market.
ing of the metal. Thereare no large surplus
stocks of metal piling up at any point in the
world. There {a no evidence that large inter-
ests have bought copper at any time to sustain
prices. The metal is being absorbed by
manufacturers as rapidly as prodaced,

That the present price cannot be perma-
nently held is altogether probable, but the
break will not come until! production begins
gaining materially on consumption. When
thia will happen no man can foretell, but pres-
ent conditions and prospects indicate that it
will be several years before the many new
mines can add $0 materially tothe world’s cop-
per supply as to disturb the nice balanes pow
existing between the mining and the use of the
metal,

Of all the new mines of the Lake Superior
district into which millions have been poured
in the past three years, the entire number will
not produce 2 per cent. of the copper mined in
the district. It will be three to five years be-
fore the production of the new mines col-
lectively will add appreciably to the tonnage of
the district, The opening of new native copper
mines in the Lake Superior distriot is a matter
of years of time and millions of dollars, Copper
ore nines in other American flelds are also
slow and costly in development.

According to the most reliable figures at
hand, which are fair approximations though
not authoritative, the world’s copper produc.

with 424,000 tons In 18%, while the output of
the United States was 205,000 tons in 18i4+as
compared with 264,000 tons forthe preceding
year. This gives anincrease of 13 percent, in
the output of the United States and of 12 per
cent. for the entire world, the United States
making over 55 percent. of the copper of the
world,

Anefforthas been mato by the European
trade and financial press to prove the charge
of manipulation of the metal because of the
importation of copper from England and Wales
to this country at the same time that America
waa exporting half her own copper product to
the various Furopean markets, The currents
and cross-currents of finance and commerce
are puzzling, but the facta do not warrant the
above charge. The exports of American cop-
per, both native from the lake and electrolytic
from Montana, as well asthe bilster copper and
mattes from other Western flelds, which go to
Swansea for smelting, are permanent exports,
and the copper go sent out does not come baek,
Copper brought to New York from Great Br t-
ain jis all, or practically all, in. the shape of
Chili bars, These are supposed to be refined
copper and, for all practical uses, are “G. M.1.,"
as “good merchantable brands” of refined ¢
per are known to the trade, Industrially, tt
Chiltan bars areg copper, but metallurgy!
cally, they are impure, containing a consider.
able quantity of silver, which the smelters of
Swansea cannot extract from the baser metal,
These Chili bars have been brought io
this country by thousands of tons inthe past
few months and have been refined, electrolyt-
foally, at Perth Amboy, N.J,. where consider-
able silver has been obtained. The bars are
used as anodes, and by the procese of electri-
cal separation and deposition, every particle
of metal istaken from the anode, through the
acidulated water of the electrolytic tanks, and
the copper redeposited on the eathode, while
the silver is precipitated to the bottom and
later recovered by reagents, America has been
sending such vast quantities of foodstuffs and
manufactures to Europe, and especially to
Great Britain, for the past two years that
home-bound freights have ruled very low, and
the owners of the steamships have been very

lad to obtain bulk ireight, where otherwise

aliast must have been joaded. This has made
cheap fretghts onthe Chili bars, and the silver
hus been obtained in such quantity that the
venture has been a highly profitable one. The
importations have been made by Lewisohn
Bros. of 81 Fulton atreet, New York, and_it is
at their electrolytic refining plant at Perth
Am boy that the bars have been refined.

This successful venture {n copper refining,
no’ only explains one of the features of the
copper trade which has greatly puzzled many
etudents, and which has done much to bolster
up the belief in manipulated prices, but It also
gives an additional proof of the great strides in
commerce and industry Which have been made
by the United States during the past few vears,
The refiners of Swansea have led the world in
metallurgy for the past century, and the ability
of American metallurgists to take the flaished
work of Welsh smelters, and by further pro-
cesses derive a handsome profit therefrom
shows a wonderful stride forward,

Was oneof the first big mines of the camp
During eighteen months ending in PRu8 the

mine paid $240,000 tn dividends. Paris capl-
talists bought it about that time for $1,250,000,

Soon afterward the vein was lost. Simonton
& Penrose, lessees, after expending $17,000,
have encountered a vein which may prove to be
the one lost,

The Pharmacist mine, Cripple Creek's first
shipper and dividend payer, lost its veln in
1802, after paying $84,000 In dividends, No
ore of much value was encountered until this
week, when the Murphy lease opened @ veln
which has yielded $800 a ton assays, The vein
has been proved up gome distance and is bo-
lieved to be the loat one,

A similar experience has recently occurred
in the once great Doctor mina, A year ag the
last Jack Pot vein. was found, enabling thirty
lessees of Creston, Ia,, to distribute $500,000 In

ALASKA,

Searrie, Wash,, Fob, 26.—J. B. Zim bars, ina
letter from Cape Nome, under date of Dec. 15,
says toone of his partners who returned last fall
with the intention of going back in the spring
with mining machinery: “You did not see half
the greatness of the country, W hen the thaw
came we finished our rocker and in four days
cleaned up $300. One of the companies oper-
ating near us with a sluice rocker, took out
nearly $4,000 inthe same time, We have also
taken up three claims at Cape York which give
great promise, We thawed the gravel on these
claims with @ brush fire, and got nuggets as
large as the ends of one’s fingers. We have
bought a fraction on Anvil Creck that prospects
from @> cents to $1500 pan, This is our luck-

jest find, When you return bring all tho mas

here, and this is the kind of machinery we
want, With good machinery we can get all the

to Cape York cost $250," .

A special edition of the Nome Ners, printed
Nov. 25, gives details of the situation along
various creekstothat date, This paper suys:

“The beach diggings are only an incident of
tho discovery of gold on Behring Sea. The
greatest golden wealth, by far, will be pro-
duced from its hundreds of creeks found in the
various mining distriets already organized, It
is but just to state thatthe discovery of the
phenomenally rich beach diggings prevented
much development work being done on many
creeks that) would have otherwise been
thoroughly prospected, Enough was done,
however, to demonstrate that. In this section
are creeks that rival those of the famed Klon-
dike,

“After Anvil, Glacier and Snow, so far better
developed, Dexter and Dry Creeks are among
the most promising. On both work will com-
mence early next spring to take advantage of

NEARLY READY FOR LAUNCHING,

The 46-Foot Cutters May Go Overboard

This Week.

Briator, March 4.—Work on the two 46-foot
cutters ig being pushed by a swarm of mee
chanics. The main object isto get them overe
board tn order to begin work on two other 70»
footers, Leas than one month ago the 40.
footers were begun, and to-day the planks are
fitted and fastened to points above the water
line, Their dimensions are now known. It is
learned that the over-all length is 74 feet,
length on the Joad water line, 40 feet, and
breadth of beam, 14 feet Sinches, There is
enough known about the draught to say that
it will be 12 feet & inches,

In making comparisons between the new
ciuss and those of the Gloriana and Syce it is
notleed that all the principal dimensions in the
new boats are greater than in those named,
The Gloriana 8 dimensions are nearer those of
the new class than are those of the Syce or
Kestrel, According to Manning's list the
Gloriana is 70 feet over all, 45 feet on the water
line, 13 feet beam and 10 feet draught. This
| shows an increase of overtiang in favor of the
new class of % feet. In comparison with
the Gardner cutter Syco the new cutters are
| 6 feet longer over all, 1 foot longer on the water
line, 2 feet 2 inches greater in beam dimene
gions an 12 feet 2 inches greater draught. The

new boate will carry a spread of canvas exe
ceeding 4,000 square feet,

Herman bb. Durvea of Glen Cove is to have

siderable notoriety of late vears in the handling
of hia So-footer Vaquero TLL. whieh was

these waters Duryea has handled the Vaquero
and fluisbed a winner of frat prizes. The
double skin of the 4(-footers consists of
a halfinch layer of cedar inside the outer hard

ne planks, It extends from the turn of the
Bilnes or just below them, to a point above the
waterline, The boats will be nearly ready for
launching at the enLofthis week,

A smatier class of racing craft was begua
here during the past week. They are 20-
