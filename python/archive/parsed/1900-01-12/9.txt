‘WANAMAKER'S  -WANAMAKER'S

—

Men’s Mackintoshes, $6.59. There's much we might tell about ” them—bat what’s the use?
Our guarantee is broad, and livel up to. Men's Gooda--Ninth stree} side.

The Cheapest Store in New York

HERE'S a wide difference between the light, jerky train on a narrow-
gauge railroad and the heavy ‘‘limited’’ that skims smoothly along at
sixty-five miles an hour. And the difference is not offset by the price

of the ticket. The limited is really the cheaper—in time-saving, security
and comfort.

The Wanamaker Store and railroads have points of similarity. The
heavy, secure and really cheap road has flower beds and beauty along its
path, The store is beautiful. The poor railroad and the ordinary store are |
skimpy. Great stocks—ample selections—characterize the Wanamaker system.

The hot-box of haste and carelessness are unknown here.

Which sort of store do you take stock in ?

Personal responsibility—hold us to it. One buys at a ‘‘cheap’’ store
in the unacknowledged belief that the customer is smartest—that one gets
the best of it. But do you? And when, too late, the purchase turns out
badly, the iauiea you take is, ‘*Well, I didn’t pay much.’’ If anything
from this store fails to please, bring it back. Hold us to our promise—

‘‘Reliable goods only, at the least cost; anything (barring certain ar-
ticles not exchangeable, for reasons of safety to health, and daintiness)
returnable for cheerful re-imbursement, if uninjured. ’’

Wanamaker’s is the safest, cheapest store in New York. And thou-

sands have proved it.

Rubber Shoes--Men’s and Women’s

How good? Thats hould be first thought in buying rubbers. If a
pair bought here ‘‘goes wrong” ‘it is because of some defect we couldn’t
find out in advance—an accident of manufacture—and the loss is ours. For
we want you to fetch a poor pair back,

Men’s Rubbers, high or low cut, 75ce.
Women’s Rubbers, ‘‘storm’’ cut, or as low as you please, 50c.

And every right sort of Arctic, Alaska and boot is here, as well.
Sold in regular shoe store. And, for convenience, in the Bargain Store
on fifth floor—not deceptively, but to save time and trouble.
