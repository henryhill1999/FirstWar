OONSTRUES THE ab08 Laws,

 

Mavor of Norwalk Tells What May and What
May Not Be Done There on Sunday.

Norwata, Cono., Jao, 11.—Mayor Charles
G, Bohannon of South Norwalk, started
this morning on a foxshunting trip, but
before he left town he gave Chief
ot Police Vollmer instructions about en-
forcing the Sunday law next Sunday, The
Mayor's interpretation of the law § {s
peculiar, According to the instructions
recelved by Chief of Police Vollmer the
Mayor considera that Sunday shaving,
the sale of soda water, ginger pop and ice
cream and the biacking of boots are necessary,
Places selling newapapers may remain open,
for the Mayor would not miss his Sunday
nowspaper any more than he would hie Sun-
day shave, The mayor thinks that cigars and
fruits are entirely unnecessary on Sunday, and
consequently stores where these articles are
bold will have to be closed or the showcases
sealed by the police, The Mayor wants this
part of the law enforced rigidly and has in-
structed the Chief of Police to have all viola-
tions prosecuted promptly

Another feature of the Mayor's order ia that
barber shops must not try to attract customers
and will be obiiged to have the curtains drawn
if there is any one inside to get barbered, The
drug stores, of course, are allowed to keepopen,
How this corresponds with the original stand
taken by the Mayor can best be appreciated by
the following quoration from his recent mese
sage:

“As the executive officer of the city it is par-
tleularly incumbent upon me to see that obedt-
ence is rendered to law and the public order is
preserved. Among the statutes of this
state is one whieh requires that upon the
first day of the week all secular affairs, the
continuance of which is not made impera-
tive by virtue of thelr nature, conditions
or relations, be suspended. Phe enforcemeut
of the law is demanded by @ majority of our
fellow citizens. If this contention be sane-
tioned by good reason, it admits of no question
by those who accept the public trust and as-
sume to bear the symbols of publeoflea All
Christendom proclaims he who violates the
Lord's day denies the resurrection, A particu.
lar result of the observance of the Lord’s day
by the great body of Christian people
{fs a considerable cessation oof buses
neas and consequent freedom from toil,
He who avails himself of this faet and makes
use of this conference of freedom in dotne
Violent ee tothe davis without regard for the

rights of his follows and unmindfal of his own
duty as a citize

Several of the cigar dealera have deetded to
teat the new rule as preseribed by the Mayor
and will conduct a wholesale soda water busi-
ness on Sunday, giving away 1 cigar with every
} glass of soda water, They gay their attorney

has advised them that they cannot he prose.

cuted aevording to the Mayor's ediet for selling
soda water, and that there is no law which will
prevent them from giving away their cigars.

that Capt, Willeoeks was not disposed to fur-
nish the required detail, and hae so stated,

Willeocks that he ia relieved from command of
his company and that he is under military are
rest. ‘ell Lieut, Willeoeks, the next senior, to

) have the detail of men ordered from Company
