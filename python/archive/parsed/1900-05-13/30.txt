A tenewed decline {n cotton meant simply that fine
weather was reported at the South, that the cables
were lower and that Wall Street was still liquidating
August. The South, too, was selling the new crop
months on the strength of the fine weather Europe
bought them to some extent. The speculation was
still dull and so was spot cotton, while @ feature not
to be ignored is the dulness and depression in most
descriptions of textile goods The strength of the
statistical position, however, may be gathered from
the fact that the visible supply isonly 2,234,701
bales against $3,548,734 ro ago. It has fallen off
within aweek 118,400 bales. Port stocks are only

LIPTON MAY WAIT A YEAR,

Talks About Not Challenging Mor Cap Until
War Is Over.

From the Boston Herald,

Guascow, May 11.—-Sir Thomas Tipton ar-
rived here this morning and bad a conference
with the Glasgow Exhibition Committee. When
the formal request was made of him that he
postpone his challenge for the America’s Cup
until 1902, in order that his yachts, the Sham-
rock and Erin, might be raced here next year,
he replied that he would very much Ike to do
so, but he hod made his arrangements. Then
personal requests were made of such strength
that he wavered abit and delayed giving the
conumittee a definite answer. He wil! consult
his confidential advisers before making another
move,

I saw Sir Thomas after the meeting ended,
and asked him if he would change his plans, He
replied

“The unexpected prolongation of the war has
upset all my plans, and I am not now positive
whether I shall go ahead with the challenge for

1901, though it is extremely likely that I shall
hold to my. first intention. Lam gong to give
the committee's request serious thought, and
yi forward them an answer inside of ten
days."

T Jearn that Sir Thomas isin close ecommuni-
eation with Designer George L. Watson He
met Watson to-day and sought the latter s ad-
vice asto his proper course. There canbe no
doubt about an order having been placed with
Watson for a challenger, but before settling
down toany fixed idea of designs Watson is
anxious to see how bis newest racing yawl, the
Svbarita, performs with the cutters in ber class,
with whiok shesails undera shorter measure-
menton accountof the rigs. Watson hopes for
great things from the Sybarita, He fancies her
immensely, and believes that a properly de-
signed yawl can come close on actual sailing to
acutter. Ifthe Sybarita comes up to his ex-
pectations, he may settle on a yawl

Sir Thomas was with Designer Watson sev-
eralhours. Mr, Watson advised him to go
thead with his challeng:+ for next year, and
this ady omy opinion, will more than off-
set all ie great pressure of the committee

After Sir Thomas had left Designer Watson,
TL had a second interview with him, and he was
not so unecertainas he was earlier in the day
Watson had used stron arguments in favor of
challenging for the cup next year, though he
would not state definitely what type of yacht
he would plan for the challenger

another contest under conditions similar to
those that governed the last contest. The
challenge was to havet sentin August, so
that the date for the es could be fixed
earlier in the season than they were in 1899
The continued calm weather that we had in
August thoroughly disgusted every one and in
order to prevent a repetition of the disappoint-

on the other side look brighter than thev do at

no improvement in trade, then Sir Thomas will

The Most Useful Pistol,
From the New Orleans Times Democrat.
“The best sort of a pistol for a man to carry,
{f he has to carry 4 weapon at all," said a former
reeident of Texas, who has seen a good deal
of wild life along the frontier, “is a ‘44’ or ‘45,’
with not over a two-inch barrel. A genuine
British ‘bulldog’— not one of the cheap Amer-
jean imitat but the real thing—comes
nearest being the {deal weapon for the pocket
{f one anticipates trouble.”
“But those old cannon don't shoot accurately
for any distance,” objected a listener
“IT know they don't,” replied the ax-Texan,
“but lonse-distance marksmanship seldom euts
anv flugure in a personal encounter In nine
cases out of ten the men are too close together
to miss, and it’s net a question of fine shooting

but quick shor ‘

 

Thrice armed is he who hath his quarrel just

But four times he who gets his gun out fust
That's a frontier proverb. A bulldog can be
pulled twiee as quick as a long-barrelled pistol,
and then, again, siippose your antagonist tries
to wrench it out of vour hand: he has nothin
to tale hold of but that inch or two of barrel,
and you can blow his hand off by simply pulling
the trigger. It ts almost impossible to dis-
arm a man who uses 4 bulldog, but I bave seen
navy revolvers torn out of man’s grasp more
than once In hand-to-hand flgh

“My reason for saying the caliber ought to
be 44 or 45 ie because the impact of a ball of
that size is so terrifle that it paralyzesthenerve
centres and puts a fighter instantly out of ac-
tion, no matter where it hite him. On the con-
trary, astrong man ray be drilled through and
through with a 32 and keep right on doing ex-
ecution A hig,
straight enough for close work, and if yon ara
far enough away to make marksmanship nee-
essary vou are far enough away to run and
keep out of trouble.”

AT COLUMBIA,

ATHLETICS AT

TRACK TEAM ROUNDING INTO SHAPE
TO MEET PRINCETON,

The Crews Which Will Row Against the Naval
Cadets at Annapolis Next Saturday Are
Soon to Be Selected-Colambia Wins the
Intercollegiate Comparative Strength Test,

Columbia's track team at Williamsbridge is

rapidly rounding into shape for its coming
meeta The team as now composed is
the strongest that has been turned out
from the university since the ‘sos, when
Columbia was acoustomed to win the in-
tereollegiata games with persisient regu-
larity. With the general athletic awaken-
ing occasioned by the successes of the
football team, Capt. J. Boyce Smith, Jr, ‘Ot, re-
solved to build up track athletics at the untver-
sity and his efforts have met with a marked de-
gree of success. Atthe beginning of the sea-
80n Maxwell W. Long was the only man in the
intercollegate class, but almost two hundred
candidates turned out for the various events,
some of whom have developed unexpected
form

The team ts especially strong this year in the

sprints, Long ran the hundred in 10 1-5

seconds Jast week against the wind, and his

Quarter in 601-5 seconds at the University of

Pennsylvania games gives promise of his reach-

ing his record of 49 1-5 seconds for the distance,

by the time of the intercollegiate games.

Young Weekes,

hundred, but it is feared that his crew
work will bind his running muscles, P. M.
Lennox, the Colorado man in the school of
medicine and HS. Johnson, '02, are also good
men in the sprints, H. A Morgan, ‘03, A
Wortmann, ‘03, the former fast interscholastic
runner,and H. R. Steeves, ‘03, are second string
then

In the middie distances the squad is not so
fortunate. GC. Atkins, who ran so well dur-
ing the winter, haus been compelled to stop

tism Perhaps the best man in the half-mile is

dates forthe quarter-mile and half-mile runs
are Delgado, ‘01, who Was placed in bothevents
at the last Knickerbocker A. C. gates, Bateson,
Halsey, Meehan, Ward, Harran, Dorman and
Van Cise, Whoran on the local relay team at
Old Penn's tleld day
The long-distance squad has been severely
handicapped by the loss of Mosenthal, who has
represented the university for four years and
whose record for the mileis 4.94, and Clark,
1900, almost as fast, both having retired on ac-
stress of university work, Cald-
and Duden, 1900, are
trio, however Caldwell ran_ first
colunbia team in the inter- |
collewiate eountry contest and won |
the mile in both the sophomore-freshman |
andthe annual spring games, He has a beau-
tifuletride and is full of grit, but his compar-
ative youth does not afford sufficient strength
for long-distance running. Tratner Mack he-
lieves that in a year or so Caldwell will prove to
beastarman. ‘Thurston hasrun the mile and
two miles fora number of years and © ips off
a number of seconds from his reeord each
sueceeding year. Duden broke the college two
mile record last week, covering the distance in |
10 qninutes 88 seconds. He formerly put the
shot and was alt tunheard of as a runner un-
tilhisadmirable run. For other distance men
the team can call on Dixon, 01, Ward, ‘01
Burns, '08; Iwlehart, ‘02, Morley, ‘02; Lunt, ‘03
The hardest blow of the year to the team
caine when Barker, ‘Ol, was taken il with ty-
phoid fever Last year he won both theh
and low hurdies for Columbia in the Princeton
games and qualified in the intercollegiate
finals. As this was his first year at the event, he
was expected to show rouch development this
spring, and he was hurdiing in excellent form
when takenill © A, O'Rourke, the late inter

and perhaps the only one who can be counted
on to win points for the tean

Considerable strength has been addedin the
fleld events. Welles, ‘01, established a hammer
record on May 4 with a throw of 133 feet 8%, |
inches, and js confident of reaching 140 feet by
the time of the intercollegiates. Bruce, ‘01,
and Mahan, ‘02, are both throwing around 110
feet and Duden, 1900 and Stewart, ‘01, closely fol-
low. Columbia is counting on two places {fn |

A. Wright, the massive football centre, and S
P. Nash of theerew are leading the shot-put-
ters, Wright having passed 40 feetand Nash
having made a puto! 38 feet 11 inches. Stewart,

Columbia bas been proverbially weak in the
jumps,and ths year |8 no exception to the
rule There are several fairly good men, but
their good performances are uncertain and
spasmodic

The team is in quarters at Columbia Oval,
Wilhamsbndge, and Tramer Mack is looking
out for its welfare. On Saturday the first im-
sortant meet will be held with Princeton at Co-
fambta Fleldand from the showing made then |
by the different men the intercollegiate team |
will be picked, ManagerShoemaker is also try-
ing toarrange a dual meet with Syracuse Uni |
versity, to be held at Syracuse on dune 2 |

Within a day or two the Columbia crews to
row against Annapolis on next Saturday wil
be selected by Dr. Peet The work has been |
awain transterred to the Harlem on account of
the rough water on the Hudson, and the
stretches and rigging of enc h eandidate |
have been adjusted until his oar enters |
and leaves the water at a certain angle

Dr. Peet has outlined the main faulte of each |
candidate as follows; Bradley varies as to the
length of his body swing toward the bow, some- |
times swinging too far and sometimes not |
enough: Burt has atendency to rowin the air |
atthe beginning of his stroke, and shortens
after rowing some distance, Boyeson
not finish his stroke hard, Coerr is not!
careful enough of lis side on the recover and
does not sit upafter rowing a distance, Fal- |
coner Jumps at the beginning of his stroke, and
does not run One part of tue stroke into the
other smoothly enough. Heis inclined to get
his blade too deep, Gilsey does not situp at the
end of his etroke, and rows in the air at the be-
ginning, Heroy does notsit up after rowing a
distance: Huffaker pauses on. the recover and
hangs onthe full reach, which makes him be- |
hind time at each stroke; Irvine rows in the air
at the beginning ofeach stroke and does not
asitup well |

Jackson rushes his slide on the recover and |
does not run one part of the stroke into the
other smoothly enough; Lawrence Jumps onthe
beginning too much and carries his arms straight
too long on the stroke, This takes away from |
the hard finish Mackay does not get bevel |
enough with his blade; Maclay does not |
sawing straight fore and aft, and has not
enough firmness when getting toward to
full reach: Mount does not get bevel enough, |
rows jn the air at the beginning of his
stroke, and pulls himself out of shape at the
end of the stroke; Morley is troubled with hi
blade work, does not situp, and shortens hi
stroke, Nash rows fu the air at the beginning
of hisstroke, and has a tendeney to meet his
oar, Oddie goes too far toward the bow with
his body and settles at the end of the stroke
Southack shortens his stroke and rows inthe
airat the beginning, Vulte ia jerky at the end
of the stroke: Weekes goes too far toward the
bow with his shoulders and is short in his
reach

Dr Peet summedupthe main fauits he has
had to contend with as follows: A tendeney to
shorten the atroke inthe waterby rowing i
the air at the beginning of the stroke and row
ing out at theend of the. stroke, feathering
under water and rushing the slides on the re-
cover when the stroke is rai-ed

Word from Harvard was received yesterday
to the effect that Columbia had won the inter-
collegiate comparative strength test competi-
tion, thus wresting the championship from the
Cambridge tniversity Columbia's total of
40.4890 4 kilograms for her fifty strongest men
was 40524 points more than Harvard's
winning score of last vear and 9,298.4 polnts
better than her own score ir iso Har-
vard won seeond place with a total
of 53,078 points, 1,701 points worse than was
made last vear. The University of Minnesota |
has taken third place from Amhersi, scoring
