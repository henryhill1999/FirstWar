PROSPECT rv
SOUTH
NE of the prettiest sights at PROSPECT PARK SOUTH
this Spring is a Butterfly bed of tulips, now in full bloom.

The design was originally used at Clifton Park, Baltimore,

where it was planted under the direction | f N. F. Britton, Su-

perintendent, and formed one of the greatest attractions ever shown by

the Park, being visited by thousands from Baltimore and vicinity.

While the one planted at PROSPECT PARK SOUTH is of the same
dimensions, a somewhat larger number of bulbs have been used.

The Floral Butterfly measures seventy-six feet from tip to tip of
wings, and the head and body are in true proportion. Some idea of
the size of the insect may be gathered from the fact the antennae are
about ten feet in length, Nature has been adhered to as closely as pos-
sible in the reproduction of the colors of the Butterfly. The bulbs
were a special importation from Holland through Weeber & Don,
of New York, and the work was done under the supervision of
Mr. John Aitkin, landscape gardener of PROSPECT PARK SOUTH.

Five thousand bulbs in all were used in the construction of the mam-
moth insect, divided as follows: 230 Vermillion Brilliant, 2,380 Belle
Alliance, $65 La Reine, 1,825 Chrysolora.

The design is worth traveling many miles to see, The bed stands
at the corner of Albermarle and Rugby Roads, (F. 14th Street.)

VISITORS should take the Kings County Elevated
(Brighton Beach Division) and get off at Beverly
Road, PROSPECT PARK SOUTH.
