KILLED IN A TUNNEL WRECK.

Wreng Signal Causes a Fatal Accident ia
Philadelp'

PHILADELPHIA, May 12.—Frank Lamtel! ts
the operator at the Vine streeet approach to
the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad tunnel that
extends 2,000 feet along Twenty-fifth street,
from Callowhill to the Green street entrance to
Fairmount Park, in which two sections of a fast
freight train collided at 1 o’olock this morning,
killing the engineer, George Loeb, und fireman
William Hinchman, wrecking thirty cars, and
causing a severe fire which burned all day
Lamtell ran away soon after the accident, but
late this afternoon he went to the office of
Major (. C. Bent at the Baltimore and Ohio
station and gave himself up z

"Tl was responsible for it,” he aid, ‘but 1 do
not know how ithappened The white signa!
was up and it was I who left itup. I was
asleep, I suppose. The omy excuse I have to
offer is that I have been overworked.”

The fast freight with thirty-eight cars left
the East Side staticn soon after midnight. The
train went into the tunnel and there seventeen
of the cars were broken off and placed ona
siding. Theremaining cars were allowed to
stand on the track, and the second section of
the train, coming aong with thirty-five cars,
getting no signal that the first section was in
the tunnel, passed in at arate of fifteen miles
an hour, and\n the middle of the underground
passage, Which extends from Callowhill street
to the Spring Garden street entrance to Fair-
yout Park, erashed together The forward
cars of the second aid end cars of the first sec-
tion were telescoped The fire in the engine
scattered about, ignited the wood and soon the
contents of adoven tank cars containing seve-
ral thousand gallons of coal oil were burning
furiously

There wereno ventilatorsin the top of the
tunnel and bongeqventy the heavy smoke
made it impossiblefor the firemen to atay in
long Holes were cut through the roof and
thousands of gallons of water poured in, but it
was littio use. A score and more of firemen
were overcome by the heavy smoke and
had to be taken to hospitals It {3 impossible
to say what the loss will be, but it is
estimated that rolling stock and freight
destroyed are worth $200,000. The tunne! was
built about ten vears ago at a cost of nearly
$1,900,000 The tracks will have to be relaid and
much of the roof will have to be rebuilt

It {s said that there were mye Wenipe on the
train when it entered the tunnel and that they
are dead, but there is no way to prove this to be
@ fact

DAY AFTER THE BATTLE.

JEFFRIES AND CORBETT SHOW FEW
SIONS OF THEIR HARD STRUGGLE,

The Champion Save He Was Under a Pall
and Should Have Won in Twelve Kounds
~Corbett Intends to Keep on Fighting

Receipts of Contestand What the Men Won

The only thing talked about by the sporta yea
terday was the viotory of James Jeffries over Jim
Corbett at Coney Island on Friday night, While
the result was a foregone conclusion, #0 far as
the majority of the followers of the ring were
concerned, Corbett'’s showing was @ big sur-
prise, The impression prevailed that he
would be easy forthe Champion and suc
cumb before the tenth round Many were
disappointed because Jeffries did not do the trick
earlierthanhedid But deapite all thia there 4 no
gainsaying that he utilized all his skill and that
it was Corbett’s cleverness and generalship
that prevented an earlier termination o! the
struggle Jeffries yesterday repeated the
statement he made after the fight to the effect
that hisleftarm bothered him to @ great ex-
tent He further said that he was undera
pull. He eontends that had he fought the
way he wanted to, the flaht would not bave
lasted bevond the twelfth round

teferea White, when questioned by a re-
porter of Tuk Sen, said that it was the best
heavyweight contest he ever had seen, and ex-
tolled the fighting qualities of both pugilists

Without committing himself one way or the
other, One thing whieh was commented upon
quite freely was the fact that Corbett was
able to vet into such tne condition, On the
other hand, Jeffries was notes finely trained as
he should have been, When he returned to his
dressing root after the battl: it’ was observed
that he could have taken off more flesh without
any danger, Jeffries said when questioned
about this that he felt very atrong and
that he had not done very much box-
ing five days. before the mill “Tommy
Ryan hada cold,” he said, “and d thought that
fs long us he was unadle to box | could get of
extra Weight by doing road work. Butl was
mistaken The supertluous flesh which you see
on me didnot bother ioe much My wind was
perfect and that is the tnain thing *

Both pugilists were around town yesterday
as chipper and lively as twolarks. Evenin
the fuce of his defeat Corbett seemed to be
happy and held a levee in his cafe throughout
the day. Hedid not display any mark, and
the only thing that Seemed to be the matter
with lum was that he could hardly speak above
awhisperattunes. He said that he had con-
tracted a cold during the battle. Jeffries left
for New York immediately after the milland
wentto the Murray. Hill baths. Qutside of a@
biack eye anda puffed lip he was unsecratehed
‘The Champion arose shortly after 10. o'clock
and went tothe Vanderbilt Hotel and enjoyed
ahearty meal In the atternoon he went to
Philadelphin to umpire a baseball game
Jeffries had many callers while he was in
town

“IT must admit that Corbett did give me a
Burprise party . he said “He is Very clever
and shifty, but he cannot hurt as hard as either
Sharkey or Fitzsimmons, He landed on me
quite often, but his blows had no visible effect,

fought him different than I have any of my
other opponents 1 think he would have
come to ne L would have dropped hin sooner
tha: I did) But of one thing [aim gratified and
that is he put upa grand ht and gave those
presenta run for their money

“Will you flght Corbett again?”
asked

The question was rather sudden,
Champion was equalto the oceasion and an-
swered
“ I'l fight hima week fromthe day) Vu
take on Sharkey or MeCoy if they wantine. I
don't think that my injured arm will prevent
me The tast tight which Thad jast night has
not done me any harm I feel like a two-year-
old to-day. My muscles are supple, and let me
tell you, my appetite is better than ever se
fore | have anvthing further to say, let me in-
form vou of one fact. Corbett is a better man
than Sharkey or Fitzsimmons — He knows more
about the game than either, If he fights Shar-
key the same way he did me last night he will
cut Sharkey all into ribbons

Jeffries further said that he is gofng to ben
full fledged actor next season, and that he will
etarinaplay written for him and entitled “A
country Sheriff’ The Champion will play the
part of the Sheriff

Corbett, alter leaving the clubhouse, went to
his hotel at ahoepahead Bay with his wife anda
few friends, The party remained over night
and returned here early yesterday morning
Jn the afternoon he went tohis café. Hehada
sweater on and looked the picture of health,
Ina talk with the reporter Corbett said

“Toannot say just now what my future plans
are, } am not going to retire, ] can assure you,
My friends wont let me, and Iam going to how

feated | have not been disgraced. Many thought
that | would quit after getting a punch, that I
could not tight any more and that IT had gone

 

 

back. Why, L feel good to-day as IT aid ten
vears ago, andl cannot convince myself that I
am 33 vears oid. Jeffries is a fine fellow, a good

fighter and very strong. He had the advantage
of weight, and this told on me in many Ways
I was not badly hurt at any stage of the
and | think | would have won had it gone the
limit. My friends are more loyal to me than
ever, and that alone is worth to me more than
the purse money

combat

Who is going to be your next opponent?”
sone one asked
“TL cannot say exactly,’ was the reply

areturn mateh
Phere is also talk

There is some talk of making
between Jeffries and mysel!
of wn bout between Kid MeCoy and myself To
allof this | must say that time alone will tell
just what Lwilldo. Twillkeepineondition It
isagreat thing to be well and healthy and no
one i preeiates this fact now more than ldo"

Corbettturther said that he won a large sum
of money on the number of rounds the combat
would go He estimates his winnings, including
the purse money, at about $12,000

The receipts of the contest, as given out by
Tom O'Rourke, amounted to a tritle over $83,000,
Half of this goes to the club and the remainder
to the flahters The winner 6O per
cent. and the loser 40 per cent. Thos woud make

 

 

receive

Jeffries’s share about $9,000 and Corbett 's about
$6,000 The impression prevails, however, that
the receipts were nearly $40,000 and that the

fighters received a Quarantee of $10,000 each
The money was not paid over tothe men yes-
Willy Brady, Alee Brown and Tom
© Kourke had several contabs regarding the
diaposition of the cash There seemed to bea
hiteh, and Brady wore 4 look of disappointment
when he left he matter will probably be set-
ted to-morrow

Moat of the out-of-town sports left for home
yesterday As the majority had at the last
moment snapped at the alluring odds on Cor-
bett and backed him, there were many disap-
pointed ones among thelot, What littl betting
was indulged in Was done at the ringside. A
good deal of money waa lost by those who
wagered that Corbett would be whipped inside
of ten rounds As good as even mInoneyv Was
secured, and odds of 10 to §% were readily
accepted by those who thought that Corbett
would not go over fifteen rounds
sidine brothers, George and
tidy sum this way George says he is ahead
to the extent of $1,500, and Johnny cal-
eulates his winnings at about $1,780
Jim Wakely, Charley Mahoney, “Honest” Jon
Kelly, Martin Dowling and Sam Fitzpatrick
won on the result, but dropped quite a pile on
the number of rounds. Tom O'Rourke, who
bet that Corbett would not respond to the call
of time after the tenth round, dropped $1,000 to
Fddie Burke. One of the heaviest winners is
Dr Ordway, who is now on his way to Europe
He commissioned Al Smith to wager $5,000 for
him on Jeffries. Smith got the tulk of the
money down, but was forced to give big odds
in order to nceomplish this

Wakely eaid that Corbett’s showing nearly
staggered him, Al Smith was pleased over the
way Corbett fought and predicts that he will
eventually win back the championship if he
takes care of himself

“Had T not been a friend of Jeffries,"’ said
Smith, “I would have lost heavily on Corbett
