ARMOR PLANT DEFEATED.

 

THE SBNATE REJECTS THE PROPO-

SITION BY A VOTE OF 299 TO 24,

Genator Chaedier Renews the Amendment
~—He Says He Is Prepared to Show That
the Harvey Process Is a Fraed Imposed
Upos the Government and That He Be-
Heves the Krupp Armor Has No Merit,

WASHINGTON, May 12-—The debate on the
armor plate amemduents to the Naval Appro-
priation bill was closed in the Senate at SP. M,
to-day. The vow was then taken and the
propositions looking to the establishment of a
Government armor factory were defeated by a
vote of 22 to 24

The Naval Appropriation bill was taken up
soon after the Senate wus called to order and
the discussion of the armor plate proposi-
tions was resumed

Mr. Chandler (Rep. N. Ao criticised the
argument made yesterday by Mr. Allison (Rep,,
la), particularly the prediction that if a Gov-
ernment armor plate plant was setup it would
not produce a sheet of armor plate in less than
four years. He pointed out the fact that
Carnegie had set up a plant and turned out
plate in less than one year, He recounted
various steps in getting the Navy Department
to adopt the Harvey process, connecting with it
Commander Folger of the Ordnaace Bureau,
and saying that after the contract had es
made Commander Folger resigned, and became
the salaried agent of the Harvey company,
with asalary of $5,000 a year and a donation of
$20,000 of the company’s stock, while Mr.
Tracy, after he ceased to be Secretary of the
Navy, in which office he had made the contract,
became counsel for the Harvey patent

After some colioquy with Mr Hale Mr.
Chandler said) “Tam prepared to show that
the Harvey patent was a fraud and wasim-
posed upon the Patent Office and upon the
Government by dishonest methods I do not
Delieve that the Krupp process las any merit
whatever, exceptas it carries farther than the
Harvey process does, the well-known means of
bardening iron by carbonization ‘There is no
patent about it, no secretabout It, that is worth
a dollar in any court’

Mr Chandier expressed his belief that In a
year and a half a Government armor plant
could be established for $500,000 and a steel
plant for making steel ingets for $500,000, and
that thus the end could be reached and the con
tention cease. He believed that to be the true
and only remedy, and he appealed to Senators
to stand by the proposition of the Minority of
the Naval Committee Hie paid a compliment

fo naval officers, but said they had no care
about cost They seemed to belleve that money
was miside by steam presses at work,
and had no idea that if \asraised by taxation
But the same thirur appeared wo be true of the
“ardent expansionists, Wo are so anxious that
ewe shall, right off, withia amonth, spend eighty
millions on anay

Mr. Hoar (Rep, Mass) made an earnest pro-
test agninat the remark, so frequently mnade,
that the United States had become a first-class

setting

power, a ‘word power ”

“aick of hearing people say that sinee this
wretched imperialistic business we have be-
come a first-class world power’ The United
Btates had come out of the War of isi2a }
first-class power, and had been a tirst-class |
power ever since a power that had kept
off all Europe from South America and
Mexico and the islands oo! the sea,

except as they had got there before

 

The United States was not so strong to-day, he
said, as she wis twelve months ago, because
she had bound herself over to keep the peace
since that time by her distant porsessions. He
cited some savings of the Duke of Wellington,
George (hanning and other great Englishmen
in recognition of the power of the United
States, and recalled the fact that Sir Howard
Douglass of the British Admiralty, in a treatise
on naval gunnery, published in 1821, gave an
index of 19 naval combats, 17 of which were
with the United States where the United States
were victorious

“The comparatively little power,’ Mr. Hoar
wenton, “which did that thing inthe war of
1812 with Great Britain came out of it a firat-
class power a vorid power. There has not
been a country since, «reat orsmall, that has
ventured totackle us: and there is not a country
onearth since, great orsmall, that would not
have got out of any difflculty with us by diplo-
macy rather than by war.”

Mr. Rawlins (Dem, Utah) spoke intavor of
the committee's amendment and made an ear-
hest protest against the imperialistio attitude
of the Administration, which was now, he said,
attempting to “play the bully in) the Dar-
danelles.’

Mr Spooner (Rep, Wis.) said thathe was not
in favor of Mr. Tillman's amendment limiting
the price for armor plate to $300 per ton. That
price might be enough, or it might be too much,
“J wish,” he said, “the ships now in process of
construction to be completed. Lam willing to
vote for the committee proposition to pay $445
for ail the armor required, andT am willing to
go beyond that and to vote $545 a ton for the
three ships now in course of construction {

competition with any foreign government in
the way of naval armament. | will not vote
for this proposition to speed the completion of
these ships on the suggestion made yesterday
by the Senator trom Massachusetts (Mr
Lodge), that it is necessary to be done in order
toenable us to protect the Monroe Doctrine
from challenge by any country. T think he
almost said) Germany That Doetrine, Mr
Presiden!, is very dear to the American people
That goes without question. tt is regarded as
vital, and it will never be surrendered on the
challenge of any government or governments
T know of no one national noliey in defence of

most illimitable resources of this country

believe that there has ot been atime in tfty
years when there was less danger than there ts
to-day of the challenge of the Monroe Doctrine
by any government under the sky, and | was
quite surprised at the suggestion contained in
the speech of the Senator from Massachusetts
yesterday as an argument in favor of speedy
completion of the ships or of increasing our
navy, that it may be necessary in order that
we shall be ready to meet the challenge of that
Doctrine by Germany. IT do not believait 1
have, on the highest authority, warrant for the
assertion that there has not been atime
when there existed a friendlier relatlon be-
tween the United States and Germany than
exists to-day; and while T am no more an
optimist in national matters than most
Senators, I would not be willing to
epend a dollar of the people’s money in yield-
{ng to the extortion of armor plate manufac-
turers on the theory that it is necessary in
order to defend the interests of the United
States against Germany. Liook for no war, no
trouble from the F eo of Germany, and |
think there is no foundation for any such sug-

eation But we must have a larger navy

do vot say that we have become a first-class
nation, in the sense that we have not been one
but we are adeveloping nation. Our ecommerce

suspect that it will not continue to expand
Our people oveupy this country elahty milions

Will recognize no boundary and will be content
with no limit. We must have a larger navy
We must havea commercial interest in every
country, and we must be ready, as we will be
willing, to safeguard and protect those interests
whenever the national honor demands "

Coming down tothe immediate question of
arinor plate, Mr. Spooner said that it would be
{intolerable to have the Government entirely

anibi-

defenceless and at the merey absolutely of two
armor plate companies
Mr. Hale (Rep, Me), chairman of the com

mittee on Naval Affairs, closed the di on

 

   

He said) ‘The committee is anxious t the

THE GARROTE IN PORTO fico.

Gen. Davis Describes the Operation and Says
It Is Less Revolting Than Hanging.

W ASHINOTON, May 12.--The President to-day,
in response to a resolution inquiring whether
prisoners had been executed in Porto Rico by
the garrote and why that mode of execution
had been adopted, transmitted to the Senate
the reply of Gov. Davis, stating that the execu-
tions of the five men at Ponce was in accord-
ance with the legal method of capital punish-

| ment in force in the island and that the execu-
tion was accomplished decently and quietly
and in strict conformity with the law

Goy. Davissays that he had investigated the
matter of mechanical details and the physi-
ological effect of the garrote, and was satisfled
that between garroting and hanging, the for-
