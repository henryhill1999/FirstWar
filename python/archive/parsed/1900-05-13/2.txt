Boston, May 12.-Supt. Aletis L. Frye, of |
the Cuban Pubiic Schools, writing from Havana, |

ing interest in the projected visit of the Cuban |

also a desire to have the Wlutman teachers
meet the visitors, says

“The attitude ‘of the Amoriema teachers |

PADEREWSKI'6 FAREWELL.

| A Great Andience at Carnegie Hall Yester-

day to Fear the Pianist.

Ignace Paderewski appeared at Carnegie
Hall yesterday afternoon for the last time
here during the present season. It was bis

seventh concert in New York. But the neigh-

borhood of Fifty-seventh street and Seventh
avanue looked before the recital as if it had
Just becorne a goal of a large part of the pop-
ulation. Carnegie Hall may be inaccessible,
but there seems no trouble in reaching it when
some performances take place there. There
could scarcely have been 4 larger audience than
that whtch gathered there yesterday. It
Was probably the largest of the season

The programme was devoted exclusively to
Chopin, It included the Fantaiete in F minor,
the Preludes in B fat major, D, D minor and
A flat, the Nocturnes in Ff major and B major,
the sonata in B flat minor, Etudes in F mnajor, G
sharp minor, G flat inajor, F sharp minor and
© major; Mazurkas in F sharp minor and B
nunor;, the Valse in A flat, “Berceuse,” Opus
47, and “Polonaise” in A flat. Of this pro-
«ranme only the Sonata, the Prelude in D
minor and the Nooturne in F major had not
been played by the pianist before this year.
All the other Chopin numbers had been heard in
his mixed programmes. But the programme

had \itde to do with the size of the audience
yeorraay, although it may have affected its
Muyo

For a farewell audience it was peculiarly
4@pathetio until the end of the programme had
been reached. Then the familiar rush to the
platform, the waving handkerchiefs and the
Patter of feminine hands led the pianist to give
seven eneores, some of them repetitions of the
brogramime nurabers, others not given before
during the afternoon and all the works of the
COlnposer to whom the concert was devoted

| There was nothing like the demonstration of

previous years. While cordiality and warmth
Were abundant, thare was no hysteria
Paderewski wave yesterday his ninety-fifth
coneert since he arrived here in Deoernber,
Those whoexpected yesterday to observe
the results of weariness in his work were dis-
appointed. He never played with greater
beauty, passion or poetry than he put into
every phrase yesterday, and there was no lack

 

) of brillianey and freshness in his performs

AN very quality that has made him unique
among the pianists of the day was beautifully
manifest. ‘The audience rewarded him wit
every sign of the highest appreciation and
delight, even though the frequent encores
atter the concert seemed rather the result

ot his amiabiity than of any imperative de-

mand from the Jingering listeners

 

THE ROCIESTER SCHOOL LAW.

Another Fraud Discovered in the Bill That
Was Signed by the Governor.
RocuesTer, May 12.~Further examination
of the Dow bill shows that another fraud was
perpetrated upon Gov. Roosey and the Legis-
lature which pas-ed it. When the bill was drafted
and when it was approvedin this city and passed
in the Legislature it had the following clause
relating to the qualifications of teachers
“But any teacher in the employ of the said
Department of Education at the time of the
passage of this act shall be exempt from the
conditions as to qualifications or eligibility
Imposed by this amendment and by said chaptar
66) of thefLaws of isGs, and all such teachers

  
  

 

except supply teachers, shall be deemed to be

upon the eligible list for appolotment

the three words, “exeept supply teachers
have been cutout and there isthe same mystery
about whe did it as there is about the clause
which retains Supt. Noyes in offlce. Both the

Behool Board and Senator Armstrong have sent

preferred requests to Gov. Roosevelt, asking
him to make an investigati

In his letter tothe Governor SenatorArmstrong
h all the faets he discovered during his
investigation of the forgery at Albany on Wed-
nesday. He told the Governor his conclusions
fn the matter and offered to furnish all the

 

 

 

evidence he had secured tf the Governor decides
to make official inquiry, There is no doubt but
the Governor will act at once in the face of the

unanimous request for investigation sent from
lochester to-day

The crime was probably committed in Albany
by legislative clerks, and the suspicion is natural
that it was inspired in Rochester. If the guilty
persons at Albany are found it ia possible that
they ean be brought to betray the insugators
rather then serve a seven-year term in prison
which is the punishment provided for this kind

of crooked work.
