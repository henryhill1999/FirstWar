NEW METROPOLITAN STOCK.
BARRON OF osTon TH118 WHERE

Teld the Connsel for the Metropolitan Three
Weeks Ago That It Came From Some-
where Near the Ratiroad Commission Has
Been Pretty Nearly 30 Per Cent, Verified.

The following statement was sent in on the
slips of a Wall Street news bureau on March 23

“Tt ia rumored that the Metropolitan is about
to ask the Stock Exchange to list $25,000,000 ad-
ditional stock ."’

By ‘Motropolitan” was meant the Metropoli-
tan Street Railway Company. The immediate
effect of the announcement was a4 decline of 2
points in the stock of the company, but the
stock soon recovered and ¢losed 2 points

higher than it had opened. Soon af-
ter the statement was Issued, it was
eeon by some of the chief owners

of the Metropolitan, who, after issuing flat de-
nials, instructed DeLancey Nicoll to trace the
etatement to its source, dermand the authority
for making it and prosecute somebody, if pos-
ible, for attempting to depress the price of
Metropojitan stock. Mr. Nicoll was informed
that the statement had been telegraphed to
New York by the Boston News Bureau, of
whioh ©. W. Barron is the manager. Learning

1) r. Nicoll made public copies of the follow.
. Pi addressed to the Boston News

u:
learn that the statement put out by Dow,
Jones & Co. this afternoon, to the effect that
the Metropolitan Street Kailway Company is
about to ask the Stock Exchange to list $25,-
,000 additional stock, came over the wires
en you. As counselfor that company, I de-
mandthe authority for that statement "
Mr. Niooll told THE SUN_that the story was
circulated “in the hope of affecting our stock,”
nd that he purposed doing something almt
t. That was the jast anybody in thee parts
ever heard from Mr. Nicoll on the subject. It

—

now pears that Mr Nicoll got an answer
rom Mr. Barron under date of April 21. Mr
n has sent a copy of the answer to Tne

UN and here it is
“Boston NEWS BUREAU,
7 EXCHANGE PLAC,
Boston, April 21, 1900.

“DeLancey Nicoll, Esq.,

“Dear Sin—Agreeable to your request I have

vestigated the rumor which came to me from

ew York that the Metropolitan Street Railway
Company contemplated an increase of $25,000,000
fn jte share capital

“Although this rumor was first published tn
Boston, it originated, I am informed, at Albany,
and the basis of it, | am advised, was aninquiry
of the New York Railroad Cominissioners as to
whether they would permit the Metropolitan

eet Railway Company to issue so large an

ditional amount of share capital as $25,000,-
000.
“I should be pleased to hear the result of
your inquiry as to how far the Railroad Com-
missioners of New York and any authorized
officials of the Metropolitan Street Railway
Company are responsible for the rumored {ne
crease in the share capital of the Metropolitan.
Very truly yours, C.W. Barron”

Mr. Nicoll was asked last night what answer
the Railroad Commissioners had given to the
Metropolitan's request and his answer was

“Nosuch request was ever made Barron
may have been informed that there had been,
but his information was incorrect. I never
paid any attention to his letter, you know, be-
cause | thought the thing was dead and not
worth bothering about any more.”

The new stock issue, it has since appeared,
was to be $7,000,000, instead of $25,000,000, and a
meeting of the stockholders has been called tor
next Thursday to authorize the issue

This compaay owas seven full-sized gold-qearts mines, only halfa mile from the line of the
Southern Pacific Ratiroad, near the town of Mojave, Callforaia. Work on several of the mines
has progressed far beyond the experimental stage. More than 1,700 tons of ere has been
milled and reduced, and has yielded an average exceeding $20 per ton.
free milling, and none of ithas proved rebellious. A good jadge who recently visited the
mines declared that one of them was, as far as its development at the time indicated, ‘the
best gold mine tn the State of California.’’ Stnoe then additional development has disclosed
even richer ore and greater depth. A winze heginolag at the 100-feet level was recently sunk
one hundred and twenty ‘feet in very rich ore.

Four gentlemen of this city had these properties investigated in April by an emi-
nent and successful mining engineer. In his report he says: ‘“The ore voinin the
winze, from the tunnel level to the bottom, will average four feet thick that Will yield
from $15 to $20 per ton, at a cost of $2 perton for mining and milling.”” Any business
that can turn out its product in immense quant ties at a cost of $2 and sell it at from $15
to $20 deserves tne attention of investors. It may be added that the gentlemen for whom
this examination was made have now invested largely in the stock of the company.

This cempany also owns the entire water supply of the district (except one animportant
quantity), and tn a place where it sometimes does not rato for several years, a virtual monopoly
of the water supply of the entire district ts of immense value,

THE CAPITAL OF THE COMPANY IS $1,500,000 IN SHARES OF ONE DOLLAR EACH.
LESS THAN 300,000 SHARES OF THE TREASURY STOCK ARE NOW OFFERED FOR
SALE AT FIFTY CENTS PER SHARE, THE PROCEEDS TO BE EXPENDED ON THE MINES,
FOR ADDITIONAL MACHINERY, WATER-WORKS, ETC. STOCK IS NON-ASSESSABLE.

Farther particelars may be learned at the company's New York Offices, Rooms 1011 and
1012 Bank of Commerce Building, 31 Nassxa Street.

Descriptions of the property will be sent by mall on application,

STOCK EXCHANGE CONTROLS WIRES,

Basiness of Members With Non-Members to Be
Supervised Sharply.

The Governing Committee of the New York
Stock Exchange has adopted resolutions, totake
effect on June 1, restricting the useof private
telephone and telegraph wires connecting the
offices of members with the offlees of non-
members and putting suchyires under the con-
trol of the Committee of Afrangements. Under

the resolutions in the future there can be no
wire connection established with a non-member
uniess application therefor has first been made
tothe Committee of Arrangements and been
approved by them. The committee will regis.
ter all permitted connections and will have
power to order any wire connection with a
non-member discontinued at any time

The resolutions prohibit members, directly or
indirectly, paying the cost_of telegraph opera-
tors or any other expense}pertaining to non-
members’ offices. Only telegraph or telephone
companies approved by the Committee of Ar-
rangements shall furnish the wire connections
Any members violating the resolutions or any
regulation made by the Committee of Arrange-
ments will be deemed guilty of an act detri-
mental to the interest and welfare of the kx.
change and punished in accordance with the
law of the Fxchange

There has been much mvstery as to how non-
members in other cities having advertised wire
connections with Stock Exchange firms were
able to figure out any profit by accepting busi-
ness in stocks at a commission of * of 1 per
cent., the rate which, under the commission
law of the New York Stock Exchange, they,
themselves, must pay to the Stock Exchange
firm with which they have their wire connec.
tion. It has been alleged that either there
must be splitting of commissions, direct or in-
direct, or that the non-member was doing a
bucket-shop business. Another result of the
resolutions is expected to be more diMflenity
about condueting illicit wire connections with
the Consolidated Stock and Petroleum Ex.

STEFL AND WIRE COMING HERE?

Don't Know-—Bourean of Publicity Not So
Active Just Now.

It was reported in despatches from the West
yesterday that the headquarters of the Ameris
can Steel and Wire Company will
moved from Chicago to this city. Max Pam,
counsel! of the company, refused to say vester-
dav whether it was so or not

Thomas Dolan of Philadephia, one of the di-

ectors of the wire company, Was quoted as

oliows yesterday regarding the changes that
have taken place in the company's manage.
ment

“Mr. Gates is off to Europe as a Commis-
sioner to the Paris. Exposition from. the
State of Illinois and the changes in the
Board of Directors make that body a busi-
nessiike concern. There will be no changes
so faras the opening of mills is concerned
Everything that Mr Gates didin that direction
was with the full knowledge and consent of the
board, I don't think the Wall Street end of the
company will beso active as it has been, and
the bureau of publicity at the Waldorf will also
suspend operations

President Eh. H Gary of the Federal Steel
Company said again yesterday that there was
no truth whatever in the report that he was to
enter the directory of the Kinerican Steel and
Wire Company, or that any such step on his
Dart was ever contemplated. Hesaid the new
directors of the Wire Company were strong and

strength to the board. The present relations
