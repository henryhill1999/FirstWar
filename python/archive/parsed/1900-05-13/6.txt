the company should have built up a business

It was with the full and free consent of the
Prussian | sovernment that the Mutual Company
began business in that ‘kingdom. Before
the privilege of opening offices for business
there was «ranted a thorough examination
was made of the company's allairs, of ite sva-

and of all details of its management. The re-
aylt of this scrutiny was that nothing objection-
able or in contravention of Russian laws or
Dusiness methods was found and the Mutual
Life was duly and formally authorized to do
business The concession or license was issued
by the Minister of the Interior of Prussia on
the 18th of Nov. 1586.

| NOTES OF LEGAL EV
Dr. Landon Carter Gray, who died in this
city on Tuesday, was not only widely known
! as an able and successful neurologist but had
also achieved notable distinction in the field
| of lewal medicine, Ingiving expert evidence
he was the very model of what a medical
witness ought to be, and his intellectual hon-
esty would not suffer him to be biased in favor
of the litigant or lawyer who sought his opinion
This was so well known that distinguished
counsel often consulted him in regard to medi-
cal matters which never found their way into
court, simply in order to satisfy themselves
as to the true character and extent of the in-
juries or maladies of which their clients com-
plained. While a resident of Brooklyn he
was called upon to testify in many important
homicide casea in which insanity was relied
upon as a defence. We recall that he was a
witness in the case of McElvaine who butchered
a grocer named Jiica whose apartments the
murderer had broken into in the night time
Dr. Gray also gave evidence in the ease of
Hawkins, the Suffolk county murderer who
killed his mother. As one of the Coniumission-
ers to inquire into the sanity of the prisoner,
Dr. Gray made a very careful study of the
case of Dougherty, “Mary Anderson's mad
lover,” who shot Dro Lieyd at the Flatbush
Insane Asylum several vears ago. The results
of this investigation appear in tl
on paranoia in his treatise on nervous ond
mental Columbian College eonferred
the honorary degree of A) Moon Dr Gray in
1894. He spent a vear at Columbia as a student,
but his academic education was completed
at Heidelberg. He was not only agood doctor,
but a man of the most winning and attractive
character

was only upon the condition that Mr

would also obtain for that corporation certain
very profitable electrical work on the Metro
politan Railway This Mr. Parker dé
to do, and hence Lawson gained nothing by
the introduction. The proof on the — trial
brought out the fact that Lord Keivin, the
eminent Scotch physicist, had spoken of Thomas
Parker as the Edison of Furope, The jury
believed the story of the defendant that
did not promise to pay being
introduced to Mr. Parker gained
something by the acquaintance, and asa he
had aequired nothing therefrom they found
a verdict in his favor

the horse was lost for want of a horse, the
rider was Jost, being overtaken and killed by
the enemy The death here is too remote
to render liable the blacksmith who left out
the nail. Sethe law deems the injurious effects
of mere fright, alone and of themselves, too
remote and speculative to form the basis of
an award of damages for negligence, and re-
fuses to give aoything fo a passenger who is
greatly frightened by » collision of his rail-

on account of this commingling of functions

pronounced the act unconstitutional Al-

OUR SOFT COAL FOR EUROPE

FAMINE PRICES PREVAIL,

 

Contract for the Delivery of 60,000 Tons
Abroad Reported in Wall Street Yesterday
Strikes of Miners and the South African
War Have Affected the Normal Supply,

Special Cable Despatch fo THE SUN.
LonNpos, May 12) [tis high time that Ameri-
ean coal mine owners took advantage of the
famine prices in this country. American coal
is finding a good market In Germany, but the

English prices are still higher. There iaa good

profit on American coal in London, for in-

“tance, at the prevailing domestic rate of 30

shillings for a ton of 2,250 pounds

It is attirmed that prices are going higher in-
stead of there being the usual summer decline,
and the effect is already manifest io mantfold
ways. Therailways have made a decided ad-
Vanee in excursion fares and even laucdry
prices have been raised It is announed that
there will be a further advance of five shillings
in the price of locomotive coal as s00n aS ex-
isting contracts expire. This rise willmean an
increase of $2,000,000 in the annual coal bill of
the North Western Railway alone,

Prices for nearly everything are higher in
Londonthana yearago The war is the vague
explanation, but in most cases has nothing to

do with the matter,

jumped from the railroad bridge over the road-
way near the Coseob depot, thisafternoon at 2
o'cloek to escape an express train and injured
her spine badly. She went to the west-bound
station by mistake and seeing a train coming,
thought she would not have time to walk down
the stepsand under the bridge to the other
station. Accordingly, she started to walk acroas
the track at the bridge where the rail fence
ends. As she neared the other side the train
bore down upon her and, realizing her danger,
she jumped, landing in the roadway thirty feet
below Those who saw her jump carried her
into the Coscob station and Dr Milo Jones was
summoned The woman's condition was such
that it was deemed best to take her to the Stam-
