Clarence H. Mackay Said to Own Banastar.

Among the gossip current between races at
Morris Park yesterday a statement was made
to the effect that Banastar is really the property
of Ciarence H. Mackay. The noted Brooklyn
Handicap winner was knocked down to Craig

W. Wadsworth. at the Clark sale on Friday. It
is said that Mr. Wadsworth, in bidding $11,000
for the crack five-year-old, was acting as a
friendly agent for the sport-loving son of the
‘Silver King.’ Clarenca H. Mackay fa re-

| garded as one of the most popular men
Inclubdom. He is a good all-round sportaman
but his chief forte, hitherto, has been racquets,
at which game he ranks in the championship
class. Should he decide to go in for racing his
advent will undoubtedly be welcomed by those
who love sport for sport's sake.
