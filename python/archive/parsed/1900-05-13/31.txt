ENGLISH SPORTING NEWS.

Performances of the Track Champions at
Holiday Meetings.

The latest foreign mail brings particulars of
the Good Friday and Easter Monday meetings,
which practically open the athletic season In
England. As usual, the large number of games
allowed the champions to select soft spots for
competition, but in afew instances where the
good men clashed fast times were recorded.

The appearance of R. W. Wadsley, the 100-
yard and quarter-mile champion, served to
make the Hairdressers’ sports at Putney the
feature of the Good Friday meetings. The
champion won his trial heatin the open 100
handicap, but went down inthe second round
in the moderate time of 10 1-5 seconds

Wadsley was in better form at Newmarket
on Easter Monday, where he won the open 120-
yard handicap from scratch in 12 seconds In
the race for the quarter-mile challenge cup at
thesame meeting the champion hadall he could
do to take the honors from FE.) Otuey. The
pair ran a dead heat in 51 seconds, but the run-
off ended in favor of Wadsley

Another instance of the marvellous manner in
which the old country runners hold their form
was provided at Cheltenham, where two veter-
ans, om Birch and(. Souch, finished first and
second in the three-milehandicap atthe Easter
Monday sports. The showing of Birch is the
nore remarkable as he has been among the
first division of long distance runners for up-
