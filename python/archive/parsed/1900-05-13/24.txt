"Hew {think such an idea horrible, He likes

“What queer people Mr. Freshington does

gsanywhera one never knows what to expect.”

“That's the beauty of {t,” sald Dobley,
exthustastically, “There ts not much fun fn
@ut-and-dried entertainment Freshington’s
evenings alwars have the charm of novelty.”

“l wonder what one should wear to such a
thing?” mused Mra Dobley; “it isn’t a tea nor
a musicale—--"

“There are to be two dances, I believe,” said
Mr Dobley, referring to the letter. “Freshngton

ton, the society girl, do her wonderful snake
dance. you Will never forget it.’”

*Where have I heard that name before?”

He's one of the Wumps of Washington, His
mother was @ Miss Mao Snorter of Virginia, a
great beauty, Willle ts a sort of society pet.
He's a very clever boy, very clever! He’s always
doing funny things. Rubbed lettuce {n his hair
at dinner onee, and when they asked him why
be did it, said he thought it was spinach.”

How very peculiar,” said Mrs, Dobley.

> very original, certainly,” replied Mrs
Dopey, somewhat doubtfully; “but I've just
been thinking, wont it seem odd for me to go
never having met Mr. Van Rattler?”

I's Freshington'’s party,” said Mr. Dobley,

There are plenty of parties at Van Raftler’s

nv black spangled gown.”

rhe Van Rattler studio was at the very top
of an old building in the Washington Square part
ofthe towm There was po elevator, as Dobley
explained to his wife,and they would be forced
to climb eight filghts of stairs. But when ther
reached the place a greater obstacle presented
itself. They could ser the lights in the Van
Rattler etudio and evan heard occasional strains
of mandolin musio,but the outer door was closed
and there wasno bell. The Dobieys were in

a dilemma. They looked up yearningly at
the windows and Dobley whtstled, but !t was all
in vain.

“I think ft fs rather funny)” sald Mrs. Dobley,
"to invite people to a party/and then have the
door fixed so that nobody can get tn.”

Just then a handsom cab drove up to the door
and a man fn evening dress got out.

“It's Van_ Rattler himself." said Dobley.
“Hello, Van Rattler, you're just tn time. We're
come to the party and we can’t get in.”

Dear me,” said Van Rattler. “Is there a

recital he said {t was too late for him to with-

have to be combined. But, you see, Mrs. Shud-
der sold tickets for her recital at $5 a piece
and she thought {t would be unfair to let in
frreabinstce’s crowd free. Freshington wouldn't
isten to the idea of charging admission to his
friends, so they appealed to me.”

“It was embarrassing,” said Mrs. Dobley.

“It was 40 embarrassing,” said Van Rattler,
“that I went out. Now I imagine that Fresh-
jugton has ion of the studio and has
omed the door to keep the Shudder crowd
out.”

“Your studio nmust be very popular,” said Mra.
Dobley. “Why don't you make them hire halls
for their affairs?”

“Oh, it’s too mu of anovelty.” ogid Van Rat-
tler, “Then, they like the snakes.”

‘The snakes,” said Mra. Dobley

“Why, I told you about Mr. Van Rattler's

“Oh, yes," said Van Ratuer. “They Ive right

throat and a porous plaster on his chest, but
otherwise they are all in good condition. The
asps are very lively.”

Tam so anxious for you to see them,” said
Mr Dobley, wondering if they were going to
spend the evening on the sidewalk

sounded doubly odd on the tinkling instru-

Then as though answering a mysterious
summons, from different parts of the room

ided as many as a dozen snakes, one a large

oa ornamented with the flannel bandage
the artist had referred to. They glided and
undulated about the musician in graceful
circles as though charmed by his music = Then
he changed the music to a livelier measure, the
shakes keeping time in their inysterious glid-
ings, some of them climbing up around Van
Rattler’s arms and neck, It was a most welrd
and uncanny alght, and if the man on the ru
had been in costume instead of Sanventicnel
dress he would have looked like one of the
veritablo snake charmers of the Orient, Sud-
denly he stopped, gathered his pets up tn his
hands and arms and carried them off, the big
boa-constrictor hanging around his neck,

Now he's going to put them to bed,” said
Miss Wobbleton,, “and f will get ready for my

Svon there was more music and she reap-
peared looking, as Dobley said, like a cosey
corner, She Was wrapped in some. silken
Oriental drapers of briltant hue and on her
bare feet sandals were fastened. Her dance
was alrnost as weird and fascinating as Van
Rattler’s performance with the snakes, but it
Was also uncanny, and lookedas thoughit had
been modelled after the convolutions of the
big boa-corgtrictor, It ended in a series of
desperate wrigwles and the dancer ran back
into the draperies while applause rewarded
her efforts

Then appeared a strange figure in the cos-
tine of a ballet girl, It waa Mr. Willie Wurmp,
fn his famous imitation of a gauve-skirted
dancer He was powdered and rouged = A
blond wig coquettishly arranged with a blue
ribbon among its curls crowned his head
and a dog collar of pearls encircled his Uiroat
Long kid gloves were drawn up on bis arts,
fastening to the shoulder straps with tiny
diamond pins The bodice was girdled
with blue satin and the myraids of white skirts
ended in two shapely legs encased in pink silk
Ughts and gold-heele satin slippers. He
wiped gracefully to the centre of the room

“Ladies and gentlemen,” he began, “with
your kind permission, I will now give vou a few
of my famous imitations.” Everybody laughed
“Imitation of Washington Crossing the Dela-
ware” fe stretched one arm into the air
and twisted his face into an expression of in-
Wepia daring, with one knee bent slightly

“Imitation of Napoleon at Saint Helena"
He folded his arms and bowed his head gloomily
on his chest

‘Imitation of Columbus Discovering America.”
He shaded his eyes with one hand and looked
off into space

Imitation of Adam and Eve l@aving the
Garden of Eden.” He turned and tip-toed
daintily into the draperies, returning in answer
to the hand-clapping to execute a burlesque
ballet: dance, after which he retreated with
humerous bows and courtesies, refusing to
repe at the performance

He's funny, isn't he?’

“Much nicer than the saoakes,’
Dobley

“T'll prasent him to you,” said Freshington,
and went off for the dancer

“Mrs. Dobley, let me present Mr
Wump,” said Freshington. Mrs.
bowed

“Charmed I am sure said Mr. Wumre
“Have you a good home, Madam?”

Mre Dobley had no time to reply to
sally for a Japanese man appeared with glas-ex
of claret punch which were pounced upon by
Wille Wump and lreshington

“It's funny.” said Willie Wump: “that the
better the society, the weaker the punch = it's
the invariable rule!”

‘I'll tell voy what
"{t needs a little-

“It needs everything ‘hat ever went
a punch bowl,” said Van Rattler. “I don't
mind people having parties here if they only
wouldn't have punch.”

“But nothing looks so lovely at a party as
a punchbowl,” said Mrs. Dobley

And nothing tastes so bad as the punch
usually,” sald €an Rattler.

"Tl have anidea,” said Willie Wurnp, tossing
back his golden curls “Pardonmea moment?"

He tiptoed to the mysterious green roorn
in the rear and came mincing back through
the room carrying a dress suit case, aimu-
lating a feminine manner of carrving a heavy
weight.

“What is he going to do now?” asked Mrs
Doblevy, while all the other guests gathered
around the gauze skipted young man.

“Something ridiilous,” sald Van Rattler

Mr. Wump epened the 4 disclosed
six gold topped champagne bottles rectit
ing in purple velvet racks. He dexterousiy
opened them and poured them into the punch
bow! after the manner of a conjurer performs
ing magical feats

“Does he carry {t round with

PAWNBROKER AS CARNIVAL KING.

Many Persons in Richmond. Va,. Worried Over
the Hon, Sam Stern's Pertinacity.

Ricunonp, Va. May 12—The first pawn-
brokerwhohasaspiredtothe dignified position
of King of the Carnival is Sam Stern, more {arni!-
{ilarly known here as the Mayor of Jefferson
ward, who is known from one end of the
ward to the other on account of his love of

notoriety and the many devices he resorts to |

in order to get into the newspapers. Stern
is exceedingly fond of personal praise He
runs a three-ball establishment on Fast Main
street and he has kept the city of Riehmond
and the representative citizens of the capital
of the old Commonwealth in aswivet for months

Stern's latest ambition is to be King of the
Grand Carnival, which will open in this city
on Monday, May 14, and run as «a great gala
week for six days. On that occasion it is ex-
pected that there will be 100 000 visitorshere
and all kind of attractions, such as vandevillas,

music, minstrels, astreet fair, amilitary parade, |

pyrotechnics and everything that can attract
the country cousins. During the week the third
warship launched fin Richmond since the war
will glide from the ways, being the Thornton,
one of the five torpedo boats under constriec-
tion here for the Navy Department.

When the first of the five, the Shubrick,

was launched, Sam.Stern was in his glory.
He rode in a carriage, wore a silk hat. anda
coloasul diamond shirt stud resembling one
of Roberts's searchlights in South Africa and
sat within three feet of resident
who was hero as the guest of the city. Stern's
self-constituted conspicuous part in the pro-

cession and in the public ceremonies worried |

the citizens of Richmond no little. Kyery-
where that anybody looked and in every fea-
tyre of the programme Stern turned up un-
expectedivy. He looked upon himself as the
real thing

Some time after that he announced himself
as a candidate for Mayor of Richmond By
reason of his large following here among pa-
trons of the pawnbrokers it was really feared
that if he continued to be a candidtae he would
be elected, Finally he. withdrew, however,
with the announcement that he would be in the
race next time and would make if warm for
the incumbent, which he will probably do

When it was announced that the public would
he called upon to vote for the king of the car-
nival, whieh is considered a place of high dlenity
and popularity, a doven or more names of the
most wealthiest and public-spirited citizens were
published as available and the newspapers
suggested that they be voted for It was
announced by the Carnival Committee that
whoever received the most votes at lv vents a
vote would ride in the king's chariot, decor-
ated in beautiful style, and would be the real
hero of the week, to whom all homage would
he due Stern anr ced himself as an inde-
pendent candidate tor King of the carnival

The interesting part of the thing is
he is now in the lead tor king. Mr. John Skelton
Williams, President of the Seaboard Air Line
system, by reason of the expenditure of a great
deal of monev here in the way of railroad ter-
minals and | istrial developments, has

“Men are so queer,” said Dorothy plaintively,
holding the end of her scarf away from her
face, where the wind was blowing it, and turn.

the red roses as long as Lcould. “I wonder if I

finally, opening my purse, But T had not!

“It is surprising to find out how many things

the air of a stoic, “Why, Lhave been getting

again, “Men are so queer |

No.” said the two seuted inen he was ad-

“Certainly is queer what freaky ideas they get
into their heads,” went on the man with the ray-
elled cigar, ignoring the lack of encouragement
extended to him, “And when it comes to pick-
ing out good things on a racetraek, picking ‘em
out just on hunch, ain't they wonders, hey?”

“Nope,” said the two men at whotmn he was
directing his conversation

“It sure beats the Painted Post Silver Cornet
Band how they can stick a pin in a programme

Ue granulated eyelids, tearmg two or three
superfluous wrappers off his ravelled cigar
“Their system beats the dope and the handi-
capping all to shucks, don't it?

‘NIX,” replied the twomen in the seat

“Never had such chance to size up the feni-
nine hunch as I did out at Morris Park ‘bout six
Or seven years ago,” Went on the man with the
eccentrics cigar. “Told my wife one night
during the fall meeung at the park that 1 was
going to the races the next day, that a shoe

Mrs. Broadway was well pleased with this
arrangement. It was 10:20 when Mr. Broadway
reached the prosperous tuloring establishment
n Lexington avenue, where, according to
Mrs. Broadway's version, her expensive gown
was being muned by inches. Mr. Broadway
had hever been in @ woman's tailor shop before

The small boy's manner was so very con-
eliatory that Mr Broadway felt his resent-
nent against a tailor who would dare lay a
destructive hand on a five-dollar-a-yard piece
of broadcloth gradually vanishing beneath
the benign influence. He would have returned
the boy's nods and smiles with equal unction

nately appeared and reminded Mr, Broadwa)
what he was there for. The manager was
also the embodiment of suavity and to pick
a quarrel with hun seemed like shying stones
at an angel, but now that he remembered the
chip on his shoulder. Mr. Broadway suddenly
bristled with pugnacity and boldly threw out
tos challenge. After he had talked for about
two ininutes the manager attempted to inter-
wlate a few explanatory remarks but Mi
srondway shut tim off peremptorily. He
had come to the shop to talk and he knew thar
if he did not say what he had on his mind while
no the mood for it, he probably would never
agai get worked up to the proper piteh where
he could do his share toward freeing the women
York from the galling thraldoin of
Unserupulous tailors. So he continued talk-
ing He talked for ten minutes, At the end
of that time the manager was red in the face
and fairly grovelled onthe rug at his feet. At
sight of this humility Mr. Broadway became
more tractable

"My wite seems to be still engaged in the
workroom,” he said. “I am very busy this
morning and think I ahall not wait to see her
Tel! her, please, that [ was here.”

Then he went away very well satisfied with
himself. But with characteristic optimism
he overestiniated the rewards of virtue. His
homecoming, instead of being enlivened by
smiles and pleasant words

Mrs) Broadway had been leaning limply
