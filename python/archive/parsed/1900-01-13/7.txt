THEY'RE

BIS SALE OF STANDARD GAS STOCK
CAUSKS COMPLAINT,

Fellow Directors in the Company Don't
Think the Veteran Financier Kept Faith
With Them-—The Meriing Hold Yester-
day Said to Have Been a Very Lively One.

 

None of the directors of the Standard Gas
Light Company, all of whom attended the regu-
ler monthly meeting of the board yesterday,
was willing after the meeting to tell what had
taken piace at it, It was reported in Wall

| their raflroad.

Btreet, however, that there hal been quite a |

lively time, the directors having taken turns in
vigorously criticising the course of iKnesell
Bago in selling most of hie Standart Gas Light
atock without having first toll them that he
contemplated doing #0. They assert that Mr,
Gage had agreed not to dispose of hia stock un-
leas the same terms were accorded by the pur-
ehasing interest to al! the other stockholders
ofthe company for their holdings.

Mr. Sage, who was at (he meeting, declined
postively tosay what had occurred It was
learned that he was a@tl!!l President of the
company, but it could not be learned whether
he had been asked t> resign bis Mee. fils
term expires in April. One of the directors,
who was seen, “ald

“We had a lovely meeting. I
not bein Russel! Sage’s shoes for all his
$76,000,000, Thera
money !n this world.”

He deolined to be more explicit os to why he
referred tothe meeting asa “lovely” one
Bage's salary as President of the Standard Com-
pany, this director sald, 19 $5,000 a year. Prom
another source it wae learne! that the buyers
of Mr, Sage's stock, the Standard O.. {aterests
inthe Consolidated Gas Company, have aso

equired other biocka of Standard (as eh
foeely, although not enough to carry contro! o
the company. Wi!liam Rockefeller was said to
have calied upon Mr Sage at hiso Mee on numer.
ous ocoasiona an’ tohave heentold by Mr Sage
that he would not sell unless the oth r holders
of the etock also got the benelir
price. r, Sage is said to have given Mr. Rock-
efelier acertain price as the onaat which he
would gel] if the rest were willing. Later, how-
ever, A. C. Burrage of Boston, one of the
Standard Oil lawyers, {a reported to have called
upon Mr. Sage with acheck made out for the
exact amount tha’ his stock would bring fig-
ured at the price Mr sage had mentioned, the
result being a transfer to Mr. sage of the
check.

| WEW SCHEME OF JUDGE GAYNOBRB’S

 

To Enable Stockholders to Get at Accounts |
of Corporations.

Bupreme Court Justice Gaynor tn Brooklyn |
yesterday denied the application o! Bert Reiss
@s a atockholder of the American &pirits
Manufacturing Company for a writ of man-
damus to compel the officers of the company to

rmit him to inspect the books. He did so oa
he ground that the books of the corporation |
did not show that Mr. Kelss was a stockholder.

“Tt may well be sugested,” sald the Justice,
“that corporations of the 6/ze of this one, if not
al corporations, should keep their booksin |
duplicate, one set prepared to be examined by
the stockholders at their pleasure. To place
the acts of the directors open to such scrutiny
would prevent ninety-nine hundredths of the
wrong they do to stock holders,”

THE SUN, SATURDAY,

FINANCIAL AND COMMERCIAL,

 

Parpay, Jan. 12,

A reduction of 1 per cent. bythe Imperial
Bank of Germany to its offictal discount rate,
a decidedly easier local money market, in-
dications of an exellent showing by the Asso-
etated Banks to-morrow, and, finally, encourag-
ing news regarding the movements of the
English forces in South Africa were the factors
that influenced the speculation in stocks
today, The further improvement in monetary
conditions abroad resulted {n moderate pur-
chases of stooks here by foreign arbitrage
houses. Some of the amalier operators jor
short account became sufficiently apprehenaive
at thia development to cover their contracta,

| and by doing so they contributed to an early

rally in prices, The larger operators on tho short
aide betrayed no such timidity, but sold stocks
freely at the advance, and apparently gained
confidence because prices yielded under their
sales. It waa significant, however, that they
did not succeed tn dislodging stocks nor !{n
forcing fresh Iquidation, and that the decline
ceased as 800N As they stopped selling.

Long before the close of business it became
plain that the market had been sold practically
to a standstill, and the appreciation of that fact
{nduced buying chiefly to close ventures on the
short aide of the market, that resulted tn a
sharp recovery throughout the Iist. Final fig-
ures for the stocks most extensively dealt In
were 1% percent. or more above yesterday's
closing prices, Sugar Refining, in which the
dealings were lesa than half as jarge a8 yester-
day, enjoyed a net advance of SS per cent.
Other noteworthy net gains were 1% percent. in
American Tabacco, 1% in Southern Pacific, 1%
{n Baltimore and Ohio, 1\ in Manhattan Rail-
way and Federal Steel common, 2 Iu Louisville
and Nashvilleand 1% percent. fn Union Pacifio
common. Inthe Granger group Chicago. Bure
ington and Quincy was exceptionally strong.
The hest feature of the market was the in-
ereased activity in bonda at advancing prices,
This indicates that Inveators are beginning to
appreciate the fall in rates for money.

It appears from the usual figures printed
furtheron in this column that the principal
Clearing House banks have gained $4,000,000
net cash thisweek. Besides, receipta of curs
rency through the mails have been over

2,000,000, indicating a net gain tn cash for the
week of over $6,000,900, As to-day's receipts
of cash from the interior were unusually heavy,
it {a safe to assume that to-morrow's bank
statement wil! be made upon rising averages
aa tocash on hand, The closing of the etock
market was strong at about the best prices of
the day. ca
