Much of the State legislation favorable to
wheelmen, secured by the L. A. W,, such as
the ‘Collins Universal Ordinance Jaw,’ the
‘Good Roads law,’ the ‘Guide Board jaw,’ the
‘Wide Tirelaw.’ and the ‘Sidepath law,’ has
proved inoperative, because in the various
towns, villages and cities there hua been no
organized force to urge the enforcement of the
laws. In order thatourmembers might secure
} benefite to @ greater extent, the pian of
forming local asaoelations or organizations of
J.-A Wo members throughout the State was
adopted. The Loeal Consulate is an organi.
vation of League members, in any eity or town,

whoare willing to assist {u the work of the

Regarding the plan proposed by a num ber of
the racing officials ofthe L. A. W, for the ors
ganization to abandon professional racing and
seek to govern only the amateur riders, Secre-
tary-Treasnrer Bull sald yesterday

“To my mind it is too late for auch aeompro-
inise, New York State had the same pen.
tiontomakea yearago. That was before the
N.C. A. had aff! ated with it so many repre-
sentative amateur riders and clubs, here is
just one way that I can see that this thing
eould be successful, and thatisfor the leaders
of the L.A. W and of the N.C. A, to meet tn
friendiv conclave and agrea to swap off the
League's professional ridera for the N.C. A.'s
amateurs, and to agree upon rules to be mutu-
ally recounized. The N.C. A. would not now
iwrea to such & compromise, and for tha
Teague to go ahead and give up the profes-
sionals and fight another year to govern the
amateurs would be {ke admitting that it was
half licked already.”

Trotting Turf Officials Revise the Racing
Code,

The conference between officials of the N, T.
A. and the A, T, A. ended yesterday afternoon
atthe Murray Hill Hotel. During the cay the
members of the joint committee, who had bur-
jed the hatchet and signed the treaty of j ace,
went over the turf codes of the two associations
and proceeded to harmonize all differences, so
that when thelr work has been ratifled by
the members, as tt doubtless will be, uniform
rules will govern all trotting races in the
United States and Canada,

While the magnates decided not to make
known the result of their revision of the ru
it i4 understood that the new code will tn
nearly all cases follow the existing rules of the
N.T. A. This is the older code, and has been
more extensively adjudicated than the other
In some pointa the A. T. A, rules will be fol-
lowed, as the Western League has madeafew

mprovements onthe oi code which was in
force when that organization was foruied
thirteen years ago. ‘The revised er

ciations, will be ready for pu! lication in a few

them from deuce, The fifth game was easily

eet by taking the last three games. The
Inglishman won three deuce games tn this

putting up a much stronger article of play,
which resnited favorably for him. The frat

OCMADWICK TELLS OF SANTIAGO,

Swashing of Cervera’s Fleet, He Says,
Marked the End of the War.

Capt. lrench BF. Chadwick, who was Rear
Admiral Sampson's chief of staff and eoms
mander of the flagehip New York during the
Spanish war, addressed the Gensological and
Biographten! Soelety last evering on the
Naval campatgn ogainst the Spaniards with
reference to Cuba and Puerto Rieo, Capt.
Chadwick aketched the operations of the fleet
from April 21 tothe fall of Santiago, He said that
not the fullof theelty, but the destruction ofthe
fleet of Admiral Cervera, marked the end of the
war, since, without a feeton this sido of the
Atlantic, Spain was doomed #o faras her col-
vere concerned, Roferring to the early
Attemptto blockade Cuba with the lowa and
three other ships, Capt. Chadwick polnted out
its futility and, drawing attention to the em-
ploymentof our fast erulsers {n the Flying
quadron, stationed at Hampton Roads, ho res
marked: "These ought all to have gono to
Cuba; but our friends at home were badly
aeared, apparently.”

Capt, Chadwick let some light upon the eap-
ture of the first prize of the war, that of the
steamehip Buena Ventura, which showed ft to
be, in miniature, a eomponton pices of naval

rowesa tothe reduction of Guam, When the

ucna Ventura’s skipper saw the Yankee war.

‘Tt he hadn't hoisted his colors.” Capt, Chad-
wiek said, “he wouldn't hove been taken.”

Bpoaking of the exigencies of biockade duty,
he said that the telephone syste on the ships
proved unreliable, and thatil became neces.
gary to fall baek on oral tronsiaissions o
orders, even chaplains being Impressed into
the service

Capt Cha !wiek did not speak Rehley's nama,
He referred to him or his cominane twice.in the
remerk about the flying squadron, already
mentioned, and again when, in talking of

#mipsen’s effort to catch up with Cervera and
head off Schley, he sald that upon hearing that
the Commodore in command of the squadron
kent from Clenfiegos to santiago intended to
return to Key West, the commander-in-ehief
determined to go utonce to Santia arriving
there on June Toand establishing a blockade a

tested the batteries, his chief-of-staf? sald, to
find out their probable effleacy against the

and learning what he wantedto know of their
