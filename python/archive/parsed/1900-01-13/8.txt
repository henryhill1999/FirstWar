Fifty citizens of the upper part of Manhattan
nd The Broux called on Mayor Van Wyck |
seetor'du under the leadership of ex-Alder-

Woodward to tell btm that they belleved

r

see trooee Cover was a bad man, who was de-

goting much time to an effort to prevent the
ting

aonatruction of a rapid transit tunnel in those
boroughs untl afferatunnel had been built to
South Brooklyn This Idea seems to be widely
entertaine tin the upper part of the city, where
the Hon John Whalen, Corporation Counsel,
has been acitating recently the building of the
rapid tral teystem. Mr. Coler bas explained

his position s veral times, and yesterday he |

sald that it appeared to him as though Mr.
Whalen was making @ desperate effort atthe
Jast moment toconvinee the voters that he had
done more for rapid transit than any one olse,

The delegation which called on Mayor Van
Wyek ha! appointed Newell Martin as {ts prin-
eipal speaker Mr. Martin sald that residenta
inthe upper part of the city were alarmed at
the resoution whieh Mr, Coler introduced at
the meeting of the Rapid Transit Commission-
epson Tussday, and that they believe tt to
have been drawia by “interested parties’ who
wanted (o Jelay Work on the original tunnel
and prevent the construction of anything ex-
cept the first avction, Mr. Martin took pains to
say that he didn’t ‘mpute any bad motive to
the Comptroller, but he thought the resolution
concealed the most insidious attack which had
yet been made on rapid transit,

“Mr. Mayor,” said Mr. Martin, “if you carry
this rapid transit matter through, your name
wil! go down to posterity with that of De Witt
Clinton.”

“I'm not looking for reputation after I’m
dead,” said the Mayor,

“We're not looking for reputation at all,” said
Mr. Martin. “We're looking for transporta-

tion.”
“Why.” said the Mayor, “I don’t believe that

 

there isa single Rapid Transit Commissioner |

who would put a straw inthe way of the tun-

pel’

“Neither do we,” said Mr, Martin and several
others.

“I'm sare I won't retard it,’ said the Mayor,

Assembiyman M, M. Minton of the Twenty.
third district said that he had Leen informed
that sections one and two of the tunnel oniy
might be built. Mr, Minton sald that what the
people wanted was simultaneous work on at
least tnree sections of the tunnel, and if pos-
sibie, on all of It, the contracts to be given out
at once

“We ask that the four sections be built be-
fore there /s any tunnel under the East River,”
sald Mr. Minton. ‘We want more than your
eymoathy. We want your earnest help.”

“The Comptroller's) the father of , that
South Brooklyn tunnel, isn't he?” said the
Maror, scans

"Yes," said Mr, Minton, “We're in favor of
our tunnel first.”

“Weil,” said the Mayor, “he’s the only one
I know who's in favor of it, You knowl don’t
father it.”

“Will the city have enough money for all of |

the tunnels?” asked Mr Minton.

‘You'll have to ask the Comptroller,” said
the Mayor.

Then James L. Wells made a speech, in
which he said that the Comptroller had made
‘ertain definite statements atthe public hear.
‘nu before the Rapid Transit Commission, and
jad then, in the board's executive session, in-
troduced a resolution which was direerly oppo.

site to what he had said, and in opposition to |

the tunne

“How's that?” said the Mayor

“Here's the resolution,’ said Mr, Wells,

The Mayor read it through,

‘You'd better read it again,” said the Mayor
“That says nothing about stopping work on
your tunnel to bulid another one,’

Mr. Walce read the resolution, When he had
finished, the Mayor sail: “Now gentlemen,
you've done a great injustice to the Comp.
troller, He has been charged here with saying
one thing and doing another, There ia noth.
ing in his resolution to bear out your charge
You ought te read it earefally, Have you any
fear of the Mayor?”

“No,” said al! The Bronxites

“Well, you needn't hay

 

  

said his Honor,

  

“T’ve always been lo faveref rapid transit, In
My opinion, this isth  iirst time the Commis.
@ioners have Leen able to see daylight.”

“In the event of there being no bila on the

‘Suffleent unto the stheevil thereof,"
said the Mayog “Let's not eross any bredges
intil we conto them

When Comptrolier Coler heard what had been
sald in the Mavor s oMfee, he said

“The construction of the tunnel was made
poseible through the adoption of anamendment
tothe Constitution separating the debtof New
York county from the ety tebe hot

REBUKED JURY TALKS BACK

 

MEMBERS SAY JUDGE COWING HAD |

NO RIGHT 70 CALL TAEM pown,

Declare They Ave as Much « Part of the
Court as He and That the Verdict Was
Honestly and Conascientionsly Rendered

Didn't Gelleve Policeman's Evidence,

Several members of the jury which was eo
sharply rebuked by Judge Cowing In Part ID,
General Sessions, on Tharsday, becwuse they
acquitted Samuel Semachowiltz of 50 Delancey
street ofa charge of violating the Excise law,
Wereon duty again vesterday in that court,
despite the Judge's advice to the District At-
torney todischarge the whole paneland get a
hew one made upof men who would listen ta
evidence and aet oon tt Some o! the yurymen
were still angry beeause of the “eall-down”
they received from the Court, but the majority
of then were rather amused and intimated
thatadudge who called a jury to account for
not seeing things as he saw them made him-
se'f rather ridiculous,

Judge Cowing's outburst was the result ofan
ageravating condition of things, whieh has
been steadiiy growing Worse in) hia court,
Many exelse cases have been on trial thera

Prneipal Withesses against the alleged law
Vv olators, and if the evidence they giveis true,
there can be scarcely any doubt of the guilt of

tals that have come so thick and fastof tate
canonly be taken as indieating uabelief on the

roused the Judge's ire as it has not been
roused before caring his time on the bench,

Y donot want to show any disrespect tothe

P man, because that would not be trae, but in

real object of the arresc to be wuessed at

“Th his original charge against this man he

al, in one piace or the other, and when a polices
man tells two stores, contradicting himself
on such an important detail, it indicates
that he ‘sn’t very sure of what he's
taiking atout himself Again, the poliee-
man testifies that when he made his
identity known to Semachowitzon the night in

me that if semachowitz hadn't ‘sassed’ the po-
iceman he wouldn't have been arrested, But
he was arreste., and for being impudenttoa
policeman, yet he was brought into eourt and
before ajury, charged with violating the Excise
law

“Now, there are just one or two things to
