Ro Big Wagers Laid, and the Difference
Between Timekerper and Referee € avaed
the Trouble—This Would Have Heen
Avoided Had English Cuetom Prevatled.

The unsatisfactory remit of the MeCoy-Choyn-
aki glove contest ut the Pradway A. G om
Friday nlght waa widely discussed yesterday.
Many persona belleve the statement of mensa-
thon mongers that Choynal.! was “Intentionally
robbed In order to protect Hie wamrere placed upen
MeCoy by persons identified with the club.” Others

| was the bright ataron the wioning tear.

'

were convinced that the troulle waa caused by |

@ misunderstanding between the referee and the
official timekeaper Choynski’s statement tm-

mediniely after the fight that the referee wae)

not to blame and thet it was the timekeeper's
action tn ringing the bell aa MeCoy got up from
his fourth knockdown that caused the muddie
was taken as proof that there waa no alleged
"job,"

While Joseph Dunn, the official timekeeper
of the club, would make no @tatament concern:
fng the rumpus, it Is known that he rang the
bell because, according to tie watch, McCoy
was on the floor more than ten seconds after his
fourth knockdown tn
the exciiement that followed,

the gong, at the seme time making 4 remark to
Choynsk!'s timekeeper that !t was “all over.”
That was the cause of the whole trouble and
further illustrates the fallacy of allowing referees
fn local clubs to count off the (me limit for kmocks
downs regardiesa of the watch

‘There have been many instances where ft has
been atated that pugilists have been on the floor
more than ten seconds by the watch and yet have
not been counted out. It was aaid that Fitzsim-
mons was down fourteen sec nds in the sixth
round of his Aght with Corbett at Carson City
end yet the referee counted off ning eer nds be-
fore Fitz got up. In the MeCoy-Sharkey fight
@ year ogo it was sald that McCoy was down
more than thelimitin theeighth round, although
the count was carefully made by ‘Tim Hurst
the referee. Maherand McCoy bad it announced
on New Year's Dry that in case of knuckhdowns
they agreed to allow Leveree Charley White to
count the seconds according to his own judg-
ment and regardie the watch, ‘lhere bas
mot been a fight decided in any of the local clubs
since the law weit iuto effect in which the referee
has counted strictiy inaccordance with the actual
us. Referens try to guess at it as well as they
know how and most of them are inclined to be
lenient 90 as t) give the crowds “A run for their
money.” For this reason wang pugilists take
advantage of the ccunt when they are really
able to get up belvore the limit

onds strictly according to elapsed time and had

done s witha watch inhishand, {tis more than

probable that McCoy would have been able to |

rise at the expiration of the tenth seeond

{t was he got up when the releree said “Ten!”
which was two seconds Inte, according to the
watches of Dunn and Choynski's timer. McCoy

was in great distress, it is admitted, but he was
able to strike a blow an! clinch before Dunn rang
his gong 4 half dozen times asa signal that the
battle had ended. ‘There were forty seconds
left to complete the second round and as the men
went to their corners the referee asked Dunn
why he had rung the bell. The latter declared
that he thought McCoy had been counted out
which promptly caused a wrangle that lasted
about one minute and forty seconds, or in other
words forty seconds remeining for the second

The charge that Choynski was deprived of
victory by this incident is based upon what appears

to be sound judgment, for ifthe b Ib had not tolled |

fter the count on tia fourth knock down It ts
easonable ty believe that in the remaning forty
ronda MeCoy might have been knocked out.
The Kid was so weak that another one of Choyn-
eki's heavy blows, tt is thought, would have
finished him. Wut the rest of one minute and
forty seconds he enjoyed brought MeCoy back
into the game in comparatively good shape
It was his physical condition that enabled Me
Coy to last throweh the third round in spite of
being grogey. Choynski was visibly weakened
by his efforts to secre a knock-out in the previous
pound and as MeCoy showed superior cleverness
p reaching vulnerable points, the latter fought
oe off, ‘The knock-out blow aduuuistered by
McCoy a second after the bell had en: (

Was such coofusion and disorder in

MeCoy heard it or not cuts no figure with the

custom that prevails in almost every ring in this
country not to declare @ foul under such eircum
6tances, Unless the blow looks intentional. Hef

NEWS OF THE WIEELMEN,

COLLECTOR OF PORT BIDWELL TO BB
UK@ED FOR L, 4. W. PACSIDENT.

 

 

Ex-President Potter Says He Would Be an
Ideal Candidate--A Strong Man Is Neei-
ed to Guide the Leagne—-Keenan Besking
@ Re-nomination ~The Coming Show

There never has been a time In the history.
the L. A. W. when it ao much needed » popular
and competent leader an at present, an! there
never was 4 time when there seemed ty bess foe
eligible for the Presidency. A firm and judte\cue
man and an organizer, one whose experience with
the League and whose past record would inspire
confidence, is needed. Cooke, Choate, Dorner
and others have been mentioned, but not «ns -+
them haa appealed to those who know the men
and the oceasion as being just right. So far as
is known, only one man baa been seeking tie
office and that is the present incumbent. Mean
while those whose votes will elect have been
casting about for some one more preferable. 14
has been recognized that President Keenan |e
unpopular in various parta of the country. New
York, with ite big bunch of votes, would like
another candidate, and now the President has
aroused the fre of Massachusetta by ordering an
election there. It {a becoming generally un-
derstood that Keenan in his hunt for the office
will turn his back upon those who elected him
last year and advocate the abolition of racing
In the absence of any other strong candidate
he might in this way be elected, but there hae
been for months a cry for some man who would
accept the votes of the assembly on the anti-racing
platform After canvassing the names of all
persons big enough for the place, a few of those
who lead in New York affairs suddenly though?
of the name of Bidwell. It acted like magic on
the group. If George R. Bidwell, the Collector
of the Port of New York, would accept the office
he would be one upon whom all could unite and
he would be a veritable Moses to lead the organ.
zation out of Ite disordered condition Collector
Bidwell is one of the veteran members of the
L. A. W. He was one of the first three men at
Buffalo to ride the old high wheel. He was one
of the earliest Chief Consuls of the New York
State division He was the first Chief Consul
of the State to raise 4 strong cry for good roada
work by the League He was one of those who
went to Albany toseek the passage of the “Liberty
bill" in, 1887, thatgave bicycles the rightso! veh!
cles and he was chiefly influential in having the
bill made a law. Subsequently Bidwell served
as 4 Vice President of the League In onepos
tion after another he was always known ‘sa good
roads advocate and an able ona His popularity
in the League has al ways been of national great

ness and without a flaw. The Collector could
not be found last night t) say whether or nit he
would accept a nomination fir the Presidency
of the L. A. W._ A reporter of Tre SuN asked
ex-President L. B. Potter what kind of an officer
Caljector Bidwell would make. This was hia
reply
He would make an {deal president He fe a
man with a splendid record in league work
He is a man of rare executive ability. breed gree
and a great organizer. J have not aeen Mr. Bid:
well recently and do not know whether or not
he would consent to the use of his name aaa can
didate and therefore | would not put him forth
as such, but if you ask simply what kind of a
resident he would make my only answer fe that
e would be the ijeal man for the place.”
Secretary Treasurer Bull and other membere
of the division concurred in these etatementa
The wires were set to working to find out how
the West and other sections of the country would
regard Bid vell aaa candidate. After the pulse
of the de'eg tes to the National Assembly haa
been felt Co.lector Bidwell will be asked to be
come the candidate of New York and the FPastern
States. One man who is 4 personal friend of the
Collector said when spoken to on the matter:
“The Collector is a very busy man and tf he
was asked to be a candidate and enter the cam-
ign at Philadelnhia he would be likely to refuse.
Whe thing to be done is for the New York men to
go ahead and get tho assurance to show how
easily he would be elected and then tender to
him the certaluty.”

 

While the true type of ecrcitng enthustasts
are as keen os ever to investigate and ergue the
points of new models, and while the cycle show
that opens on next Saturday wil) he ensentially
the same as ever- a bicycle exposition, it is al-
ready plain that itis going to be almost as much
an affair of the automobile as of the hicycle
There will be many changes in the famillar part
of cycles to he studied, but the developments
{fu the motor vehicles will have an attractive:
ness of novelty not now possessed by the detalis
of the wheel, The advocates of steam, naphtha
and electricity will ail be represented in the metor
vehicle display and machines that range in price
from 8600 to 83,000 will te shown, so tnat the
bewilderment over what tocbuy will be as great
as it was over cycles 4 few years ago when every
wheel differed radicaily. In bieveles the features
will he new things in the way of chainiess gears,
modifications of lines, weight and bearings, be-
sides the usual crop of novelties in accessories,
chief of which will be the coaster brakes.

Rhode Isiand yesterday stepped to the front
with its chief Consul as a candidate for the Vice-
Presidency of the I, A, W., #2 the following let-
ter signed by Howard L, Perkins, Percy A. Har
den and Nelson H. Gibbs shows:

The Rhode Island Division at its Laat meeting
voted to place Cef Consul George Lewis Cooke
before the next National Assembly asa candidate
for one of the Vice-Presidents, Hehas been a mem
berofthe National Assembly for eleven years and
Chief Conan! of his division for sig years, and bia
good works are shown in the standing of bie di
vision, which now ranks seventh tn numerical
streneth, He has also served as chairman of the
National Rights and Pivileges and Membership
comtuitters, Rhode Island has never bad a ne
tional office, and while the claims of the division
were presented at the last asaen bly they were with-
drawn in the interest of harmony

Chief Consul Cooke is opposed to the LL. A. W
control of racing, He would probably receive
the support of New York on any Ucket of which
the head was satisfactory,

 

 

The Automobile Club of Amartea has chosen
{ts country clubhouse and will take possession
on March 1 Itis the Kingsland Pointmansion
and grounds inthe Tappan Zee on the Hudson,
The property covers 233 acres and is liberally
grown over with trees. Tt is twenty-six miles
from the city over goo roads, The use of the
house and grounds has been given to the elub
by John Brisben Waiker for one year, free of
rent.

A new atyle of tire pump has bean made
necessary by the use of the large sized pneus
matic tires on motor cycles and aulomobilee
At first those tires were inflate! by means of
stored jara of con pressed air that were filled bs
the use of machinery, but levices ary now ap-

rearing that enable a manto fill the big tires
by hand without unreasonable work. One
maker has constructela pump which gives a
pressure of 600 pounds ‘othe square inch and
will fill an automobile tire with @ few strokes of
the lever.

 

A cycle dealer sald yesterday; “The women
whocycle in winter should have it impre-aed
upon them that they shoud rig their wheels
for winter work a8 well as thernselves, Those
who ordinarily pedal an S0-gear sould pation
one of, say 70, and those who usea 70 should
dropto about ts) There are a @reat many
women ona wheel this winterand | frequently
findthem beeoming discouraged because they
ey ao tired pushing against the wind with
hich gears, They woul! be af right with low
gears, but they do not seem to understand this
tact.”

inw at middle distanve be’ore he has attained
his growth and become settle | physica ly was
illustrated yesterday by a fifteen-year-old
yours who becamo very prominent last year

into a cycling academy where there was a
trainer of wile experience. As the boy went
aeross the halland left, the trainer called at-
tention to the fact that he was loping along o
his toes in @ very peculiar way, “That
