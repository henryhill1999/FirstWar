=—Trimmings of Dressy Go -Develop-

ments of the Bolero Styles of the
Costumes for Brides and Their Bride-
maids Gowns for Wear ib the South,

The present phase of fashion as it appears in
the shops is as inconirucus as a feverish dream
asort of whirlwind of winter furs and diaphanous
things for summer combined, but all the more at
tractive for the striking contrast it affords, It us
like a promise of spring in midwinter to see the
dainty lawns, embroidered Swiss ginghams and
colored piques spread out for inspection, and
women are on the outlook for everything and any-
thing new in the way of fashions for summer
dress. However much a woman may protest
agalost her sex's reputed love of new clothes, {tis
all there if she is a true woman, and it really does
not matter so much whether the clothes are for
present use or for six months benee, so long as
she can only buy new things and get ahead of
herself in the accumulation of a summer outfit

Something pretty for waisis.and entire dresses,
if you can afford the extravagance, isan allover
exquisitely embroidered batiste in the pale biscuit
tints, It comes in charming lace-uke patterns,
in double width, with beautiful insertions to match,
Other noveities in batiste are the robe dresses of
white embroidered with pale colorsin a bow-knot
Pattern with sealoped ruffles for & finish Col
ored batistes are embroidered with white in the
eame patiern

The epecial fade! the woment is the taffeta and
China silk squares for separate waists They
come in Persian designs in an indescribable vari
ety of colors, but some of the most effective are tn
mixtures of gray, biack and white on different
colored piain grounds which show in a border
around the edge frimged fully one inch wide In
tafleta the squares are large, two being required
for a waist, and are used in combination with
plain taffeta in black, white of @ color to match
the ground! ‘This is used for a plaited vest, from
which the fringed corners turn back in soft revers,
and sometimes for sleeves with a cap of the figured
silk at the top In the China silk squares three
are required fora bodice, and they are not fringed
The pastel tints in the taffeta squares are exquisite
ly soft, while the China silks show a brighter
coloring

Something very charming among the new ma-
terials is the figured crepe de chine allin one color
Large flowers overiapping ove another in con-
ventional disorder have the appearance of being
pressed into the surface, giving a very pretty
effect without the help of any variation in color-
ing This stuff costs 87 a yard, bat it is double
width and very durabie, so it is not so cosuy as
it seems

Some of the details of dress which will char-
acterize the coming fashions are tho continued
use of plaits, and tucks in very conceivable form,
and the cape effect around the shoulders, which
will materialize in various ways. The prettiest
form of the cape effect is a deep collar of heavy
lace falling just @ bit over the points of the
shoulders to give the broad look which the new
close fitting sleeve does not supply. A little
cape, or deep collar, made of @ series of shaped

 

folds of cloth, each edged with narrow lace ap

Plique, rows of stitehing, or very narrow: fringe |

which matches the cloth in color, is another
edition of this idea which may be anticipated
for the new spring gowns These cape collars
and the short boleros are evidently manifesta
tiona of fashion to which we can pin our faith,
4s there are no violent revolutions in sight

A derided change in skirts is promised
but it seems to consist principally, so far as heard
from, in still more careful close fitung around
the hips, and not in any reduced quantity of ma
terial required, or any waning popularity for the
plaite which are so much in evidence just at the
moment. The graceful flare which adds so much
to the beauty of outline will be increased rather
than lessened, and plain shirts evidently will
be quite out of the question Absolutely plain

place in the winter fashions, and summer gowns
