year, barring Brookly Turning to the fall

meeting records for the same years one finds a |

range from the 34 per cent. of 1599 to the 46 per
cent. of 1804 and the 45 per cent. of 1896, Here
are good averages enough in all conscience, but
the average man loses sight entirely ¢ f the obvious
fact that because he has won at Morris Park,
spring, thus evidencing either a succession of
favorites or the success of bis personal choices,
the natural maturing of chances bas returned
the pendulum on a backward swing, fur over
to the losing side at Sheepshead, ready for the
high percentage due either at Brighton Beach
or Saratoga, generally at the latter, If a close
analysis was mado it would be found that when
on individual lost at Morris Park he would win
a) Sheepshead but of this no one could convince
him. This was bing discussed the other night
and one man said

“It is all nonsense. 1 will bet any man any day,
or every day that he cannot uame the winner
of race after trace, $50 on each bet, win or lose,
and | have never met yet a man who would take
me on!"

He evidently thought this argument was a
clincher, and it was evident it was not the fret
time he had brourhtit out. The answer ename
from an unexpected quarter

“Do you know why you never found a taker™

“No,”

“Well, imply becatse you are on!y offering even
money, whereas on your stool at the track you
will be offering an avernge of 7-5 against the favor
ites, and if the man's choices should not be favor
{tes you will probably be offering an average
of up to 10-1, He would be a foo! to take your
offer of evens. Til tell you whatl willda Send
out for two new packs of cards. These contain
fifty-two red and fifty-two black cards. Take
out twenty-six of the black, leaving twenty-six
black and fif y-two red cards. You shall shuffte
them as much as you like, and then lay them,
backs uppermost, on the table, turning the cards
one by one I will make a bet with vou before
each card is turned and T will back the black,

This was done. The first bet was 810 anda

Take the first twelve deve, for analysis, the
others overlapping into the following meeting aa
far AS sequence Ls concerned, It must be first re
menibered that, nearing the end of the year’s
Sport, conditions are becoming settled, and thus
) when 1896 is looked at it will be seen that the aver-

was 45 per cent, of just over the average 43 per
cent, and therefore it was fair to expect at Brook-
lyn of that year the fall to 88 per cent; in sae?
the previous nieetings averaged 43 per cent.,
nermal ane the 36 per cent egain sppaaiel,
pointing to the great possibility in 1898 (when 43
per cent. eae came out on the five meetings previ-
ous), thata rising rate was due, because of the low
averages of Susepshead and Brighton Beacn
of that year, following the high 51 per cent and
50 per cent, of the two first meetings of the season.
In other words, 1898 was a year of acute contrasta,
meeting after meeung, and this higher reach in
turn foretold the general low average of 1899, only
one meeung, of course, Sheepshead spring, shows
ing o higher figure than the corresponding meet-
tog of the year previous: the Brooklyn fall, drop
ping from the 44 per cent. of 1888 to the 39 per
cent, of 1890, just along the reverse line, Con- |
sidering 1896, it will be seen that the first six days
wed thirieen winners, or 386 per cent, these
coming in four blocks of two each and singles;
! 1807 followed with fifteen winners, or 41 percent, |
} dropping in three bloeks of two each and two |
| blocks of three; 180% showed thirteen wins, the |
same as 1846, in one block of four and one of two
winners: 1889 handed out twelve, or 83 per cent, |
nly two blocks of two winners, consecus |
y, a hard problem for the duplicate favorite
players as many af them doubtlessly remember. |

 

 

 

ow note that 186 was above the average per-
» when this meeting opened, and note the

  
 

cent, also that 1807 and 1408 were fairly

 

, and note the slight inerease to fifteen
| rs, or dl percent., the fall to thirteen winners, |
lor Sd perceat, a still lower figure marking 1890;
| in the second half, the second six days that is, |
|} 1806 handed tn fifteen winners, @ natural ris
| above the thirteen of the first nalf and therefore |
| easily predicted; 18/7 fell to thirteen winners, as
the fifteen of the first half, and 1808, tne |
strong swings, showed nineteen, bringing
rand percentage up to 44 per cent., the bizh-
rurein four years, pointing to the fall in the
year of 1809, Which at this meeting snowed six-
teen wins; tne runs came in 1896 in four twos and
| singles; in 1807 they came in four twos and one
bl ck of four; in 1608 there came three blocks of |
4 aud singles, and in 1899 there came a start-
veinthe seventh and eighth days, and then
f wos aud widespread singles. Turn
