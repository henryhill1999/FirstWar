NEW LIFE GIVEN TO OUR
SALES OF CLOAKS AND FURS.

Counting special orders to manufacturers in the with
the season’s surplus stocks, we could have safely met anything
short of the buying avalanche that followed our first January
announcements,

Not five days from this sale’s opening, we were scouring the
market for more Coats, Capes and Suits, urging the swiftest
production compatible with high character in every article.

First slowly, then faster and faster as our needs grew, choice
garments poured in. As this third week opens, we can show,
trom all sources, in round numbers—

750 Stylish Jackets—SO0 Tailored Suits—
450 Assorted Capes—375 Dress Skirts—
And (large and small) some 500 Fur Pieces—

Made up between seasons, when best fabrics and linings are at
their cheapest, expert labor content to work for small wage, and
manufacturers well satisfied to accept narrow profits.

This is the condensed epitome:
