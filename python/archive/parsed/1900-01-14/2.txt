Berowitke Had Been Robbing the Store for
Six Months When Caught.

The arrest of twenty-one-year-old Erwin

Berowitke on Friday by Detective Ser-
geanta Boyle and Chariton and tho pris-
oner’s confession have cleared up the

mystery of a serles of thefts committed
in the dry gooda store of Weaver & Co. at
603 Eighth avenue. For six months the firm

had been missing goods from the store,
Every employee was more or less under
suspicion, but all proved their innocence,

Detectives Boyle and Chariton finally began
to watch the pawnshops and seeond-hand
clothing stores. Berowitke, who oecupies a
furnished room above the store, wae arrested

Weaver & Co. ‘Tha detectives thouglit that
they had only found aciue, but the prisoner's
confession, onused by hia belief that all was
known, showed them that they had solved the
whole mystery in one swoop

The cellar at 0% Eighth avenue belongs to
the store, In the rear of the building,on a

The detectives say thet Sorowitke ceased
