cost of raw silk, We bought a lot from one of the best known makers in
the trade—probably 45,000 yards in all—ribbons that are beautiful, bright,
right. The lengths run from 14 to 8 vards; in black, also colors—some
fancies, some taffetas, some satin gros grain, some dou! le faced satins, some
satin Liberty, some satin taffetas. In blacks—always a favorite—the show-
