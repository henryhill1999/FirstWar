PINANCIAL AND COMMERCIAL,

 

Barvapar, Jan, 13.
There was fairly good buying of atooke, with
advancing prives, to-day until! the appearance

' of the bank statement, when a seliing move-

ment wae started Ly professional operators,
which carried prices dowa rather preolp!tately,
Not results, however, were reasonably satie-
factory. Vora majority of the stocks dealt tn
walue were shown. The decline which fol-
lowed the Issuunce of the bank statement was

| nut due tothe showing in the statement, but to

aprearrauged attack on the market. The state-
ment, as o fact, wus @ favorable one !n prac-
tically all respecta,

An Increase of $5,033,200 In the cash hold-
{ngs of the banks, alter allowing for gold
exporta to Europe on Saturday last and to
South Amerion yesterday, proved that money
fe fowing from the tnterlor to New York to
large volume. The emall increase of $334,300
in deposits permitted an increase of $4,1140,-
625 in the surplus reserve,an amount nearly
equal to the increase in cash. A decrease of
$1,558,000 In loans wae attributable more to
repayment of loans secured by corporations to
meet Jan. 1 requirements than to liquidation
ofetock accounts, Theactual position of the
banks was believed to be somewhat better than
was {ndicated by tho statement, inasmuch as
the statement was made up on rising averages,
The bellef wae that money would continue to
accumulate at this centre by reason of the re-
turn flow of funds from the West and that an
easy money market might be counted on for,
probably, a considerable time to come.

The declining tendency of discount rates
abroadin spite of the uncertainty asto the
military operations {on South Africa is reassure
ing. Money iv becoming easier throughout
Europe, because London, having supplied its
Pressing needs for gold by importations from
New York, has relieved apprehension at Parte
aod Berlin, and for another thing the domes-
tlc movements of money in Great Britain and
On the coatinent are now naturally toward the
financial centres. In brief, the situation in
Europe is much the same as {t {a here. It pre-
sumably is true that a great deal still depends
on the developments inthe Anglo-Boer war,
butitalso is likely to tarn out thatthe most
serious effects of this warin monetary relations
have been witnessed,

The largest dealings on the Stook Exohange
were again in Sugar Refining, For thie stock
4 lose in price was recorded. There were no
new features in the sugar trade, or dieclosures
in the affairs of the company, but the epecula-

| tive element that has been working on the

short efde of the stock was conspicuously ac-
tive, There was liberal buying of American
Tobaceo and @ eubstantial addition to ite
price resulted, There was lees doing tn Conti-
nental Tobaceo, but It, too, improved tn price,
Teunessee Coal and Iron was notably strong
and closed at the best price of the day.
The transactions in the other — steel
and tron etocka were not heavy, but these
stocks were bettered {n price. Brooklyn Rapid
Transit was freely traded tn, butthe final price

| showed no change from yesterday, Metropoll-
| tan Btreet Rallway waa wenk and Manhattan

lost fractionally in price, The largest dealings
in the raliroad list were in Union Pacific and
Baltimore and Ohio, but they failed to advanga,
Thera were moderate purchases of Louisville
and Nashville for foreign account.

As compared with the final prices of last Sate
urday the majority of stocks are lower. The
more tmportant net declines are {uo American
Bugar Refloing 14 per cent., Metropolitan
Street Railway 6%, Cleveland, Cine!nnat!, Chi-
eago and Bt. Loats 34, Brooklyn Rapid Tran.
