REAL ESTATE NEWS.
There was a fair amount of real estate sel!-
ing accomplished yesterday for a Saturday.
The largest transaction reported was the sale
of the old O'fteilly, Skelly & Fogarty brewery
property in Weat Fourteenth street, extending
through to West Vifteenth «treet. This
property ia Nos. 4 ani 411 West Fourteenth
street and Now, 408 and 410 West Fifteenth
street, SOx 208+ Tt wad sold vesterday by the
hetrs of Patrick A. Fogarty to Philip Herman's
Son, An odd eoincidence ls the fact that many
years ago this land was sold bythe present
Duyer's grandfather to Mr. O'Reilly, who
erected the brewery. Last year the property
was sold at auction, in a partnership partition
and was bought by the Fogarty estate.
Another apartment house waa sol lf yeater-

{ 1801, soon after che banks opened for business a
band of music was heard in on {whe principal
streets §=[t was in whe days of reeruiune for ube

music, so that ihe brass band disturbance cansed

One of the mob who War a leader took Mitchell
by one arm and s} ook him violently Mitchell
did not finch. nor did he make any effort te (re

closed the door and turned the bolt This inf

riated the mob which hurled stones through the
lass until the front of the bank looked as if it
ad been under the fire of a batters The Mayo

  

and Sheriff tried to talk to the crowd but were
howled down and told to keepoutof the way

“The band had gone around the corner and
was hes to plas at intervals but it was ne
the sort of music that soothed. Cin ite nitars
it had the apmosite effeet. ‘The noth formed
wedge, threw itseif against the door and it gray
way In falling 1} smashed some of the offic
furniture Tho employres of the bank started
to escape, Some succeeded but others were
knocked down and trampled upon. While one |

part of the mob was engaged in these asaaulia,
another, armed with picks and axes, demolished
all the furniture, that had not come under the
force of the door
“This accomnlished, the mob rushed across
the street to the State Bank The employees
of that concern had not time to lock up their books
and papers. The mob piled them in a heap and
made a bonfire. The fire companies were called
out, but no sooner had the engines got to work
than they were stopped The mob cut.the hose
A company of militia was in quarters near by
and the authorities called on the officers to in
terfere but they replied that they could do noth
ing without orders from the Governor, who was
at Madison, the capital, In renly to a message
he ordered the company to quell the disturbance
The soliiers responded quickly and
the mob with bavonete, The mob acaitered
and some were captured
‘Just before this company had

 

  
 

squad of recruits from another part of town was
drilling The mob surround led the volunteers
and captured their guns. Gen. Rufus King

was in command of all volunteers, and
as he learned what the Governor had done he
rociaimed martiallaw Sentinels were stationed

fore every bank in town, and at all principal!
crossings. The mob had retired to another quar
ter and their sullen shouts could be distinet!+
heard through the right. The report that they
would burn the place down kept everybody
but children out of bed

“Toward morning additional troops from other
places came in, to the relief of the cilizens and
the town became a military camp.
in the town were men who had volunteered to go
to the front to save the Union, but their first trou
ble confronted them athome After the war
some of those whe revurned said they never felt
as timid in the field as they did when ordered to
face the Milwaukee mob.

“Quiet was restored for one day only when Fy e
mob rallied again and marched down one of the
principal streets uniil they were halted by a regi
ment that was drawn upin line. The Colonel
informed the leaders of the mob that unless ther
dispersed he would give the order to fire The
leaders turned and the mob followed down 9 back
street, Troops remained in town a week, A
home guard was formed, and the volunteers re
turned to their respective camps, The mob made

nofurtber trouble. and those who had been arrested |

werereleased The ‘run’ on the banks ceased.”

“What became of the brass band’ asked one
who had heard the story

“I'm Wlessed if] everheard. Nor did I ever
hear where it came from, or why the mob ever
thought of having 4 brasa band to lead it It
was the first instance of the kind [ ever heard of”
