BROOKLYNS WIN ANOTHER.

pEMONTREVILLE AND KENNEDY
FACTORS IN THE VICTORY.

 

 

Bostons Scare the Champions by Fast Play
_pittsburgs Wia, Too, From the Cincianatis
~Pphiladelphias Have an Easy Time With the
Tall-Enders-Chicage and St. Louis Draw.

Again the champion Brooklyns won from
the Bostons yesterday in another clean-cut

game. Hanlon’s men thereby maintained a

jead of 24 points over the Pittsburgs, who,

after suffering two consecutive defeats, finally
defeated the Cincinnatia with ease. From
present indications it will be a neck-and-neck
race between the leaders to the wire with the
odds slightly in favor of the Champtons, who,
with a braced-up pitching corps, are playing
real championship ball. The Philadelphias had

a doch with the New York tail-enders, who

once more failed to take advantage of the Reds’

defeat Tho Chicagos and St. Louis played

Brooklyn, 5; Boston, 3.

BROOKLYN, 6; BOSTON, 8.

In what was perhaps the best played game
of the season at Washington Park, the Brook-
lyns again vanquished the Bostons yester-
day afternoon. Barring two growls by Her-
man Long at the umpire, there was no kicking

and no delay. Magnificent plays of the most
sensational order prevailed and as the result
was in doubt up to the last moment, the crowd
of 2,000 cranks relished the sport ,im-
mensely. Thou the Bostons were beaten,
they made the Champions work like beavers to
secure a Victory in which Eugene DeMontre-
ville and “Roaring Bill” Kennedy were con-
spicuous factors. Kennedy not only pitched
with steadiness and effect, but he started a
fruitful rally in the fifth inning with a three-
bagwer. It was DeMontreville’s lightning
base hit in the clan that really won the game
whilea superb catch by him in the ninth spoiled
a possible two-base hit. Sheckard, too, was
in evidence with his bat, his single in the fifth
doing «reat execution.

]t was from Sheckard's bat by the way, that
Rilly Hamilton made one of the greatest circus
catches ever seen in Brooklyn, or anywhere
else for that matter. With one out and Keeler
on first base in the third inning Sheckard got
{fn a tremendous whack to ht centre. It
was a drive that looked good for a home run
and both “Sheck” and Keeler began to leg it
around the bases. Hamilton got hia piano legs
moving right away and seemed to in fora
chase. Just as the ball waa sraili over
his head, he stuck up his left hand, which was

are, and made a desperate gra ft the sphere.
fe just mana to reach it while Jumpin
several feet in the air, and it stuck,too, Hamil-
ton Was a5 Inuch surprised as anybody, but he
made a quick throw to Lowe. Keeler was
rounding third at the time, 80 the Bostons had
a chance to fatten their flelding averages when
Lowe t the ball to Long. The latter
threw it to Pittenger and he sent it to Tenney
for the out, a double play being made there-
fore by five men.

Other startling playa were made by (Collina,
Cross, Dahlen, Kelley, Long and Kennedy,
Pittenger was almost as much of a puzzle as
Kennedy, except that he became unsteady
at a critfcal juncture and his wildness was al-
most directly responsible for the defeat of his
companions.

Hamilton scored the first run of the game
in the third inning on his base on balla and Long's
three-bagger with nobody out. Right there
Kennedy showed that he was not ready to get
into the balloon, though he was hel A great
deal by @ rattling play on the part of Kelley,
who knocked down Tenney’s smash and caught
Long at the plate, In the fifth, with one out,
Stahl singled scored another Boston run
on Tenney's two-bagger to right. The latter
ran home on Collins's le to left, but Collins
could not reach second, DP that point the
Champions made but one hit off Pittenger
and with the score 8 to 0 against them the crowd
began to expeo defeat.

lwo were out in the last half of this innin.
when there was an explosion that delighted
the rooters. Kennedy hit for three bases and
scored Brooklyn's firet run on Jones's single.
The latter raced to third on Keeler’s two-bagger
to left, and both counted on Sheokard’s corking
base hit to cont. With the score tie en-
nedy redoubled efforta, with the result that
in the last four innings the Bostons got but
one man to first base.

Thec ons won out in the Fighth, Sheck-
ard was hit by a pitched ball and stole second,
but in sliding he went over the bag and was

alled. Then Pittenger gave bases on balls to
Kelley. 088 an ahlen. It was up to De

ontreville, who, after Fisying the game to
the mit, lined a beauti “\ Sagie to centre on

which Kelley and Crosa ran home. The score:

The Philadelphians turned the tables on
the New Yorks at the Polo Grounds yester-
day afternoon and won an interesting game.
The Quakers won because they were able to
hit the ball when hite were moat needed, while
the New Yorks were unable to do anything
with Orth. The deaf and dumb pitcher was
trotted out to hold down the heavy-hitting
Philadelphias, but he was batted out of the
box in the third inning. Carrick, who took
his place, was unable to hold the Quakers in
check and they made nine hita off him, four
of which came {n the sixth Inning. The score:

PHILADELPHIA CLUB SCORED.

 

Abell Says Somebody Should Be Censured by
the National League,

The recent exposure of the Philadelphia
club's sharp practice in having a player tp
off the opposing team's signs, has stirred up a
tempest in League circles. Manager Shette-
line of the Philadelphias has admitted the truth
of Manager Hanlon’s charges and has no ex-
cuses to offer. F, A. Abell, one of the owners
of the Brooklyn club made a few remarks yes-
terday to Tuk SUN man which would seem to
indicate that Col, John 1. Rogers of the Phila-
deiphia Club will be compelled to orate at un-
usual length at the meeting of the League next
December.

“Having learned that the charges of fraud

lodged by Hanlon against the Philadelphia
club are true,” said Abell, “I wish to say that
such tactics are a disgrace to professional
baseball, which has always been looked upon
as an honest sport. The Philadelphia club
has been caught red-handed. It has been
aying one A 8 players a salary for two years
o wateh the signs of opponents by means
of glasses usedin a house back of the centre-

fleld fence and has thereby profited in the
most remarkable manner.

‘The Philadelphias have fattened their
batting averages and have won many
@ames at home because of this unfair

trick and I should like to know, whether
tye League thinks that these poyers
should rank in the official averages this year,
Ia it fair to allow the Philadelphias to have any
official place in the record? It would seem
not. In any sport cheating cannot be over-
looked, The Philadelphia club haa been placed
in a_ bad light and its offence has adminis-
tered to baseball a black eye that wil not dis
appear for some time to come

The League should take some action inthis
matter and somebody should severely cen-
sured, Can it be poasible that John I. Rogers,
the principal owner of the Philadelphia club,
who has always proolaimed himself to be a true
sportaman, has known of this business?
am surprised that other clubs have not dis-
covered the trick before this, We knew of it
some time ago, but we did not expose it until
we had absolute pect of it.”

John I Rogers has not yet been heard from.

League Manager Says the Protective Associa-
tion Will Work Harm,

Several League managers are complaining
that they have already felt the influence of
the Protective Association of Professional
Baseball Players. They say that since the
new organization was perfected the players
have been acting with more independence
than ever before. A manager, who does not

care to have his name used just at present,
aald to Tue SuN man the other day:
“Several of my playera have practically
defied me of late. One of them took two days
off and when I asked him where he had been
he stinply said: ‘Been to the races.’ Another
one after failing to show up in the afternoon
replied when asked foran explanation: ‘Didn't
have time to come!’ It was also intimated
that in case any fines were inflicted I would
hear from the Protective Association. It
looks to me as if several players I kuow of
have lost their heads They seem to think
they can boas things to suit themselves ”
The magnates, incidentally, have discussed
the recent notice sent to them by the attorney
of the Protective Association, asking fora con-
ference, Most of them say they are willing
to listen to the demands of the players, butitis
the general opinion among them that no con-
ceasions of any kind should be made, The
magnates feel that the oar are getting all
that they are entitled to and that the organiza-
tion of the Protective Association was not a
necessity. In a word, the magnates believe
that it will be prudent to call the players’ bluff,
as they term it, and see how far the Protective
Association will go,

FOOTBALL,

Practice of the Big Elevens—Ready for the
Opentog ef the Season.

Campnimpor, Sept. 28.—Harvard’s football
outlook was not brightened very much to-day.
The third eleven, which has held the ‘Varsity
#0 well this week, was again brought out, This
time the elevens were lined up for fifteen and
twelve-minute periods, and in that time the
‘Varsity could score but once. This touch-
down was due, as was the one on Wednesday,
to end runs, For the second time the ‘Var-
sity suffered the humilfation of being held for
downs, an event that happens but few times
inaseason, The ‘Varsity was unable to make

 

 

any consistent gains at centre, largely
owing to the activity of Roberts, the
big freshman. 6 made holes,
so that the third eleven — repeatedly
forced the ‘Varsity line for long gains.
Throughout the practice game, the ‘Varsity
backs fumbled punts, mixed their signals,
started slowly and failed utterly to block holes.

Kernan was put on the ‘Varsity behind the
line in place of Stillman, who was playing very
yoorly. Kernan made one high long punt, but
it got away so slowly that. Roberts almost
blocked the ball. For the third eleven, in ad-
dition to the good playing of Roberts, Hersey

tackled Kendall for a. loss of seven
yards, and Littig made several hard
tackles behind the ‘Varsity line.

Considerable uneasiness is felt over the out-
come of to-morrow # game with Wesleyan
The coaches hope that the training Coach
lewis has given the men in defence will en-
able them to keep Wesleyan from scoring.
Harvard pimply hopes to get over the game
without the disgrace of being scored against,
Just how serious the situation really is can
be seen from the fact that the coaches put
the whole squad back to the preliminary work
of falling on the ball, tackling the dummy
catching punts, &c., this afternoon, To spend
most of the afternoon doing such elementary
work when the season is two weeks old is
something most unusual

Yesterday afternoon the candidates for the
New York University football team commenced
scrimmage work for the first time this year.
Nearly thirty men were on the fleld. Marsten,
the crack guard of the Centenary Collegiate
Institute of Hackettstown, reported for work
and made a good impression. Among the new
freshmen out were: Tuthill. from Flushing
High School, who was tried at full back and
punted well; Preperd, centre, Walz and Lip-
pinoott, ends, of New York Hi h School; Clarke,
of Westerleigh Collegiate Institute, and Morrison
of Dwight School. Of the upper classmen who
were playing for the first time at N.Y. U., were
Lane, 1903, of Trinity School; Weinberger
1902, and Young, 1908. Bergman, the tackle of
the "98 team, who is back at college, was tried
in the line with Brennan of Manhattan Coleg.
On Monday the practice will commence on Ohio
Field. if the authorities are willing, and the
tackling dummy will be put in place. During
the coming week the coaching force will con-
sist of Hatch, '09; “Pop” Foster, ex-1900; Garvin
‘ov; Evas.. ‘08: Young, ‘82, and Jones, 1002,
"The latter will not play t miner as he isin train-
ing for track athletics. Manager Gould an-
nounces a game with Syracuse University for
Oct. 13. Oct. 20 is open owing to a cancellation,
The firat game will be played on next Saturday,
when the team will line up against the alumni,

 

Princeton, Sept. 2&—It took the Tigers
to-day only three minutes, in their prac-
tice on Osborn Field to push the strong-
est “scrub” that could be picked about
seventy yards gove the gridiron for the first
touchdown of the season. The entire distance
was covered by plain, straightaway football,
but of the hardest and fastest order that has
been seen here this fall. De Witt, the fresh-
man guard, who had two fingers put out of
joint yesterday, will not be able to play for a
week and his practice was taken by Wright,
a sophomore. Henry, fromthe St. Paul's
School, played at half and was usually able
to gain his Gintance, although he was not used
ao often as either Mattis or Levick. Hale, a
sophomore, war at centre opposite to Butkte~
wiez, the Andover man, and those who watched
the struggle say that it was a roval baltle,
with the odds slightly in favor of the former.
Ora Gardner, a senior, has been appointed
captain of the “scrubs.”

ITHACA, Sept 28 —Cornell meets Syracuse on
the gridiron to-morrow and it is feared here
to-night by the student body that the eleven
from the Salt (ity will prove as much of a sur-

rie aw Lafayettes did last year. Syracuse
r. coached by Ed Sweetland, who | played on
Cornell's team for three years and who was
elected to the football captaincy in his eenior
year but was turned down by the athletic
council. When Sweetland was chosen coach
of Syracuse thie year he thought he had a
chance to get even, Accordingly, he got the
candidates out very early and they have been
working hard ever since with this end In view
Fortunately for the Itha . however, he will
meet a team which has had hard work and
which should at this time of the year stand a
good chance with any team in the country
To-night the "Varsity were lined up against

araity scored twice and easily held the scrubs
when on defence. The ‘Varsity was made up
as follows’

Left end, Toohill: left tackle, Whitney; left guard,
Warner; centre, Pierson; right guard, Hunt; right
tackle, Lueder; right end, Mull; quarter back,
Thomas and Finucane: left half back, Otis; right
half back, Morrison; full back, CoMn,

Schoelkopf was kept out of the game because
of a minor injury and Taussig also was a trifle
indisposed.

The Words School football team. won its
first game of the season by defeating Manhattan
School at Wostchester yesterday afternoon
by @ score of 32 ww 18.

 

New Haven, Sept. 28.—Fifty freshmen re-
ported for football practice at Yale this after-
noon, The quad is the biggest in years. There
are a lot of blg men in the equad and it looks
as though a good freshman team could be de-
yeloped out of this bunch of material.

Varsity coaches will wateh the freshmen
closely and from day to day call out the best
eee from the squad fora trial on the ‘Varsity.
Nicky Sheldon had his firet trial this after-
noon in the ony rush line. He was played
at right guard in place of Gose, who is laid up.
Sheldon made a very fair showing. He is
not yet in good football condition. ‘The coach-
ing list was swelled this afternoon by the ar-
rival of Morris Ely, quarter on the team of
two years ago, Olcott was again at centre
rush on the ‘Varsity. The practice was hard,
as usual, but it did not last long. _ When the
third and fourth elevens lined up Bob Keane
was again put at quarter. In one of the first
scrimmages Keane injured his ankle so badly
that he will not be able to play for a week or
more. In the opening game of the season
with Trinity to-morrow the make-up of the
*Varaity will be the same as it was this after-
noon, as follows:

Gould, left end; Kunzig, left tackle: Boyne, left
Cuard; Olcott, centre; Sheldon, right @uard; Stillman,
right tackle; Coy, rightend: Fineke, quarter: Chad-
wick, half back; Sharpe, half back; Male, full back.

It was learned to-night that the Yale faculty
has as good aa vetoed the proposition to have
the Yale-Prinoeton championship game played
in New York this fall. It hast een snagested by
Yale graduates that in case Princeton's fleld is
not ready by the time of the game, that Yale
offer her fleld for the game.

A decided let-up in the severity of football
practice at Columbia waa noticeable yesterday,
and though the play in the usual scrub game
was fast there were frequent periods of rest
and but a single half was played. The maic
work Was an attempt to pick out the best men
for the end positions and to this end Coach
Ranford tried the entire squad in getting down
the fleld on punts with the result that McCollom
and Ache played ends in the afternoon game,
McCollum. is quick and. energetic, but lacks
weight, while Ache failed to take advantage of
opportunities. Two new men, Pell and Creen,
were seen on the college team Which Was in
charge of Capt, Simons, The ‘Varsity was weak-
ened by the absence of Weekes, Wright and Van
Hoevenberg, who were laid off for a day, and
as @ consequence no touchdowns were made.
The kicking of Full Back Ashley. was again
the feature of the day's work wice he put
the ball straight over the scrub line, though
his deliberate system of kicking seemed to

ortend blocked attempta in both instances

yson resumed hia place at right guard and
Goodman and Bovyesen filled the positions
of Van Hoevenberg and Weekes at quarter
back and left half back respectively.
Austin had his eye alizhtly cut  dur-
ing the play, The practice was concluded
by a race between all the candidates for the
full length of the gridiron. Austin won, Ex-
Capt rt Wilson and Putnam, last year's
end, watched the work ofthemen. The line-up,
which is supposed to be that in which Columbla
wil] meet Rutgers next Wednesday with the
ddition of Weekes and Wright, was aa fol-
owe: Right end, Ache: right tackle, Burchell;
right guard, Tyson; centre, Murphy; left guard,
Bruce: left tackle, Austin: left end, MeCollom;
quarter back, Goodman; right half back, Hol-
man; left half back, Boyeaen: full back, Ashley.

Ernie Hjertberg, one of the trainers of the
eleven, will resign,

PHILADELPHIA, Sept. 28.—Pennsy!vania plays
her first cnme of the season with Lehigh at
Franklin Field to-morrow. ‘he Quaker line-up
has been a matter of conjecture, and i{ was not
unti! late this afternoon that Woodruff an-
nounoed the line-up as follows:

Left end, Davidson and Pennett; left tackle, Zim

Extra Card at Gravesend Furnishes Lively
Sport-Monroe Doctrine Takes the Hurdle
Race on Two Sound Legs—King Barleycorn
Loses a Race by Sulking~Entries To-Day.

The extra afternoon's racing which marked
the beginning of the end at Gravesend at-
tracted a large crowd to the Brooklyn Jockey
Club's track yesterday. The early morning
rain had deadened the going somewhat, but
it improved as the afternoon wore on and fair
fields turned out

Monroe Doctrine furnished a surprise in
the hurdle handicap, with which the sport led
off. The race was figured as a gift for the
Hitchcock pair, Mazo and Laat Chord, and
they closed favorites at 6 to 5, after opening
at even money. Monroe Doctrine was played
down a point from his original odds of 4 to 1,
and he landed the money, after a desperate
struggle, by a head from Mazo. The winner
broke down almost hopelessly at the turn for
home, but raced through on his courage with
his front tendons so badly bowed that he will

hardly be seen out again this season

Fliczabeth M, scared all but Scurry and the
Puritan out of the Bowevard Handicap,and the
trio finished as named, with the odds-on-favorite
an easy winner, She was subsequently pur-
chased by W. ©, Whitney for a price wala to be
f20.009, and will be shipped to England. Eliza-

veth M, is one of the fastest fillies seen out this
season, and she races like a youngster that will
keep on improving.

Dolando had a alight call over King Barley-
corn in the third race, but was somewhat lucky
to win by @ head, as, after sulking most of the
way, King Barleycorn cut loose in the stretch
and would have won in another jump, Tatar
was played confidently at even money in a field
of nine maiden three-year-olds, and after mak-
ing all the running won cleverly by a length
from Templar,

The most interesting event of the day was
the Bayview Handicap, fcr all ages, at one mile
and a aixteenth. At a first glance Mr, Brown
looked the best at the weights, but asteady play
on Intrusive sent the pair to the post equal
favorites at 2to i, Meanwhile Motley was not
overlooked by her immediate following and
with a strong rider up she might have won. She
tiptoed the lot to the last pole where Odom got
up with Favonius and won by three parts of a
leneth. Intrusive had no speed at any stage
and wound up a poor third,

Although only five horses paraded for the
two-year-old selling race, last on the card,
the talent failed to pick the winner. Glade
Run and Quite Right closed equal choices
at 8 to 1, while Billionaire found supporters
at 7 to 2, Snark at 6 to 1 upset all calcula-
tions by taking the track soon after flag fail
and winning easily by a length and a half.
O'Connor brought Billionaire up from last
place to second in the drive and snatched the
place by a head from Quite Right. Summary:

SHOW HORSES AND RACERS.

 

A Varted and Interesting Programme at the
Westchester Fair.

Excellent types in the various classes judged
at the Westchester County Horse Show and
Fair distinguished yesterday’s programme.
Jack Feek, the veteran reinsman, who has about
deserted the trotters and gone over to the heavy
harness horses, said that he never saw a better
lot of animals shown in the ring, and that in his
judgment a higher class would not be seen at
the National Horse Show. Trotters in harness
began yesterday's proceedings, There were
only four entries. Highland Baron, the hand-
some bay stallion, got the blue ribbon, and Park
Commissioner George C. Clausen's good-@aited
bay gelding Quarter Cup, by Quartermaster,
that took a record of 225% in the third heat of a
winning race at Bridgeport, Conn, in 1508, Te-
ceived second prize. Howard Willetts’s good
going brown stallion was third

There was a brave show of heavy harness
horses in the class for animals 15 and not over
15.8 hands. Messrs Williams, Rives and
Crozer had an unenviable task in sifting the
twenty-six entries and selecting three to bear
off the ribbons. Lord Chesterfield, a grand
actor, well shown by Albert C Bostwick, was
finally selected to wear the blue, while there
was only little to choose between him and
Hassan, the bay gelding shown by Howard
Willetts, and Reginald Rives's mare, Black
Venus, winner of second and third respectively.
Happy Times, the brown gelding shown by |
J.N. Gallatin, that won first prize inthe tandem |
class on Thursday with Happy Days, attracted |
much attention, as did Strauss & Hexter's |
Burlingame |

Mrs. David McAndless drove a splendid pair
of roadsters in their class. In passing the
racing judges’ stand the clang of the starter s
bell made them a little gay. Mrs. McAndless
