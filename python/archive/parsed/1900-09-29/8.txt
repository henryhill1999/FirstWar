Thas to All the Spanish Regime—Muaicipal-

Speciat Cable Despateh to THE SUN.

purana, Sept. 28 —A decree has been issued
woriding that after Nov. 1 26 per cent. of the
jot of the police shall be borne by the munici-
palities. and that after March 1 all the expenses
jhall be paid by them. Heretofore the State
sap paid the entire cost of the police service
throughout the island, The object of the
jecree is to lighten the expenses of the State.

The municipalities, or at least those elected
ny the people, have in forming their budgets
hown a «reat tendency to extravagance,
pme of them even attempting to levy taxes
anich have been abolished by law in order to
garb igher salaries to the Mayors and to employ
wae stafs of municipal clerks. The papers
ain that a large proportion of the elected
Mayors and Councilmen do not belong to the
var-paying class

Qefor Villalon, Secretary of Public Works,
yas completed bis annual report. It shows
that during the Spanish régime only 275 kilo-
getres of public roads were bullt, mostly is
qavana province. There are now 440 kilo-

roads in course of construction,
metres have been surveyed, and 1,847
ijometres are projected, All of this work
yas been done in less than two years of Ameri-
00 wn. The estimated cost of all
these road improvements Is $15,626,000,

The carrying out of the work will be ex-
ended over a number of years, An office has
pean established in each province, with an en-
gineer in charge, In making the plans for @
oad system the most important localities are
onsidered first. While the work is neces-
»w owing to the lack of funds, each
f road built forms part of a

which will be constructed in
This plan provides for a
k road the entire length of the
branch roads connecting with
coast towns. This will allow
others to reach the porta with
their products without being compelled to
urse to the raflroads, and will un-
in time result in a very material
raduict in the present high railway tariffs.

In some of the provinoes there is plenty
{ good material for road building, but in
thers stone for the purpose is entirely lacking.
some valuable lands will soon be opened up
roads now belng constructed. The
Secretary of Publio Works is overwhelmed
petitions for the construction of high-
vars. Roads will first be bullt in the districts
where the greatest number of people will be
henefited

PECK'S DEATH UNEXPLAINED.

Police Still Relteve a Fall Caused It and That
He Was Robbed Previously.

No progress was made yesterday toward
etermining how Charles 8. Peck, the real
estate agent of 30 West Thirtieth street, came
death. Detectives from the Central
and from the West Twentieth street
station worked all day on the case, but they
inable to trace Peck's movements after
he left Kid MeCoy's saloon in Broadway shortly

ret o'clock inthe morning. How he came
enteenth street and Ninth avenue,
= body was found by the policeman
Thursday morning, remains
famystery as ever
is reported to the police that Peck had
ntalking toa mulatto woman at Thirtr-
street and Broadway about 1 o'clock,

) the person was who saw him the

ould notlearn. Even if this were
he police were not inclined to attach
much importance to it,as the old man was quite

rar it that hour He had been arrested
for drunkenness several times in the Tender-
in ar when intoxicated he was quite In-

to talk with any woman who would reply

ack

» police do not believe the man was mur-
deted They have been unable to find per-
sons who are reported to have seen him fall,
but this has not shaken their belief that his
leath was accidental They believe he waa
robbed while asleep on some doorstep and
that in his drunken state he wandered aimlessly
about until he fell While Dr. Weston, who
made the autopsy, expressed the opinion that

ith came from a blow from some blunt in-
trument, he admitted that it might possibly
been caused by a fall. Detectives are
hing the pawnshops for Peck's watch
id rings which were stolen If they find them
= mav give a clue to the robbery if not to
ow Peck's death was caused
Mrs Peck, who has been in the Catskills and
was telegraphed for, arrived home last even-
ing Arrangements for the funeral will be
made to-day

REAL ESTATE NEWS,

De Selding Brothers have leased to the Na-
tional Glass Company for five years the second
floor of the Crockery Exchange Building on
the east side of West Broadway, extending from
Park place to Barclay street, The National
Glass Company is a combination, or so-called
trust, of manufacturers, which, while removing
ite headquarters from Pittsburg to New York,
at the same time consolidates half a dozen
New York agencies which have represented
the factories now in the trust. The lease,
therefore, illustrates two very marked tenden-
cles, the net influence of which on New York real
estate has not yet been definitely determined,
The tendency toward larger business ‘units
naturally limits the demand for real estate,
However, the prime object of combination
{s to overcome competition, and this object
is gained no leas by superiority of location for
the purpose of distribution than by economy
of production, Advantage of location, again,
does not have relation merely to distribution
of goods, but also to the labor mafket. American
manufacturers are going more and more into
the production of intricate machinery, re-
quiring highly skilled labor, which can be had
in quantity suited to varying requirements
only in @ great labor centre like New York,
The application of electricity, for example,
to new uses has undoubtedly given employment
to fully as much land and labor as has been
displaced by the tendency toward consoli-
dation, At any rate, New York is certainly
the favorite site for the administrative head-
quarters of the new trade combinations as well
as for light manufactures demanding highly
skilled labor, Whatever depreciation has re-
cently taken place in New York real estate
has probably been confined to buildings, for,
so far as can be learned, land generally haa
advanced, If this is true, the existing dea-
preasion in real estate has little connection
with the current tendency toward industrial
combination.
