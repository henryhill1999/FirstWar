TRADERS’ FIRE 00: AFFAIRS

HINT AS TO THE PERSON RESPONSI-
BLE FOR THE FALSE REPORT.

 

  

Railroad Commissioner Baker to Be at the
City Ball to Hear All Complaints.

ALBANY, Sept. 28.--Commissioner Frank W.
Baker of the State Board of Railroad Com-

 

Secretary Theodore Suatro Went Up to Albany
Yesterday in Order to Make an Investiga-
tlon tn the Insurance Department —State-
ment as to the Liability of the Directors.
Phe directors of the Traders’ Fire Insurance

Company did not meet yesterday at the offices

of Stimson & Williams at 55 Liberty atreet,

although it had been announce ed that they
would, Mr. Stimson said that his firm were
the attorneya for President William A. Halsey

and fifteén or twenty stockholders, but not
for Secretary Theodore Sutro. Mr, Stimson
declared that the directors were not respon-
aible civilly for any loseaa of the coThpany,
ei: her as stockholders or directors, and that he
would advise hia clients not to pay one cent
toward the liquidation of the company’s ing |
deptedness. He declared, further, that policy
holders must look for repayment of premiums
to the assets, which are about $25,000, while
the liabilities are in the neighborhood of $200,000

Policy holdera who had suffered losses by fire

to the same source for reimburse-

attend at the City Hull to-morrow In case there
should be any appearances for the hearing set
on the application of the Brookllyn Rapid Tran-
sit Company for apidority to abandon certain
stations on the elevated lines in Brooklyn,
This application was withdrawn by the com-
pany some time ago, but all rarties interested
may not have received word that the proposed
hearing was indefinitely postponed ’

While in Brooklyn Commissioner Baker will
look into complaints which have been received
by the Railroad Commissioners that the Rapid
‘Transit Company has, of its own notion, discon-
tinued certain of its stations on the elevated
lines. Just what stations are meant
stated, as the complaints come to the Railroad
Commissioners in the form of letters from in-
dividuals and their contents will not be dis-
closed, If the Brooklyn Rapid Transit Com-
pany has discontinued ita stations without first
securing the atithority of the State Board it
has acted illegally.

profit should take advantage of such an oppor-
tunity to dispose of their holdings as was offered
yesterday and the day before. They also sold
stocks to-day, but had to do so in competition
with their opponents, who, having redueed the
volume of their ventures on favorable rumors
regarding the strike, were constrained to-day

consequence the best prices were made at or
soon after the opening, and as the day wore
away a receding tendency developed into
heaviness, and finally the tone became weak,
There was a falling off in the volume of bus-
ines, due in part to the discontinuance of the
fairly good buying that was a feature of yester-
day's market The two obvious and important
factors controlling the stock market are the
determination of actual buyers to hold aloof
from it pending the election and the unwilling-
ness of brokers to carry securities on margin
because of indications that the money market
may become uncomfortably active within the
next sixty days Upon this point it fs to be
noted that the principal city banka have lost to
the {nteriors and to the Sub-Treasury this week
between $7,000,000 and $8,000,000. This fore-
shadows a further decrease in the surplus
reserve of the Associated Banks to-morrow, a
circumstance that might easily result in
the contraction of loans next week The
absence of authoritative confirmation of cur-
rent reports of animpending settlement of the ln-
bor troubles in the anthracite coal region was an
incidental depressing influence in to-day's pro-
fessional speculation, Yet for some reason not
explained by the Stock Exchange contingents,
this ciroumstance was not reflected In the prices
for the shares of the anthracite coal carrying
companies to the extent that it was in other
issues A rational view would be that the pro-
longation of the strike might have an effect
upon the political situation, as it has already
begun to have upon general business in the
Eastern States
The heaviest trading was in Northern Pacific
common, Sugar Refining, Brooklyn Rapid
Transit, People’s Gas and Union Pacific com-
mon. The last named was exceptionally firm,
All of the others, together with many stocks
that were traded in less extensively, closed
matertally lower than last night. Northern
Pacific common was especially weak and sus
tained a net loss of two points. In the opinion
of some observant brokers a good deal of
the selling was for short account. The fact
remains that the market for the stock showed
no disposition to rally. London adrices are
that Berlin is a heavy seller of the stock
in that market and its operations may
unostentatiously have been extended to this
The condition of the Germany money
and security markets is ample explanation
of the eelling from that quarter. Besides the
remarks regarding the outlook for the eom-
pany's business the coming year givento the
public by the President in his annual report
juat issued are far from reassuring. The clos-
ing waa heavy and final prices were asa rule

‘The jocal movements of money this week are
described by ihe New York News Bureau as
follows: “The known movements of money in
the week beginning on Friday of last week and
ending at the close of business yesterday indi-
cate an aggregate lossin cash by the banks, on
account of the direct express movement to the
interior and the dealings with theSub-Treasury,
of $7,667,966. Of this amount $5,160,000 repre-
sents an excesa of receipts by the inatitu-
tions mentioned. The movement of funda
out of town is so decided as to strengthen
the probability that considerable sums were
also forwarded by registered mail, The
express figures given may b+ modified to an
extent by the fact thata number o! the banks
that make returns to this bureau have in-
cluded in iheir statements new national bank
notes. ‘To-morrow’'s statement of bank aver-
ages will, in all probability, be more unfavora-
ble than the actnal condition of the banks war-
rant. The large disbursements at the Sub-
‘Treasury to-date, aggregati' ge over $2,000,000
on account of gold received at San Frat cisco at
the close of last week, will faure very slightly
inthe averagesthis weck The agerecate loss
in cish by the banks last week was $6,750,000.
Of this amount $6,004,702 represented the net
resuit of the interior movement and the trans-
actions with the Sub-Treasury.”

Owing to_a General hesitancy to sell cotton ad
vanced, The reasons for this hesitancy must be

sought in the bad oficial State reports, the prospects
ofan unisually early folshing ar picking, the grow
ing conviction that the cropis short, (he rather large
discounts already prevailing on the distant montha,
end the fear of ome sudden disaster tothe cropinae
year of extraordinary conditions as tosupply if not
