that {t is far from satisfactory

clerks say
it Mr Bryan said
We are in favor of a civil service reform

that means something, not a civil service re-

{form that permits one President to suspend
i the elvil service until he gets his friends into
| office, and permits another President to exte!

the civil service just as he is going out

id
We are
in favor of fixed terms of office in the civil de-
partments of the Government. We want it
so that when a man goes into office he willknow
how long he is going to stay and when he is going
out. We do not want to build up an office-
holding class and fill our offices for life, be-
cause men appointed under those conditions
are likely to have no concern except to draw
their salaries. We believe that a life tenure,
which relieves a man from all further care,
{a destructive of the highest form of oitizen-
ship and ought not to be tolerated in a country
like ours.”

A good many of the clerks havet heimpreasion
that Bryan is opposed to giving them more than
four years of service. They say if thia is true
the Democrata employed in the ratlway mall
service all over the country will vote for
McKinley. Another letter will be sent to Bryan
asking him for a more definite statement of hia

must be in gold. Key A forfeit
was put up and an agreement made that the
entire amount should be placed in the hands
a realdent of Woodstock by 7 o'clock last

APPEALS TO GOLD DEMOCRATS.

Congressman Bynum and John P. Irish Urge the
Defeat of Bryan.

INDIANAPOLIS, Sept 28&—John P. Fren-
zel, secretary of the National Committee of the
Gold Democratic organization, is elated over
the big meeting addreased by John P. Irish
of California in English'’s Opera House last
night. The address is to be printed and dis-
tributed from headquarters here. Itisanappeal
to Democrats to withdraw their support from
the Bryan Democracy this year, in order that
the Jeffersoni Democracy may be rescued
from the Popocratic management and restored
to its previous honorable position. Mr. Irish
reports that the Gold Democrats of four yeare
ago are just as enthusiastic for the defeat of
Bryan this year He will make several other
addresses in Indiana and will speak in the
Western States as he returns to his home.
