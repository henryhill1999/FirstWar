Dies Pund-Hiis Course Crittetsed by

Commissioners, Whom He Replied,

The action of City Superintendent Maxwell
in appearing before the Cites Committee of
the Senate on Toosday In support of the Ford
Bohoo! bili wave tive to an attack on him at
yesterday's meeting of the Board of Edueation,
{t being conten led that he had created the Im-
pression at Albany that he represented the
vows of the hoard. That this was not the
ease, and that, on the contrary, most of the
Commiasiouers are opposed to Dr. Maxwell's
views, was shown at the meeting, A commu.
nication sent to the board by Dr, Maxwell beur-
ing on the situation was lald on the table
by @ unanimous vote after some flerce
speeches had been made, This communiea-
tion, addressed to the board by Dr. Maxwell
and also signed by the Auditor of the board,
called attention to the fact that no apportion.
ment of the general sche ol fund had boen made
and pointed out that in order to avold cons
fusion and delay in making payments the ap-
portionment should be made at this meeting.
He said the borough school boards would be

ampered by techuical nancial Hmitations es-
hampe id by the Board of Estimate and Appor-
tionment ifthe app rtiourment were not mado
at once,

As soon as this communication had been
read, President Robertson of the Brooklyn
Voard, who has led former attacks on Dr,
Maxwell, asked that the matter go over, pend-
fic the result of action oo the remedial legt +
Jation at Albany, some of which is designed to
do away with the apportionment,

“Tthink,” satd Mr. Kobertaon, “it fis hardly
right forthe City Superintendent. to foree his
own ideas on this Loard after the hearing ses-

vray,”
: President Burke of the Richmond Board said
he wanted it determined whether the Presi-
centor Dr. Maxwell was supposed to represent
the board in legislation at Atvany

Tsee fp the papers,” said Mr, Burke, “that
the City Superintendent fs quoted as represent:
ne the bowrd. Lthink we shall be represented
hy the President or a committee, The duties
of the City Superintendent arelelear, His bust.
neas isto seep the schools running, not to mix
up in legislation or dratt bills as he seems to be
doing, [think the City Superintendent is try-
fngtoforee a bill on ns in which he is inter.
ested with Senator John Ford, and which ts
one ofthe most vicious measures introduced,
Idon't think the City Superintendent repre.
sented this board when he said he was in favor
oir, Tt was this plan whieh caused all the
trouble Inst year, and itis Dr, Maxwell's desire
to ‘oree us to be in the false position we were in
then, when we were morally right and teehni-
cally wrong.”

‘The matter was then tabled,

Supt, Maxwell asked leave to speak in hia own
defence, He said Mr. burke had spoken bastily
und was not acquainted with the facts,

"Te is quite true,” he said, “that Lappeared
atthe hearng yesterdsy, butitisn’t true that
J appeared_as this board's representative, or
that I sald Idid,or that [stated that the boar
had any particular views IT appeared there on
the summons the chairman of the Senate
Committe Permit me to add that the only
motive whieh setuated me in sending in this
communication was to prevent any complica-
tions in the payment of the January salaries
of the teachers in any of the boroughs, As
matters stand now, the Comptroller may take
the same action he took Iast month indemand-
ing that the salaries be charged to a lot of ac-
soOuNtS
; Toward the endof the meeting Commissioner
Swanstrom suc led in getting a resolution
passed that: Dr. Maxwell's communication be
prnted in the minutes, ‘Phis, he said, was
on ytair. The board voted to place Miss C. 0
Cary. ateacher, on the retired list and that she
shoul! receive half-pay from the time of her
resignation in February, 1803. This vetton
wns necessary because of the passage, by the
last Lewisluture, of Senator Plunkett's bill giv-
jing Miss Cary this money, As the Retirement
act for teachers was passed several years later,
the giving of back half-pay to this one teacher
is }ooked upon by the board as a rather unfair
discrimination,

A resolution waa passed disapproving of As-
semblyinan Minton's bill to give school ine
spectors more power, anda apecial committes
of five was appointed to be on the watch for
other bids which may be presented, The Com.
mittee on Supplies was authorized to contract

Tho place in which the smoking was done

her Jastevening on the streat and renewed an
nequaintance that began nearly a ron ago,
They went to a hotel and while there May
asked Kennedy if he knew of a place where
she contd “hit the pipe.” He told her that he
hada friend who “smoked,” and that he could
take herthere. She consented and they went
to Parker's room, Parker Jent them bik oute
fitand the pills were madelby Frank Gregg, an
inmate of the house, and also a slave tothe
drug, He says he cooked six pills and that
the girl smoked part of three, he and
Kennedy inhaling the remainder. They went
to sleep and Were awakened by the girl groan-
ing. They turned the light up and saw that
she was ill and that blood was coming from
her pose, She did not regain consciousness

The inmates of the house were arrested,
Harry Parker and Frank Grege were com-
mitted to the care of the police, George Whita
was commanded to appear atthe inquest which
will be beld to-morrow and Kennedy and

Comes to Town by Train Instead of Using
His Automobile,

Greexwrier, Conn, Jan, 24.-When William
Rockefeller paid a visit to Greenwich to-day he
did not come in his automobile, as has been
his custom of late, owing to the runaway ha
caused two weeks ago while here, The Boston

riage, to which was attached a prancing pair of
horses, had been driven over from Mr, Rocke-
follar’s estate in North Tarrytown to take him
to his extensive farm here, three miles from
the station. He drove back to Parrvtown a‘ter
inquiring after the health of Mrs. Blisha Minor
and her daughter, Mrs. Horace Smith, whose
horses became frightened at the automobile,
throwing them out ;

Mrs. Minor was the more injured of the two,
and has been eonftned to her bed ever einea
from the shoek iad injuries she received, Her
daughter has also been fll and is pot able to go
out yet.

He said that when be left England he was
