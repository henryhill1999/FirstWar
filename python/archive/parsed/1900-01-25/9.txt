STATE TRUST ST

PRESIDENT JOUNSTON SAYS THE RAID
IS ON TTS LAST LEGS,

 

Collateral on the $7,000,000 Loan Included
82,000,000 of Consolidated
Fact Which Mr, Kiing Failed to
tion tn His Petition to Gov. Roosevell,

Walter 8, Johiston, President of the State
Trust Company, speaking of the effort to cause
the Btate authorities to tako action of some
nort hostile to the trust company, sald yester-
day: ya

“These men are on their legs. ‘They
have been compelled to abandon avery charge
that had the slightest sulstance init They
went to Gov, Roosevelt with the story of the
misuse of millions by influential directors,
They aro now reduced to a plea of legal tech-
niealities and to forced constructions of the
law concerning one single transaction -the
Joan of $2,000,000 to a syudicate of six persons
in which three of our directors were jaterested
as mem bers.

“Well, in the first place, this loan has been
paid, We have our money, the syndicate has
ite securities and the transaction is concluded
And, 80 ends, to my regret and against my
protest, the most profitable business the con
pany has everdone, ‘Tho collateral security to
the loan was worth from 50 to 0 per cent
more than the Joan, and included $2,000,000 of

 

last

Consolidated Gas bonds; an! we Were
able to place the sum of $2,000,000
at 6 per cent. interest, and to
obtain at the samo time the ae

count of corporations whose average depos-
ite wore at all times more than one million
dollars. If this was acase of directors misusing
thecompany, [ only wish I had a few more
auch directors, Asa mutter of fact, it was a
case of directors sustaining the company,

Dringing useful business to the company,
building the company uo and making their in-
terest in its welfare shown in the profits to

stockholders.
“And it is precisely this which has distin-
guished the State Trust Company since its

present Management secured control, one year

0,
wetind you, itis in the guise of stockholders
that these people are making their attack

ey own fortyshares. They don't like the
fact that our deposits are $14,000,000 to-day
as against $7,000,000 a year ago; that our sur

Tus ia $1,200,000 as against $800,000 and
hat woe are doing more business and a
better business every day. Is any one so blind
as not to sea the motives of men who with
pages of lies attack the integrity of a trust
eompany’s management which has this record
to the credit of asingle year of administration’

*T do not believe it was a Violation of law for
us to lend money on good collateral to a part-
nership association of six persons on joint ac.
count tn which three of our directors were in-
terested. It happens that the three persons
not directors had the largest interest in the
ayndicate and were persons of the highest re
eponalbility and credit; any one of them able
to pay the whole Joan. believe there are
thousands of such loans in New York to-
day. The _large financial transactions
of New York calling for the lise
of money are conducted by great firms. The
individual members of such firms are sought
for by trust companies a4 trustees by reason
of their knowledge of securities and their
connections, If it is illega! for a trust com-
pany to loan on collateral to a syndicate or
vartnership in which atrustee has an interest
Tom afraid there will have to be a general
reajustment of loans

“From one point of view our depositories
olients and friends may be congratulated upon
this assault. [t has caused, upon our demand,
an examination by the Bunking Department of
every loan, big and littie,on our books Por
three days the official examiners have sat here
at my desk while there has passed in review
before them every detail of our company's
business. No bank in New York was ever sub
jected to 80 searching and complete an inquiry
8 the one we not only invited but exacted, and
the result pleases our company and its stock
holders hereafter beyond the reach of raiding
speculators.”

BANK OF COMMERCE EXPANSION,
ftockholders to Vote on March 15 on Taking
in the National Union Bank.

Formal assent will be given at a meeting of
the stockholders of the National Bank of Com-
merce on March 15 to the merger with that in-
etitution of the National Union Bank. Votes

teen directors, Elbridge I’. Gerry, Gordon
Norrie and Charles ©, Beaman will act jointly

Circulars that have been sent to the stock-
holders say: “After the National Union Bank
by inerease of its capital stock shall be pos-
sessed of net assets approximating $8,200,000,
the National Bank of Commerce, already hay
ing assets approximating $8,500,000, will be
pre to effect practical consolidation upon
these highly satisfactory terms: First, by pay-
ing to the holders of its present stock
a dividend of 10 per cent. and dec.
ond by issuing 50,000 shares of, new
stock for use by the Board of Directors fin the
acquisition of the assets of the National Union

k, which then will be more than equiva-

Jent to those of the National Bank of Commerce
in New York. The effect of the proposed con-
solidation will be to give to the National Bank
of Commerce in New York a capital and
urplus Jarger than that of any bank inthe

Tnited States. The Board of Directors unani-

mously recommends the stock holders promptly

rease the capital and surplus of the National

Bank of Commerce in New York and to acquire
the good will, business and assets of an active,
prose rous and most important financial in-

atita jon. . s

duce Exchange Trust Company, was elected a
director of the bank early this month.

WESTERN MARYLAND'S APFAIRS,

Mayor Hayes Indicates a Negative Line of
Action He Is Willing to Follow,

BaviimMonek, Jan, 24.--City Solicitor Carter
had a long conference with Mayor Hayes this
morning concerning tho floating indebtedness
ofthe Western Marviand. A number of plans
to protect it were proposed by Mr, Carter, but
were disapproved by the Mayor, who was
finally induced to promise that if a resolution
pledging the city not to enter foreclosure pro-
coedings against the Western Maryland Rail
road for one year is passed by the City Council
he will sign it

Mayor Haves told Mr, Carter that he would

not urge the passage of such a resolution, nor
would he oppose it. The resolution must be
assed by the City Council on ite own responsi-
jility. Tf its passage can be secured he will
sign it without hesitation. and strictly abide by
its provisions, as would be necessary.

VINANCIAL AND COMMERCIAL,

 

Wepnespay, Jan, 24.
| The stock market to-day, while of small pro-
portions, was strong. Dealings in London in
American stocks before the opening here wore
| at substantial advances. The first day of the
| London Stock Exchange settlement passed
oasily and the American issues were carried
into the new account at 4’. percent, The
whole situation ia London, in fact, was reported
as especially easy, notwithstanding the con-
tinued uncertainty as to the outeome of the
| movement of Gen, Buller against the Boers,
| Money was somewhat higher at Berlin, but
| this was accounted for by special transactions
and not by ary change in affairs in general at
that centre, While the South African war has
beon disclosing a declining influence, there
can be no doubt that the course of speculation
still depends ehlefly upon it and that any strik-
ing development in the war would make a ma-
terial difference in values, Tho trend of specu-
jation, indeed, can hardly be definitely defined
until events have progressed far enough to
deternine in what way and, approximately, in
what time the wer will end.

The flow of funds to New York, coupled with
the deposits of Government receipts in the
depository banks, is steadily foreing down rates
for money both on call and on time. It is also
resulting in the lessening of discrimination
against collateral, The offerings of time money
are notably liberal and the terms of lenders
are becoming attractive to borrowers, Another
addition to sterling exchange rates is a reflec-
tion of the growing ease in money both in New
York and London, While the supply of bills is
not large it is quite sufficient to meet the
requirements of remitters, There is nothiag
intheexisting state of exchange to foreshadow
aresumption of gold exports. The statement
of the Bank of England to-morrow will prob-
ably show that the bank now hasan abundant
stock of gold

The principal activity on the Stock Exchange
was in the stock of the American Sugar Refin-
ing Company. The fluctuations in it were not
unusually wide, and it closed with a moderate
gain from yesterday. So far as surface indica-
tions go, the sugar trade war has stopped, but
no proof has yet been adduced of an actual
agreement between the American company
and the independent refiners, Arrivals of raw
sugar are vot heavy at present and the new
business in refined sugar is comparatively
limited, Glucose Refining was conspleuous for
strength. The trading in American Tobacco
was much smaller than it had been, but there
was an improvement in the price. Continental
‘Tobacco was unchanged, United States Leather
moved ir an uncertain way, but was bettered
fractionally in price. There was a good inquiry
for American Stee! and Wire anda sharp rise
in its price. Federal Steel, likewise,was strong.
The other steel stocks were rather quiet.
Brooklyn Rapid Transit was bought in expecta.
tion that the outcome of the annual meeting
would havea favorable influence on the stock,
There was arally in Metropolitan Street Rail-
way, and additions were made tothe prices of
both Third Avenue and Manhattan Railway.
The operations in Missouri Pacifle wereona
considerable scale, and the stock gained
slightly in price. Other railroad stocks in
which there was @ fair amount of business
were Atchison preferred, Baltimore and Ohio,
Burlington and Quincy, St. Paul, Louisville
and Nashville, Southern Pacific, Texas Pacific
and Union Pacifie. For all these stoeks ad-
vanves were recorded
