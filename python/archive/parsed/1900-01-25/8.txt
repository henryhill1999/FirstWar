Magnates Determined to Stop the Associn-
tlon Movement—Ex-Champion John L,
sullivan Expresses Interesting Views on
Pugilistic Matters of the Present Day,

Edward Hanlon, manager of the Brooklyns
and President of the Baltimore club, was in town
yesterday to consult with the other members
of the syndicate. While Hanlon would not talk,
it is evident that the Krooklyn- Baltimore mag
nates are somewhat exercised over the talk that
McGraw will jump into an Association club to
be placed in Haltimore. The conference held
fm the latter city on Tuesday betwoen President
Quinn of the Association and McGraw and the
latter's reported statement that he had raised 820,
000 and Intended to leave the League caused
no end of speculation, with the general opinion
what unless the League makes a counter move im-
mediately the Association men Will tangle matters
worse than they are at present As Tue SUN
has already pointed out, the League men are
not sleeping, but have framed something up
that is calculated to knock the spots out of the
Association movement Just what transpired
yesterday between Hanlon and Powers, Presi
dent of the Eastern League, ‘which is anxious
to take in Baltimore and Washington if those
citles are dropped, could not be learned as neither
would discuss baseball, and for that matter, they
denied having seen each other ai all. But they
met just the same and it is reasonable to suppose
that Powers got some information, or perhaps
gave sume as coming from Chairman Brush
of the Circuit Committee, for whom Powers is
supposed to be acting as an agent. Whether
the League circuit can be reduced or not depends
solely now upon the strength of the Associa-
tion movement League poeple admit that it
would be poor policy to reduce and thereby leave
territory open for a rival organization. In short,
the schemers Want to monopolize the whole bust-
ness, Which can be successfully accomplished
by the perpetuation of the twelve club circuit,
with two new cities admitted in place of Cleve
land and Louisville. Solong as there is evi
dence of opposition the League will make no at-
tempt to cut its membership down.

Just what the League will do with MeGraw
end other players who are reported to be talking
secession is a matterfor conjecture, A prominent
League man said yesterday that the “blacklist”
might be resorted to, but that several club owners
@re strongely opposed to any such measure, It

will be remembered that the League several years
avo “blacklisted” William Barnie and Fred Pfetfer,
for attempting to organize an Association circuit
while they Were in the employ of the Louisville
club. ‘The League Wasseverely censured at
the time for this proceeding and later the penalty
Was raised MeGraw is under reserve to the
Baltimore club, having signed «a contract las
yearin which wasthe option clause Which League
men believe is binding. If he jumps the reserve
ruleormakesany definite move to help theAssocia
tion at this time the League will either enjoin
himip the courts on the strength of his coutract
with the Baltimore club or he will be expelled,
along with every player Who goes with him. ‘I bis
information comes to THE SUN from @ responsi
ble member of the League who says that McGraw
has “monkeyed with the buzz-saw” long enough
and must be brought up With a round turn. With
out MeGraw and Baltimore the Association can
not start the season, it is believed, consequently
they are training their guns on the home of the
Orioles

 

The veteran shortstop, Jack Glasscock, has
received av offer to manage the Youngstown,
Ohio, club for the comingseason, Glasscock is
more than forty years old, but he continues to
play pretty good ball. At one time he Was con
sidered the best shortstop in the National League

years ago and siill sticks to him. [le

John L. Sullivan was sitting in a big chair in
his Hroadway cafe the other meht perusing the
Lewspapers through a pair of eveglasses, When
@ reporter of Ta Sun asked him how he felt he

Tee Yachts on Orange Lake Out Again,

Newaurea, Jan, 24.-There were two ica
yach’ races on Orange Lake to-day. ascrub
anda second contest for the O'Brien burgee.
The wind was light from the northwest and
the ice was hard and in good condition
first winnerof the trophy on Monday, Flying
Jib, carries only 385 equare feet of sxi'. but the
winner to-day, the Windward, is the largest
boat in the fleet and earries 728 square feet
At the start to-day Commodore Higginson got

& good send-off with the Windward and bis big |

boat was never during the ten miles in danger
of losing first place, The Arctic was only twen-
ty-three seconds behind. The lee Queen gave
the Arctic a good tussie for second place, being
only thirty seconds in the rear, andthe Cold
Wave made it interesting for the Snowdrift for
fourth place, being only twenty-elght seconds
behind her. The Troublerdid not fintah. The
scrub race was sailed this evening. The boats
that lined up were; Troubler, Windward, Are-
tic, Cold Wave and Snowdrift, The distance
was only three laps, or six miles) The Wind.
ward soon captured this. The Troubler pulled
out onthe first round and the Snowdrift later,
The uneertainty of the lying Jib being en-
titled to the burgee on Monday was dispelled
to-day, Tho Arctic finished first, Snowdrift
second andthe Jib third. On corrected time
the Jib got the race by twelve seconds over the
Aretic. To settle the matter the Jib was re-
measured to-day and her victory stands,
Flijiah Walsh, skipper and owner of the
Arctic, to-day presented a loving cup as a prize
for the club yachts to compete for. The main

points of the conditions are that the regular |

ten miles must be sailed and the boat owner
winning the cup three thiies is to be the pos-
sesser of the trophy forall time. Capt. Walsh's
boat, the Arctic, will not race for the prize,

“They wanted me to sign that agreement to

purse or a stake closing prior to July 1,” said
he toa reporter of Tne Sux, “but I sald ‘No, I
won't be a party to any kind ofa combination
like that; 1 don't belleve in boyeotis, I don’t
believe in entering my horses in these inatall-
ment races either, but if anybody wants to of-
for that kind of races and anybody else wants
to enter his horses in them it’s nono of my
business. Let them go on and enjoy them-
selves, It’s thoir privilege. As for my own
horaes I am going to divide them up Into two
strings, giving one to Andy McDowell and the

other to Ai Thomas, I shall let them

get the horses in shape te race
before I make any entries, Whenever Thomas
and McDowell tell me they are ready to go to
the races I will sayto them: ‘Go ahead, boys,

enter wherever you like.’ But I’m not going
to nominate a jot of horses alt months or 80 be-
fore they are to race, when I don’t know any-

the champion stallion Directum, 2:05'.. has
his atring of trotters and pacers working over
the Ice on Glen Lake, near the Suburban Stock

Trainer Charles Baldwin. Last year the owner
of Direetum sent his flyers to Dr, J, C. McCoy's

from the turf and bred to Directum. :

“Her break-down was & great disappoint-

* Have you any young Directums old enough
to train?”

“Yes, Baldwin will have three or four three-
year-olds bythe black horse in his string this
year. and I think they will give a good account
of themselves. Eight out of eleven two-year-
olds by Directum could beat 2:30 last year, and
three of them were able to beat 2:20. Nirvana
was defeated only a length or two in 2:14% in
the two-year-old race at Lexington ‘last fall.”

Heeley, won in a drive by a nose from Buda,
wiih Choice third, a head away. Witha stronger
finish Buda would have won, Sister Fox, the
favorite in the first race, did not show speed
at any stage. Barataria with anything like
good raving luck would have won, but strik-
ing the heavy going next to the rail in the
stretch was beaten a length by Yuba Dam, the
second choice, After a series of disuppotnt-
ments, Misericordia, belonging to the Morris
stable, atéthe comfortable odds of 15 to 1, won
the second race, Cheesemite, the favorite in

BIG AND LITTLE WHEELS.

THE SHOW OF ALL SIZES AND KINDS
CONTINUES TO DRAW,

 

 

Many Things That Are New at the Garden
Police Interrupt Marphy’s Riding—In-
ventor of fthe First Safety, and Other
English Visitors at the Exhibition,

There ia no quarre! about it because the cy-
clists and the automobiles recognize each
other as mpmbers of the samo set, but each
class thinks the other is taking too mach
crodit for the size of the crowd at the cycle
and automobile show at Madison Square
Garden, During the “study hours” of
yosterday afternoon there were about as
many in the aisles as at the opening, while
last night the crush in the passageways
was greater than at any previous time.
The stylish character of the crowd is some-
thing the automobilists ask credit for also, but
the cycle men declare that the best part of all
present are their customers, However.
neither class has cause to complain for the
fashionables andthe common folk seem to be
paying equal attention to all the show.

New things, great or small, are being added
to the show daily. Yesterday there arriveda
new gasolene runabout, a low rakish affair
that will not easily tip over, with double reach,
hinged axles, and a bicycle that can be taken
apart and put intoa hand case for travelling.

The Interest taken in educational features of
the exhibition strengthens the confidence of

the tradeamen in the belief that o great
year is ahead of them. A big machine
near the centro of the hall shows

how bevel gears are cut, It is a complicated
and formidable looking affair, but those who
watch {t are not bothered to understand the
details of its working. They can see the gears
being shaved to proper size and shape
and can see the big master gear at the
front and the guide {t operates upon and
understand how the accuracy that makes
every tooth the same is insured. Nearby is a
man who shows how to take apart and re-
assemble a chainless wheel.

Yosterday a little man, about forty years old
and wearing a saucy goatee, was one of the
group watching this exhibition, The operator
begins by removing the tool bag from the
whee), emptying it of its contents; he uses no
other tools. When he saw this the dapper
man with the chin whisker exclaimed:

“Gee! That's fair enough,”

Then he wriggled around fora place of more
vantage and throughout he asked questions
and made remarks. His antics amused every

onlooker. When the porrormanes had been
concluded he pranced into the inclosure and
said to a salesman ;

“Say, if that chap can teach me to do that
half as well as he does 1'!! buy one of your
wheels.”

In tires there are shown. some new wrinkles
in the weaving of their fabric that do not in-
terest riders much, but there a few things that
are novel and catch the eve, One innovation
is that of aself-healing inner tube for double
tires. Practien! tire men say tnat it is all
right. It consiataofa broad strip of uncured
rubber that {s fixed bya solution on the tread
of the {nner tube, This contractile rubber
promptly closes up any ordinary small pune-
ture, suchas that made by a pin oratack.
Another new article that strikes some as freak-
ish is a cover for tires made of rubber and fab-
rie, It wraps about the tire and is laced on the
under side. The tread of it is studded with
rivets 60 closely setthat it would be diMfleult
foratack point tostrike the tread and not be
deflected. ft is said to be 40 percent. puncture-
proof by reason of the rivets in ft and to be
durable and non-slipping. One such cover
weighs ten ounces and costs as inuch as a
cheap tire.

A new feature at the show is the number of
rubber tires for automobiles and other big
every variety anid
pneumatic, cushion and solid.
exhibits that excites curiosity
and interest is an electric delivery wagon,
the top of which can be taken off and a
cushion seat set on the box frame so that it
can be used as a pleasure carriage, Another
“auto” that takes well is a low-bullt four-
wheeler with a gasoline motor that carries two
persons tandem, one In front on a seat like
that of a buggy and the other on a bieyele sad-
die in the rear, within reach of controller and

vehicles. They are of
dimension,

One of the

steerer and brake. The ceutral part of the
frame is made of tubing and follows closely
the standard bieyele lines. The two
rear wheels with the motor can
be detatched and a wheel set fn a

pair of forks in front so that it. may be used as
a trievele for one person. Members of the
Automobile Club as well as those from many
bieyele organizations can be seen singly or in
parties every night. Someof the automobilists
noticed yesterday were: Harry Payne Whit-
ney, Whitney Lyon, A. L. Riker, Alfred C,
Bostwick, M. E. Hoskin, Harry Good, Gen.
Thomas Eckert, Homer Hedges, A, W. Cham-
berlain, Frederick Bronson, A, R. Shattuck and
Winslow bk. Busby. ;

A stir was created yesterday by police inter-
ference with the riding of Charlies M, Murphy,
who gives an (mitation on @ roller machine of
his ride behin a locomotive. Sergeant Mar-
tin, whois on detail at the Garden, thought
there was danger of Murphy falling off the
machine and pitching overthe edge of the plat.
form that is only a few inches ahead of
him down onthe heads of the people twenty
feet below. The performance does look dan-
gerous, and WwW Murphy is pedalling at
terrific speed, it seems asil he must pitch off
The machine beneath Murphy's wheels is like
the treadmill on which horses run on the
stage, and no expert man. need fall from it
The sergeant, however, said that Murphy must
head the other way, with his back to the audi-
ence, or sidewise, it the riding continued

A party of Visitors who were the centre of in-
terest in the afternoon were Harry J. Lawson,
W.M. Letts. and Charles Jarrott of London,
Lawson, in IN77, made and patented the firat
rear-driving chain safety, Letts is the manager
of the British Motor Coupé Company and Jar-
rott isthe champion motor cyclist of England

The latter sald he was greatly annoyed to
find that an impression had been created here
that he was a professional, which he is not. He
will race any man inthe country that he can
without saerificing his amateur standing. He
has brought atricycle with bim and was sur-
prised to find no racing motor tricycles here,
