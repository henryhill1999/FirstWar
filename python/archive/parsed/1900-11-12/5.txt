i conies, he says, with & purpose not diseimi-
‘Jartothar with which BENIAWIN FRankrin

went to France during the American Revo-
lutionary War. His mission, indeed, is a
more modest one, He no longer aske for
complete political independence, but his
miasion {s, so he avers, to persuade one or
more European Powers to urge England to
put a stop to the shedding of blood in South
Africa by offering the burghers terms that
they Legislative autonomy tn
domestic matters is the utmost that he now
hopes for; and, doubtless, he would agree
to admit the Vitlanders to the franchise
upon liberal conditions. It {s not impossi-
ble that the British Government, disgusted
at the prospect of {nterminable warfare,
might listen to such a proposal, were it con-
trolled to-day by ‘uch men as Lord Drr-
Ham showed himself to be when he was
sent to pacify Canada after Parinrav's
Rebellion.

There ia not, however, the slightest chance
that the British Government will restore
legislative autonomy to the Transvaal and
the Orange Free State at the present time.
On the contrary, {t would resent as an un-
friendly act any application to that end on
the part of a foreign Power, We may,
therefore, take for granted yt M. Dere

Affairs, who has no desire to plunge his
country into war With England, will set his

even probable that he will oppose wilh

Then the Waldeck-Rousseau Cabinet will
find itself again in jeopardy, for nota few
of ita habitual supporters may concur with
the Nationalists in thinking that it ill be-
hooves the French Republio of to-day to
show itself less genorous toward Infant
Commonwealths struggling to be free than
was the Bourbon monarchy a hundred and
twenty-two years ago.

THE BOER GENERALS CRITICISED.
Notes of a French Officer in the Transvaal.
From the Figaro

If the English Generale at the beginning of
the South African casnpalgn astonished the
world with their incompetence and were beaten
fu nearly every encounter by a nutuerically
inferior enemy, the Boer chiefa who were ob-
posed to them have shown that they were,
perhaps, worse still, and they are in a laree
mneasure responsible fur the reverses which
have delivered their country to the invader
Of course, they have the excuse of not belie
professional military men; many of them never
saw war. They were called suddenly froin
their farms to direct the march of several
thousand undisciplined men totally devold of
military instruction. Flected by the burghers,
from the “corporal” to the “Commandant
General,” those Boer officers have no other
authority than that which their men chose tu
give them

It was my good fortune to be present at one
of these elections in the corps of volunteer
suouts to whieh L belonged, The Command-
aul, the ciief officer of the corps, was haunted
sormewhat by kuropean ideas, and he wanted
to have a Captain and two Lieutenants ap-
polnted fn addition to the three corporals al-
teady elected. He notifled his men, and at
the appointed hour a blast of % whistle caused
wil to assemble around their ehiet, There is
nothing solemn in euch a meeting The elec-
(ors gather in a circle, some standing up, some
lying down, and others sitting on their heels,
Kafir fasiion, Then the pipes are lighted

In this case tie Commandant, from the
centre of the circle, after reminding his men
briefly that they should alwa)s be the first tu
altack and the last to retrait, explained the
ect of the meeting. Ininediately a@ tall
blond Boer, who was well liked by his
rades fur his numerous exploits, arose, and, in

such officers not beg apparent. The Cor
mandant aecepted this decision without di+-

cussion, He then asked for an adjutant
“What for?” asked the voluntcers
“Te the corps should be divided in the course
& reconnol-sance L should need a man to
transmit my ordera, was the answer

This explanation sutisfactory @n
adjutant was chosen by the Commandant

It then remained to choose a Captain, Ivers
man had the right to nominate a candidate.
lintediately every one shouted out “L nomi-
hate so and so When the had
