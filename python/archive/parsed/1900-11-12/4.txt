that appointments to the academy for the next

ra each United States Senator the right be given
to appoint eadets. He urges also that “The

THE COMI

Mr. Dalsell Expects Contests Over the Ap-

Portionment, Shipping and Army Rills,

Wasuinaton, Nov. 11. -Representative Dal-
zell of Pennsylvania, a member of the House
committees, fn
outlining the probable legislation of the coming
seswion of Congress to-night, expressed the
opinion that the principal contests of | the
seasion would be over the Apportionment bill
the Shipping bill aud the propo ed reorge niza
tion of the arms The reduction of the war
revenue taxes would also catse something of a
fight, particularly in determining what taxes
should be removed or merely rediiced and how
much relief in a lump sum was to be al orded
The Nicaragua Canal bill might @lso come
up again, but that hardly seemed probable

The defeated and discredited Democrats
he continued, would undoubted!
bitter a fight against the Shipping and Arn
bille as they coud To expeet at ything less
would be to prophesy that they had chucked
their bogy men ealled “ioperialism” and
“militarism” into the garret That would
be foolish propheey, The atruae on the
reapportionment bill would probably be a
bi-partisan one. The leaders appeared 1)
