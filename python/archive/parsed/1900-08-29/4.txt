The first race of the day, a dash for two-
year-olds down the last five and a half fur-
locus of the new Futurity course, was signa-
lized by the victory of @ gon of the “horse of
the century,” Ormande.. He was passed over
by the talent in favor of All Green and Kenil-
worth, but the California colt trimmed the
pair in a driving finish

Belle of Troy played to odds-on, soored
an easy victory tn the second race and looked
such a bargain at the entered selling price
of $2,000 that Tod Sloan bid her uP to $4,000
JE. MeDonald protected her with the cus-

collected more than the deficiency in the ring

The hurdle race resulted in a clean-cut win
for the favorite, Klondyke, over the second
choice, Dranghteman, Nine horres com-
peted and all kept their feet, although the race
was rin at a fast clip, King Bramble, at the
liberal odds of 6 te 1, won the closing race of the
day easily by two lengths from ttie Gray,

ioted at the same price. The joint favorites,
ttente and Mayor Gilroy, finished third and
sixth, respectively. The race calls for little
description, as after the firet half, during which
Mayor Gilroy looked formidable, the three
horses in the money fought it out among them-

   

selves, Bettie Gray had a tight squeeze to
beat Potente and only beat him a neck for the
place. Summary:

THE WALCOTT-WEST FIASCO,

Tweatieth Centary Clab Has Not Paid the
Loser's End of the Parse.

The unexpected termination of the battle
between Joe Walcott and Tommy West at
Madison Square Garden on Monday night was
widely discussed by the sports yesterday. Wal-
cott was roundly condemned by all those who
lost money on him, and judging from the com-
ments expressed, tt ls doubtful whether he will
be able to restore himself in the confidence of
the public again. That Walcott is a great
fighter {s not denled Although he says he

was not in the best condition,his showing proved |
otherwise, for he cut out a fast pace from the |

start and was vever in danger at any stage
The management of the Twentieth Century
A. f: where the mill was fought declares that
it $ ould be held blameless in reference to the
fight.
states that Wolcott will not get a cent of the
loser’s end of the purse, no matter what may
betide. He is very bitter against the colored
yugilist and hints that there is a plot on foot
»y sore of his enemies to kill his club and keep
the public froin attending the fight between
McCoy and Corbett to-morrow night

In a talk with THE SUN reportert Walcott said
yesterday

I was not in the best of “condition and quit
because my arm was hurt. I did not have very
much time in which to train. My stomach
was bad, too. andI shouldn't have gone on, But
I did not wish to disappoint the crowd, ana
that is the reason why I went on and fougit
The flight was no fake. I got licked fairly ana
syuarely, that’s all.”

Walcott did not look like a man who was not
in perfect trim. ‘There was no sign that his
afm was notin normal condition, and he seemed
to be as weil and healthy as he ever was

Rublin and Maher May Fight to England,

There {sa possibility that Gus Rublin may
soon go abroad and meet Peter Maher before
the National Sporting Club, London, some time
this winter. Billy Madden, Rublin’s manager had

a talk with Peter Lowery, who does Maher's
business, and asked the latter if Maher would
fight Rubiin in England. Lowery repiled that
the Irishman would aud Madden promised

to see Dr Ordway, the club's Ameri-
cun representative, to-day about a match
Madden expects a $5,000 pur-e Maher «nd

Rublin fought one of the hardest heavyweight

Madden has also under consideration an offer
fromaciub in San Franciaco for a 20-round
struggle between the “Akron Giant" and Maher.
Ile «ays he wants to wait until he hears from
the foreign club) before he accepts. Billy fur-
ther said that Gus is prepared to tackle Bob

performances and vew records, and it is more
than suspected (hat « desire to meet Nelson and
prove hiinself still able to hold the cffamplon-
ship was u large part of the reason for his re-
turn, In a brief talk last nigbt Elkes said that
he did not like the French style of pacemaking
with tricycles “as big as locomotives.” tie
said that while in Europe he had won more
races than had Edouard Taylore, the French
champion. lu hie opinion the sport is de-
generating in France, having been overdone,
and next year Germany, he thinks, will take
the lead fu evele racing. Concerning the merits
of the Frenchmen as riders Elkes said that they
beat the world at short eprint riding, their whole
idea and practices being to loaf around the
track until the turn for home. 1p consequence
they are faster for the last 100 yards of a race
than American riders, Cooper, Elkea said,

The agitation in the League of American
Wheelmen begun by the determined oppo-
sition of the New York State officers to the
abolition of the State divisions has by no means
been settled. The New Yorkers are as deter-

mined as ever in (hivstand they have taken. As
a matter of fact the League is in a precarious
condition. This is admitted by its most ardent
supporters and oldest members, To abolish
the State divisions would be to leave only a
nominal organization, in the opinion of the
New York recaicitrants, and if it ls done “there
willl be in a year,” according to one man, “both-
ing left of the league but the secretary, bia
$5,000 salury and a few hundred members con-
etituting virtually a mutual admiration sv-
ciety. Chief Consul Belding of this State
cane out plainly in @ talk with a reporter of
THe SUN yesterday and said that the League
should pay only for clerical work. It
is understood by the New Yorkers
that the latest idea of the Revision
Committee is to leave the State divisiond
in existence, but have all the money

o to the uational officials without rebate
for division expenses. This would. prevent
the maintenance of an office or headquarters
in the State where members could go. Chief
Consul Belding {s a business man, fe be-
jevea that it was all right for the League w
have {ts office in a hat or a vest pocket when
there were only a few hundred members, but
that with several thousand dollars it ts nec-
essary to have an office In order to do business
properly. It is argued by those who favor the
Pbolition of the State divisions that {n England
there are no divisions of the Cyclists’ Touring
Club, which is highly prosperous, After firat
replying that the Unfted States is vastly differ-
ent from England in a way that makes State
recognition necessary, the oppositionists in
New York have bettered the sugges ton by
declaring that it gets more meney from ita
menibers in the shape of dues, pays its secre-
tary less and gives its members more for their
money than the League. It is thought by
some that it would be a wise solution of the
League's whole diMculty to charge $).25 or
$1.50 for annual dues instead of $', and it is
held that this would be as readily paid by the
thirty odd thousand who are now loyal.

The residents of six Long Island villages
have combined to prevent any_more women
racing around the triangle at Valley Stream
to make records as long distance bicycle riders
Petitions are being circulated tn Valley Stream,
Spricetield, Freeport, Rockville Centre, Hemp-
stead and Baldwins, asking the Board of Health
of the town of Hempstead to prohibit the per-
formances and to pass an ordinance to that
effect on the ground that the exbibitions are
not conducive to pulic morals.

Itis through thesestx villages thatthe women
cyclists ride in their efforta againsttime. The
movement against the women ia being con-
ducted by the pastors of every church In the
six villazes. A mass meeting has been called
to be held at Freeport this week at which the
racing of the women will be denounced and
a demand made for speedy action on the part
of the village authorities

The clergymen do not declare that the women
racers act improperly, but that they are urged
on by men and the influence of the races has
a depressing effect upon the residents of the

Boston, Avg 28.—Will Stinson proved him-
self more than a match for (Champion at Charles

had he made a harder fight he would have
pushed Chainpion for seoond place. Miller got

the pole in the drawing, but Stinson caught the

settied down to steady work behind Champion

ten yards unul they both had lapped
Miller. Then they. again settied down

to the same old galt, the time for the miles be-
coming slower and slower Miller was not mak-
ing any appreciable neadway, and Stinson
finally got the lead on Champion in the second

lap of the twenty-third mile, holding it
to the finish, Miller had in the mean-
time been pugeng & little, and seemed

in a fair way to beat out Champion for
second morey, but as the laps went on he
seemed to lose heart and finally quit entirely
The best mile of the evening was the fourth,

Jim Kennedy, who is managing the testimo-

merits. George Munroe and Willie Ryan, at
118 pounds; Aif Levy and Young Kehoe, at
115 pounds, and dim Burke and Denny Moore,
at 135 pounds will try for supremacy Nume-

tions made preparatory to the fall regatias

Some slight changes are being made in the

to the rig. A new mast has been stepped
further aft than the old one and a few feet

TROTTING AND PACIN

Connor Lowers His Record in the 2:10 PF
at Previdence.

Provipance, R L, Aug. 28.—To-day was an
ideal one for light harness racing and a big
crowd was preseut on the second day of the
Grand Circult Meeting here. The events
were well contested and exceedingly interesting.
That the Narragansett Park track is one of the
fastest in the country was proved to-day by
the me made in every event. In the second
heat of the 2.10 pace Connor not guy lowered
his own record but also the record of his class
so far this season. The talent went astray
in all but one event, Connor being the only
favorite to win. The 214 trot brought over
from yesterdey drew the crowd out early.
This event was landed by Alice Barnes, who
showed unexpected form. Fyolute won the
224 pace handily in good time. In the 2:80
trot Mir Middlemay showed hia heels to the
bunch. The 2:10 pace was the best event ov
the card. Connor won in three straight ayes,

ap

 

 

but was forced clip his own record to
16 money. It is predicted tha many of the
roult fecords will be smashed before the
end of the week, as the splendid condition of
the track (s the talk of the drivers. Sumunaries:

As the day of the battle between Jim Corbett
and Kid MoCoy draws near (nterest in the out-

Corbett's quarters at Bath Beach is very
much lmpreased with his form and looks.

Corbett was up earlier than ugual yesterday
and took advautage of the cool morning alr
by covering ten miles on the road, alternately
running and walking. Upon his return a few
minutes was spent with the medicine ball and
when this part of his programme was over
Corbett got arub down. After dinner Corbett
took on four opponents one after the other.
The first toface him was George Munroe. Next
caine “Spider” Kelly of California and whea
Jim got through with him he tackled a former

club mate from San Franclsco. Leo Pardello,
the wrestler, was the last one to put on
njtta with Corbett. Llu all he boxed abo
fifteen three-minute rounds, After a short
rest Corbett had an {oning with the gad

Pardello on the mat followed. Pardello

oo the defensive and rraltted Corbett to
do all the work. Corbett showed how str

he was by turning Pardello almost on his

aod getung several dangerous holds,

Those who have seen “hid” MoCoy at work,

trim. The Kid's dally sparring exercises

Lacille Trots a Fast Mile to Wagen.

Cc. K. G. Billings’s mare Lucille, which re
oently set up a new trotting record to wagon,
acoomplished another great performance at
the same style of going at Chicago on Satur-
day last. The time made, 2 minutes and 10

seconds, though not as good as the record, was
remarkable Use e Washington Par
track,on which the mare trotted,was so soft (
holding that @ mile in 2:15 was the best looked
for from either trotters or pacers. In addition
John Tucker, the manager of Mr. Billings*’s
racing stable, who welg 8 about 200 pounda,
was in the wagon at the time of the trial.

There was no pacemaker. Lucille covered
the half mile in 1:06, then increased her speed,
keeping to the better going some distance from
the rail. Tucker urged Lucille to her utmost
nearing the finish and she dashed under the
wire in 2:10, having made the last half ip 1:06
and the last quarter in 0.20.
