Hish visitors to American lawn tennis courte
Orie {es what rankles, and Gore, the captain
of the visiting team, went home a very much
disappointed Englishman :

“when I left home,’ he sald at Newport the
st day of the tournament, “I was looked on
as almost vertatn to win your all-comere’ tour-
sament, if not your championship. It waa
Adiculous, my losing to Wrenn: 1 should have
peaten hirn in str ight seta as easily as Larned
did, and then I dare say Larned and I should
have played a very fine game in the finals,
1 could have beaten him {f he played no better
than to-day against Whitman, but T do not care
to say what | think of my chances against

yon
os might be more willing to believe
that Gore's losing to Wrenn waa a fluke if he
had not taken full flve seta to beat Ward two
days before, for Ward is not so strong as Wrenn.

Asto the causes of the failure of the chal-
jenging team, there were many reasons given.
Al) three of the visitors protested that they
were fully fifteen off their game and there is
probably some truth in this. J. Parmly Paret,
who saw both Gore and Black play when he
was abroad two Years ago, Says that they cer-
tainly did not show their true form here, but
that the difference was not great enough to
account for their poor scores in the international

ea,

- chief reason why they did not show
their best form was because they came over
here only four dara before the international
matches were to begin and spent two of these
sightseeing at Niagara Falla instead of prac-
tiaing for their matches There can be no doubt
that they came here grossly overconfident,
for all declared after being beaten that they
had no idea that the American standards at
the game were so high before they left home.
But the English authorities must have been
dreaming to let them come over here with any
such idea and let them officially represent Great
Britain with only two days’ practice under
strange conditions afier an ocean voyage.
Two of the members of the committee that ar-
ranged the plans for this match were Mahony
and Nesbet, both of whom were over here only
three yeare azo and had a good taste of Amer-
jean skill then. How little they told their rep-
resentatives is apparent from Black's state-
ment that he did not even bring spiked shoes
over with him, supposing he was to play on
dirt courta. Yet it was officially announced
and well known on the other side long before
the English team started that the international
matches were to take place on the Hoboken
gfass courts, where both Nisbet and Mahony
played in 1897.

There were other reasons for the failure
besides overeonfidence and lack of prepa-
ration. Every one of the three visitors de-
dared that the “reverse twist ” services used
by all three of the Americans on the inter-
national team, were absolutely new to them
and a very heavy handicap against them.
Barrett put it best ata dinner to the visitors
the night after the last Longwood match at
the Somerset Club in Boston, He said:

“We were beaten by vour services, yet I hardly
dare to go home and tell them that. When
1 tell the Doherty brothers, our champions,

team

  

that we were beaten over here because we
could not hit a new twist service, they will
laugh at me, vet | wish they had @ chance to
try it, T sionld like te ' what they could

  

te against i+ I believe that the Doherty
vould have been beaton by Ward and Davis
4 doubles, though perhaps not as badly as
Black and I were”

Barret! had few criticisms to make and took
lis defeat very gracefully

Both Gore and Block complained also of the
wfvices of Davis, Whitman and Ward, which
they found so diffenl! to handle, and each at-
tributed much their failure to that. In
js, when the last English team was here,
Whitman was the only man to use this play
and Eaves, Mahonev aud Nisbet all complained
of it then. Whitman, it will be rememnered,
athough only secoid class then, beat Mahoney
at Newport and forced Nisbet to the full five
sets before he was beaten. Why these Eng-
Iishmen did not warn this year’s visitors of
what they inight expect here is beyond com-
prehension

Gore, however, declared that this twist ser-
vice could not be made in England because the
English balls were harder and would not take
all the necessary twist or lose their shape in
the air, and the harder courts would not per-
mit these erratic bounds. Whether this be
rue or not remains for Davis to find out on the
other side this fall, but Larned, Paret and others
whe have pi “abroad doubt it

Gore Nd not en ‘ear himself to the hearts of
the American olavers as ct! Black and some of
the earlier English visitors to American courts.
Almost the first cay he reached Longwood he
complained of the courts, the balls, the nets
and almost everything else. When pressed
for the reason he finally admitted that his
chief objection to them lay in their eolor—he
preferred cark to white nets. He said they
gue too high. too long, and had too wide bands,
Ut the dimensions were proved to be correct.

Gore also objected to playin

6-2, 6-8, 6-1 forthe American. Gore required
the full five seta to beat Ward and then lostin five

ta to George Wrenn, who could do nething at
all the next day against one of the first-class
Americans, Larned and Black took flye sets,
each to beat Hardy and Budlong, each of whom
like Ward and Wrenn, are second-class players
here. It ts easy to imagine what would have
happened to either of the visitors If at New-
ort he had struck Larned, Davis, Wright or
Khitan, the four first-class players of the
country.

Although rated higher abroad than any
previous British team that his visited Amert-
“an courts, this year's visitors showed poorer
orm and had less success than 4 of their
pieces essore. Goodbody won our All-eomers
‘im and Mahony got firat and second places

 

| agalnst America’s picked cracks at Weat New-

ton Eaves and Nisbet won first and second
prizes at Newport, but Gore and Black were
nowhere when the tournament was over

The difference tn methods and styles of play
was more responsible, American experts be-
leve, than individuality. Pure base Hne play
ns Never succeeded over here against Ameri-
can volleyers, and Gore's chances were dis-
counted from the first because of his inability
to volley. Such play mey be successful againat
the English method of volleying from the base
line, but hardly when the opponent gets close
up fo the net to kill the return by short volleys
across the front of the base-line players’ court.
The fact that Fnutish volleyers’ sfay further
back makes it unprofitable as well us unnec-
essary to lob, so Pnvlish base-line playere do
not use this stroke often. .

Discovering that, both Wrenn and Ward
successfully ventured in very much closer to
the net against Gore than they would have
dared to do against an American, who learns
to stop this by lobbing over the volleyer's head,
If Gore had lobbed and driven Wrenn back
in his court at Newport, there might have been
n different result, His play showed a gfeat
lack of variety and headwork,

It is hoped that another challenge for the
Davis trophy will be issued next vear. and
another British tearm be sent over, but if the
Fnglish want to win they will have to senda
stronger team than the last and sendit over
long enongh before the matches to get used
to American conditiona,

BOERS FIGHT

 

 

STU RBORNLY,

 

Resist Baller for Two Days After the Capture
of Bergendal.
Special Cable Despatch to THE SUN

TONDON, Aug, 28.—The War Offlce has re-
ceived the following despatch from Lord Rob-
erts, dated Belfast, Aug. 27, 720 P. M,

“Our movements have been necessarily slow
on account of the great extent and diMleult
nature of the country over which we are oper-
ating, but to-day we made a satisfactory ad-
vance and met with decided success,

“The work fell entirely upon Buller’s command
and resulted in the capture of Bergendal, a
very strong position two miles northeast of
the Dalmanutha Railway station

“Ll met Buller at Bergendal shortly after our
forces arrived there and was glad to find that
the occupation cost less than had been feared
on account of the approach to the Boers’ position
being across an open glacis for 2,000 0r 3,000
yards and because of the determined stand of
the enemy.

“The Inniskillings and the Second Rifle Brigade
formed the attacking party. The latter suffered
the greater loss. Gen. uller could not give
me the number of casualties, but 1 hope that
they will not exceed fifty or sixty

“A good many Boers were killed, some of
them on a rocky knoll by lyddite. A pompom
was captured on our left.

“Gen. French advanced to Swartz kopjes
on the Lydenburg road, and prepared the way
for the movement of Pole-Carew's Civision to-
morrow.

“Gen Rundle reporta that he made a recon-
noissance in the Brandwater basin on Aug. 2
and suffered some casualties. One Boer was
killed and sevente®n were captured He also
ecured 700 head ot cattle

“Gen, Baden-Powell reports that he occupied
Nylstroom unopposed, his troops and those of
Gen. Paget afterward returning to Pretoria”

A despatch from Pretoria, of yesterday's
date, says that Gen De Wet is reported to
be in the neighborhood of Heilbron

The War Office expecta that peace will be
established in a few weeks, although to-day's
telegrains show an increase in guerrilla war-
fare in the Orange River Colony with the re-
appearance of Gen. De Wet at Heilbron. Boer
commandos are gathering at Senekal and
Bethlehem. Gen. Buller's capture of Bergen-
dal was followed by two days of severe fight-
ing. The Boers determinedly held their ground.
Two hundred Rand police occupied a small
rocky kopje, and it required a bombardment
with lyddite and later a charge by the rifle
brigade to compel them to vacate. Their com-
mandant, named Moosthuizen, was taken
prisoner '

The Boers continue to hold positions south
of the railway at Belfast. On Monday two
heavy guns shelled the British, eompelling
their transport to retire.

Gen, French is advancing slowly along the
north parallel with Gen. Buller, while Gen,
Roberts is awaiting developments in the centre

Hotel Impertal Guests Alarmed.

Fire on the second floor of the four-story
brownstone front house at 30 West Thirty-
second street, occupied by Mrs. H. M. Foote
as a boarJing house, created considerable
excitement among the guests of the Hotel
Imperial at 8:45 o'clock last night. The house
is almost directly in the rear of the hotel and
when the engines arrived and the guests smelled
the amoke, many, thinking that the hotel was
burning, ran into thestreet. The fire was soon
extinguished with a loss of about $100.

the procession awung down Michigan boulevard,

The Sters and Stripes led thejcolumn as, her-
alded by twelve trumpeters, it marched west
on Randolph street and into the Court of Honor.
First, there was the “Pageant of Patriotiam,'’
Gen, Danial FE Sickles of New York command-
ing. Faecorting him was the Lafayette post of
New York, and then came the old post of Wash-
ington, The guests of honor were next, among
therm being Gen Nelson A. Miles, the Duke and
Duchess de Aroos and the Presidents of the
Women’s Relief Corps, the ladies of the G. A. K.,
and the Nurses’ Association, Thus the column
approached the reviewing stand, Opposite Hub-
bard Court there was abrief stop to allow the

guests to take their seats Then the flag of the
G. A. R. was hung out, ue star- and Stripes
and the Banner of Peaoe moved forward again,
and the long tnarch was fairly under way

Col, Joseph H. Wood. Grand Marshal of the
day, led the oo.ums, eseorted by the (Citizen's
Committee, mounted, 100 strong, and then came
Wisconsin, leading the veterans of the Grand
Army ‘The :ands plaved ‘Tramp, Tramp,

handful of survivors of the famous Iron
Hrigade march d by, led by Gen F. 8. Bragg.
‘The veterans of the Baceer State were followed
by those from Pennsylvania, their old battle
flags attrac ting much attention. Ohio madea
fine showing in the seoond division and was
followed by New York, the Bidwell-Wilkeson
postof Buffalo having the honor of escorting
the Commander-in-Chief Next came. posts
from Massachusetts, Connecticut, New Jersey,
Maine, California, Nevada, Rhode Island, New

Dakota, Washington, Arkansas, Tennessee;
Mississippi, Texas, Icabo, and other States,

ing up the rear of the parade

The signal gun for the start of the procession
was fired shortly after 10 o'clock and the
parade was nearly five hours in passing the re
viewing stand, ‘The veterans marched twelve
abreast. ‘There were no divisions in the parade
and it moved as a compact tase, the States
und posts bein distinguished by guidonsa and
banners. Because of Its sitnplicity the ranks
were formed aud moved away with little diffl-
culty Only 196 posts In the United States were
unrepresented in the procession

Fifty ragged and torn battle flags in the

Aa Exhibition of Paintings Suggested as a
Means of Increasing It.

The Citizens’ Committee which has in
charge the collection of funda for the
erection of a naval arch on the design of
the Dewey Arch has received bo additional
subscriptions since the report of Aug. 1, when
the total of the fund was $107,780.12, It was
said yesterday that the headquarters of the
committee had been clored for sorne time, as
the absence from town of most of those who
might be interested in the project seemed to
offer a good opportunity for the secretary of
the committee, Charles BL. Nicoll, to take his
vacation, Mr. Nicoll said yesterday that no
energetic efforta would be made to get more
subscriptions until afterthe elections, Until
then he thought {t would be hard to interest any-
body in anything except politics,

The Arch Committee has made arrangements
through Louis Windmuller for the transfer
to this country as a whole of the exhibit of
American paintings at the Paria Exposition,
if the Arch Committee should think it desirable
to give an exhibition of the paintings for the
benefit of the arch fund.

and Third avenue, from fugg@us polsoning,’has
discouraged mushroom gathering in The Bronx.
Mushrooms grow in abundance in most of the
parks in The Bronx and for years search for
them has been a favorite pastime. Dr. bP. J,
Byrne of 836 Alexander avenue, who attended
Mr. Lyons, said to a SUN reporter yesterday:

“Mr. Lyons did not dle of mnashroom pois-
oning, but muscarine poisoning, which comes
from the toadstool. ‘his kind of poisoning
differs from ptomaine potsoning, although the
symptoms are somewhat similar.”

 

It was said yesterday that the supposed
mushrooms Mr. Lyons partook of were canned
ones, Most of the canned mushrooms are

imported from France, They are not harm-
ful in any way,
The dry goods store of Lyons & Chabot was

closed yesterday out of respect for Mr. Lyons's

memory. Mr. Chabot Is in Paris at the Expo-
sition,

Avery Mills, a Negro, of Forest Clty, N. ©,
Shoots M. H, Flack, His Landlord, for
Trespass Flack Calls for Mi'ls's Blood

Mob Attends to It om the Way to Jalil,

CHARLOTTE, N.C. Aug. 28.--A negro named
Avery Mills was taken from the peace officers
near Forest City, N. C., at noon to-day and
riddled with bullets by a mob, which sought
to avenge the death of Mills H. Flack, a former
member of the Legislature and a well-known
citizen of Rutherford county, who was shot and
killed by Milla about 0 o'clock this morning,
Three days ago Flack went to his plantation,
which is rented to Mills, or who, by some agree-
ment, is making a crop this year, to get some
fruit, whereupon Mills's wife ordered him off.
He refused to go and she went to the house
and secured a pistol and went back the second
time and ordered bim to leave. He left rather
than have a difficulty.

This morning at 9 o'clock Flack, his son
Otho, and another boy went to the plantation
in a wagon to pull fodder. Milla's house is
about one hundred yards from the road, He
appeared and halted Mr. Flack and began to
renew the talk about the fruit, when Mills'’s
wife brought him his pistol. He took it and

shot Flack just under the heart, Flack, having
a shotgun, drew and fired, the shot taking
effect in the negro'’s shoulder. Flack then
took the gun and pounded the negro over the
head with it until it was broken

The negro attempted to shoot Flack's son,
but he hit the negro on the head with a stone
and took his pistol away from him and shot him
in the hip. The negro was not hurt badly.
Flack died {n leas than an hour

The news soon spread and the Forest City
people were gathered at the scene. The negro
and his wife were arrested. Flack said to his
friends before he died that he conld not live
Jong, that the negro had killed him and that
he wanted him hanged and wanted his friends
to see it done. He was then taken home and
the negro and his wife brought before a Jus-
tice, who at once committed them to jail They
were placed in the custody of Town Marshal

Hamrick and Constable Hardin A crowd
overtook them two and one-half miles from
Forest City. Sheriff Martin, leading another

crowd, was on the way, but stoppea down the
road a few hundred yards to keep the people

back. Meantime the first crowd had held up
the wagon, and were waiting for a second
squad The Town Marshal, who was driving,

attempted to push on, but the small crowa
held him and told him nottomove. Theerowd
was appeale! to to let the negro alone and let
him go to jail and take the full course of law,
and at the time it seemed as if they would sub-
Init, but some one would then make a remark
about the killing and stir the crowd again

Finally the Marshal in charge of the wagon
drew his revolver and started’ hix horses, but
Just then a fresh body of horsemen arrived
and velled to the mob to take hold of the negro,
The offeers were pushed aside and the negro
dragged from the wagon. Afier allowing him
to sit down for tive minutes the prisoner was
marched off about a hundred vards from the
road, A volley was fired at him, bringing in-
stant death,
