BRIDGE BIDS INJUNCT

ARGUMENT YESTERDAY ON IT BE-
FORE JUSTICE GILDERSLEEVE.

Mr, Meyers’s Counsel Attacks the Prevailing
Rate of Wages Claase-Saye It Is Mon-
strous Vicious, Unconstitutional and Titegal
—Harte Contractors and Laborers, Too,

Argument was heard by Justice Gilder-
sleeve in the Supreme Court yesterday on the
motion ef Julius Meyers, a4 a taxpayer, to
enjoin the letting of bids for the approaches
to the new Fast River Bridge on allegations that
the terms of the contracts are illegal. Seven
bide have been made, ranging from $1,874,000
to $1,678,000, for the approach on this side, and
from $926,000 to $1,119,800 for the approach

on the other side,

Meyers's action proceeds on the ground
that the terms of the oontracta require larger
sums to be pald than is necessary, *0 that as
a taxpayer he in pecuniarily interested in pre-
venting the acceptance of the bids. The ob-
Jeotions contained in his motion papers are
that the contracts should not provide that
the prevailing rate of wages must be paid
that the provision as to the steel to be used
{e iDegal, because under it the contractor would
have to buy his steel from a certain company,
which makes {it atee) by secret process, and
also that the provision is {llegal which requires
that\bidders must have been engaged in brides
work \for at least a year. But the argument
of L. Lafin Kellogg, counsel for Mr. Meyers,
turned mainly on the provision touching the
prevailing rate of wages, regarding which he
sald:

“It is monstrous, vicious, inconstitutional
and illegal, It requires contractors hot to
pay the prevailing rate of wages in the open
market, but the prevailing rate of wages in
some secret market, a rae rewiated by some
labor organivation, It works net only an in-
Justice to contractors but also to laborers, It
prevents fair and honest competition of labor
It is unfair to the city, as it is compelled to pay

, ce fo contracts because
@ mech higher pricralt Bea beta beenwnse
they do not know just where they stand when
they put in bids; they cannot tell the price they
will have to pay to the laborers they will have
to employ under the contracts Il this is @
violation of the Constitution oof the United

States and of the State of New York
“Your Honor knows that between the efty
and it immediate employers this law is con-
atitutional, because this city the creature
of the Legislature and the Legislature has a
right to deal with the city's employees as ft
gees fit. The courts have not iceapted the
provisions of the Labor law as between the
contractor and the city as conetitutional, or
tween a contractor and his sub-contractor
he Legislature has been passing these sumpt-
uary laws In the interest of politicians and
other classes, and if we cannot rely upon the
udiciary to prevent these unconstitutions |
aws from being enforced then this country
will be ruined.” ,
Assistant Corporation Counsel Hill said
that it was not customary for the ‘ ware at
cial Term to pass upon constitutional ques
Gees, ttn hold that Mir. Meyers should not
have the injunetion, because of the delay he
had caused. Bids had been advertised for
on July 9 to bein by Ang. 9. He saidthe Bridge
Commissioners had the right to say what sort
of steel they considered best and ¢! had
not prevented competition by the provisions
as to the kind required. The provision for

DROWNED FROM ISLAND FERRY BOAT.

Patient From Hellevoe Jomped Overboard,
bat They Don't Know Who He Was.

A man Jumped overboard from the Chart-
ties Department steamer Thomas Brennan
while she was on her way from the foot
of Fast Twenty-sixth street to Blackwell's
Island yeaterday morning with between
thirty and forty patients who were being
transferred from Bellevue to the City Hos
pital The man was drowned, and his
body was not recovered. A peculiar feature
of the accident is that the Bellevue authori-
ties are unable to tell who he is, as he had his

“history card” in his pocket
The Brennan was off East Thirteenth street
when the cry_was raised that there was a man
erboard. The tide was coming in and the
rennan went some distance upstream — be
fore the reversing of her engines stopped her
way. The Glen Malena steninboat Sam Sloan
was passing downstream, however, and one
of the deckhands threw a rope to the drown.
ing man. The men on the Sloan say he made
no attempt to save himself, but, instead, pushed
his head under water ano sank ont of sight.
The Brennan came back downstream, but
was unable to see anything of the hody
It is thought that the drowned man is one
of seven alcoholic patients who were sent ap
to the Island for treatment, but ft isn’t certain
thathe was. Fach man'sname, address, friend's
name and address, father and mother's name
and other details are written on a card and the
patient carries it in his pocket until he is ad-
mitted to the hospital on the Island, where
his igree is copied into the books of that
inetitution. This man’s card ts with him in
the river, and the Bellevue authorities are un-
able to tell who he is, because they keep no
iat of the persons sent to the Island. There
been no such case before and this one will
likely result in a record being kept of the per-
sons sent to the Island

WEEKLY CROP REPORT.
Favorable Weather for Corn—More Detertora-
tion In Cotten,

Wasnrworon, Aug. 28. The summary of
crop conditions Issued to-day by the Weather

Bureau says
The week ending Aug. 27 is the fourth week
of excesalve heat in the districts east of the
Rocky Mountains, and while tt was dry over
the greater part of the Southern Btates, por-
tlons of New England and the Ohlo Valley,
there were in these districta good rains over
Jocal areas, and very weneral and abundant
ruins over the northern portions of the Central
valleys, southern half of the upper lake re-
gion, and in the middle Atlantic States
The temperature conditions of the past week,
as in the preceding weeks of August, have
been highly favorable for the rapid develop-
ment of corn, @ large part of the early crop
being already made, some having been crt
as far north as Jowa and Ilinols, ‘The abund-
ant rains whieh fell in Nebraska, Kansas, and
Missourl have improved the condition of corn,
but much in the two last mentioned States has
been permancully injured, while the crop in
southern Iilinois and western Kentucky con-
tinues to suffer from drougbt. As @ whole,
the week has been very favorable for corn
over the greater part of the principal corn
States, more particularly the central and north
ero districts, but over the northern portions
of the Gulf and South Atlantio States it was
unfavorable,
Ileavy raing fn the spring wheat regions
have retarced thrashing and prevented the
completion of harvest in North Dakota, in which
State, us woll as in Minnesota and portions of
Nebraska, stacked wheat has sustained dam-

Kxcept in Alabama, where an improvernent

eral concition of this crop over the central
and eastern portions of the cotton belt has
further deteriorated, rust, shedding and pre-
mature opening being enerally reported,
while the boll worn has been cestrietive tn
the central and western portions. In ‘Texas

portions of the belt
In western Kentucky, the Carolinas and
vortiona of Virginia and Maryland tobacco
ina stiffered much from drought, but in the
two last named States rains of the past week
have materially improved its condition, tn

very favorable prowress, although sustaining

are receive from localities in the prineipal

apple States of the central valley the persistent
dropping that has been so prominent a feature
inthe repdrts dur e the early part of the season,
with the excessivehen’ in August, and in some
sections high winds, has materially reduced the
prospects of this crop

Over the central and northern districta the
condition of the soll has been highly favorable
for ploughing for fall seeding, which work is
unusually well advanced in those seetions
hut in the Southern States the conditions have
not been favorable

Hi. BO Huntington be elected President
to fill the vacancy caused by the death of his
uncle, Collis P. Huntington. The name of
Charles H. Tweed, one of the Vice-Presidents
and general counsel of the Southern Pacitle sys-
tem, has been mentioned in connection with
the presidency, but Mr. Tweed has taken pains
to discourage the suggestion tHe may, how-
ever, be made chairman of the Board of Direc-
tors

The C. P. Huntington estate, although by
far the largest holder of Southern Pacific shares,
does not control a majority of the stock. The
Huntington and allied interests control about
three-fourths of the atock

sylvania Ratiroad Interested in the Devel-
opment—Towa, Voted to Sell for 625,000,

Lono Baeacu, 1, 1, Aum. 28 According to
Panl K. Ames, the receiver of the Long Beach
Association, which controla a largo section
of the beach property and the bla hotel, this
resort {a to be transformed into a rival of At
lantic City. Mr, Ames says that arrangements
have been made for the sale of Long Beach
under the terms of @ resolution adopted by
the voters of the town of Hempstead in April,
1200, to well the property for $25,000. The Town
Board of Mempstead has directed Supervisor
Sintth Cox to engage counsel to prepare & title
to the property, Mr. Ames expects the title to
be ready by about Sept, 10. It ts asserted that
Mr. Ames, in arranging for the purchase of
the property, {s acting in the interest of either
the Pennsylvania Kallroad Company or capt.
taliate associated with that corporation t
{4 understood that $600 of the purchase money
has already been paid to the town offlc in,
and that the remainder is to be pald aver 8
the time of taking title. In aarealng to pe
sale of the beach the town has resery certain
rights, such as the rights of inhabitants
to use the adjaoens tance under water for
ovetering An clamming.

Long Beach more closely resembles Atlantic
City dan any other section of shore front on
the Atlantle seaboard It contains about
1,800 acres and has a frontage on the ocean ©
seven miles, almost in a straight line, angie
from one-quarter to one-half a mile wide. ihe
bench is very high and perfectly safe for we
erection of Pulldings. On the north side ts
meadow land pierced by creeks and amall bays,
much like Atlantic City. It is said that among
the improvernents that will be made by the
owners will be a boulevard to run the entire
length of the beach. Streets will be laid out és
right angles to the boulevard, there will be
another wide avenue through the beach length-
intended for the business section and a
boardwalk along the western half will be built.
An iron pier will be erected tor the use of
boats and there will be piers for small boats
and vachts on the bay side.

as Manhattan

Beach. Col Sharpe, receiver for the Long
Island Railroad Company, made the rate of
fare low ran fast trains and introduced features

that took crowds to the resort. It was the
siceess of Long Beach that partly induced
Austin Corbin to secure control of the Long
Island Railroad. He at once raised the rate
of fare and Long Beach was closed in 1883.
It was then that the bondholders stepped in
and tormed the Long Beach Association and
tried to run the place asa summer Chautauqua,
but it was a tailure and Paul K. Ames became
the receiver.

 

GOING OUT OF BUSINESS.

The Rogers Locomotive Works at Paterson,
N. J., to Close on Dec. 1.

Paterson, N. J, Aug. 28.—Paterson ts to
lone one of its largest and most important
incustries. The Rogers Locomotive Works
are to be closed down and 1,400 men thrown
out of employment. A statement will be iasued
by the company in a few days. The closing
down {9 not due to financial troubles.

Jacob 8. Rogers holds most of the stock
and it is owing to his desire to close out his
interest that the action ia to be taken. Robert
S. Hughes the President of the concern, died
three weeks ago and hia death hastened the
determination to give up the works. The
company has orders on hand to keep the shops
running until Dee. 1. No more orders will be
taken and the force of employees will be re-
duced gradually.

Competition has been sharp in the past few
years, it is said, and the Paterson plant has been
run at a loss. The cost of transportation of
locomotives to the railroads is a large ttem of
expense, the works being located at a distance
from the tracks. The plant has been in exist-
ence for nearly a century, and the industry has
been one of Paterson's mainstays. The payroll
amounted to about $30,000 fortnightly. The
locomotives made here are in use on many rail-
roads in this country

WHO KILLED LING LUN?

 

Coroner's Jory, Though It Hears a Witness

Who Saw Him Shoot Himself, Isn't Sure.

A Coroner's jury yesterday returned a verdict

Grace Lawrence, who was sleeping in the house
and wasawakened by the first two shots, told
how she opened the door of her room and saw
the Chinaman with the revolver {n his hand
firing a third at his stomach

Ing Ging of 16 Mott street told the Coroner
that Chinamen if they wished to commit snicide
did not shoot themselves, but used poison, and

TursparY, Aug. 28.

The stock market to-day was perfunctory in
the extreme, the volume of transactions reach-
ing only one-half of yesterday's very moderate
record, The Street continues to explain the
dearth of business in the securities market as
due to the approaching election, the Chinese
situation and various other influences, but the
fact remains that nothing seems to be able to
disturb ite lethargy. Of course @ change may
come at any moment and, as not infrequently
happens, when least expected. The absence oi
pressure of securities is significant to the pro-
fessional dealers and prevents serious
attacks upon prices. The mainte-
nance of full market values of the higher priced
investment issues is @ frequent subject of
comment and even of complaint on the part
of buyers, as in the case of the bankers who
wish to substitute other Government bonds
for the old 2 per cente now placed to seoure
circulation, The preasure of unemployed
balances and the constantly increasing accu-
mulations of money prevent owners of securt-
ties from taking seriously the occasional notes
of warning of a variety of probable heavy
calls for money within the next sixty to ninety
days, for domestic requirements and European
accommodation, Discounts in London were
reported very firm to-day and some speoula-
tion was indulged in regarding the proba-
bility of a renewal of active efforts by the Bank
of England to attract a further considerable
supply of gold from this country.,

Reports regarding the condition of the fron
and steel trades are mixed, some accounts
telling of heavy accumulating stocks of pig
iron. Taking the situation by and large there
{s unquestionably improvement {nother
branches of the industry dwe to recent
reductions in prices and radical curtailment
of production, As bearing upon the trade
outlook generally, the reported impending
labor troubles in the coal regions attract at
tention, although this possibility has aa yet
failed of appreciable effect upon the market
prices of the shares of the coal companies. Ac-
cording to the best authorities on the subject
there {s no serious apprehension of a general
strike of the miners, although labor agitators
have been endeavoring to foment dissatis-
faction. In most cases the miners are work-
ing on fuller time and are making more money
than in a number of years, and this fact will
operate materially to lessen the chances of a
serious disturbance. It Is also a matter of
almost general knowledge that the coal pro-
ducing and carrying companies have been
rushing production for several months past
and could now hold out for a long siege. Rail-
way earnings that came to hand to-day were
uniformly favorable, including the statement
of operators of the Atchison Railway Com-
pany for July, showing an increase fn net in-
come of $933,735, The figurea of the exports
of merchandise from this port, showing an
{nerease in value of over $91,500,000 since
Jan. 1, as compared with the same period of
last year, do not afford much consolation to
pessimists,

The only two stocks in which a record of 10,000
shares was established were American Sugar
Refining and Brooklyn Rapid Transit. The
first mentioned, as was the case yesterday, sup-
plied one-fourth of the aggregate dealings and
its eourse indicated further adroit manipula-
tion. Covering short contracta was responsible
for an advance of over a point from the lowest
price, but the net change was fractional. After
arise of 14 per cent. Brooklyn Rapid Transit left
off practically unchanged from Monday's final
figure. In the general list early fractional de-
clines were followed in the afternoon by slight
rallies, so that the trivial net changes
favored both sides of the account. There
was some pressure against Ameri-
can Steel Roop issues, and Consolidated
Gas, on light trading, scored an exceptional
net losa of 1'4 per cant. On the other hand.
St. Louis Southwestern fasues displayed con-
tinuous firmness, and Chicago, Indianapolis
and louisville stocks rose sharply, the pre
ferred gaining over 4 points, on the declaration
of dividends of 2 per cent. and 1% per cent.
respectively on the preferred and common
stocks. The market closed inactive, but fairly
steady.

Chicago was closed and as usual on such occasions
the grain market here was dull. Early in the day,
however, there was a silght decline, owing to rather
disappointing cables, clear weather tn the Northwest,
weaker markets in that section, large receipts of win
ter wheat and liquidation. Liverpool was only ‘4d
higher, while Paris was 10 centimes lower, Receipts
of winter wheat were 455631 bush. against
258.119 a year ago. Later on, however, shorts
covered on the Bradstreet statement, which
showed a_ decrease tn the world's stock of
1,000,000 bush. and prices rallied. St. Louis was
strong, there was a@ little foreign buying and the
weather in France and England was unsettled. The
seaboard clearances were nearly half a million bush
