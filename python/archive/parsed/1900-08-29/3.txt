Virst Sixteen Won

BOUTHAMPTON, Aug. 24.-The adage,

"It is a jong lane that hus no tuning,” does |
not seem Ww apply to the golfing of our women |

players, for Migs Beatrix Hoyt to-day won for
the fifth time the gold medal presented an-
nually by the U.S. G. A. for the lowest score
fn the qualifying round, while Miss Griscom,
second to hor last year, again finished in the
game placo. Miss Margaret Curtis, @ relative
of Laurence Curtis, the former President of
the U. 8. G@ A., won the medal for the third
lowest score. ‘These happenings oceursed ip
the 18-hole medal play of the women's
championship over the links of the Sbhinnecoc k
Fillls Golf Club, an event held since 1496 under
the management of the U. 5. G, A. The national
association was represented by its President,
W. B. Thomas, and the Secretary, K. Base
Kerr, A committee, headed by Henry G. Trever,
worked in codperation with the U. 6. G. A
officials on behalf of the Bhinne« ock club, The
alds included Samuel L. Parrish, ex-Judge
Horace Russell, &. H. Robertson, W. A. Putnam
aod A. B, Clafita,
a best on record for efficient management.
It had ap amateur ready to score for each pair,
and no charges were made to the women for
caddies, hack hire or luncheons,

W eather favored good golfing, for there wasno
wind to deflect the flight of the ball, but It was
excruolatingly hot. The day was a gala one,
the Southampton ocottagers and visitors making
up @ gallery of impressive proportions. Dur-
ing the starting, which Insted from 0:30 to
12:16 o'clock, the gallery had the south veranda
as ite headquarters and after that the people
flocked to the veranda overlooking the ¢rean to
seo the pairs oome in. The very good
drives from the figst tee were fow in number,
Miss Underhill, Mrs. Manice, Miss Hecker
and Mra. Cochrane doing the best of the Metro-
politan players,while Miss Anthony, theV estern
Golf Association champion, and Miss Edith
Collins of St. Louis did the best of the Western
set. There was very hearty applause from
the gallery for the good drives, yet the West-
erners said they thought the onlovkors rather
lacked enthusiasm.

Nothing was made easier about the links
to favo® low scoring by the women. The
tees were the samo that the men used a month
ago in the open tournament, making the full
distance 6,300 yards, The men's bogey, which
for the women mnay be considered as abs yhutely
par golf, is as follows:

Obbistuicmnnnced 244948 8 8 GR}
Lh. o ss ceeeeeeecees 8446465 5 6 @ 8 4-80-60

(he score was better than any seen as yet in
the women's champlonship in this country
At Bala last year, where two at least of the
tees had been put forward, the low soore in the
first sixteen was 07 and the high score 107, To-
day the low score was 04 and there was @ tie
between four at 111 for the sixteenth place.

On the vlay-off of the tle for last qualifying
place Mise Harrison, Miss M. Chauncey, Miss

Howe and Miss Keyes all drove off well, but
Miss Chaunesy was a stroke behind on the
green. She was still away after the two puls,
and as Miss Howe and Miss Harrison were down
in two putaeach Miss Chauncey lfted. Miss
Keyes ran down a long put, and the three halved
insix. On the second hole Miss Howe and Misa
Harrison went into the bunker on their third
shota, Miss Keyes getting on the green. Miss
Harrison was unuble to play out in 2 and lifted.
Miss Howe was over on her next, but overran, |
playing two more, and Miss Keyes won the hole
and the coveted pla © ln five

The East won all the places in the first sixteen,

not one of the Western representatives getting
a place. Miss Anthony, who has been averag-
{ng under 100 tn her practice rounds for the
past week, scored 117, which was a great dis-
appoiutment to her mother and her friends
who had come on from the West to see her play.
She has a very good style, ye may be re-
corded too for Misa Collins of St. Louls, who
has as pretty a swing as one would wish to
gee, but who could not get on her beet game
reaterday. “The West, I am afraid,” said
Miss Anihony, “has expected too much from
me, This is faster gyliny than we have about
Chicago, although if 1 had been up to my prao-
tice work, I should have been In the first set
perhaps.” This put the case in a nutshell
and the remark will serve for Miss Morse, Miss
Collins, Mra, Carter. Miss Groesbeck and all
others from the West or the middie West,

Miss Hoyt began poorly, foogiing her drive
and taking 8 for the first hole, but thereafter
her worst hole was a7 and that on a bogey 6 hole,
which was not eo bad. Miss Griscom, bar three
holes, had a nearly perfect score, This player
began the wame, like Miss Hoyt, as a schoolgirl
and she knows the game quite as well. Brilliant
on both the long game and in holding out, only
hard luck has seemingly kept her from winning
in a national event. Miss Griscom meets Mrs.
Manice to-morrow, who plays splendidly at the
match game,

Miss Underhill took ber place in the first set
with ease; so did Mrs, Fox, and the two will
be dangerous at match play. Miss Hecker,
never a good score player, played in quite a
provoking wey par hoise and bad holes nearly

ternating. Mra. N. P, Rogers with a little
uck would have given Miss Lioyt a close call
for the gold medal. She play perhaps the
best long game of the fleld, but in putting Mrs.
Rowers at times fell down to a marked degree.
On the eiahth hole she was on the green in 2,
but it took her @ to hole out, while at the siz-
teenth green after getung on in 2 Mrs. Rog-
ers took 6 more to get {nto the eu

Of the newoomers at national tournaments
Miss Livingston and Miss Parrish showed a
dashing game, Mi-s Wickham, bu: for ba
juck on starting out, would have been wel
under 100. The scores show how fortunes
fluctuated with the others.

he one unpleasant feature of the qualifying
round was the disqualification of Mra. Elliott
Rodgers on the sisth green, where, through
inadvertence, she lifted when on the rim of the
cup A story wae circulated that Misa Hoyt
was to be disqualified for not dropping back
out of casual water on the second hole. There
was nothing {n it, so the U. S G. A. committee
said when the facta were reviewed. There
were five Wes at 113 for the third cup to complete
the elaht. Three will drop into the fourth cup
set, where 114 will be the top score, Miss Rich-
ardson, who has a very good style, was foroed
cyrough bud direction to hold the high score
place

Mre. Manice, disqualified last year for tak-
ing advice from her forecaddie, had the pleasure
of getting within the barriers this time without
the shadow of an objection against her clever
play. Others who qualified last year and
are again on the list are Miss Hoyt,
Miss Griscom, Mrs. A. Dewitt Cochrane
Mrs, Caleb ‘Fox, “Miss Ruth Tuder hill
and Misa Genevieve Hecker. Two on the
list, Miss Terry and Mrs. Rogers, were in the
second set last year, Miss Keyes was outside
of both seta at Bala. Miss Wyekham and the
two Misses Curtis have played in champion-
ships before, while Miss 8S. WM. Parrish, Miss
Caroline Livingston and Mrs, Toulmin are
debutantes _{n the event. Two who qualified
last year, Miss G. M. Bishop and Miss May
Barron, were just out of the running this time and
Misa Lucy Merrop, winner of the gecond cup
at Bala, also fai to qualify. The scores

B. & O, WASHINGTON DIVIDENDS.

Answer of the Railroad Company to the Suit
Secking Compulsory Payments,

BarTIMonr, Aug. 2 —Tbe Baltimore
and Ohio Railroad Company filed ita answer in
the Circult Court to-day to the sult instituted
acaitnst that corporation om June 27 by the
State of Maryland The proceedings were
to compel the railroad company to pay
dividends on the stock of its Washington
branch. The stock owned by the State
is estimated to be worth over $1,500,000

The answer declares that, while it Is true that
no dividend has been paid since the dividend
of & per cent. for the six

 

directors bad determined it would be uusafe to
distribule money of the Washington branch to
the atockholders under existing circumstances.

Attention is called to the proposed coustruc-
tion of rew works at Washi gton in cor necuon
with {ts Washington branch railroad and its
Metropolitan branch railroad within the Dis-
trict of Columbia, the cost of which is estimated
at $5,509,408 Toward this expenditure the
United States and District of Columbia will
contribyte $1,500,000, leaving $4,100,000 to be

srovided by the company, an expenditure more
Phan twice the whole capitalization of the Waal-
{ington branch.

The anawer says that while the hope is enter-
tained that some saving in operation will be ob-
tained through these new works, the grose busl-
ness at Washington will hardly be increased,
because the line in competition for much of
that business is about_to make equally exten-
sive improvements. It is asgerted this enor-
mous expenditure of ay for new works
within the District of Columbia is_re-
quir to maintain the present position
of the railroad in its ability to do business
within (Ke District. Under these circumstances,
it says, until some plan can be perfected for
obtaining the new copia required by this com-

vany for these works in connection with the
Washington branch, to the intent that the same
may be properly considered chargeable to that
branch, the President and directors of the
company have considered that the money now
belonging to the branch cannot be treated as
available for distribution to the gtockholders

“he bill was filed by Mr. Hugh L. Bond, ooun-
sel for the company, and sworn to by President
John K. Cowen,

 

SKITTISH NAG SHINER.

Smashes a Police Wagon and Strews Detec-
tives and Ballot Koxes Around.

Shiner, one of the horses at the Morrisania
police station, is 21 years oldand has been at
the station for the last fifteen years. He
shouldn’t be over skittish now, but he showed
unexpected mettle last night. Detectives
Foster and Gerahty were driving Shiner
to a covered wagon along the Hoston road,
collecting ballot boxes from the poliin places
At 167th street Shiner took it Into his head
to run away and he did

At 165th street he banged the covered wagon
against an electric light pole. Foster and
Gerahty were thrown out and knocked insensi-
ble. Ballot boxes were strewn around and the
top was separated from the wagon. This did
notsatisfy Shiner. Ae began to kick and kept
{t up until the wagon was completely demol-

lehed

Then a policeman came along. At sight of
the brass buttons Shiner stopped kicking and
looked ashamed of himself. Gerabty and Fos-
ter were revived and it was found that they
were not seriously injured. The ballot boxes
were all collected again and were taken to
the station in another wagon. Shiner was
led home in disgrace,

WELI-+KNOWN PLAYERS IN QUALIFY-
ING ROUND OF OPEN TOURNAMENT.

 

 

BR. ©, Watson, Jr., Leads the First Sixteen for
the President's Cap With 155-C, Hitoh-
cock, Jr., in Second Place--Herbert M. Har-
riman Also Qualifies ~ Draw for To-day.

Newront, Aug. 248 The open tournament of
the Newport Golf Club opened this morning,
| the play to-day being for qualification for the

President's and Consolation cups The condl-

tions as to weather were not * all favorable

Rain began to fall before all ‘ontestants had
| started, but rain never dé sd a real golfer

and play went on just as though it were
| pleasant The rain was light, however, and
after a while ceased. The dark, threatening
weather soon gave way to clear sunshine and
| heat. In the afternoon a breeze from the
northeast made the alr more endurable

The hot, dry weather had affected the

links, for in places the surface seemed

orusted = and the greens were 80

lively as to bother the players, some requiring

about twice as many as usual on the greens on
account of the fast way the balls rolled. Aside

 

  
 
  

 

 

from this.the links were in the best of
condition. Of the thirty-nine pairs drawn,
| thirty-three pairs, or sixty-six players,
|
| started. Among then were flerbert M.
Harriman, Charles Hitchoock, Jr, A. M
Coats and many other well-known players
Quincy A. Shaw, dr., who was entered, was
unable to play. This was a disappoint-
| ment, as Mr. Shaw was expected to do
some fast work. Last year he won the Presi-
deut's cup, deleating it B. Rollins, Jr, 1 up in
i 37 holes in the final. The play to-day
in the preliminary round was 386 holes, medal
play, 18in the morning and 18 alter luncheon
this afternoon. ‘The best sixteen scores will
qualify the makers to play for the President's
cup, and the second sixteen for the Consolation
cup. Those who qualified were as follows;

Lono Buancu, N.J., Aug, 24. Alfred Bingen,
a broker of New York, who was known as
“Count” Bingen, cciumitted sulctde last (night
on the Dobbins Lot, corner of Matilda {terrace
and Second avenue, by shooting himeelf tn
the head, [ls body was found this morning
at 6 o'clock by Martin MeCue, a milk dealer.
A revolver lay by the dead man's side, Upon
his person was a pocketbook bearing the name
of A. Bingen

There was also a letter addressed to Cesare
Conti which contained a blank form of affidavit
No money was found on the body. Later
in the day A. N. Benjamin who has a.cottage on
Ocean avenue, West End, identified the body
as that of Bingen. Bingen, who was & cousin
of Benjamin, had been invited to visit the latter
at West knd There ia not the slightest doubt
that tuwen took his own life. Only last
Friday Chief Layton received a telephone mes.
sage from New York stating that a business
man from that city was missing and ft was
believed that he had atatted tor Long Branch
with the intention of eonmmitting stile ide. ;
description of the man tillied exactly with
that of Bingen. The pistol shot. which is be
Heved to have killed Bingen was heard by two
wersons, & conductor on the Asbury and Long
ranch trolley road, and a servant in one of
the Matilda terrace cottages.

Alfred Bingen was a well-known curbstone
broker in Broad street, He had desk room
at 35 Broadway and seemed in gree spirits
when Jast there on Monday Jingen was
bora in Italy about 36 years ago. His father,
Compté Massimo Bingen, was formerly one of
the biggest bankers in Genoa, and it was a
great surprise when in 1892 he went into liquida-
tion, Alfred, who was a member of the firm
at the time, resolved to come to America anc
Legin life anew :

Cesare Contl, an Italian banker of 85 Broad-
way, recelved the following letter from Bingen
yesterday

“Deak FRIEND: I thank you for all yoy
have done for me. You have been very kin
to me while 1 have been in this country. I
am so agitated I cannot write more. Always
keep me in your memory and think well of me.

z “BINGEN.

Mr. Conti said vesterday that he knew of
no reason for Hingen’s aulcide. Financial
inatters could have had nothing to dowith It, he
said, for Bingen had always been fairly suc-
cessful, and as late as Monday sent $900 to bis
mother whois living in Paris.

THE COAL STRIKE AVERTED.

TEN DAYS MORE GIVEN TO THE
OPERATORS TO COME 10 TERMS,

 

 

Im Case of Failure the Matter Will Re Referred
to the National Executive Board for Per-
mission to Steike-The Demands of the
Men and the Resolutions Calling for Delay.

Harneron, Pa., Aug. 28.—The great strike
which was to overwhelm the anthracite coal
regions has been averted for the tine being at
least, and an amicable settlement may be ar-
rived at between now and Sept.§. Ifthe efforte

of the Mine Workers’ Union to arrive at some |

agreement with the operators by that time
fail the matter will be referred to the National
Executive Board, asking that permission be
given to declare a general strike in this region.
Meanwhile every effort will be made by the
representatives of the men to bring about
an amicable settlement with the operators,
and should they not succeed within ten days
permission will be asked of the National Exeeo-
utive Bogrd to go on strike

To-day'a two sessions of the union were ex-
tremely stormy and no definite conclusion
could be arrived at until late in the afternoon
From what could be learned the diversities
of opinton were so great that Father Phillips
of St. Gabriel’s Church, who in a sermon on
last Sunday had expreased bimself as opposed
to a strike and had signified a desire to address
the convention, was sent for. He remained
in the hall with the nan several hours and made
a long address, the tenor of which, It was said,
was of thesame nature ashis sermon, an admo-
nition agaivet adopling any hasty resolutions
for a atrike.

At the conclusion of the afternoon session
the Press Committee told the reporters that
the following damands would be made upon
the operators to the First, Ninth and Seventh
Authracite district:

An abotition of the company store system;
reduction in the price of powder to $1.60 4
keg; the abolition of the company doctor sys-
tern; the abolition of the sliding scale now

in practice in the Lehigh and Robuy kill coal
regions; the compliance with the State law
which says that all industrial concerns shall
pay their employees semi-imonthly and in
cash; the abolition of the erroneous system of
having 8,300 pounds to the ton and that 2,240
pounds shall constitute @ ton; an advance of 20
per cent. to be paid to all classes now receiving
lesa than $1.50 a day; all classes of day labor
now receiving $1.50 and not exceeding §1.75
to receive 18 per cent, over the present prices;
day labor now reoeiving more than §1.75
a dey to be advaneed 10 per cent.; no man to
have at any time more than one breast, gang-
way, and in any class of work to only «et his
legal quota of cars

The following resolutions, which
tute an addres¢ to the public at large and set
forth the position taken by the miners, were
alay adopted

“Whereas, The operators of the anthracite
coal regions have entirely ignored the cordial
invitation extended by the representatives
of thelr employees to meet them in joint oon-
vention in the city of Hazelton forthe purpose
of discussing and if possible adjusting the many
grievances complained of as set forth in the
circulars mailed to the operators at
journment of the convention held
18, 14 and 15; and

‘Whereas, The earnings of the mine workers
have been reduced to such an extent that we
are no longer able to support ourselves and
families, notwithstanding the fact that market
prices of coal are mach aan than have pre
vaed ingmany years and the profits made
in the operation of coal properties are iu excess
of that obtained at any other period; in view
of all these circumstances we declare it to be
our firm conviction that we are entitled to at
least a fair share of the increase profits which

consti-

the ad-
on Aug

have been and are being secured for the product
of our labor; therefore, be it

“Resolved, That we, the delegates rep-
resenting the miners and mine laborers en-
gaged in the production of coal in the anthra-
cite coal region submit the following scale of
yriees and conuitions of employment, believing
hem to be both moderate and temperate in
view of the fact that the necessities of Ufe have
incraased 30 per cent. during the past two years,
thus decreasing the purchasing power of earn-
ings, and, be it further

‘Resolved, That while we deprecate the neces-
sity of a strike to enforce humane conditions of
employment, except when all other honor-
able and peaceable measures have been re-
sorted to, we hereby declare our willingness to
suspend work and respectfully request the
National President that he at once convene the
Natio.al Executive Board for the purpose o
passing upon our resolution to engage in a
strike, to take effect not later than ten days
from this date, providing an amicable set-
tlement is not effected in the interval; and, be it
further

*Reeolved, That we pledge ourselves to use
all honorable and lawful means to bring about
a Speedy settlement of our differences, and w
hereby call upon all coal workers to put forth all
efforts for Justice, and we earnestly appeal to
the great, lustice-loving American people to
render us their sympathy and moral support to
the end that {injustice and oppression, sifferin
and wrong may forever be obliterated an
that we may enjoy some of the comforts and
pleasures which our arduous and dangerous
employment richly entitles us to, aod in closing,
we respectfully solicit the inestimable an
continued advocacy of our cause by the Ameri-
can press.”

This resolution was_also adopted

“Reaolved, That the Fxeoutive Committee rene
resenting the First, Seventh and Ninth dis-
triets he given power to ora any committees
upon the lines sugmested If they see it will as-
sist in arriving at any fair and amicable settle
ment within the next ten days.”

This resolution means that the committee
can appoint on such a committee any one out-
side of the union who they may think can
assist in the settlement of the pending di fi-
eulties, Just before departing for his homein
Indianapolis President Mitchell said that the
National Executive Board would undoubtedly
approve the application of the convention to
consider the declaration of a strike unless an
amicable arrangement with the operators {ts
arrived at within ten days.

BOATLOAD OF FAT MEN,

IF THEY'RE DUCKED AUGUST BRAUN
BUYS A OLAMBAKE

 

 

Queer Test to Be Tried To-day in the Flectrie
Launch on the Central Park Lake by
Twenty Corpatent Citigens—Proposed asa
Joke-- All the East Side’s Interested,

Twenty fat men have planned to board the
electric launch on the lake in Central Park at
8 o'clock to-day in an effort to sink the oraft
simply by their avoirdupoia. If the launeh
sinks Ernst Wills of 1407 Second avenue wil)
win a clambake, accompanied by unlimited
drinkables and smokables for the entire party,
If the launch does not sink Augnst Braun, Jr,
wil] be the winner and Wills the loser,

Twenty-four fat men will arrive at the hke
at about 8 o'clock In a wagon drawn by slx
horses, Four of the men are eubstitutes, who
will be ready to fill the places of any of the
regulars who for any reason are unable to take
their chance, Since last Wednesday evening,
when the wager was made, Capt. Wills, who
himself weighs 250 pounds, has been busy en-
listing volunteers. He has had no occasion to
canvass, for all kinds and sizes of fat meu have
offered their services.

Not only the fat men but their friends, rela-
tives, employees and employers are interested

in the wager. As athletes train down, the
fat men are training up. Never before has
so much beer been consumed in the middie
Fast Side, and seales are working overtime
registering the progress of the training. H.
M. Braun, Willam Young and a few others,
hearing that water was fattening, began tran-
ing on the Croton fluid and others were be-
inning to follow their example till dismayed
rewery collectors and saloon keepers ex plained
that beer accomplished the same results and
contained no germs,
The men of Capt. Wells's company with their
weights are as follows: Ernst Wills, 250; “Pot
Cheese,” 960; A. Schleutermann, 263; 1. (ireim,
244; F Welsh, 227; A- Hennelley, 260; P. Begney,
229; A. Groth, 260; P. Unmuth, 205; CG, Grube, 247;
A. Kruspy, 231; G. Green 246; A. M. Braun, 265;
James Kinney, 248; John Hock, 250, A. Kuntz
252; P. Deviin, 265; Thomas MeGulre, 240; William
Young, 335, and Joe Nedjedhy, 235. The sub-
stitutes. are Alex Creamer, 252; “Creamer'’s Un-
known,” 4; Jaines Archibald, 264; and Conrad
Moeller, 273. ‘
The wager was made on the spur of the mo-
ment as a jake, though arrangements for its
decision are being made in all seriousness
Wills and a party of friends were having a clam-
bake at Braun's Park at ae street and
the East River, when August Hraun, who owns
the boats on the Central Park lake, was ex-
aining the carrying capacity of the new elec-
ric launch there. He said it had carried
seventy-one children. Wills doubted = this
statement and wagered he_ co produce
eee ee Se ee ese werghs
wou nk the launc aun pro .
It was rumored at first that Wills fad elated
that he would qurely win, for if launch
carried the load naturally he would see to it
that the boat was sufficiently “wabbled.” This
statement, however, did not disconcert the fat
meo, for they can all swim and none is afraid
of a ducking, but not so with Aug. Braun, Jr
Accordingly, it was agreed that fat men
should be properly seated, that they were to
remain quiet, and that if the boat was rocked
Wills would lose his bet. The boattf {tecan go
at all with its load ia to go once around the
lake, the usual trip it takes when carrytnu
ordinary visitors. Yesterday the following
were fppoinied refe: : George Roemer,
Otto Kinzel and Fred Git. A truck has been
engaged to haul the party to and from the
lake. The vehicle, it is promised, shall be
decorated with flags and preceded by a brass
band. The average weight of the twenty-four
men ls 265 pees. and the East Siders proudly
assert that these cast the records of
of former fat men’s organizations into the
shade.
