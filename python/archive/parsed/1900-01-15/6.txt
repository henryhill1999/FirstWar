Bank $5,000,000 The promotion of the
President of the National Union Bank, Mr,
Joseph €. Hencrix, to the presidency of the en-
Jarged Bank of Commerce, fs highly gratifying
tothe members of the newspaper press, Mr.
Hendrix was formerly on the staffof THE Stuy,
leaving it. greatly to the regret of his associates,
first for politics, and, then, for the fleld of
finance. in which his ability has justly raised
him tohis present high position, His case is a
paraiiel to that of the Marquis of Salisbury
who, at the outset of his career, was @ con-
tributor to the London Saturday Keview, and is
pow Prime Miuister of Great Britain, Of the
truth of Napo'eon Bonaparte's saying, that
every soldier carries in his knapsack the baton
ofa field marshal, Mr Hendrix and Lord Salis-
bury are notable Jlustrations,

The entrance into American finance of two
giant banks lke tho Nation City and the Com-
merce has called forth in some quarters come
ments implying that it marks the beginning of
anew erainouriinancial history, Inone sense
the remark jatrue, The same process of aggre-
gation ani consolidation which has led to the
formation of the mammoth Industrial corpora-
tlonsand railroad companies with which we
have recently become familiar has also affected
banking. Thefame reasons, too, which make
manufacturing and railroading more profitad!
on A large senile than onasmeallone apply with
equal force to the businessof banks, One bank
with $10,000,000 capital can render as much
service to ita dealers as ten with capitals of
$1,000,000 each, and at one-tenth the relative
expense. That the day of small banka, in cities
like New York at Jeast, is passing, and that the
little banks everywhere are doomed to ultimate

  

extinction, is pluin to every perspleacious ob-
server, Even in country towns the $25,000
banks which t) e Curreney bill now before Con

gress proposes to allow to be created underihe
National lank act, cannot possibly do a legtt-
imate banking business which shall be proft-
able. They wiji get no deposits worth mon-
tioning. and their expeoses for rent, salaries
taxes and incicentala will be at jeast $2.500a
year each, or 10 per cent. on their capitals, and
probably twice as much. Here in New York,
banks with capitals of even $500,000 each have
hard work to earn 6 per cent. dividends, and
are continually, in times of stringency, calling
on the large banks for assistanee, Eventually
they will all have to wind up or become attach-
menta to banka with $5,000,000 eapi als and
upward, to which there will be no competitors.

It is not true, however, that a $10,000,000
bank i9 a novelty in our Anaucial history. The
Bank of Commerce itself had, until about
twenty years ago, a capital of $10,000,000, and
retuced it to $5,000,000 to lessen its taxes,
The last United States Bank, upon which An-
drew Jackson waged so relentless a war, and
which failed under the management of
Nicholas Biddle, had a capital of $55,000,000
and did business through its branches all over
thecountry. In Europe hanks with capitals
of $10,000,000 and upward, are numerous.
Hero isa listof some of them, whichis far
from complete, but which sufficiently indicates
the present contitions of banking in the older
countries of the world:
