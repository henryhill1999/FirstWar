tender’s intentions have not yet been disclosed,

SUNDAY IN SOUTH NORWALK,

BLUE

The Mayor's First Attempt to Enforce the
Connecticut Sunday Law.

Sovtn Norwark, Conn,, Jan, 14.—To-day
was tho first Sunday of the enforcement of
Mayor Charles G, Bohannon’s unique concepes
tion of the Connecticut Sunday law, a slightly
revised edition of the old blue laws which made
the Nutmeg State famous years ago, Contrary
tothe strict lotterof the law, which provides
that work of necessity only may be carried on,
the Mayor decided that \ce cream, soda water,
shavingand boot blacks were a necessity, while
he placed a strict taboo upon ciears, confec.
fruit and nuts. Hundreds of
Routh Norwalk people went to. Norwalk for
their Sunday smokes, much to the chagrin of
the South Norwalk. dealers, for the
reamed to bethat if the trade flocked to Nor-
walk it might teachthe Mavoratesson, The
trolley curs were crowded during some por
tionaofthe day. Some of the South Norwalk
cigar dealers aol soda water
jority closed
upand spent the dav “roastir the Mayor
The police were kept so busy watching storea
to detect the sale of cigars that the saloons had
itallthairown way. It looks as if the present
police force of the city will have to be trebled
ifthe Mayor desires both the cigar and liquor
end of the law watched on Sunday.

strotly ‘or investinent purposes, however,
wore the two largest purchases ot the week—
the buying of the Hartley apartment house tn
Central Park West and the buying of another |
big apartment house on upper Broadway
Both are newly built houses and thelr prompt
kell ng indicates that builders have nothing to
fear if they put.up good houses in desirable lo-
valities, ‘he Hartley went to an out-of-town
corperation and the Broadway house to a local
investor, Both houses were completed lust tall
and both are nearly full of tenants, which goes
to show the apparent impossibility of over.
crowding the great West Side with apartment
houses if they are of the right kind.

taken heart and are doing no end of hustling

The onteome ofthe Whitfleid sale laat Wed-

ket Lvery one of the dozen investment

market, however, will be the Contol! sale, early
