It’s a Silver Store This Week

RADE SALES versus Job Sales. When you catch the meaning of these terms you will appreciate the Wana-

 

 

Used to be that special sales or ‘‘job sales’’ were made up of goods caught as the flotsam of the
markets. What nobody wanted at any considerable price was sold as a job. Poor sort of storekeeping, and we

a more dignified plane—which means real economy for the shopper as against questionable bargains,

and comfortable treatment for the shopper who essays to get so much of the goods as shall serve present and prospective needs,
On this basis—the annual furniture sales, the semi-annual underwear sales, and, added to them—

The Annual Sale of Silver Table Ware and Toilet Pieces

The sale runs simultaneously in the parent store and here—starting with

Stocks in Excess of $150,000

including solid silver (the sterling standard in every case, .925 fine), and silver-plated ware of known and sustained makes, The
prices on these very large special lots—here as the result of more than six months work in gathering—amount to

Savings of a Fourth to a Half from Ruling Prices

On a very few pieces the reduction is rather less than one-fourth, but still important, and such pieces are included to make the

stocks so complete as to meet every supposable need.

Some lots in patterns that, while yet in good favor,
because new silver-ware patterns never displace the pieces one own

Muslin Underwear---Best News Yet!

The basis of these half-year underwear sales is new goods, but with the |
important gathering and selling of French Waists and other garments, |
always going on here, it is important to make frequent clear-outs. And
they give us the biggest percentage of loss that comes to this business.

For instance—

Sixty-five Imported Silk Walsts are reduced a third or half.
Prices now are $10 to $32.50.

Imported Tea Gowns, rich and lovely, are reduced as severely.
Prices now are $12.50 to $47.50.

Imported Dressing Sacques, as well—the flannel ones are now
$3 to $19; the silk ones are $6 to $25.

In the line of American manufactures, there are big savings, too. For
instance—

75c Eiderdown Sacques at 35c.
o'clock,

Velveteen Waists, $3 instead of $4.50 to $6.50.

Silk Waists, taffeta; solid colors, black, striped—broken sizes, $3.

The Muslin Underwear is rich in pretty much all the fine values of
the month, starting with the Cambric Corset Covers at 8c.

A further word of detail—and this warning: We cannot replace these
special lots at anywhere near the present low prices, and what we have will
soon be sold—

Many Book-case Bargains

There are represented in this furniture store about 200 styles of Book-
cases, Of these a majority are showa today with new markings on their
price-tags—reductions that average a full third, There are some at $5, that
were very fairly priced at $6.50; combination book-cases of oak at $7.50,
that were $12, and $8.50 that were $13.50. Others of imitation mahogany
at $8.50 and up to $35 that were $13,25 to $57. And of quarter oak at |
$60 instead of $90. Judge safely of numerous others by these few speci-
men values.

Last Wednesday we|

i‘ Silk told of a second lot of
argain Crepe Meteor—in fine
colorings—at $1 a yard instead of
$2. And you took the lot in a day.

Two firms were interested in the
mill’s output and now we have the
final twenty-eight hundred yards to
sell at the same low price.

Think of the prettiest Henrietta
you ever saw—think how much hand-
somer it would be if all-silk; think of
all the gracefulness and beauty of
crepe de chine, and then you'll say
that Crepe Meteor is even handsomer.
All silk, 25 in. wide, evening shades
and browns and blues. $1 a yard
for $2 goods.

Good choosing yet, among the pretty Japanese
Silks (striped) at 45c a yard. These are decid-
edly spring-like fabrics, Rotunda,

these lots to choose from today.

Linens for less than their worth! |
That’s all of it.

We are rather brokers than store-
keepers—and we have men in many
lands watching for dependable goods
that must be marketed quickly. These ,
we buy—for you—for Jess than their |
worth, A trifle to us forstorekeeping, |
but the bulk of the profit is yours.
With the continued bettering times in |
the manufacturing world, bargains are

~ Black Dress Goods---Reduced

There are several sorts of critics: those who pick flaws in everything
(destroy because they cannot build), those who look through biased glasses,
and those who base conclusions on ascertained facts,

Critics who deal in facts say that the Wanamaker Dress Goods Store is
the best in America—richest in selection offered; closest in Fashion’s dictate,
and invariably selling at prices less than most stores charge for comparable
goods, We have dressmakers tell us that foreign trips now-a-days are merely
for style-study and recreation ; that they buy their fabrics at Wanamaker’s,
saving worry and custom’s troubles—and dollars, as well.

Do you see why we can honestly lose money without flinching? To
maintain leadership stocks must not only be ample but really a little in ad-
vance of the demands. Whatever lingers a few weeks over-time, we sell at
whatever loss is necessary to make the bargain irresistible.

Today, Black Goods—the richer sorts, so nearly staple that they’ll
serve you well for spring.
