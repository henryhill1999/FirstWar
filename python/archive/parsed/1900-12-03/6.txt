eo back to the last movement

tered, there have been

Oo upward swing ft the market pendulum

between 1881 and 187 that eould properly be
regarded resulting from other than more or
eae adventitious stances Che actual
and substantial groundwork necessary for such
tendencies did not exist. The awakened spec-

ilative fers f a nation growing rich despite

 

unfavorable circumstances did, indeed, upon
several ov n the interim produce strik-
Ing stock market results, but they were fol-
lowed by the ines e and involved reactions.
Thus, to review historically the security mar-
ket situations of this ration, we find that
the decline that set in upon the assassination

of President Giartield, culminated in the disas-
trous, even tf | i, Wall Street panic ef
8S. Profound depression and = stagnation
ensued and tre ed until the summer of 185,
when the tronsfer of the control of the West
Shore Railroad to the New York Central, with
{ts consequent adjustment of dangerous rate
problems, was followed br a general advance

 

 

 

which co sued for some eighteen months
Then it tripped over a stringent money mar-
ket which could not then, as now, be relieved
either by domestic resources or foreign credita
In fact, for the two fiscal years of 1888 and 1887,
the country's exeess of exports of 1
disse amounted to less than $48,000,000, ¢

ow often exceeded in a single month, whereas

rities has been immeasurably reduced in the
