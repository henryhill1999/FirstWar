FINANCIAL AND COMMERCIAL,

Tuorspay, August 16.

There was a sudden contraction in the vol-
wine of trading on the Stock Exchange, acoom-
panied by @ reaction inprices. In the early
dealings a slightly better market for securities |
of all kinds in London imparted a fairly firm |
tone to the loreal speculation. There was |
further moderate buying through commission |
houses, whose customers apparently entertain |
hopeful views regarding the {mmediate course
of prices on the Stock Exchange. There was {
also some covering of shorts. About midday |
the market bewan to reflect the extensive liquid- |
ation of speculative accounts that took place |
yesterday, and at the same time it became
apparent that professional operators who have
been working on the long side were indisposed |
to supply the support that they have hereto- |
fore contributed. Now and then they bid up |
prices in various sections of the market, pre-
sumably to facilitate further selling. The |
market, briefly described, looks as if the medi- |
ocre operators, who have been able owing to
technical conditiona to advance prices, have
marketed the greater part of their holdings
and do not care to reacquire them at ourrent
figures.

The retrograde movement in prices was
attended by fresh reports of damage to the
corn crop and by the announcement of a rather
unexpected reduction of $8 a ton in the price
of structural steel and of a further decline of
60 conta a ton in pig iron. The greatest ao-
tivity and the largest net decline was in Brook-
lyn Rapid Transit, which was sold on the cus-
tomary reports that the annual report of the
company {s about to be issued and that it will
show a very small amount earned on the stock
and possibly show the existence of a floating
debt of several million dollars. The report
is not yet ready for publication and regarding
the floating indebtedness of the company Its
officials decline to make any statement. An
authoritative announcement that the dividend
on Consolidated Gas will be restored to 8 per
cent. at the end of the month had practically
no effect upon the moderate dealings {n that
atock. Northern Pacific common was excep-
tionally heavy at a net decline of nearly a point.
Throughout the remainder of the list the net
losses averaged about % per oent. The pool
in United States Rubber common did not ap-
pear to be discouraged by the reaction in the
general list, for it forced the price of the stock
a point above the final price of yesterday.

There are indications that Wall Street is be-
ginning to realize that ita sanguine views as
to the outcome of the Presidential campaign
may have to be modified to an extent, The
inter view with a member of Mr. McKinley‘s
Cabinet published this morning, telling of the
seeming indifference, begotten of confidence,
of many prominent persons who are in favor
of the continuance of the present Administra-
tion, fa doubtless a more conservative state-
ment than could be made if all the facts were
told. That Wall Street has been indulging in
implicit confidence as to the outcome of the
campaign ia shown by the action of the stock
market, and to an extent by the betting that
has taken place in and about the Stock Ex-
change. To-day there was a little variation
in the betting, some Bryan money being offered
ati to 244 on McKinley. It will be remembered
that when the betting began a few weeks ago
the odds were 6 to 1 on McKinley.

Wall Street, and possibly the business oom-
munity as a whole, does not seem to realize
that the effort of the Democratic candidate
“to make” anti-imperialiem the predominant
issue is simply @ ruse to catch votes, and that
if Mr. Bryan should be tn a position next March
to call a special session of Congress to legislate
regarding the treatment of the Philippines,
he could logically and consistently submit a
proposition for the repeal of the gold standard
and the rehabilitation of ailver on the basis of
16 to 1.

Those who hold the view that the existing
laws are irrevocably on the statute books have
very short memories. The present campaign
should bring it home to every one that the price
of national integrity, like that of liberty, is eter-
nal vigilance. Those who areindifferent to the
vital importance of crushing out monetary
heresies and Populistio and fanatical senti-
ments at the present time also overlook the
fact that the business of the country on account |
of the prosperity whioh it has enjoyed is much |
more widely extended than {t was four years |
ago, and that if the Administration should be ,
defeated the collapse would be several-fold |
more serious than {f a similar disaster had oo-
curred four years ago, when business of all
kinds was being conducted on a hand-to-mouth

 

  

basis and when practicaly everybody had
prepared for the worst.
