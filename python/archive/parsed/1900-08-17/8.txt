URS THIS YRAR.

Heved to Be Rich—Explortog the Tundra.

Alaska, Aug. 1.—About six weeks
nave paents since the first steamers landed
thair thousands of passengers op the Nome
and still the verdict regarding the re-
the gold country is “not proven.
reds of men are ready to denounce
the region unqualifiedly. In nine cases out
of ten, it will be found that these men came
to Nome with @ wild hope of getting rich in a
single season; that they came without material
resources, with not money enough in their pock-
ota to pay thetr fare back to Seattle or Ban
Franctsoo. The number of those who be-
eve in the country is rather smal], The num-
ber of those who hold that the people who
boomed the Nome gold region in the United
States last winter have not yet proved their
cane to large. Some of these believe that the
case will never be proved; others maintain
that {t will be, and still others are simply walt-
ing for developments of past discoveries and
the making of new strikes.

Of the three classes of placer mining in the
weatern Alaska peninsula, beach, tundra
and creek, the first has already turned out to
be a virtual failure so far as the present season
ta concerned. Beyond a doubt the beach
netwean Cape Nome and Penny River yielded
something ike a million and a half of dollars
last vear to the ploneer miners of the region
who operated with rockers exclusively, This
year there are not fewer than 1,000 power plants
on the Nome beach engaged tn sluicing or
dredging. These machine outfits employ from
two to twenty men each, and from one to aix
men are interested in each plant as proprietors.
Every one of them ts a failure, considering
the advance expectations of thelr owners.
The untversal opinion, based on the experience
of the machine men, is that the beach was
worked out last year and early this spring be-
fore the labor-eaving devices for gold mining
appeared on the scene.

Ralf a dozen creeks fn this peninsular are
known to be immensely rich in gold, and two
or three of them, notably Anvil and Dexter,
are yielding a large output. Scores of other
creeks are known to have gold along their
winding basins, but they have not been thor-
oughly prospected in most cases and few of
them are being extensively operated. There-
fore the richness of the creek country as a
whole remains to be demonstrated. The
tundra, that ts, the stretch of frozen high
marsh lying between the beach and the moun-
tains to the north for a distance of many miles,
fa a sublect of controversy between those who
belleve {t contains an enormous quantity of
placer gold and those who declare they would
not buy any part of itat 10centsanacre, Net-
withstanding all statements to the contrary,
{t cannot be learned that any part of the tundra
has ever been thoroughly and honestly pros-
pected. Prospects on a large scale have been
begun, however, and will be watched with
interest during the coming month.

Barring the mining operations on Anvil
Creek, which were begunearly in June, the first
work of taking out gold this year was on the
beach a mile or two west of the city of Nome.
Bluicing on the beach was begun as early as
June 2. Many of those who brought machin-
ery to Nome for beach mining find it hard to
believe that men with rockers washed out as
much as $1,000 in a single day last year. What
ia probably the largest ehuicing plant on the
heach this summer, situated in the best locality,
employing ten or fifteen men and consuming
$90 worth of fuel, has failed to produce more
than $1,000 worth of goldin one day. Nine out
of every ten power plants, employing from
three to five mean, have yielged only from $30
to $200 @ day. Many oft have been un-
able to pay the expenses of operation, and
scores of them have been abandoned or sold.
Tt is possible to-day to buy on the beach a small
gasolene or steam engine and pump capable of
producing a fair sluice head of water at prices
ranging from the cost of the freight from Seattle
to $200. Few buyers appear, and when they do
they are regarded as wanting either discretion
or Intellect.

Ry far the greater number of the asluicitng
plants are established on that part of the beach
lying between Nome and Penny River, twelve
miles west of Nome. For the first three miles
west of the city the lines of sluice boxes, ex-
tending from the tundra to the sea, are crowded
together with spaces of only about 100 feet
between. The ground avatlable for each ma-
chine owner ts practically limited to the small
tract ocoupled by his plant. Farther away
from the city the machines are not quite so
numerous. There is hardly ground enough,
however, to keep them al! busy until the end of
the summer. To the eastward, between the
city and Cape Nome, the beach contains less
aold, and fewer plants are in operation

Sluicing on the beach is not so simple a prop-
osition as {it appears from the outside. It
seems like a very easy matter to set up a steam
or gasolene engine and centrifugal pump fifty
feet from the water, and, by means of a suc-
tion pipe extending outinto the sea, raise water
toa level with the head of a line of sluice boxes,
and then to shovel sand from the beach into the
boxes and save the gold. If the Behring Sea
were a placid body of water the case would be
diferent. But there are few places in the
world where there is an uglier surf more days in
the year than on the coast of western Alaska.
For a distance of a mile off shore the water |s
only a few feat deep, and a suction pipe con-
nected with a powerful pump on the beach
must either be very near the sandy bottom or
be altogether above the surface of the water.
Mining plants on the beach are obliged to shut
down every time there is a storm or aa un-
usually high surf, for the suction pipes become
clogged with sand and seaweed. Even in calm
weather seaweed and rubbish in the water ool-
lect about the ends of the suction pipes, and a
suspension of operations for several hours is a
oommon ocourrence. Gangs of men drawing
from 60 cents to $1 an hour are idle during these
delays, and if their pay continues the loss to
the mfuing operators is a serious item of cur-
rentexpense. A day or two ago a plant on the
beach six miles from town shut down for lack
of water. A shoveller waded out to the end
of the suction pipe to see what had shut off
the water supply. He ducked head and shoul-
ders under the water and emerged a moment
later with the obstruction in his hand. He
didn’t hold it long, but gave a yell and threw it
Upon the beach. It was a live crab as large as
® man's hand. The owner of the mining plant
Teokons that the crab oost him from $10 to
$20. Last Tuesday every mining plant on the
beach for a distance of many miles was shut
down on account of a phenomenally high surf,
which reached half way from the normal high
tide to the line of vegetation on the tundra,
250 feet away. Yet no wind was blowing at a
distance nearer than 100 miles southward,

The best clean-up which has been heard of
on the beach this season was made last week by
& plant one mile west of Nome Forty-four and
one-eighth ounces of gold was taken out of the
sluice {nto which three men had been shovelling
beach sand for fifty-five hours. Two days
laterthe operator of the plant was obliged to
move to another location because he had
worked out the small patch of ground on which
his machinery and siuulce boxes had been set
"Dp. Altogether, beach mining on the Nome
coast ts scarcely a paying proposition.

Thousands of rocker men are working on the
beach all the was from Cape Nome to Penny
River and far beyond. It is perhapea fair state
ment to say tha each rocker man {is taking out
An Average of $1 worth of wolda day. The out-
r a of gold on the beach seems to have practi-
cally ceased almost as suddenly as it bezun ta
the summer of 1890. Idle attempts have been
Mide to estimate the value of the investments
™ ide this summer in beach mining outfits on
thie const, It certainly cannot be leas than
#3,000,000 and {t is proba bly as much as $6,000,000,
Even the smallest power pleats eost not less

 

 

 

  

 

than $1,000, and several of the larger plants
represent an expenditure of from 850000 to
$100.000 for machinery and freight alone. Nat-
urally, the largest failures have been made by
the largest plants

While beach sluicing has turned out very
poorly, beach and sea dredwing has proven an
absolute failure. Several hundred thousands
of dollars has been thrown away {n mammoth
Projects for saving the gold which it was be-
Heved by some persons lay in the sand of the
spa bottom from a few feet to a mile off shore.
These projects were launched on the flimsiest
sort of evidence that the sought-for gold ex-
{ated at all. ‘The largest scheme of all In thia
class has ita concrete representation in a struc-
ture as large as a business block In a thriving
Fastern city. The great timbers used in its
construction make it look like the framework
of an immenee barn built after the fashion of
fifty years ago. Somewhere up in the second
or third story of this structure fs an engine and
large sand pump. The etructure ia mounted
on wheels that look like hogsheads. After a
month spent in construction th e dredae was
pushed out Into the sea. Two days demon-
atrated to the complete satisfaction of the owner
that there is no gold on the sea bortom. A leew
expensive apparatus would have demonstrated
the same truth. This dredge is one of about
twenty that have been used for a few days on
the beach this summer and have then been
abandoned.

The principal excitement regarding opera-
tions on the creeks has been caused within the
last few days in connection with legal injune
tions issued to restrain the Pioneer Mining
Company from working ita three rich claims
on Anvil. The Pioneer company consists of
Linderburg, Lindblom and Brinderson, the
three discoverers of gold at Nome. The three
claims have produced this season about $150,000
worth of gold. Injunctions were ulso tasued
uguinst several other owners of claims on Anvil
Creek, The legal steps were taken at the in-
stance of several persons headed by Alexander
McKenzie, who assert that the titles to the
claims in question are invalid because they
were staked by ullens. These injunctions,
together with the lack of the usual water supply
on Anvil, have hindered mining operations
on that creek to a lurge extent.

There is no doubt that the claims above Dis-
covery on Anvil are all enormously rich. No.
1 below Discovery is also very valuable and
Nos. 2 and 8 ure also good producers,

Mining in the creek country has been hin-
dered by luck of rain, several streams running
dry just as operations were about to be begun.
Dexter, which is probably the richest creek
in the region next to Anvil, te dry and there ts
no expectation of a good water supply before
eurly fall. Some of these claims are so rich,
however, «8s to warrant transporting water
in wagons for a long distance. Gold ts ob-
tained on Dexter Creek exclusively by rock-
ing. Strikes are reported from the Golovin
Bay district, and miners have posted off in
that direction to confirm the rumors which
have reached the town from time to time.

No encouraging reports of a trustworthy
nature have been recelved from Cape York,
the much-vaunted gold country, 125 miles north
of Nome. There are those who still hold that
valuable mines exist there, but the prevalent
belief is that the country haa not yet shown
evidence of great richness. Hundreds of pro-
spectors have been scouring the country tn every
direction from Nome for a month, and almost
every day a new strike has been heard of. The
fact remains, however, that no report has yet
been confirmed which ts calculated to show
that western Alaska possesses the rich deposita
of gold which were believed to exist there.
Nevertheless, when one contemplates the vast-
ness of the country and the enormous area to
be prospected it is not hard to believe that the
territory comprised in this great peninsula will
yet prove to be one of the largest producers of
gold in the history of the world. Old mining
men declare that five years must pass before
a correct judgment can be formed, and they
predict that new lucky strikes will be made
every year for the next decade. Not every
claim that is said to have been prospected and
found barren of gold has really been thoroughly
examined. Many so-called prospectors will
dig one or at most three prospect holes in a creek
claim, and if they strike bedrock without finding
anything more than a few colors of gold they
give it up asa barren claim. The owner of one
of the richest claims on Bonanza Creek in the
Klondike region relates how he dug fifteen
prospect holes to bedrock tn his claim without
finding much more than colors, That was tn
1897. Since that time he has found $10 to the
pan, and the claim has produced more than
$80,000. Yet for a year and a half that claim
was the laughing stock of Klondike miners, who
said that the owner was throwing away good
money in prospecting @ barren plece of ground.
This man declares that not one In ten of the so-
called prospectors who are scouring the Nome
gold country ever thoroughly prospects any-
thing, and if any of them make a strike they
are simply lucky.

Bed rock in the tundra Hes from a few feet
to a hundred feet below the surface of the
ground. The average is perhaps fifty feet
Tt is not difficult to see, therefore, why the
tundra has never been prospected thoroughly.
Two or three large stock companies have with-
{n a week begun to prospect tundra claims
and the next two or three weeks will probably
demonstrate whether or not that part of the
country contains gold in sufficient quantities
to pay the expenses of operation and a profit.
A New York company with a capital of $5,000,-
om ia making a prospect on a tundra claim
six miles west of Nome. It is proposed to dig
a prospect hole 200 feet long by forty feet wide
and as deep as is necessary to ascertain if any
gold ts to be had. Digging has to be carried
on in solid foe three feet below the surface

Meanwhile the merchants, saloon proprie-
tors, gamblers and legitimate business men
who make up the population of the city of Nome
are awaiting news of new strikes and promising
developments in the mining country. More
than all, rain is desired, for this will encourage
operations on the cresks which are known
to be good producers of gold, and business
prosperity in the town will increase accord-
ingly. At present the town ts dull for a mining
camp, and prices for staple articles of living
are becoming lower every day as competition
increases and the popular demand diminishes.

BIRDS AS CHIMNEY SWEEPS.

 

 

Their Good Work Recognized by the Insurance
Companies of Maine.

Eart Cortntn, Me., Aug. 16.—Fire insurance
companies doing business in Maine are re-
luctant to take risks on farm buildings that
stand on dry hillsides. where the wells run
Jow in midsummer and water must be hauled
some distance. The companies demend a pre-
mium of 1 per cent. a year on this kind of
property, and some agents will not assume
the risks at any price. Nearly all the farmers
use wood for fuel. This fills the chimneys
with soot, which burns like tinder when a fire
gets into the flues. Most of the farmhouse
fires occur in August and September. The
chimney catches fire and the blazing cinders,
falling on the dry shingles, soon start a bluze
that is beyond control.

The farmers who live in large towns com-
plain bitterly about the policy of the insurance
people. They help to pay for the waterworks
and fire department that are supported by the
towns, but because they live away from the

vilinge they derive no benefit from the outlay.
A few years ago despairing of getting redress
from the old companies, the farmers went over
in a body to the insurance furnished by the
Grange. This action woke up the insurance

bs who have since been trying to win hack
he seceding patrons 5

In the course of their investigation into the
causes of fires the agents learned that three-
quarters of the damage wrought in Maine
farmhouses was due to fire in the chimneys
enreading to edjacent woodwork, They also
discovered that chimneys in which the brown
awifts or chimney swallows built their nests
and reared their young, seldom if ever caught
fire. the wings of the birds in their passage
up and down the flues serving as brooms to
aweep the soot awny, so there was nothing
in which the flyin: sparks could catch. Since
this discovery the companies have agreed to
take houses that are tenanted by chimney
awifts at the old rates, but they will not con-
der an offer from a home where the birds
o not dwell.

BATTLES WITH BIG FISH.

SPORT AFFORDED BY THE BLACK
SEA BASS OF THE PACIFIC.

Anglers Who Cross the Continent to Seek the
Jowfish—Strug gies That May Last One Hour
or Many-A New Yorker Who Caught «
240-Pounder With a Rod After Four Hours,

Pomona, Cal, Aug. 18.The season of ang-
ling for jewfish on the coast of Southern Call-
fornia is at its height. Hundreds of people at
the seashore resorts, and especialiy at Banta
Catalina Island, are engaged in the sport.
Among the anglers are a score of men from
New York and New England, who have come
almost solely to seek jew fish.

The black sea bass, scientifically called Stere
olepia gigas, is better known up and down the
Pacific coast as the jewfish. How it got that
name is a common topte of discussion out here
each fishing season, and probably always will
be. These fish are, next to the ahark, the larg-
est that take the hook. The famous tarpon of
Florida and the Gulf of Mexico are not to be
compared with the jewfish in size. For sev-
eral weeks from five to ten jewfish weighing
about 150 pounds each have every day been
brought into Redondo by fishermen, and 4
dozenor more have been caught lately that
weighed more than 240 pounds. The largest
caught this season at Catalina tipped the beam
at 827 pounds. The head alone weighed 48
pounis. The fish was 6 feet, 8 inches long,
and 8 feet, & inches tn circumference at the
greatest part. The tail was 18 inches wide, the
scales were larger than silver dollars, and the
eyes were as large as a horse's.

Catching a jewfish !¢ an experience that ts
well worth travelling a long distance to at-
tain. The fish is a cousin of the black bass
of Eastern waters and looks like it, though
its enormous size makes it a caricature of its
pugnacious and julcy relative. It has all the
game qualities of the black bass. The most
common mode of capturing the jewfish at
Catalina Island is with a hand line and hook.
The fisherman goes out in a rowboat accom-
panied by one or two companions, for when
a fewfish {9 hooked {it requires one man to
manage the oars, and one or two men to manipu-
late the line. It is often the work of an hour
or more to subdue a jewfish, and there have
been instances where a rowboat has been upset
by one of these fish. The hook most generally
used fs seven Inches long and made of tough
ateel of the diameter of common telegraph
wire. It is fastened to the line by a copper
wire two feet long on a swivel. The line is as
heavy as an ordinary clothesline and made of
the finest linen threads. Most fishermen use
about six hundred feet of line. The bait is
a two-pound Spanish mackerel, or, better still,
a chunk of cheap and odoriferous beef or pork.
When the haunts of the jewfish have been
reached, a mile or so from the shore, the hook
is thrown over the side of the boat and lowered
some one hundred and fifty feet in the water.
The other end of the line having been securely
tied to the bottom of the craft, the fishermen
may sit and smoke and give themselves over
to meditation.

Suddenly there comes a tremendous tug
on the end of the line, the line begins to run out
and the angler finds himself engaged in an
exciting struggle. The boat is towed about
by the fish--sometimes half a mile at a time,

Then, when there are indications that the jew-
fish is wearving of his tow, the line is allowed
to run out some 200 or 300 feet more. Then
for a second time the line is grasped. The
fish starts off again and tries by many tricks
to regain ita liberty. When at length there
are indications that the fish has been tired,
the fisherman begins the long process of haul-
ing the mighty warrior of the seain, It is hard
work, for the fish still engages in every form
of aquatic gymnastics, When at last, after
a contest of an hour or more, the big is
drawn to the surface of the water, and near
to the boat, it is held by the fishermen, while
the man at the oars either shoots leaden slugs
into its bead, or reaches out with a long-handled
pike and cuts open the head of the bass, There
are instances of fights between experienced
fishermen and ee of lasting hours.

Bobbing for jewflsh in the bay is exciting
fun, but there is no science in it, and it is re-
sorted to principally by people who want to make
money by selling the fish. During the autumn
aod winter months jewflsh follow mackerel,
smelte, halibut and other fish inside the bay,
When their presence is known get a strong
float; any sort of plank will do, but a 2 by 4
scantling about six feet long is best; to this
attach a rope; common cotton clothesline,
about twenty feet long, will do. To the hook
end fasten a small chain, two or three feet long,
and to the other end of the chain attacha hook
of quarter-inch steel, about eight inches long.
Bait the hook with a good-sized mackerel,
or any Uvely Aah, hooked through the jaws,
and throw t whole outfit overboard. Row
away one hundred yards or so and watch the
scantling. If there are any jJewfish about
it, {t will not be long before it will be perform-
ing all manner of gyrations. Then row for it.
It will be some time before you can pick it up,
but when you do get it hold it fast to the bow
of the boat, and let the fish tow you around
until he gives up, then tow him in. The meat
of the jewfish is palatable, thoughrather fat
and coarse. One advantage is that one is not
troubled with small bones in eating it,

The angling lore of California has no more
interesting story of achievement in landing the
mammoth black sea bass than that which cone

erna Stuart M. Beard, a famous amateur angler
n central New York. Mr. Beard came from
Canandaigua, N. Y., to Catalina Island to spend
the summer of 1897 in fishing. He had been
at Catalina two weeks before he hooked a jews

 

 

fish. After a wonderful encounter with the
creature he landed his game, which weighed
248 pounds. Previously the best record made

in America with arod and reel was made in a
battle with a tarpon in the Gulfof Mexico off
the coast of Florida in May, 1888, when John
P. Sexton of Philadelphia brought to gaff a
1@-pound fish. Mr. Beard hooked his mam-
moth black sea bass at sunset and for four
hours had one of the most exciting contests
with a fish ever experienced by any angler. It
was dark and after 10 o'clock at night when
he landed his trophy In the boat. - | ete,
he had on his reel some 900 feet of cuttyhun
fifteen-strand line, and was with an exper-
fenced oarsman or he would certainly have
lost the fish. Mr. Beard and his rowing com-
panion were returning to the little town of
Avalon when suddenly the line on his rod went
out with a loud shriek of the reel. Some 800
feet was out before it was realized that a bi
fish had been hooked. The oaraman rowe
backward as fast as possible, while several
hundred feet more of the line went out. Then
began the battle The bont was rowed back-
ward and forward many times, some Capes
mile at a ume. while the monster was play:
with and while Mr. Beard reeled and unreele
his line scores and soores of times. Pully
fifteen miles was covered first and last in the
struggle, while the fisherman, shaking with
excitement and watching as best he couldin the
dark the movements of the great basa, adroitly
anaged his rod 80 as to hold the fish and not
fose both line and rod. One moment the big
fellow was 500 feet away fro 6 boat and a
few minutes later he was slowly and cautiously
reeled to within fifty feet of the craft, when,
taking a new spurt, away he went with 200 or
800 feet more of line after him. At last he was
ao wearled that he was brought to gaff and one
of the most extraordinary rod and reel bat-
tles with a big fish was over. The men who
have fished In Southern California waters for
years with common hand lines and who have
had some lively experiences of thelr own at
Catalina Island, have not yet got over telling
of Beards wonder "ae and the Los
Angeles photographers have sold a great
number of pictures of the fish and the rod
and ree! and fisherman that landed the trophy.

Cripples Get On the Ticket.

BCRANTON, Aug. 16-—Three years ago the
Democrats, hard pressed in this county, nom-
inated Williarn Koch, a cripple, for Recorder
of Deeds. Photographs were taken in which
his twisted leg and a crutch were displayed
and the pietures were scattered through the
county. Koch led his tieket and was elected
by about 3,000 plurality, the vote for the other
officers being close, a majority of the Demo-

POLITICAL NOTES.

 

Naturalization this year, from all reports, has been
leas than tn any other Presidential contest since
1440,

A Senatorial seat depends, tn a!) probability, upon
the union or failure to units of the Bryan forces in
Idaho. The term of the present Repubiienn Senator,
Mr. Shoup, who is Idaho's representative on the Re-
publican National Commitiee, expires on March 4
neat, and the Legtalature which ts to elect his eue-
cessor will be chosen in November, The last Idaho
Legislature was much divided. It was made up of 21
Hepubiicans, 17 Democrats, 12 Silver Republicans, 8
Populists, ® Democratic Fuslonists and 38 Fusion
Populists, On the vote for Governor the Democrats
and Silver Republicans polled 18,400, the Repubii-
cans 13,700 and the People's party 3,500 votes.

 

A State Senator is to be elected inthe Fifteenth
New York district this year, which contains a larger
Republican majority than any other districtin this
part of the State, and there ts no present opposition to
thejrenomination of Nathaniel A. Elsberg. There are
no factional contests for Republican leadership in the
Twonty-fith, Twenty-seventh and Twenty-ninth As-
sembly districts, into which itis divided, « condition
of affairs generally ascribed tothe harmonising ef-
forts of Gen. Francis V. Greene, the new President of
the Republican County Committee. Heretofore these
three districts have had annual contests between the
Republicans to the manifest political advantage of
their Democratic opponents.

John Lind, the present Fusion Governor of Minne
Sota, upon whose personal popularity with the Scan-
dinavian voters the Bryan men are depending for
success in that State, had, when chosen fn 1495, a
total vote of 122,000, 7,000 leas than Bryan received
in the State two years before,

 

Three national conventions tn 1900 have been pre-
aided over by Colorado men—the Republican National
Convention in Philadelphia by Senator Woloott, the
Democratic National Conventionin Kansas City by
Gov. Thomas, and the Silver Republican Convention
in the same city by Senator Teller. In proportion to
ita electoral votes. now four, Colorado has a larger
popular vote than any other State. It was 149,620 in
1896, South Dakota has four electoral votes and a
popular vote of 82,000. Washington with four eleo-
toral voles, had a popular vote of 93,000; Florida,
with four electoral votes, had a popular vote of 46,-
000, Vhe explanation of the apparent discrepancy ts
this; There is female suffrage in Colorado.

 

The term of the Sheriff of New York county 1s two
years, and the holder of the office is not, under the
Constitution, eligible to succeed himself. A Sheriff
will be voted forin November next at the same time
as the second Mayor of the Greater New York ts
elected. Bernard F, Martin, who has two terms to his
credit in the State Senate, |9 a candidate for Sheriff on
the Tammany Hall ticket,

On Nor. 17, 1800, the seat of Federa! Government,
which had previously been in Philadelphia and New
York, was removed to the city of Washington and the
formal establishment of the seat of government there
took place!n the monthof December, 1500. Presi-
dent McKinley has approved the plan for the celebra-
tion next December of the centennial of the establish-
ment of the seat of government in Washington The
plan provides for a reception by the President with
appropriate addresses, followed by commemorative
exercises in Congress in the afternoon, and a military

The late R. K. Scott, who died recently tn Toleda,
was the first Governor of South Carolina after {ts read-
mittance into the Unionin June, 1868, and he held
the office of Governor untll 1473, being succeeded in
turn by F. J. Moses, Jr., and Dantel H. Chamberlain.
Mr. Scott wasan Oblo man, one of the many Ohio
men who attained bigh political honors in other
States. Since the close of 1876 the Governors of
South Carolina hare been uniformly Democrats when
not Popullsts, asin the case of Tillman and his im
mediate successor.

This year’s Presidential election will be the frst
held within the boundaries of Greater New York.
Nassau county will, for the first time as such, be @
participant in a Presidential election in November.

 

A correspondent in Washington, D. ©, writes to
the Hvening Post declaring his positive and irrevo-
cable determination not to vote for William McKinley
and Theodore Roosevelt this year. He might well,
with like positiveness, have declared that he would
not vote for William Jennings Bryan and Adlai E.
Stevenson either. Residents of the city of Washing-
ton have no vote. a

According to an announcement made in Chicago
there are now 260,000 taxpayers delinquent on ae
seasments in that city, an abnormally large number
for 4 community in which, heretofore, tax debts have
asa rule been very prompt) collected,

 

There has never been a Democratic Governor o
New York elected from the county of Kings, though
prominent Democrats in that county have been in past
times favored for the Democratic nomination and
often with strong local support, notably inthe case
of Henry C. Murphy. Henry W. Slocum and Alfred
C. Chapin. The last Democratic candidate for Gov-
ernor of New York, Au®ustus Van Wyck, was a rest
dent of Kings county

The beneficial material effects of the Republican
policy of commercial expansion have had so great an
effect upon business on the Pacific coast as entirely
to change the character of former political calcula-
tlons Washington State was carried by Bryan in
14096 by alarge majority, but since then the develop-
ment of the business interests of the onlef Washington
ports has been such as completely to overthrow the ar-
guments of theadvocates of 16 to 1. A recent com-
putation made of the business of Seattle, whichis
now the largest city In Washington and which be-
tween 1880 and 1890 made the marvellous gain of
more than 1,000 per cent in population, shows the
chief shipments to be in round numbers as follows:
Coal, 1,200 tons a day: lumber, 200,000 feeta day;
shingles, 1,100,000 a day; flour, 1,000 barrels a day;
and wheat, 5.000 bushels a day. Merchandise is
shipped to British Columbia at the rate of $1,000 4
day, to Honolulu $1,0004@ day, to Manila $1,000 4
day and to Alaska $20,000 aday. Shipments of fish
alone are estimated at $3,000 a day,

 

Everything in the Department of Docks and Ferries
is conducted In an orderly and parifamentary fashion
and communications receive not only the formal at
tention which they demand, but also the attention to
which the writers think them entitled. Thus, under
the order of general business, ata reeent meeting of
the board a formal communication was received and
spread upon the minutes from Mary McGinty, ‘‘de-
clining an appointment as cleaner,"’ and another was
received from Lillie Newell, making forma) tender of
her resignation as recreation pier cleaner. The Oom-
missioners of Docks and Ferries went into execative
seasion and determined by 4 unanimous vote to ao
cept the resignations
