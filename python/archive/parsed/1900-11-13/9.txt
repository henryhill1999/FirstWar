ODD THINGS.

The little pieces that put the finish-

ing touches to a room,

Siuall tables and etageres, topped
with onyx of such pellucid depths, such
sharply defined markings of blacks,
browns and reds, as are not often seen,
Mahogany or gold curio tables,
kunken Velvet-lined, glass enclosed
Handy music cabinets, pedestals,
Oriental rugs — hand-woven rarities
Which artists rave over,

These are just the hints of the many
novelties now being choseu at factory
prices for November Brides.
