ARMOR CONTROVERSY SETTLED.

     

Agreement Keached Between the Navy De-
Partment and the Armor Make

WASHINGTON, Nov 12 —Through an ar-
rangement made between the Navy Depart-
ment and the Carnegie and Bethlehem Steel
companies the long standing controversy
ever the price demanded by the artnor makers
for Krupp armor has been adjusted on a basis
vouch the naval authorities say will meet with
the approval of Congress ‘Lhis controversy
has resulted in delaving the construction of
& number of battleships and armored cruisers,
Congress having at one time forbidden the
Navy Department to make contracts tor build-
ing thein until the price of high-class armor
had been reduced. At ita lust session Con-
gress modified this radical provision, but pro-
vided that unless the Secretary of the Navy
could secure the best armor at a rate con-
sidered reasonable, he should proceed to build
a Goverument armor factory, toward the con-
struction of which $4,000,000 was appropriated
Contracts for constructing the bulls of only
the battleships Maine, Ohio and Missouri have
been awarded, however, and bids for con-
structing eleven other armorclada will not
be opened until next month. The arrange-
ments for building these fourteen vessels were
delayed on account of the armor controversy

Under the agreement reached between the
Navy Department and the armor makers,
there need be no further delay, and the first
deliveries of armor will be made within six
months after the contract has been signed
Copies of the contracts huve been forwarded

to the two concerns for approval, and it is ex-
pected that the contracts will be signed this
week, Lntil the deal is actually consummated
the Navy Department will not make public
the terms of the agreement, but there is reason
ty believe that the armor makers have reduced
their price for the best armor treated by the
Krupp hardening process to $476 @ ton

The controversy was start the insist-
en f the Carnegie and Bethielemn companies
on $545 a ton. In the bids opened in Septen-
ber last they submitted identical bids o; Sa)
4 ton, but served notice that they would not
Make Contracts for less than one-half each of
the whole amount of armor required, asyre-
gating about 37,000 tons of ail deserk) ons
The Midvale Steel Company submitted lower
bids, but asked twenty-six on
which to make the tirst deliverles and required
that it should recelve at least 20,000 Cons
bids Were unsatisfactory and were rejected
Just before the new bids were to be or: ened,
the Navy Denartment and the Carnegie and
Bethlehem companies saw @ Cliahee for an
agreeinent and the openie of the bids Was
cancelled As a result of their conferences au
agreement was reached, which to-day recetved
the sanction of Secretary Long

REPAIRS AT THE CAPITOL,

Committee Rooms ant Attic Corridors Painted
and Frescoed,

WasHINGTON, Noy. 12,—Architect of the
Capitol Clark, in his annual report, describes
the repairs made at the Capitol during the
past year. A number of the committee rooms
were repaluted and refrescoed. He says the
ventilation of the House side is greatly in-
ferior to that on the Senate side and recom-

 

monds that the floor of the House berecon- |

structed and the restaurants and kitchens be
combined and located in the jupper
He algo advises the installation of folding
chairs in the walleifes in place of the benches
The great dome serves as a ventilator for the
centre of the Capitol, but has no intluence on
the halls of the Senate or House

The total expenditure of repairs at the Cap-
{tol during the fiscal year of 1900 Was $40,700,
and for lehting $83,216. The repairs made
during the iast session of Congress have pro-
duced marked change in the condition of many
of the corridors and committee rooms. ‘The
work of painting alone couprised some 60,000
ecuare yards, The attie corridors in beth
Senate and House have been finely frescoed

The care of the works of art in the Capitol
cost $1,500 during the last year, Fine ma-
hogany doors were placed at the entrance to
the marble room of the senate indof hesen-

BIG CLOAK FIRMS RETIRE,

 

Tader Competition From the Smal! Manofact-
DBrers, the Uston Asserts.

Three of the largest cloakmaking firms in
this city announced yesterday their retire-
ment fiom business. The three firms are
Blumenthal Bros. of Third and Mercer streets
who employ 900 cloakmakers Benjamin &
Co, of Broadway and Waverley place, who
employ 200 cloakmakers, and Friedlander
& Co. of & Bond street, who employ 1,000 cloak-
makers, No reason {a stated for the retire-
ment of these firms, except in the cane of Blu-
menthal Bros, who are going into the banking
business

According to the officers of the Cloakmakers
Union the firms are going outof the cloak -
niaking business owing to the great increase
{n the number of small manufacturers, who
lve in the tenement districts and whose work
is done in swentshops. For several veara
the large manufacturers all over the clty have
heen complaining of the competition. of the
small firms, whi¢éh pay low wages and whose
expenses for rent and other matters are much
smaller than those of the lorger firme

In view of the retirement of these firms a
meeting of delegates from the various unions
of garment workers will be held to-night to
consider the situation. Herman Grossman,
walking delegate of the Cloukinakera’ Unlon,
asserted vesterday that the whole trouble
{n the trade arose from a revival of the eld
sweatshop conditions in the tenement dis
tricts he saves that in many tenements peo-
ag are working In living rooma in spite of the

actory act
trade unions tried to arrange for a svetem of
cooperation between the large firms by which
the small firms would be forced ont of busi-
neas, but the manufacturers declined to act
