wave an example of his neat, nice and tactful
acting, and that Miss Vanbrugh went past
him to a point of genuine genius in the de-
piction of a woman doing a bad thing witha
good intention. The {ngenious situation is
that the nobleman gets the Duchess safely
out-of the room and then locks himself in with
the manicure, who is thus #° caught
in her own trap that, as the tan
tella her, she will herself be compromised
if she reveals the affair. But she resolutely
declares that she will sacrifice her own reputa-

this brief description, that the complication
of cross-purposes is peculiarly valuable Ihe
handling of it by Mr. Pinero {4 masterly. The
climax of it is that the nobleman, admiring
her loyal bravery, stops her as she is about
to call in others, and promises not to say a
word against her. That honorable stand by
