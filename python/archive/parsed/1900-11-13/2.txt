In making Unis appeal to the citizens of New
Cutting made the following

| statement

The Citizens’ Union has no desire to par-
ticipate in a three-cornered contest in the
Mavoralty campaign of 1991, and it hopes to
tind on the part of other organizations so gen-
eral a readiness to cooperate in a bona fide good
government movement as to avoid the neces-
sity for a third ticket

In the effort to accomplish {ts purpose the
Union will observe a policy toward ita possible
coadtittors to which it believes no one ean take
exception that is ready to put the direct in-

It was added that many I(rregularities had

had written even though he had not put « cross

REPRISALS AGAINST CHINA,

This Government Dissatisfied With the De-
mands of the Fore.ga Mintsters.

WasmINGTON, Nov. 12—-Much dissatisface
tion ts felt in official circles here over the atu-
tude of the foreign Ministers in Pekin in their
arrangement of a programme of reprisals
against the Chinese Government. 50 far this

Government is the only one of the Powers
that has pointed out what it conceives to be
the danger of demanding the execution of
princes of the Imperial family and other high
dignitaries concerned in the Boxer outrages,
The Government is convinced that many of
these men should be severely punished, burt
it believes that the Ministers desire to oarry
out a policy that is 80 bloodtursty that it will
meet with strenuous Oppostion by the Chinese
and perhaps result in differences which may
bring about more hostilities All the nations,
with the exoaeption of the United States are
believed to be in accord with the desire of the
Ministers to adopt a comprehensive programme
of punishrnents, and for the sake of harmony
this Government may be obliged to acquiesce

The advices received here from Pekin indicate
that the indemnity which the Powers will de.
mand from China will be bevond the meansof
the Chinese treasurv. The etatement that the
Powers will ask for §$406,000,000 Is) regarded
in Washington with surprise. “They
ae well ask for ix billion milion dollars,” sald
one oMcial China is in debt almost up to the
Hrnit of her resources and could not raise any
eur hur as $600,000,000 even with na reasonable
period of time She is still making payments
on the $400,000,000 indemnity toJdanan on account
of the war with that eountry. The idea here
is that China should be made to pay as much
as she is able, but not made a bankrupt nation
by exorbitant demands.

PaTENSON, N.J., Nov. i2.~ Andrew Bosbauin
and Sullivan Johns, boys, were committed |
to Ja'l to-day by Recorder Senior for ninety
days on charges of disorderly conduct. Police-
man Horridge found thew lute last night sleep- |
ing bebind a packing box in a vacant lot at
Riverside |

The boys are known as the “Lerrors of River-
side". The parents of both are respectable
people with comfortable homes. The elder
Johns is # property owner, but he hae no control
over his young son, Both lads are under 15
years of age. They refuse to live at home
preferring to spend their time !n the streets
sleeping under stoops and stea'ing when they
cannot make raids at their homes.

Bosbaum’s father told the Recorder to-day
that his sun Was in the habit of sneaking into
the houee during the day when he was away
at work The boy stole whatever food or
money he could lay hands on and retired to
share the plunder with young Johns. On
these occasions Andrew threatened his younger
brothers and sisters with all manner of aire
calamities if they told their father Three
weeks ago on One Of these Visits his sister Lizzie,
11 years of age, objected to his stealing some
canned goods) Ihe boy seized her and, throw-
{nw her on (he bed, attempted to smother her
with a quilt. The gs strugéled, but the poy
held her down on the bed unt she was blac
in the face. He nally desisted when he heard

A week later Andrew attempted to set fire
to Jizzie's dress). He hadhelda blazing wisp
of paper with whion be chased the girl around
the house. She escaped from the house. He
has been arrested four times for stealing. His
favorite plan is to catch children going to atores
and to take what money they have. Johns
and he have done this 80 often that children
have been known to spend the money ther
get from theirmothersto buy eroceriesand then

» home with the familiar tale that Andrew
Boabautn or Sullivan Johns took the money
from them

Another favorite plan of the young rascals
was to steal from sual) stores in the River-

Ide section kept by women. One of thei
would go io to purchase a penny’s worth of
candy and while the women was attending
to him the other would fill his pockets. They
have not confined their operations to snea

Polioainan Horridge arrested young Bosbaum

for breaking into a small grocery store in Frie

street and stoaling clgarettes, candy and some
emall change

Until to-day voung Bosbau:m has escaped
punishment because his father has always
jeaded for hin and made restitution, but
fis recent escapades have convinced bis father
that the lad is jneorrigible and to-day he ap-
peared against him and asked that the State
take care of him. When young Bosbaum heard
the stories told by his father in the police court
to-day he nodded his head in assent to the
query of the Recorder as to whether he had
attempted to kill his siater

TAMMANY

REVOLT SPREADS,

 

German-Americans to Wage Bitter War Against
the Wigwam.

The dissatisfaction within Tammany Gall,
which has been shown plainly on a number of
occasions manifested itself first yesterday
in the orgapization of the Thomas L. Reynolds
Assuclation of the Twenty-third Assembly
district, with headquarters at 715 St. Nicholas
avenue. The club is composed of young
Democrats who have hitherto followed the
leadership of William F Stillings and Thomas
fF MeAvoy tn the Twenty-third Assembly
district, which is dominated entirely by Corpo-
ration Counsel John Whalen. The club has
declared in favor of the nomination of Bird S
Coler for Mayor, It will hold a ernoker at ite
headquarters on evening of Nov, 24, at
which its members will be addressed by Mr.
Coler, ex-Mavor Gilroy, Elliot Danforth, John
C, Sheehan and William M. Ivins

The Executive Committee of the Germane
American MeKinley and Roosevelt League,
which dissolved on Friday, having completed

remember the muniepal campaign
will call to mind the facet that Richard Croker
in usurping the power of John C Sheehan,

who at that tine was the leader of the Demo-
cratic organization in New York county, gross
ly insulted the German race Mr Sheehan
had made a careful study of the political sit-
uation, and had made up his mind that Willlam
Sohmer, who was the Fammany leader of the
lenth Assembly district, would be an accept-
able Democratic candidate tor Mayor Mr
Sheelian supposed that he was in supreme coin-
mand of the Tammany and Democratic foroes
in New York, for Mr Croker had requested him
on his departure for Kngiand before the cam-
paign of tsu®, to rin the machine and to dis
courage any efforts to bring him (Croker)
back [nto polftics, Mr. Sheehan had taken
Mr. Croker at his word and Mr. Sohmer_was
to have been nominated for Mayor. Then
Mr. Croker came back to this country. The
full story of how Mr. Croker regained control
of Tammany Hall_has never been told. At
this time it will su™flee to say that Mr. Croker
asked Mr Sheehan who were under oonsidera-
tion as candidates for Mayor. Mr. Sheehan
named several gentiemen, among them being
Sohmer. When Mr. Sohmer's name was men-

tioned Mr. Croker said
He's a German and

“No, no: he wont do.
he can't be truated.’

The Germans have never forgiven Mr.
Croker for this insult, and for that reason it is
expected that the German Anti-Tammany
League will have a powerful influence in the
coming campaign
