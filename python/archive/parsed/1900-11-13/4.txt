It was a day of upsets at the Aqueduct track
yesterday. The card was a good one, and
even if favorites did not run up to expecta-
tions the sport was interesting It was @ proa-
peroua day for the layers of odds, for not only
were four out of the six favorites beaten, but
many good things as well he only unpleas-
ant feature was Starter Dettingill's poor work
In the third race Leon Ferguson was a heavily

and Cephalalgia backed on the side aa good
things After losing much time Pettingill

dropped the flag, when only the first four horses
wot a chance Cephalalgia was left standing,
While three others were practically in the same
predicament. Come To Order and Miss Michel
had the best of the break and they ran as named
to the farturn Then Miss Mitchell shot away
from the bunch and never was caught. She
won by twelve lengths.

Ihe best tleld of the day was entered in the
opening race, a handicap at seven furlongs,
but it was ripped to pleces by scratches whica
left seven out of the Afteen encries to start
With the best horses out it looked as if Godfrey
could win and he was the public's selection,
with Marivert and Watercure having 4 strong
| following. Godfrey ran a good rac but Prince
