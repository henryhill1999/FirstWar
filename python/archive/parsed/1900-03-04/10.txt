AND BUYS AT WAR.

JANITORS

A Feud Caused on tho Kast Side by the
Snow That Made Coasting Possible.
‘The snows that have come and gone have left
a foud behind them. All along the district of little
hills, a block or so io length, on the upper Fast
Side the youngsters turned out with a whoop for
the sledding as soon as the sidewalks were in
condition frit It was their first chance to \se
their Christmas sleds ani the streets were alive i
with them. In consequence, the sidewalks were
worn down to 4 consistency of glassy iciness
Down these the small boy on his sled passed
swifly and joyously, Quite otherwise passed
the resident of the district Ile, too, slid, as soon
as he encountered the treacherous surface, notona
sled, but on whatever portion of him happened
to hit first Then he made bitter complaint to the
janitor if he lived in apartments or to the servants
if he was a householder, and these went forth
with asbes and sawdust and salt to make safer
the ways. This, of course, spoiled the sledding’
and the small boy is not one w sit down idly under

econceives to beatyrannical disregard of
earls While there was snow to make sno whe
of he defended bis slides with those tuIss) em poms
times he scraped up the very ashes noe by the
foe and used them as ammunition l over that
of the city the battle raged tlercely between
the janitors and the urchins, chielly to the dis-
comiiture of the former, who, while stronger in
band-to band conflict, were greatly outnumbered
and were inferior in swiftness and stravegy
The snow is all gone now and there is no more
gliding, but the war rages unabated. So bitter |
{s {t in some neighborhoods that the lice have
been called upon a8 4 second line of defence w the
Janitors, but the skirmishers of the enemy elwaye
discover the advance of this ponderous line ©
disappear only to pop up again when

ae ay incurred the ens dty of the small-boy
organization of his block by ruining their alide
aftervarious tenantshad performed un remedditate:
contortions upon it, and the war had n raging
for some days when, coming around a corner, he
had chanced upon two of the ringleaders in con-
aultation and bad seized upon them before they
could aacape. While employed in the pleasing |
diversion of knocking thelr heads together despite |
their shouts of grief he was surprised by @ gan

of twenty, he said, of their colleagues, armed |
with barrel staves, shinny sticks and other forms
of daadly weapon, and was beaten earth afier 8
allant @ gle. Whén he arose his acalp had |
bo worn through in several places by repeated |
applications of the aforesaid weapons, and this

woNey caked his name on tbeir list, upon which
already 4 several entries, among them A
colored washerwoman who was almost blinded
with ashes, an ashman who had his head cut
open with a stone by a gang of the urchins while
engaged in furnishing contraband of war, the
owner of » house who was pelted while cleaning
off his own sidewalk, and half a dozen janitors.
No arrests have been made yet, but the police
have promised ageneral round-up of theyoungsters
if peace is not soon declared.

 

 

REAL RATATE NEWS.

A week ago real estate men ascribed to the |
fact of Washington's Birthday occurring on Thurs-
day the ama!! amount of business they had done.
With no holiday, the week just past has had fewer
pales than ‘6 one preceding. Nevertheless,
with a hopefulness due {n part to the closing of
the Rapid Transit tunnel contract and the conse
quent projects and prospects of building and sell-
{ng in Harlem and The Bronx, most of the real
estate brokers viewed the situation with equa-
nimity, and talked of numerous and large deals
nearing completion, but not ready to be announced
just yet, Whether it was a coincidence that 60
many deals should be in the same state at the
same time or whether the brokers exaggerated
a trifle is a matter of uncertainty. There were
e few doleful ones, however, who said plainly
that there was practically no market and that it
was due to unequal taxation and the discussion
rife concerning the subject of taxation on mort-
gages and the Stranaban-Allds bill.

Several members of the Real Estate Board of
Brokers have expressed themselves as being op-
posed to the passage of that bill, and thero Ls little
doubt that the board ts almost, if not quite, unani-
mous on the matter. Such, however, ts not the
condition of mind of all brokers, a number of
whom maintain that the imposition of o tax of
five mills on all mortgages will harm no one, but
will redound to the benefit of the poorer class of
persons who hold mortgages and cannot protect
themeelves by “swearing off’ their mortgage
taxes. Be that as it may, persons who have
money to lend are not anxious to lend it under the
present unsettled conditions, and some bankers
who offered loans at 4 per cent. afew months ago |
are not anxious now to part with their money at |
4‘; percent. Others will lend at 4 per cent., with
4 proviso that in case of the Stranahan bill be-
coming 4 law the rate paid shall be 4", per cent,

There is, however, 4 downtown bank which has
seized with avidity the opportunity to lend at 4
per cent. on property which has been offered to
uptowm institutions and rejected unless the ap
plicant would pay 4's per cent. The fact seems
to be that the law of supply and demand will
settle the interest question. If a number of banks
are willing to land at 4 percent. and the demani
for loans is not unusually great, other banking
{nstitutions will be forced to loan at the same
rate, whether the Stranahan bill is passed or not

Property outside the boroughs of Greater New
York is being rented, bought and sold mor freely
than it is in the city, although real estate busi-
ness in Brooklyn is not unsatisfactory; at least,
leas so than on this side of the East River.

—. B. Prindle of Brooklyn is having @ colonial
residence built on the bluff at Seventy-fourth
street and Second avenue, Bay Ridge section, for
his personal use, to cost $20,000, Frank Gelston
has begun the construction of seven Queen Anne
cottages on Seventy-second street, between First
ond Narrows avenues, to sell for 85,000 each.
Fdward Johnson, builder, is erecting a frame
double house for E. F. O'Connor at Fourth avenue
and Seventy-eighth street, Brooklyn, to cost
$10,000. Within the past few daysasyniicate
has been inspecting property along the Shore Road
with the view of purchasing 4 tract of land in that
locality on which to build high-class colonial
residences.

W. L. Dowling of Brooklyn has sold to Post
master Mayo of Bay Ridge section a dwelling
on Eighty-third street between Second and Third
avenues for $7,000.

Cornelius B. Van Brunt has bought a plot on
the Shore road between Fighty-second and Eighty-
third streets, 502x200, for $15,000,

Frank Gelston has filed plana for the construc-
tion of four Colonial houses. One ts to be built
on the corner of Seventy-ninth street and Second
avenue, to cost $10,000. Two will be «ituated
on Second avenue, near Seventy-ninth street,
and the fourth on Seventy-ninth street between
Second and Third avenues.

The new main sewer in the Bay Ridge section
is to extend from New York Harbor and the Shore
road, east through Seventy-ninth street to Filth
avenue, then north to Ovington avenue and east
to Fort Hamilton avenue. Only three blocks
of this sewer have up to this time been excavated.
The Brooklyn Borough Construction Com-
pany haa the contract for the work. Bay Ridge
has never had a sewer system. The assessments
on property owners to pay for the sewer now being
constructed will be borne equally.
