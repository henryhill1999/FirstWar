One true philosopher, with an innate sense of
the strength and frailties of woman's nature,
saysthat it isher first and foremost duty to please
and that she cannot fully succeed in this unless
she is neatly and tastefully dreased; to which,
with up-to-date wisdom, the modern sage adds,
fashionably. So much depends on dress in these
days that there is no arguing Against this state
ment. A woman may have all the assumed
virtues and graces of the angels, but if she lacks
the proper halo of dainty well made fashionable
qothes she fails to reach that pinnacle of success
for which she strives Dress is certainly an art
and iu it artistic feeling may be expressed in a
greater or smaller degree as it reflects the taste
of the individual and has become a labor of love
which requires unlimited attention

Whether you view fashion in the perspective
orasitappears in the first installments of imported
novelties, there is a promising fleld for artistic
dressing during the coming season, and if women
fail to accomplish this, it will be no fault of the
materials, colors, trimmings, and, apparently,
models, as there is every thing to be desired. Fach
week reveals some measure of novelties in material
and trimmings as well, and new gowns are getting
{nto line for the summer campaign. Folian
cloth is a distinct novelty among the mixed silk
and-wool fabrics, of which there is a charming
variety this season Jt has a weave very much
like fine poplin, only it is as soft and thin and

 

Pliable as crepe de chine Conventional designs
fn silk lines of the same color are thrown up on
the surface, giving something of a brocaded effect
It costs $3.25 a yard, but it is double width and
like all the silk-and-wool materials, it is recom-
mended as very serviceable

The silk-and-wool crepes de chine are extremely
nice and very glossy, and then there is an all-
wool canvas dotted overwith rough, rather shaggy,
large round spots of the same color, which is
much less “expensive and very stylish. Our old
friend Lansdowne, » silk-and-wool material, has
appeared in a hew guise with small lovers’ knots
embroidered in black seattered over it, Among
the novelties in all-silk materials is the meteore
crepe, at$iayard, Luttwice the width of ordinary
wpilk. A set flower design into this
at intervals either in white or the same color 4s the
ground, showing againaren swed tendency toward
brocaded designs. whatever the color may be it is
a@ most beautiful fabric. For extreme novelty
the new India twilled silks with palm-leaf borders
take the lead. In pale shades, with a border in
Persian colors, they are very attractive, but for
yeally striking effect the black grounds stand
atthe head.

Another surprise which blossoms out in the
organdie department is the silk chambray

1900.

dimity model is a very much flowered design
mathered in this way, arid is trimmed with three rows
of lave insertion a little distance apart, set in above
the hem all around the skirt to the narrow front
breadth, where they turn up to the waist line on
either side. A pretty effect is made by using
tucked white lawn, very fine in quality, for this
narrow front.

Another feature of the muslin gown is the wide

 

 

girdle belt made in various ways, one of which
is in rows of narrow lace insertion with beadings
between, through which any narrow ribbon may
be run, A baby waist above this, or one draped
in surplice fashion, with a chemisette and collar
of lace or tucked lawn, makes a quaint little bodice.
Helis of the new soft ribbons in pastel colors,
finished with 4 rosette bow at the back, are pretty
for the muslin gown, and usually they are ac-
companied by a rosertte bow at one side of the
bust. Sashes, too, are a great feature, and they
may be made of the soft silk mousseline. This is
used double, the edges being sewn together in a
seam, the scarfs turned and trimmed on the ends
with little frills of lace, and always the rosette
finish at the belt. Then there is the soft fiehu,
draped around, not over the shoulders, whichis a
decided element of the new thin gowns. The
idea of a fichu strikes the average woman 4s A
very simple one, easily managed, butas a matter
of fact a successful fichu is not such a trivial
thing. afterall. Everything depends on the way
it is draped, and it requires an artist to make it
any kind of a suecess. The fiehu with noends,
fastening at either side with a ribbon rosette, is
especially pretty with alow cut gown

While all the novelties for summer are very at
tractive, there is something to be said about the
thicker gowns, which are being made up forearly

travelling wear are made of homespuns and tweeds,
the light gray mixture being especially popular,

more people than would formerly, nowadays
