Columbia's Rowing Candidates Hard at

Work,

Bince the college examinations the work of
the Columbia's university crews has been
progressing. The most encouraging feature is
, the number of new men continually reporting
for practice. In the inst few weeks Morley,
Willlams, Denman and Van Hoovenberg of the
football team have taken seats in the boat, and
Boyeson, who rowed 2 in his freshman crew,
and Kernan, a former Harvard oarsman, have
also reported. Four squads have been formed
under the leadership of Capt, Mackay, l’aleoner,
Nash and Irvine, ai) of last year’s ‘Varsity.
and Dr. Peet is daily giving time to each, A
second set of rowing machines has been set
upin the crew room of the gymnasium so that
two eights can row at the same time.

The ‘Varsity squads are finishing out the

stroke with their arms, but nave fount dif.

eulty in starting offon the recover. The quick
} recovery with thearms has a tendency to vause
| a jerky movement. This will be remedied as
|
|

 

\
!

soon as possible. Dr. Pect’s further deserip-
tion is
“The stroke will be pulled through hard to
the very finish and the recover will not he so
snappy as it was last year, but amoother and
more deliberate, In short. there will be a
wheel-like motion, along bo ly swing, and the
oars willappear to sweep the water rather
} than jal atit,’
‘The complete schedule of rowing events for
Columbiahas been definitely determtned upon
as follows
May , University epring regatta, class crewse and
| departmental races; May 19, three mile race a
| the Naval Academy at Annapolis; May So,’
aud freshmen crews in the Harlem River Decoration
Day Regatta; Second ‘Varsity avainst University of
Pennsyivania, Cornell aud Harvard at Philadelphia,
, and finally the intercollegiate regatta against Wis-
consip, Syracuse, Cornell and Old Penn at Pough-

was all over it was found that the ..nickerbocker

"S" team, G. 8. Adams, W. HL Church, B.D.

D. Segur, were the winners,

the standing of the six eaders at the finish being

as follows

The Rnickerbockers took the silver tropby
and prizes were given the members of the three
leading teams. A. F. Freeman of the Park Club
took the first prize for the best individual trick
score with 28 plus, J. B. Elwell and J. E, Faber
of the New Yorks being tied for second prize with
24. Freeman, Gasten of Brooklyn and Tappan
ted for the prize for the greatest number of times
high score.

It should be interesting to those who believe
{n the poss bilities of improving 4 person's game
by study and assiduous team practice to know
that the captain of the winning team this year
had the lowest individual trick score in last year's
tournament, and it may also interest those who
believe in hard luck to learn that the lowest in-
dividual score this year was made by the captain
of the team holding the State champlonship.

Speaking of luck, there ia @ Chinese proverb
that says the gods cannot help 4 man that loses
opportunities. The New York team had their
opportunity to win the trophy this year by thetr
play on a single deal. Two members of the team,
at different tables, had the chance to pick up @
trick apiece against the Knickerbockers. It
was not enough for either of them to do ft; they
must both do {t, as the two tricks were essential.
The final score of the winning team was 17
matches to New York's 15';, and one of these
maiches to the credit of the Knickerbockers was
that which they won from New York by 4 single
trick. Early in the tournament they got four
tricks from New York on a aingle deal, but the
New Yorks had pulled this down to two before
the last round In the final round New York
got back another trick and had the chance to
get two more, which would have made their score
16', matches to Knickerbocker's 16. The result
of the whole tournament really turned on the
play of this one deal, which was No. 4. Z sat|
West and turned the nine of hearts. Here is the
way it went when New York was N. and S, Enick-

the Bath coup, feeling certain of making the clubs

Trick 7. ‘The result of the tournament now

because A will get two rounds of trumps at once
and then fores with his clubs, reenter with the
last trump and make three club tricks, secur
ten tricks on the deal, instead of six, which with
the seore actually made at the other table would
show a gain of five tricks on the deal for New |
Yorn, when only three were wanted to get the
championship

But Z seems to have suspected that there was 4
nigger in the woodpile somewhere, He thought
the thing over a little and concluded that the six
of trumps which his partner put up on the third
round of clubs was probably the best he has, so
the ace must be held up by one of bis adversaries. |
As there is not much use holding up an ace un
less it is accompanied by the jack, Z feels cer

the major tenace if he went on, #0 he shifts, a la
Ward, and goes up to B's apparent weakness

A—B get twelve tricks

 

Trick 1. The New Yorks use the number show
ing leads in trumps and echo to show four when
they have two honors

‘Tricks 4 and 5. A goes right along and pulls
all the trumps and then leads the longest suit
he has in which he hasa sure trick, He thought
it would be too much of a shot to risk the spaces,
even after Y's discards

Trick 6 Bis not vet converted to the lead of
the king from KJ 10, and does not wani to lead
6 low card up to Y's discards, but prefers to give
his partnera possible finesse against him. As
goon asthe Jack wins A can read his partner for
the king, as with both king and queen Z would
cover, and B would notlead the jack from QJ 10.

Trick 8 Another interior lead, in the sult which
A does not want returned to him, but in which he
hopes B may havea trick, and so getin to give
A a discard of his losing club

Trick 11. A having led the seven originally
and now falling to the four, Y thinks the king is
with B and so he puts up his ace at once.

The only other team that got twelve on this
hand were the New York 13, But they played it

in a very different way to get that result

   

~A—B get twelve tricks,

Trick 1, Any player would lead
from such an all round hand

the trumps
especially as the
suits are noneof them good ones to open

Trick 3. These players do not show number
in trumps nor echo in them, so B holds up the
deuce, in order that his partner may be able to
place that card as still in his hand

Trick 4. A does not draw the last trump until
he finds out whatis against him in the plain suits
With three trumps between himself and hia part
ner he is not afraid to lead his shortest sult

Trick 6 B goss back with one of the second
and third best spades so as to establish the suit
He knows his partner is leading short, Y having
discarded two oa On this trick Y lets go
another diamond, thinking his partner may have
have the best spade, and he covering the jack
with the fourchetts. queen and ten

Trick 7
shows by his original discard to be his best

Trick & As A discards aclub, it looks to Bas if
he was long and strong in diamonds, so he goes
back with one

Trick ® Itis obvious to A that ff Y holds both
ace and jack of diamonds they must make, no
matter what A plays) The ace cannot be with
Z or he would have won the queen
chance is that the ace is alone on his left, so he
passes, although the trick is already Z's

Trick 10° 18 jumps at this chance to make his
singly guarded king and to lead the trump through
Z. He dare not lead another dlamond for fear A
held both king and jack, which would allow Z
to save his trump.

Here is a rather interesting deal from the match
between Balumore and Boston for the A.W. I

Trick 2. The trump lead from Y's hand is prac

tically forced, but Z should have been able to count
his partner for four trumps exactly, as the Hoston
avers show number A,dropping the ten and not
peing able to win theking can have but two trumps
possibly only one, as Y should held @n honor, so
there must be at least four trumps in is hand
over Y As Z has nothing in platn suits which
will help Y's game. he should have switched,
refusing to go back with the trump and leading
his spade suit instead. This will save just three
tricks on the deal, as will be seen if the cards are
laid out and the hand played in that way

Trick 3. As Z is marked with the deuce alone,
{tis useless for Y to cover the jack with the queen
losing it, and making the nine and eight good
against him in Bs hand. Even by placing the

1 lead with B it is not possible for Y to make the

king of diamonds, because B will not open that
auif, but will return his partner's clubs, and the
play will go just as it does, A switching to dia-
monds at trick 6

Cricketers Preparing for the Coming
Season,
The annual meeting of the Metropolitan

District Cricket League will be held to-mor-

row night, when officers will be elected anda
general plan of campaign for the year laid
down, The probabilities are that there will
still be aix clubscompeting for the champion-
ship. Staten Island has reorganized under
the nameof the Livingston Field Club, and
the Montelair A.C. has made app! cation to be
admitted to the League to fill the vacancy
caused by the withdrawal ofthe Newarks, In

addition to the regular schedule of champion-
ah matches which will be played by the
clubs comprising the Metropolitan League and
the New York Cricket) Association, these two
organizations Will meet during the season in
@b all-day contest, Home-eand-home matches
wii be played with @ representative team of
Philadelphia, and many out-of-town clube will
be encountered both here and away,

The fact that the groundat Livingston will be
used forcricket this year is gratifving to all
lovers of the game, It is associated with so
many historic games that everyone who takes
an interest in cricket hates to see it go. Ir
seems a pity toat the Steten Island clip ahould
go under and that no means can be found for
reviving it agin onasound financial basis
There are a sufficient number ot wealthy Eng-
lipthinen in New York tosupport aclub of this
kind, and if means could be found to arouse
their apathy there is iittle doubt if such a
mevement would be suecessful

CANDIDATES FOR TRACK AND DIA-
MOND BOOMING THINGS AT
PRINCETON,

Encouraging Outlook for Another Win-
ning Baseball Team Clark for Head
Coach and Willis to Look After the
Pitchers -Track Men and Their Prospects

Princeton, March 3,-Activity in spring
athletics at Princeton University began Inst
week when the candidates for the baseball and
track toam up preliminary tratoing.
With els members of last year's champlonship
nine still in college there is every reagon to
believe thatthe prospects for turning out an-
other winhing team are bright. The presence
ofthe veteran battery, Hillebrand and Kafer,
giveatothe Tigers an advantage over either
Harvard or Yale at the outset. The othermen
whoare ready to don their uniforms again are
‘ireep, LOZ, who played first base in the
series against Ya‘e last season; Chapman, also
& sophomore, Who shared honors with hia
Classmate on the initial bag; Hutchinson, third
baseman antl cuarter back on the football
teum, and Watkins, centre flelder. Avcopt-
ably fll the positions left vacant by the gradu-
ation of Suter and Harrison in the outfleld,
aud Bedford and MeGitbon in the infleld, will
beadiMenit task, but there is a wealth of sub-
stitute material to draw upon

For Bedford's piace at second base the moat
likely man in view is Steinwender, a sopho-
more, He made an enviable record on the big
during the early part of last season, but was
compelled on account of a wrenchel knee to
retira before the rave for "Varsity honors had
fairly begun, However, Duncan, the football
player, and Burke, who played the position on
the ‘07 team, will not allow him to loaf.

stop kept the coaches at their wits end last
year, and it is probable that the same place
will demand a large share of their attention

on the freshman team last year, is hardly con-
sidered fast enough to wear a ‘Varsity suit.
Hutchings, who was at third base until he was
crowded to the sidelines by Hutchinson, may
be tried, but many look to Purnell), a freshman
from the Princeton preparatory school, for a
solution of the probiem,

Judging from his work in the minor games
in I8h!!, Meier, 1902, will come in for serious
consideration this year. He got the call over
the other candidates for first bise last spring,
but was compelled to quit just before the con-
test with Harvard on account of a protest en-
tered by Yale, which was based on the one

year residence rale, He has handed in his
nameas a candidate for tho first bag, and with
