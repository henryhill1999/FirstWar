WHEREWILD PIGEON WENT

SHE BIRD IN MIGHTY FLOCKS IN
WHE FAR, VAR SOUTH,

Mystery of lis Sudden Disappearance From
This Continsat Seems to Have Been
Cleared at Last-It Has Pound a New
Home tn South America Where Pood
ke Plenty and Sportsmen Are Pew,

Decarikeyp, Wis, Marel 1 -For
years past persons in this part of the West have
deen investigating the disappearance of the wild
pigeon, or “passenger pigeon which used to
{nhabit the United States in countless millions
and disappeared even more suddenly and
completely than the buffalo There was an
@pparent parallel between the fates of these two
species of game, butit was only apparent. ‘The
buffalo has gone, never to return. Inthe Yellow
stone National Park, and ta circuses here and
there are scattered specimens of the bison, That
js all. But the wild pigeon, while it has beeu
swept outof this country asif'a giant storm from
the north had driven it forth, sill exists It
seems to have been definitely established within
the year that the myriads which used to muhe
dark our heavens are now below the equator
on the western slope of the Andes, flying seuth
when the summer comes and north when the
winter comes, eXactly revermng their former
migration when with us. As if ity experience
with menin this country had taught it to beware
of them, it seems to be inhabiting only the most
gecluded regions of the Andes, finding in isolated
Peruvians and Chilians such men as they need
not fear, since there is little or no sporkin them,
There, finding their food amid the giaut timber
which grows just below the snow Iine, unhar-
vied by human or other foes, they are multiply-
{ng into their old millions, subject to decimation
only by disease anid by the superfluiiy of their
own numbers,

Tt has been said that the wild pigeon was the
ewiftest thing that ever cleft American air, but
this isa mistake. For individual speed the teal
held, and still holds, the record. There is noth
fog which cymes near it in velocity ‘The wild
Pigeon, was, however, the swiftest thing which
flew in large flocks, or rather, to be exact, large
flocks of wild pigeons made better time than
large flocks of any other fowls or birds. ‘The

swiftly, steadily, like a buzzing cloud they darted

aight of 1,200 feet. ‘They seemed to find at

into the distance. There came down on him
afaintshimmering murmur, a sort of keen tremor
of sound made by the tens of thousands of pul-

steadiness, the persistence of its flight was not
less remarkable than its velocity, As certain
forms of wandering termites are not to be turned

This obstinacy of direction was one of the
@trangest things in nature, and no man could
ask for a more absorbing sight than 4 pigeon
flight harried by a dozen hawks and falcons,
The birds of prey met the cacoming horde. They
never presumed to clase it. Hovering high,
they waited until the vanguard had passed under
them, then struck down at the practically solid
mass beneath, soaring upward immediately with
dead victims in their talons Often, in seeming
wantonness, they would strike againand again
with beak and claw and dead birds would come
sifting lamely down out of the mass in dozens
Bronze and gray feathers floated upon the wind
The man below could know what was happening
only by the falling bodies and feathers. How-
ever severe the attack, the hurtling mass of birds
did not vary its formation or check its speed,
It seemed unconscious of tbe murder being dove
In that tremendous throng individuals were of
no moment, nor was any account taken of them.
In only a4 little while the hawks would be left
far behind, each with its talons gorged. ‘They
were able to do much execution when a killing
fit was on them, because th fre themselves

Pigeons was somelimes more than a mile long.

The ability of this bird to die, its apparent
willingness to die and the Jack of caution or in
terest itshowed when assailed were potless strange
than ita ability to devour space. Often when
roosting the swarms which loaded the trees would
be attacked by owls, ‘They made no effort to
fy outinto the dark. They simply clung to the |
y

ranches while the owls hovered near and struck
their bills into them, nor did any amount of such

unishment ever cause them to change their
Reostin places. Manyeof them fell during the
Night, borne down and disabled by the weight
of the comrades above them, and underneath
them always were foxes, wolves, minks, wild
cats, raccoons and such things ready for the sur

The bird's unchangeable determination to sleep
in the company of its fellows was most fatal to
ft. It was the most gregarious of feathered things.
Companionship of its kind was as necessary

of capturing a half- grown pigeon and shutung
it in a cage, and invanably it has lived only a
few days It did not die of bed water, bad air
or bad food, Not even confinement. killed at

stead of being a chimera of the popular imag.
pation, as scentfic men Nave generally been
vnelined to regard 1, the kissing bug os real, aod
not only harinful but even dangerous under cer

iinet Insects as coming under the general head
of kissing bugs and believes that these insects
are respousible for the reports of serious bites
in 1800 and also that in past years they may
have been the source of many reported spider
bites of serious nature
‘The kissing bug craze, as Mr. Howard calls it,
originated inthe city of Washington in June, 1899,
and through the newspapers spread over almost
the entire country resulting in “one of the most
interesting cases of widespread popular alarm
arising from a comparatively ins.ga.ficant cause
which has occurred in the present scientific and
matter-of fact century.” ‘Throughout the coun
iry persons who were bitten by any form of irr.
fant insect straightway rushed to the nearest
newspaper office or to any sc.entifie man of ther
acquaintance bearing with them whatever fori
of insect Life happened to be about at the time
they suffered the bite, and confident that the
captive was the only true and original kissing

Of all these Mr. Howard regards but three
Fastern species as hav.ng any rpht to the au
thorship of the kissing bug scare. Both have
been captured cn the very act of bing buman
beings and those same humans have subsequently
swelled up to varying extents. So the ind.et
ment is considered as complete and Mr. Howard
says that the original cases of bite in the lemer-

gency Hospital in Washington, which started
the newspaper stories, were undoubtedly tne
work of one or the other or both of these bugs
‘The first of these he describes under the name
of Reducius or Opsivaetes personatus, known
in Europe whence it comes as the cannibal bug,
a name which suggests that it had a bad record
before it came over. This insect is about three
quarters of an inch in length and fooks not un
like the comimon squash bug familiar to all men
who have ever done any gardening. The spectes
Reduvius is widespread, being found in Europe,
Asis, the northern part of Africa, Australia,
and this country. The date of its introduction
into this country is not known but it is surmised
that .t was imported soon after the coming of the
bedbug upon which it preys. Ro personatus
has been taken in Virginia, Distriet of Columbia,
Maryland, New York, Ohio, and lowa. [t is
furnished with a long beak or rostrum whieh
it thrusts into its prey, and it is this instrument
with which the poisonous bite is inflicted The
bite is deseribed as being more painful than the
sting of a bee, Under the name of KR. pungens
Le Conte describes an insect probably identical
with Ro personatus which he found in Georgia

This species, he says, “is remarkable for the
intense pain caused by its bite I do pot know
whether it ever willingly plunges its rostrum
into any person, but when caught or unekill
fully handled it always stings. In this case
the pain is almost equal to that of the bite of a
snake aod the awelllag and irritation which re
sult from it will sometumes last for a week. In
very weak and irritable constitutions it may even
prove fatal

When the kissing bug made ity appearance
scientists identified it as Melanolestes picipes
al first, untildetailsfrom many parts of the coun
try showed that this species alone could not be
held responsible forall the injuries This species
towether with M. abdominalis which is very much
like it, and possibly identical, is common. all
through the Atlantic coast States and in the
West and South These insects, which are
winged, live under logs and flat stones and run
swiftly when surprised. [t was first noted as
yoisonous by Glover in 1875 Dr Shaffer of
Revkuls In, reporia that in 1805) four spect
mens flew in at his window one evening vehile
he was sridng and buzzed about his light) ‘This
proves that the Melanolestes is a night flyer and
it is noteworthy that most of the bites reported
oceurred in the evening A case of bite by M
picipes iS reported from Cincinnati, the patient's
hand swellitug greatly and with great pain An
other case, the person being bitten upon the cheel,
is reported as causing great swelling but litte
pain Two other eases are thus reported by
Mr. Howard

“In the third case, occurring at Holland, S. ¢
the symptoms were more serious The patient
was bitten pon the end of the middle finger, and
stated that the first paroxysm of pain was about
like that resulting from a hornet or a bee sting
but almost tinmediately it grew ten times more
painful and a feeling of Weakness followed with
vomiing ‘The pain was fell to shoot up the
arm to the under jaw, and the sickness lasted
for a number of days \ fourth case, at Fort
Bliss, ‘Tex. 18 interesting as having occurred
in bed Phe patient was bitien on the band with
very painful results and bad swelling

Regarding the third species found in the bast,
Corsicus subcoleoptratis, Mr Howard is. doubt
ful whether ft rightfully belongs to the category
of kissing bugs. He was bitien bs one in Greene
vounty, NOY, Which he interrupted in its career,
but though the pain of the bite was sharp there
was no apparent poison it in nor did the bitten
hand swell

Rasahus bguttates, the weespotted corsair

as itis commonly called in the Southern States |

where it is found, is well outhenticated as the
inflietor of a number of called kissing bug
bites. Lintner says that this species is) very
fond of human blood bul prefers to get it secor
hand, for which reasen i! preva upon bedbugs,
like Reduvius personatus which it ronmbten
in appearance. Dr. Davidson, who has made

 

 

————

 

a atudy of the poisonous insects of California,
believes that almost all the cases of so-called
spider bites in that State are produced by this
creature, He deseribes the symptoms following
the bite as follows

"Next day the injured part shows a local cellu
litis with a central dark spot; around this spot
there frequently appears 4 bulbous vesicle about
the sive of a tencent piece and Ailed with a dark
grumous fluid; a smail ulcer forms underneath
the vesicle, the necrotic area being generally
limited to the central part, while the surrounding
tissues are more of less swollen and somewhat
painful. In oa few days, with rest and proper
care, the swelling subsides, and in a week all
traces of the cellulitis are usually gone. In some
of the cases no vesicle forms #t the point of injury,
the formation probably depenaiing on the con.
stitutional vitality of the individual or the amount
of poison introduced,” ;

The seple symptoms observed are aseribed
by Dr. Davidson not to any specific poison se
creted by the insect but to fortultous putrefactive

erms adhering to the knife like proboscis, It
is interesting wo note that mosquito and spider
bites, and even the bite of the ordinary house tly,
have been known to be followed by very serious
symptoms and even by death due to poisoning
from this cause, ARasahus thorvcicus is found
in Arizona and Mexico, and Mr. Howard has been
bitten by this species, with disagreeable etfects

Of all the bloodthirsty insects found in this
nation the most ferocious and the best feared is
the blood-sucking conenose, Conorhinus san
guisuga, which is coufined to the South and West,
and is well known to the inhabitants of those parts
of the country. There are several variations
of this species, but they are all very closely allied.
The head of the insect is furnished with # sort
of dagger, projecting outward and downward
from the head, which it plunges though the skin
of any living creature upon which it may find itself

reparatory to sucking its blood, for this insect
sa blood drinker at first hand and does not,
like the Rasahus, murder and despoil the robber.
In his notes upon the blood sucking cone nose
Le Conte says: a ,

“This insect * * * inflicts a most painful
wound, It is remarkable also for sucking the
blood of mammals, particularly of children, 1
have known its bite followed by very serious con
sequences, the patient not recovering from. its
effects for nearly a. year. ‘The many relations
which we have of spider bites frequendy proving
fatal have no doubt arisen from the sings of these
insects or others of the same genera When the
disease called spider bite is not an anthrax or car
buncle, it is undoubtedly occasioned by the bite
of an insect, by no means, however, of a spider.
Among the many species of Araneidas which we
have in the United States, I have never seen one
capable of inflicting the slightest wound.”

From the almost uniform symptoms noted ig
cases of bite of this inseet Marlatt, who has inves-
tigated it, believes that there is a specific poison
Mr. Howard, however, maintains that very serous
results from the bite are always caused by the
introduction fortuitously of extraneous poser
germs, and cites the observations of Lembert,
who has found the Cornorhinus of the Pacific
coast feeding upon earron. Prof. ‘Tuomey notes
the case of a woman in Arizona, who after being
bitten by a conenosed blood sucker, broke out
all over her body with red welts, although she
was bitten but once and then on the shoulder,
\ friend of Mr. Howard's was bitten on the lip,
the spot supposed to be chiefly ebosen by the kiss
ing bug, and he reports a burning pain, almost
intolerable fiching. and much yeelling, which
latter symptom lasted several days, His brother
was bitten at the same time on the legs and arm,
and his symptoms were the same. Mr. Howard
does not deny that the Conorhinus has a specific
poison of tts own, but merely that its own poison
cannot be held responsible for such serious symp
toms as were observed in the case of the Anzona
woman, In conclusion the writer of the pam
phlet says

"More need hardly be said specifically concern
ing these biting bugs. ‘The writer's conclusions
are that the bite of any one of them may be, and
frequently has been, mistaken for a spider bite
and that nearly all reported spider bite cases
have had in reality, this cause; that the so-called
kissing bug scate has been based upon certain
undoubted cases of the bite of one or the other of
them, but thatother bites, including mosquitos
with hysterical and nervous symptoms troduced
by the newspaper accounts, have aided in the
eneral alarm. The case of Miss Larson, who
iad in August, 1405, as the result of a mosquito
bite, at Mystic, Conn. is an instance which goes
to show that no mysterious new insect need be
looked for to explain occasional remarkable cases
One good eault of the kissing bug excitement
may be in the end to relieve spiders from much
unnecessary discredit.”

 

JOHNNY |RESUMES HIS MARCH,

An Old Tune Gets a Friendly Welcome in
Topical Song Service,

One of the most§popular of the Civil War songs
which survived by many vears the close of hos
tilities was “When Johnny Comes Marching
Home,” which described the hearty welcome
that awalted the Union soldier on‘his return home
He was represented as returning, laden with
honors and laurels, and inJa frame of mind so
cheerful that “stone blind” drinking would be
appropriate, Many years have elapsed since
this stirring composition§enjoyed its largest popu
larity, the significance of the theme having passed
in the effacement of questions growing out of
the Civil War, But it appears} to have occurred
to some one to utilize (as is often done in the case
of popular airs) the tune of the old favorite, setting
it, with some variations to new words, and it has
reappeared as “A Little Bit Off the Top

How far the renewed acceptance is due to the
familiarity of the tune and how far, or how little,
to the arrangement of the words is a question
which only their perusal can determine. The
first verse tells the story of Brown, who invited
some friends to dinner and who treated them in
such royal fashion that one of them forgot,
for the moment, the conventional requirements
of the occasion when a waiter brought into the
diningroom a pudding of “wondrous size” So
delighted was this guest with the aspect of the

pudding that, though a leader of society, “he
completely fost his enquette and yelled out to the
host.”

Carvea little bit off the top for me, for me,

Just alittle bit off the top for me, for me;

Saw meotfa yardortwo, I'1l tell you when to stop,
All T wantisa little bit off the top!

It is a peculiarity of popular songs that if the
chorus is such as to please an audience one fur
nishes one definite idea which is easily compre-
prehensible, various verses may be tacked on
to the first ones especially on such familiar themes
as the traditional mother in law, the irate father,
the arrogant janitor and the high theatre hat
As to the janitor, an important personage in the
contem porary lifeof New York, this is the limping
verse and chorus

If vou liveinan uptown flat, you must realize where
you're at,
For there the janitor is the only thing;
T have lived in one just ayear, butitis always in
dread and fear,
For I have got to patronize the King
This morning when the grocery man broughtin the
breakfast things
I heard lis Highness to his wifey call;
Just pass the can of milk to me, don't putit on the

dummy till
Tuet all that’s a-coming in the hall!
CHORVS:
Skim alittle bit off the top for me, for me
Scoop a little bit of the top for me, for me
Take off all the cream, my dear, don't leave

drop,
All | wantig a Jittle bit of the top!’

a single

The rhythm of popular songs is open very
enerally to such mechanical objections as arise
Foor too many “feet” in one line and two few
“feet in another, but when, as in this case, the
character of the music is relied upon to carry
the song along, such minor blemishes are con
sidered of less account than they would be ata
literary convention, This explanation is neces
sary, perhaps. for a thoroughly clear apprecia-
tion of this concluding verse of the soug "A Lit
the Bit OM the Top’ as sung originally, though
since then numerous verses have been taken
added

If you Want to enjoy a show, tipon Broadway's the
place to go,
For there you'll see the proper kind of play,
Tragic, burlesque or comedy, every one agrees with
me
Aud that’s the reason why Talwaya pay
T went to one the other night and gave up iny little
two
In front of me there sat a lady fair
Her headpiece was three yards high, Teouldn't see
the staye at all,
So I was forced to mournfully declare;
CHORUS,
Take a littie bit off the top for me, for me;
Chopa littl bit off the top for me, for me
Cut away a yard ortwo orelse I'll call a cop,
All | wautis a little bit off the top

The duration in popularity of a song does not
in all cases depend either upon iis intrinsie merit
asa musical Composition or in the word arrange
ment, but the question of opportuneness bas
much te do with the matter and just now war
songs as well as war themes are favorably con
sidered by New York audiences

lutely no difference. They are the same in size |
the same in shape and the same in color, not to \
speak of the identity of their flavor, which is |
the most important thing of all As with the |
Chesapeake terrapin, there are differences in the
individuals of the tribe, some being of better flesh |
and taste than others, but the expert does not |
live who can distinguish a Corpus Christi “count
from a Chesapeake “count’ if they be prepared |
in the same way and with equal skill, Dealers |
in terrapin) in some parts of the eountry have
long been acquainted with this fact, and the
Northern epicure whe pays 360 4 dozen for Chesa
peake terrapin often gets Gulf terrapin which
cost his dealer, laid down in Moston or New York,
less than $1 each, As for the numbers of them,
there js no comparison at all, The terrapin in
dustry in Maryland has long been decadent
The enormous prices paid for the product have
resulted in almost as rapid a diminution of the
crustacean as of ihe buffalo. The man who
gets a living from terrapin in Maryland earns
it, ‘The tidbits are, on the other hand, plentiful
along all the western Texas coast, and the ease |
with which they are caught and their lack of
reputation with gourmands has put down their |
prices untilthey would be within the reach of any
poor man if it were not for the fact that the bess
of them are rushed to market and sold as
Marylanders

Here and there along the coast rivers debouch
It is in the neighborhood of the mouths of these
streams that the terrapin are most plentiful. They
hang about the outrushing water for the food
that it brings down and itis no trouble at all te |
catch then. I ishing for them is not an organized |
industry here. ‘They are taken while things of
more importance are being looked for “ven |
under this condition thousands of them are brought |
to “Corpus” each season and hurried north. That |
is to say, the “counts,” or the best of them are
hurried north. The others are cut up and put
into cans. While terrapin fishing is not a reeog-
nized ‘Texas industry, turtle fishing is. It is
an ee the great sea turtle that the terrapin |
is most often taken. ‘The nets are made of strong
cords, but the meshes are not large. They are
of small size. for the reason that if a sea-turtle
weighing 500 pounds, once gets his head through

@ purchase for his huge clawed feet, it is good by
to the net, Often in making a drag no sea-turtle
is bagged, but in the folds of the twines will be
from a dozen to twenty tive terrapin, struggling
frantically and endeavoring to foree their way
through the hemp gratings that hem them in

Phe debouchments of the river are also favorite
feeding places for the turtles. There is a fleet |
of no Jess than twenty boats in Corpus Christi
whose owners make @ good living pursuing turtles

ingly large. In addition to these, there is a fleet, |
large or small, in every Gulf town between the
mouth of the Bravos and Brownsville, and they
are at work most of the year round. In this part |
of the State the fishetmen are almost) wholly
Greeks A colony of these people came to the |

Texas coast many years ago and, as they were
all natives of the Ionian Isles and used to sea

and own pleasant homes looking seaward over |

The outfit needed by the terrapin and turtle
fisher in not large por expensive. tle wants |
a couple of heavy neis, a small catboat and a |
partner or two to assist him. Furnished with the
plainest of provisions, he sets sail down the coast
and in 4 day or so bas reached the mouth of some
river which he is used to frequenting. There, |
on the inner side of @ small island, which stands |
not more than a yard higher than high tide, the |
men anchor and begin the dragging of the net, |
having first set it by the use of a small boat It)
is in reality seining on a large seale. The sea
turde, if hooked on the end of a line, as sometimes
happens, will give five men all they wish to do
in landing him, but once thoroughly enmeshed, |
wrapped round and about by the cords, tt loses |

POLITICAL SITUATION IN IOWA,

Adoption of the Bienntal Election Amend-
ment Likely—Govy, Shaw's Strength,
Drs Mores, Ia, Mar. 2. Towa will vote
this fall upon the proposition to amend the Consti
tution so as to have biennial elections for all State,
township officers, It is
almost certain to be adopted because the people

| are tired of the political agitation that has been

going on in Jowa, and they are determined to
join the other States that have adopted the policy
of biennial elections

If this amendment {is adopted there will be
no State election In 1901, and the State, county,
distriet and township officers whose terms would
expire on Dec, 31, 1901, and whose successors
would otherwise be elected at the general election
in 1901, will have their terms extended one year.
This will include the Governor, Lieutenant-Goy
ernor, members of the Legislature and many
other State and county officers. The sessions
of the Legislature will be changed from the even
numbered years to the odd numbered years, but
a session will be held in 1902. The Legislature
which meets at that time will be composed of
the men constituting the present General Assembly
who will have had their terms extended one year
Then another session will be held a year later
under the new arrangement

One of the effects of the recent Senatorial fight
in lowa has been to encourage the movement
for the clection of Umited States Senators by the
people A resolution asking the lowa members
of Congress to submit an amendment to the Fed
eral Constitution to this effect has passed the
House and will soon be favorably reported in the

Senate, where it will undoubtedly pass. This
isnota part of the movement originated in Penn
sylvania but eriginated in lowa, The fight
between Senator Gear and National Committee
man Cumming for the Senatorial nomination
lasted the better part of a vear, and it was the
first consideraiion tn the nomination of a ma
ority of the Republican) meinbers, It had a

 

} demoralizing influence upon the make up of the

General Assembly In close districts it resulted
in the defeat of Republican nominees For
these reasons many Republicans desire to relieve
the Legislature of the burden of choosing United
States Senators

The tight for the control of the next Republican
Siate Convention is already on. Each faction
has a candidate for State Treasurer and will
strain every nerve to nominate him. Other off
ces will be brought into the fight The Gear
organization, the present State machine, is in
excellent working order and is almost certain
to win al every point The opposing. faetion
at present is litte more than an organized protest
against the control of the State by the large ma
jority that is now lined up under the Gear banner

There has been some gossip about Gov, Shaw
as a Vice Presidential possibility, but it may be
stated authoritatively that he would not seriously
consider such a nomination, Under the proposed
Constitutional amendment providing for bien
nial elections, he will have three years to serve
as Governor, lle would like to go to the United
States Senate from lowa but in the recent eon
test he was forGear tis friends have all advised

The Brighton Beach meeting is too long to be

With Spencer, Clawson and MeCue starting the
meeting at the head of wins and percentage,
little Odom finished ihe first half of the meeting
with the maximum number of wins to his eredit,
these being 16 in 53 mounts, coming as follows,
the wins showing the odds, the losses being marked

in the last three races al Bon shot lost, followed
by a l- 7 win and a following loss, which was
the race in which Odom was injured. In thia
case J. BK. Madden's John Fritz fell in the first
race July 21, having started at 6 Lt and being
sixth when he fell. The average odds were 1 4,
the proportion ef the wins to losses 40 per cent
for the half meeting, the losses ranging from 1-8
on to 6001, on a high average which helped
capital, Odom's maximum run of consecutive
Joskes was nine, two overhanging from the pre:
vious meeting Another nine losses came after
his five wins later on

MeCue soll retained his good average, rank-

SO mounts of the jockey Seven heing the max-
imum run of consecutive losses, the cumulative
risk to win $5 a race was sinall, and the losing
odds were fairly good

O'Leary, who turned in 9 wins at Sheepshead
in 87 mounts, kept along at the Beach and had
4 wins in 59 races, which, although only 16 per
cent, was sufficient to bring him into third place
as to number of wins, which came as follows:

while the losses averaged 100-1. ‘The fact must
not be overlooked that the initial run of losses,
with a bang overofl 4 fromAhe preceeding meeting,
was 11, which required a cumulative bet capital
of 8465 to win the 85 each race and the losses

Turner, the leading percentage boy, had &
wins in 49 raves, this being an unusually spotty
and heart breaking record, as follows: 0, 6, 0,

of course, large, about @--2, the cumulative bet
in the long series of losses calling for 8670 to win
ont) The losses ran from 2--Yte 50-1

Spencer showed 8 wins, but had no mount for
15 consecutive races, Thus the story is continued
without change other than the regular variation,
fs it must be termed, and the second half of this
perplexing meeting furnished the shakeup of
the year, as indeed it does in all statistics and
systems, in almost any given year. Why, isa

20 per cent, Spencer at 25 per cent, Maher at
22 per cent., McCue at 20 per cent, Odom at 18
per cent, O Leary at 17 per cent. and Clawson,
the Morris Park premier, at ll per cent) What
happens’? One of the two leaders manages to
wet fifth, but the other does not appear in the
winning list, O Leary being the only other boy
to make a showing. This is explained by the
exodus to Saratoga to open ie meeting there on
duly 26. Soe, at once, the gross winning record
at this track shifts to Maher with 19 wins in 438
mounts, Mitchell with 16 wins in 58 mounts,
Dupee with 7 wins in 4) mounts, and Doggett
