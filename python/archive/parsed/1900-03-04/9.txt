surdity of Ever Giving Up the Is

Ysanvusa, Isla de Negros, PL, Jan 9
Yesterday | went marketing and bought half a
doten ben's exes “Cegloogs” the natives call
them. They cost two dukkos each Eight duk

os make an American nickel T don't know
fl spell “dukko” right Well, at suppertime I
took my “eegloogs” to the detachment cook and
asked him to fry them

“Vall,” he said, “you vas a damned nuisance
but I fries him this time, Which side mitdereggs
do you want fried first”

1 laughed

Now, the Hull bill made “non-coma” of all the
Puteh cooks Men tiave been hnown to talk bas kk
to corps commanders and escape with their lives
But the man who laughs at a non-commissioned
Duteh cook had better ask fora trausfer, Starva-

In a recent letter I said that the talk about self
government for these Filipines was all tommyrot
Well, they've tried it right here on Negros, and |
tommyrot itis There isn'ta primary school in
America that isn't better fitted for self government
than these peopla Why, give a local presidentia ,
free rein and he'd execute half the inhabitants of |
his village ina week. And steal! Give a native
the job of tax-gatherer and a squad of soldiers
to back him and he'd own the island ina month

To illustrate: All our rations are brought up |
the river in canoes from Binaibagan When |
word came that our rations were at Hinalbagan

our detachment commander used to send for the
presidentia, a full-blooded Filipino, give bim a
round sum of money, and tell bin to hire boats
and boatmen to bring up the rations ‘| wice in
euccession the rations arrived all right ‘The
third time no boats or boatinen were forthcoming
After a couple of days’ delay the presidentia an
nounced that the boats were all busy and sup-
plied caribou-carts instead. ‘Twice the rations
were brought up in this way, and then no mors
caribou-carts could be secured
Then the detachment commander thought it
time to investigata. The presidentia had paid
neither the canoe men nor cartmen one red dukko.
He had calmly pockets! the coin, and told the |
native toilers that “the Americanos had no mas
dinero.” According to him, your Uncle Samuel
had “gone broke,” and couldn't pay his drayage.
And when that presidentia was confronted with
the evidence in the case, he just lifted his ere
brows, shrugged bis shuulders and suggested that,
as the canoe men and cartmen all had remote rela
tions with the Papiecios, it would be a good idea
io execute them in a batch Al Espagnol ‘That |
presidentia was fairly and squarely elected by a
wpular vote, and would be reelected toemorrow

The American soldiers in the Philippines are

the fact that President McKinley has the veto
