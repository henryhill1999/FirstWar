BOND PROFITS FOR BANKS.

Why the Country Demand for the Bonds Te

So Strenuons,

Why Government bond prices have ad-
vanced sharply recently is explained by the
showing made tn a circular addressed to the
national banks by Harvey Fisk & Sone. This
eircular says regarding the pending currepey
bill:

“Among ita other attractive features the bill
provides for the issue of 2 per cent. W-year
gold bonas, the reduction of one-half per
@ent. perannum in the tax on elrculation where
secured by these borda, the issue of notes to
the full face value ofthe bona deposited and
the right to increase ejreulation At any time, by
the repeal of the restriction which has heroto-
fore prevented its increase unt'| theexplration
of six months from the last decrease to cir-
¢@ulation.

“Many banks have already increased thelr
holdings of the old ivsues which are to be re-
fanded into the new 2 per cents, and, while
there has been a material advanoein the prices
of all Government bonds during the Inst faw
days, they are atill obtalnable at prices making

the new 24 very attractive asa basis for circu. |

lation. At present prices every dollar Invested
fn circulation will realize over 20 per vent. per
annum. In noother way can such rates of in-
terest, absolutely free from risk, be secured;
and {t behooves the banks toact promptly in
order to secure the full advantages of the
transaction.” }

the elreuiar goes on to explain thatan in-
vestment of $104,000 in $100,000 of the bouds
a really an investment of $8,000 only, since

100,000 of circulation can be taken out
againat the bonds. The 20 percent, profit is
on the $6,000, With the outstanding 3 per
cent. bonds at 111.08, the ds, of 1007 at 117 80,

of the 2e, will be 108, At ioe, the profit on elr-
culation would be 21.55 per event a year with

The profit from the 2s at 107 would be 18.21

money at 5 percent, Ih percent. ‘There were
predictions in Wall Street yesterday thatthe

laaac N. Seligman has written 4 letter to Bea-
etary Giage regarding wha’ he thinks Isa flaw
n the eurreney bill, Hesays that under sec-
tion 2 of the bill, after nan issue of bonds to re-
plenish the reaerve fund, notes that had been
redeemed throveh the action of this fund
would have to he turned into the general fund
of the Treasury in case the bond. sale in-
creased the reserve fund to ubove the maxi-
youm of $150.000,000 defined In the section.
The notes so withdrawn wold be avaliable to
any of the general purposes of the Cov-
ernment.

ri Should at any future time,” say® Mr. Selig-
man, “the revenue ofthe country fall short of
ite requirements, these legal tenders would
certainly in one form oranother, be pald out,
and we wonld havea repetition of the perni-+
cloua endieas chain that broneht such dia-
astrous effects under the last Cleveland ad-
ministration.”

Mr Seligman says he wants to see the bill
ebanged so na to retain such notes in the ous.
tody ofthe Bureau of Issue and Redemption,
It was, however, pointed. out in Wall Btrect
yesterday that Senator Alirich, in explaining

the amendments made ty the Conference

ecretary of the Treasury shonlt not use the
money raised by the enle of bonds for the pay-
ment of the curent expenses of the Govern-

ent, the purpose being to destroy any posal.
Piney that the so-called endless chain might be

Over $100,000 hus already been invested In property and machinery and to secure
additional working capital, the Company hereby offers for subscription 34,000 shares of
{ta preferred stock, par value $25,

This Company has exeoptional advantages over other companies in the manufacture
of Cotton Seed Ol, by reason of exclusiva patents for cleaning the seed, thus saving
damage from heating or sweating and reducing the bulk of the seed for shipment,

The location of the Company's plant at Berkley, opposite Norfolk, enables it to com.
mand a Wide territory for the purchase of Cotton Seed, in which there are no competitive
mills, wiere labor and coal are exceptionally cheap and from which location the oil can
be shipped to Europe at lower rates than prevall at other seaports,

The mill has a capacity for crushing 120 tons of Cotton Seed dally, and can be
utilized for the production of Linseed and Peanut Oil when other Cotton Oil mills are
oom pelied oo oe idle, It hasa refinery where crude oil can be reflned, with a capacity of
800 Lbs. daily, ,

This Company has in connection with its Cotton Seed Mill a Cotton Spinning Mill,
6,000 Iba., dally capacity for producing Cotton Yarn, consuming all the short staple
coming from the seed, which is useless to other Cotton Reed Oil Companies, this Com-

ny alone naving combined a Cotton Yarn Spinning Mill with a Cotton Seed Crushing

Lill,

This Company owns and operates {n Philadelphia a large factory for fibre and cotton
mattrasses, stair pads, pillows, antiseptic curled cocoa and other fibres, with a well
estalilished and profitable business,

It is conservatively estimated that the business of the Company will exceed $750,000
annually, with a safe average profit of 20 per cent. thereo’, or $150,000, which will pay
a dividend of 6 per cent. on both the preferred and common stock and leave a surplus
besides

For the 24,000 shares of preferred stock now remaining in the Treasury, subscrip-
tions will be received at $12.50 per share and with each share so purchased will be
given one share of the common stook, par value 325, full paid and unasseasable, The
preferred stock is entitled tu have dividend of 6 per gent. per annum upon the amount
paid in, which is accumulative, and after @ dividend of 6 per cent, upon the common
stock, both stocks share equallyin the profits, It is the tntention of the Company to
begin the payment of dividendson the preferred stock in July next.

FINANCIAL AND COVUMBROIAL,

 

Satunpay, March 3,

The taking of profits on tho short side of the
market waa the feature of the dealings on the
Stock Exchange to-day. Operations of that
character caused net advances of nearly
8 points in Third Avenue and of % points
in Sugar Refining, The sharp ad-
vances in those two stocks influenced the
entire speculation and in consequence the ma-
Jority of the list closed higher than yesterday,

The more important net advances, other than |

those just mentioned, were in Brooklyn Rapit
Transit, Tennessee Coal and Tron, People's
Gas, Consolidated Gas and American Stee! and
Wire.

The rally in Sugar Reflning was accompanied
by rumors of pending negotiations for a settle.
ment of the warinthe refining industry, The
chances are that the rumors Were the result
rather than the cause of the rise In Sugar Re-
fining stock. In Third Avenue the heaviest buy-
ing was by brokers identified with the recent
speculative pool in the stock and the Room
inferred from these purchases that the pool,
or 8ome of ita members, were covering shorts
which they had put out after they had been
constrained to liquidate their holdings of long
atock. The market for the stock was alan influ-
enced by the reappearance of substantial bank -
ing interests in the probable programme for
financing the company,

As for some time past, there is a wide disorep-
ancy between the increase in the deposita and
the change called for by the loss In cash and
the increase in loans, The net result brings
the surpius reserve down materially, acircum-
etance that might affect the money market un-
favorably, were it not for the weaknesa of the
foreign exchange market, resulting from large
exporta, particularly of cotton, and from mod-
erate purchases of securities by Europe. More-
over, there Is the certainty of a large increase
in the circulation as soon as the finance bill be-
comes a law,,
