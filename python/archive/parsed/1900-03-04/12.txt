Laces Extraordinary
At Prices That Are Incomparable.

Laces are indisputably one of our incomparable specialties. We merely recite a
well known trade fact, without intending to b2 boastful, when we say there is no lace
stock equal to ours in this country, for the simple reason that no other firm in exist
e1ce has like opportunities for de | laces. We are creators of laces and lace
fistions, We have an office wherever laces are mide in Europe. Our own people
aways onthe spot. Laces of all kinds come to us and through us to you directly off
tie machines or from the hands that make them. There is aysolutely no profit but
our own between you and the maker. And no other retail house can truthfully make
this statement.

And so our showing for the season opens with the most extensive and best display
of masterpieces in lace making ever offered to the public. The laces that are hard to
find excepting here.
