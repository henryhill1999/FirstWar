Commission submitted to Congress to-day a
preliminary report of its investigations into
the operations of trusts and industrial combi-
pations. A large fleld of investigation, the
commission say, remains uncovered, only
eleven commerelal combinations or trusts
having been investigated, but the urgent de-
mand for information was doomed a sullcient
warrant for making partial report at thie
time.

combinations thus far,” the report says, “your
commiasion are of the opinion that certain
evils in connection with them should be
checked by appropriate legislation, Experi-
ence proves that industrial combinations
have become fixtures in our business life. and
their power forevil should be destroyed and
their moans for good preserved. As aresult of
further development on the partof the com.
Donations, it may be possible later to propose
additional measures for relfef without running
tho risk of increasing the evils, At present we
propose the following, which, if severally
adopted by the States, or so faras possible by
the Federal Government, we are confident will
be of great service and will not endanger busi-
oss prosperity.

“To prevent the organizers of corporations
or industrial combinations from decelving in-
vestors and the public, either through sup-
pression of material facts or by making mis-
leading statements, your commission recom-
mend:

(a) That the promoters and organizers of
corporations or industrial combinations which
look tothe public to purchase or deal in their
stocks or securities sould be required to fur-
nish full details regarding the organization
the property or services for which stocks or
securities are to be issued, amount and kind
of same, and all other material information
necessary for safe and intelligent investment,

“(b) That any prospectus orannouncement of
any kind soliciting subseriptions which fuils
to make full disclosures as aforesaid, or which
{s false, should be deemed fraudulent, and the
promoters, with their nssociates, heid legally
responsible

Absence of Snow Protection Has Caused
Damage to Winter Wheat,
Wisurxoros, Mareh 1.—The monthly erop
reports of the Department of Agriculture were
resumed to-day, In
the subject of crops the Department says
“The absence of snow protection over the
States during the

Kreater part of the month,

freexing and thawing, leaves w
at the clove of February in much less favorable
conditions than at the end of the preceding
month, The reported condition of the crop
at the endof Pebruary is, however, generally
satisfactory in moct sections outside of the
Middle States, Ohio, Michigan and portions of
Indiana, Missouri and Kansas, In Michigan
and Ohio many reports of winter killing are
received, indicating amore unfavorable condi-
tion than at any time during the winter, On
the north Pacifle coast favorable reports are
received trom Washington, Orexon and north-
ernand central California, although the crop
fn eastern Washington sustained some injury
asa result of the cold at the close of the month,
In southern California where there has been
an almost total absence of rain, the crop, es-
pecially the earlior sown, is suffering seriously

from drought.

The following is a part of the summary of
crop conditions:

New York—February waa characterized by
lack of snow, sudden and decided tem perature
changes and two or three general raing, fol-
lowed by freezing weather, with little orno
know protection, being very unfavorable for
wheat, rye, aod grasses, At the close of the
month only 25 per cent, of correspondents re-
port wheat in goo! condition,

Peonsy!vania Lack of snow protection,
heavy rain atorms, high winds, successive
thawing and freezing, Were injurious to winter
grain, and its general appearance is below the
average, but the extent of damage canno’ yet
be determined, asthe thawing may not have
been deep enough seriously to affect the roots;
from present Indications much will depend on
March conditions,

Maryland and Delaware-—Snowstorm inthe
middie of February most: beneficial to wheat,
but the remainder of the month was open;
some damage resultad from freezing and thaw.

ould weather at the close of the month also in-
Jurious; conditions hardly as favorable asa
month ago in western counties, but the out-
look ia unchanged elsewhere

  

 

Virginia-Condition of winter wheat at the
elose of February varies somewhat ae@eording
to whether early or late sown, Tn sotue of the

BIT URGED BY THE BREWERS TRUST,

A Scheme, Senator Nelson Says, to Crush
Ont Competition of Small Brewers,

 

WasHINGton, March 1.—4n apparently Ine
nocvent bill, repealing the existing law
permitting beer to be put up n
sixth and eighth burre.s, was the
subjeet of a Vigorous protest presented
to the Senate Finanea Coma ‘0 to-day by
Senator Nelson of Minnesota. The bill was

prased by the House fen days ago under
pension of the rules, aftera brief explanation
that the Legislatiog was asied by the brewing

 

   

 

interests and that it met the approval
of the Internal Revenue Bure Accordinn
to the statement f Mr. Nelson the bill
favors the big brewerles and diseriminates

egainst the smallones. He weut on to explain
that the sixth and eighth barre!s, or “kegs,”
were used almost exclusively by the smail
breweries, the large ones Oicing it unprofite
able to bother with them. If the use of kegs
were denied the smal! brewers, they would,
Mr. Nelson said, be foreed out of the business
for they eonld not compete withthe big estab-
lishments in the packages of iarge ice,

Mr, Nelson presented the protests of (iity-one
brewera in Minnesota againat the passage of the
bill. These comprised, ho said, every brewer
in the State with one exception. He had also
received protests from several coonperage es-
tablishments in Minnesota who represented
that the passage of the bill by the House alone
had brought ton standstill the ma eture of

 

   
      

the amail packages, leaving jarge stocks of
finished and partly manutactured material
on their hands. Mr. Nelson eontendet that
the Internal Revenue Bureau bad not
recommended the bill but hink its
passige was being urged by the brewer « trust

for the purpose of crushing out the competi-

TIE SENATE PROGRAMME,

PROTRACTED DEBATE EXVECTED ON
CUR PUERTO RICO TARIFF BILL,

 

A Vote Likely to Be Taken on the Onay
Case Next Week Nothing Arranged for

 

the Consideration of the Canal Treaty
and It May Be Allowed to Sleep in
the forenmga Kelations Comimiitee,

Wasutnator, Mareh 1.—A protracted debate
is likely to follow the calling upof the Puerto
Kico bil! in the Senate next week and im-
portant legislative matters will crowd along
so fast and furious that it is possible
that the almost forgotten Hay-Pauncefoty
canal tveaty will remain where it is on a
side track in the room of the Committee on
Yoreign Relations. After the Puerto Nivo
question is disposed of, the Spooner bill, vest-
ing inthe President the power to control af-
fairs in the Philippines after the insurrection
shall cease and until @ permanent govern-
ment ia provided, will, it is thought, have the
rightof way, Areporttothe Senate fromthe
Committes on the Vhilippine Islands would

have been made long ago but for
the enforeed absence of the  chair-
map, Senator Lodge. ‘The discussion

of this meausure will be along the same lines
us the debate on the Puerto R bill, and will,
undoubtedly, consume the tire of the Renate
until the appropriations bills begin to come
nlong about the middle of April or the frst of
May, Afterthat there will be little time for
questions not on the legislative programme,

At intervals during the consideration of the
Puerto Rico bill next week the Quay case will
be discussed, and Senator Foraker, in charge
of the Puerto Rico bill, will not objset to its
temporary postponement if a vote on the seat-

ing of Mr. Quay can be had. [t is now the

opinion of the best-iuformed Senators on
both sides of the chamber that a vote
will be taken next week or the week
after and that Mr. Quay will be seated
Senator Foraker will vote for Mr. Quay,
It is possible that the effort to bring

the Quay case to a vote may be somewhat
complicated by the action of the Committee on
Privileges and Elections now investigating the
charges of bribery against Senator Clark of
Montana, It the Senate that the
committee will stand 7 to 2 against Mr, Clark

is said at

  

and that a report may be made before the
Quay case is disposed of, Uf it is, and Clark
should be unseated, Mr. Quay would not
only be deprived of the Montana man's
vote, but would also lose Whatever sup.
port he may have reeeived from the alleged
Quay-Clark combination, It is more than
likely, however, that Mr, Penrose, who his

 
  

already demonstrated by a@ vote in open Senate
that there are enough votes in Mr. Quay's
favor to seat him, will bring the case to a tinal
tore the Senate is ready to receive

vote long be

THE SINKING OF THK COLON,
No Record That Sampson Recommended

That Her Commander Be Shot.

Wasninetox, March 1.--In an interview
printed in Tne Sun of Feb, 27, Rear Admiral
Willlam T, Sampson, commenting on the sink-
ing of the Spanish armorelad Cristobal Colon,
is quoted as saying:

“The fact that the ship had been sunk after
she had surrendered made me recommend
that the commanding officer be retained on
board or that ho be shot ag having destroyed
public property which after her surrender be-
longed to the captor, I madethe same rec-
ommendation in regard to the Captata of the
Sandoval, who sank his ship aftter the sur-
render at Santiago and soveral days after he
had received a letter from me warning him
that he was no longerat liberty to do injury to
the vessel, He deserved to be shor, but 1 did
not see just how wo were to get at it.”

A close search has been made of the files of
the Navy Department, but no letter or tele-

gram from Admiral Sampson can be found in
Which there is any recommendation that the
commander of the Cristobal Colon or the com-
mander of the Sandoval be shot. Secretary
Long and Assistant Secretary Allen said, in
answer to inquiries of THe Sus’s reporter,
that they had_no recollection of such a recom-
mendation. Lieut. H. H. Ward of the Bureau
of Navigation, who com plies the official records
of the naval operations in the war with Spain,
said be could not resall any letter or telegram
from Admiral Sampson to that effect.

Naval offleers aay that {t would have been
perfectly justifiaole for Admiral Sampson to
have shot the commanders of the Colon ani
the Sandoval, and that offleers of some foreign
navies would unquestionably have inflicted the
death penalty for acrime which is regarded ull
over the world as dishonorable aud treacher-
ous. Information has reached the nay De-
vartment that the Colon has slipped off tha
ank on which she had been grounded and has
suuk in deep water.

ate to Vote on the Conference Keport

bate on the bill establishing a terr.torial form
of government inthe Hawalian Islands, that
measure was passed in the Senate this after.
noon without adiviston, It creates the Terri.
toryof Hawaii, with a Legislature, Supreme
and minor courts, a Governor and other
officials; extends to the islands the Internal
Revenue, Customs and Navigation laws, and
provides for the election of a delegate to repre-
sent the islands in Congress. Tho Senate
afterward took up the bill to establish a gov-
ernment in Puerto Rico and imposing for two
years atax ef 15 per cent. of the Dingley rates
on trade between the jaland and the United
States, and mado it the unfinished business,

On motion of Mr, Aldrich (Rep, R, L.), it was
agreed thata vote onthe conference report of
the Financial bill be taken at 4 o'clock on

The House bi!l temporarily to provide rev-
enuesa for the relief of the Island of Puerto
Rico was received from the House and referred
to the Committee on Pacifle Islands and Puerto
Rieo, Later, Mr. Foraker, chairman of the
committer, reported back the Puerto Rico bill
with an amendment, substituting for it the bill
already reported to the Senate, giving Puerto
Ricoa Territorial form of government, The
substitute waa amended go as to make the
tariff on Puerto Rican trade 15 per vent., a3 the
House bill provides. The rate fixed by the
Senate was 25 per cent.

Mr, Clay (Dem., Ga.) then addressed the
Senate in opposition to the retention of the
Philippine Islands. He quoted some remarks
of Mr. Foraker (Rep. Ohio) when the Paris
treaty was under discussion to the effect that
the President was not in favor of retaining
those islands and that it was the purpose of
the Administration notto exercise permanent
dominion there. He also quoted from re.
marks of Mr. Lodge (Rep., Mass.) tothe same
effect, and suid that seven out of the nine
speechos made in executive session in favor of
the ratification of the treaty took the position
that, as soon asthe authority of Spain was re-
moved, it would he the duty of Congress to
legislate for the independence agd self govern-
ment ofthe Philippine Ishands,

why, if bis argument were correct, another

why pot hand over the country to the Filipinos
and withdraw the Ai fean troot

“Beeause,” Mr Clay answered, “if this joint
resolution (Senator Bacon's) be passed, and tho
