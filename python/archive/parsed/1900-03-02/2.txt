THE PROFESSOLK
THE FOLD OFr

 

A Heresy Trial Thus Avoided—Said That He

Will Retain Chair at Union Seminary
He May Join Congregationalistis—Lat-
ter Not Entirely Glad to Receive Him,

It {s stated om apparently sufficient authority
that Prof. Arthur ©, MeGiffert, D.D,. Wash.
burn Professor of Chureh History in the Union
Theological Seminary, will voluntarily with
iraw from the Presbyterian Church, thereby
relieving that denomination from «a heresy

ial. Dr. MeGiffert, It ts said, will present his
withdrawal through Prof, Francis Brown of
the Union Theological Seminary, his personal
fiend and warm supporter, at the next meet.
ing of the New York Presbytery on Mareh 12.
jr is further said that Prof, MeGiffert will enter
the Congregational Church,

Iwo years ago Prof, MeGiffert published the
hook which eaused the present trouble, “A
History of Christianity in the Apostolic Ages.’
The General Assembly of 1808 took notice of
the book, specially mentioning the passage
which challenged the truth of the generally
accepted statements about the Lord's Supper.
Many passages in the book were regarded by
straight-out l’resbyterians as more heretical
than this one, The Assembly asked Prof,
McGiffert to modify his views. This the pro-
fessor showed no disposition to do, and he
sent to the Assembly of last May, which was
held at Minneapolis, a letter which left the
matter just where it was. He held that his
book had been wrongly interpreted

“Such misapprehensions, he wrote in reply
toa suggestion of the Assembly that he either
conform to the tenets of the Church or with-
draw, “Isincerely regret. * * * So farasmy
views are concerned they have been and re-
main, as I believe, in accord with the faith of
the Presbyterian Chureh and of evangelical
Christendom in all vital and essential matters,
and I therefore cannot fee! that it is my duty
sceven my right, in juatice to myself and to
my brethren and to the Chureh of our Divine
lord and Master, in which | am an office-
bearer, to withdraw from the ministry of the
Vresbyterian Church.”

Onarepresentationof Dr John Baleom Shaw,
who was understood to guarantee that {! the
Assembly left the matter tha New York
Presbytery Prof, MeGiffert would withdraw of
his own accord, the matter was referred to

t
to

 

the Lresbytery. Resolutions condemning
the teachings of Prof, MeGiffert’s book, but
deelaring agains! a heresy trial, were passed
by the Presbytery a few weeks ag lhe
stated clerk, Kev, Dr. G. W. FP. Bireh, an-

| to the General
iiffert's teachings

nounced that he would aps
Assembly and have Prof. Me

 

 

 

 

puton trial before that body Before this an-
nouncement was made Prof. MeGiffert had
called together fora conference on his ease
twelve or fifteen of his intiniate friends in the
Presbyterian ministry and set the matter
before them in full, asking theirjudgment
and saying that he wished todo what was best
tor the Chureh and for the seminary. The
question was discussed at great leugth and the

almost unanimous decision of Prof. MeGiffert's
friends wasthatthe best thing in all liehts
would be his withdrawal. Ha agreed to this,
it is said
Vhe feeling in the Presbyterian Chureh will
be one of relief at the avoidance ofa v
trial, which could not but engender bitte 4s
aa Prof, MeGiffert has a strong following
«
v

 

amoug Presbyterians and particularly am
the younger men, Dr. Birch said yesterda
that Prof. McGiffert’s withirawal would
the best interests of theChureh and a@ motion
for peace. “My contention was never persona
toward Prof. Meiffert,” said he. “LT bave told
him and [ think he understands fully my
Deotives.”

Prof. McGiffert’s withdrawal from the
bhyterian Church will not necessitat
siening his ehair in the Union Ther a
seminary. When seen last night he would not
liscuss the matter of his with lrawal, either to
affirm ordeny it, A numberof Congregational
ministers were seen yesterday in regard to the
possibility of his going into that Church and all
were chary of discussing the matter

“There is so much unrest in our denomina.-
tion now,’ said one, “that itis unwise for any

ustosay anything. There will be no such
trouble in the Congregational denomination
