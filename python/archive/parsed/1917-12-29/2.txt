Further sharp advances in the prices
ef stocks, particularly those of railroads,
yesterday registered the approval of
Wall Street and investors of the Govern-
ment's plan under which it has taken!
over control of the railroads of the na-
tion. Trading was on a heavy scale,
total transactions exceeding one million
shares, Advances ranging from two mI
ten points were added to the sensational
rises of the previous session, ranging
from three to nearly eighteen points. }

Investment and speculation shifted
from the high class rails to the low
priced issues, which under private con-
trol had been considered of little value,
but under the Government's plan of
guaranteeing earnings are now consid-
ered to have a fair yvaluatign. |

The railroad issues were the most
sought, but an increased inquiry was re-
ported for industrial issues. The latters’
advances in price were not as large as

Swift Trade Causes Confusion.

Whereas reports on orders executed
on the floor of the Stock Exchange are
usually obtainable three of four min-
utes after they have been sent to the
broker, it was sometimes «ss much as
half arr hour yesterday before a cus-
tomer knew at what price he had sold or
purchased a stock,

Trading was so active at times that
the tape was more tM&n five minutes be-
nind the actual transactions on the floor
of the exchange and this necessitated
much explaining by brokers to customers
who thought they had not received
Proper prices on their orders.

Further expansion in the bond and
rote markets at advances in prices was
witnessed and some of the largest in-
\estment banking firms are giving con-
sideration to the flotation of new offer-
ings which less than a week ago would
have been considered very doubtful of
success. Semi-speculative bonds were in
most demand and advanced from one to
three points. New Haven i per cent.
notes were particularly strong and
changed hands as high as %6, which

Notwithstanding the sharp advances |
most of the’ gains were maintained up|
to the close of business, There was!
profit taking on a fair scale, but the de-
mand was more than sufficient to take
care of these offerings,

To the veteran speculators in the
financial district and even to some bank-
ers the continuance of the advance in
view of the previous session's sharp
rise was surprising, most people having
looked forward to a reaction on the
theory that the rise Rad been too rapid.

Trafic Men Are Sanguine.

Directors of railroads are taking a
™more favorable view of the situation,
and the directors of the Chicago, Rock
Island and Pacific Railway yesterday
saw fit to begin dividends on the 6 per
cent. and 7 per cent. preferred stocks.

It was this action, together with the
fact that the shares were selling un-
usually low considering the road's earn-
ings, that resulted in an advance of ten
Points in the 7 per cent. preferred and
of more than eight points in the 6 per

Directors of the Baltimore and Ohio,

are also expected to be inclined to be

| movement. Members of the War Board
urged strongly on Mr. McAdoo to-day
| the necessity of cutting down on some

the United States is the only nation at

great amount of war freight and at the
| same time asking its railroads to trans-
port as well all commercial freight re-
gardiess of its importance.

day, any funds needed for equipment or

sary new financing will not be done

done, directly by the Director-General.
Any permanent betterments of prop-
erty or individual units will be charged
; to these units against the time when
the railroads are, turned back to their
