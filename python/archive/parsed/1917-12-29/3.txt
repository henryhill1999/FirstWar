WASHINGTON, Deo, 28,-—Direct request |
for exemption of shipbuilding concerns
from the operations of the excess profits,

to-day to the Sonate Committee Inves-!

Rear Admiral Rowles, arsistant to the
General manager of the Emergency Fleet
Corporation, asked that Congress ex-

Can be built for the war emergency.

contracts for shipe,"Mr. Bowles declared.
“We cannot get contractors to take
them at any price on account of that.
Bection of the tax law. The men who
were hungering after contracts we can-
not induce to take them at any

“My own experience as a shipbullder
convinces me that the invisible things
Will take away so much of the profit on
shipbuilding that the shipbuilders
not be blamed.”

To demonstrate what he meant Mr. |
Bowles cited the profit of the American
International Company, which ap-
Parently would be In the vicinity of $6.-!

cut down to $2,400,000, and which other

taxes and charges would reduce to less

Aska for Legislation.

Mr. Bowles made these requests for
legisiation to aid in building the war

Authority to requisition houses in
the vicinity of shipyards for men em-
Ployed there.

Authority to build
ground owned by the
the same purpose.

Authority to compel street railway

Clal transportation for #hipyard em-
Ployees.

“Some of them will come before your |

he asserted. “I would like to ask the
committee when that happens that T be!

and to answer whatever they have to

This request,
was «a fair one.

The extent to which the Government |
has aided shipbuilders in helping them |
to construct yards and ways was de- |
tailed by Mr. Bowles. In all, he said.
twenty-o1e yards have been helped and |
this help amounted to $9,338,000. The! |
American International Company was
helped to the extent of $3,347,000,
the Merchants’ Shipbuilding Company,
$1,870,000, and the Submarine Boat
Company to the extent of $895,000, In
answer to questions he asserted that it
was far wiser to give thie assistance
than to have the Government construct
the yards, Several other companies also
were aided. Tlitough this aid the steel
ship programme was expedited.

Mr. Bowles detailed one of the steps
taken by the Government to insure more;
skilled workmen for building ita ships,
“We have offered any shipbulider $5 a
day for each man he rends to the voca-
tional training establishment of the Gov-
ernment who is trained in the shipbuild-
ing trades,’ he said. “We have offered
$1 a day to a)) sh!pbuilders for each man
he trains in his own yards, half of it to
go to the shipbuilder for the temporary
loss of efficiency and the other half to
the man. In «a year this will furnish us
in the neighborhood of 60,000 trained
workmen for shipbuilding.”
