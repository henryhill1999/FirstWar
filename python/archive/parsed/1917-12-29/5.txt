The Man Who Wins by Losing.

The price of silver, which in 1896
was about 73 cents an ounce, is now
about 87 cents.

Prohibition awaits the judgment of
the States.

Government control, if not
ship, of railroads is here.

What Democrat, peering into the
future for a Presidential candidate
for his party in 1920, can see any fea-
tures more distinguishable than those
of Mr. Bryan?

He could be nominated on the
strength of what has been seccom-
plished after the fact of his defeats,

But perhaps the next Democratic
national convention will be operated
by a Director General of Politics.

Two Sides of a Shield.

There are two ways of viewing the
“terms of peace” adroitly and vaguely
phrased by Count Czernts to the Bol-
shevik delegates at Brest-Litovsk,

From cither of the two points of
view the proposals (if such they can
be considered) are non-responsive to
the call for a definite basis for ne-
gotintions, They are evasive of the
great issue of the war as it has been
squarely propounded more than once
to the German people from Washing-
ton, from London and from Paris
They are manifestly unsatisfactory,
inconclusive, impossible of entertain-
ment for 2» moment by the Allies
fighting together for world peace
through the overthrow of Prussian
militarism, and fer justice, restitu-
reparation and future security
for democracy against the aggres-
sions of autocracy.

Nevertheless, all this being true,
there are yet two different and widely
different ways of looking at the
shield.

The first is to regard the Czernin
deliverance in behalf of the Central
Powers as pure bluff and sheer trick-
ery; intended to assuage war weari-
hess at home; intended to encourage
Pacifist demonstrations in the enemy's
country; intended to cover military
movements and gain time for prep-
aration for a renewed offensive on a
vast scale; intended to improve the
moral position of the Kaiser while he
proceeds to execute his blatant threat
of the shining sword and the fron
fist; intended, in its artful simula-
tion of respect for international law
and civilized practices and treaty
faith, to recover lost ground in the
world’s esteem and patch up a repu-
tation forfeited by the unspeakable

7 perfidy and savagery of the past three

years and a half.

Every motive here ascribed to the
characteristic Berlin intrigue is sus-
ceptible of demonstration amounting
to proof, Tt would be easv enough
to fill this whole page with historical
and psychological reasons for dismiss-
ing the Czernin prospectus summarily
and contemptuously as signifying
nothing more than one or several or
all of these dishonest and dishonor-
able things.

THe Sun is perfectly conscious of
that. At the same time it finds itself
asking why wise statesmanship and
humane hope should shut their eyes
to what is obvious on the other side
of the shield.

These proposals or “peace terms”
addressed generally to the world
through the shatter pated Bolsheyiki
by the haughty wielder of the shining
sword, under circumstances that must
he more or less mortifying to him,
do mean something more than is in-
dicated in the other view of their sig-
nificance, The fact may be ignored
officially in this quarter or that, but
jt is not thereby altered or removed
from the record.

For the first time since the war
begun something specific in the way
of a statement of war aims has been
elicited by distress from the head-
quarters of the ambitions which be-
gan the war, For the first time there
is n diplomatically guarded admission
that the main objects of ambition are
now seen to be unattainnble, For the
first time there is a definite, though
Indirectly conveyed, recession from
the purposes with which the Teuton
war was started,

Tt is not necessary to measure the
degree of possibility or Impossibility
in the Czernin schedule, for there is
at this time before the United Stetes
no question of Its acceptance or re-
jection, But If negotiations with the

. . 60
if
r

active Allies should begin and con-
tinue at Germany's further instance.
these first asking terms afford at
least the evidence of Its desire to

To Save a Million Tons of Coal.

| At the conference in Albany called

, Was estimated that the cutting of a
lcord of wood on ench acre of farm

lif it could drag all the other seedless
orange trees with it. The navel orange
is a poor imitation of a fine fruit; it
shames the otherwise respectable and
respected citrous family. It runs to
coarse pulp, to juiceless cells, It may
be beautiful, its beauty 1s skin deep;
but its skin is too thick. All the na-

The railroad says that in April,

idea of using silt by admixing it with |

great banks everywhere in the hard
coal fields.
passed through a mesh where the
openings are no larger than three-
thirty-seconds of an inch in diameter.
Silt has always been waste.

A Japanese chemist employed by
the coal company took silt
blended it with soft coal in a series
of experiments. By pulverizing the
soft coal and using 70 per cent. soft
conl and 30 per cent. silt the chemist
got a fuel producing just as much
water evaporation as when he used
pure soft coal.

These tests have now been made
with the largest locomotives, equipped
with automatic stokers. ‘Trains of
fifty loaded coal cars were handled

with ease and there was even a sur- |
| prise awaiting the experimenters.

The
new fuel produced 30 per cent. more
steam than soft coal alone did.

Mixing plants are being built at
points in the coal fields and the miil-
ions of tons of silt lying about will

be utilized at last. The rallroad’s

‘locomotives will require a third less

soft coal than hitherto, and that third
will be available for industrial plants
using soft coal.

It is the dust which has |

Indiana hes already undertaken a
| vigorous campaign for the substitu-
‘tion of wood for coal.
| Fuel Administrator, Evans Woo..en,

, has enlisted as his aids the forestry |

department, which is showing how |
1w ood may be obtained and coal stoves
‘turned into wood burners at small
expense; a boys’ working reserve that
is organizing “‘sawbuck clubs” among
j the boys of rural schools, and the |
: county fuel administrators, who ure.
i; engaged in a general elucational cam-
| paign throughvut the State. The ef-
fect has been a marked saving in
coal, and in many
‘administrator and
| have refused “to sell coal to farmers
where it is known they have an avail-
jable supply of fuel wood."

| F. FRANKLIN Moon, acting dean of
ithe New York State College of For-
estry, strongly urges the need
wood consumption in rural communi-
ties. Public buildings in these com-
munities, he says, can often be Sinex-
pensively heated by fuel easily ob-

| PLANETARY REVOLUTIONS.

the coal dealers

‘A Simple Explanation of Certain
Movements,

To Tur Eprron or Tug Sux—S@; The
|principal reason that the earth and
‘planets revolve on axes at different
j rates, or that a large planet revolves
; faster and has a shorter day than a

smal] planet, is that a large planet's re-
‘volving rate has a better chance to
| accelerate.

Every part of the earth or a planet
| moves to a perihelion of its own every
day. Thus a point on the earth is at
taphelion at midnight, and as the earth
| revolves toward the sun that point of the
earth falls around to its perihelion at
noon, or its nearest distance to the sun;
jtherefore the larger the planet the
further its surface portion will fall from
midnight 10 noon, or from aphelion to
‘perihelion, and the further it falls the
more its rotating velocity will have an
opportunity to become accelerated as it
thus gravitates toward the sun.

There are other minor causes that af-
| Saat this revolving rate: thus the nearer
| a planet is to the sun the faster it would

revolve, or its revolving portion gravi-
tate: the nearer a planet is to the plane
jof the sun's equator the faster its west
!half would revolve toward the receding
west half of the sun, as that body of

We were, they said, to have a mild
and equable winter, with little snow ;
the Hudson was to be navigable
throughout the season;
this neighborhood was to bask in the
rays of the sun in warmth and eom-
fort unprecedented.

The shifty Dame made liars of them
all, and exposed us to the humilia-
tion that is visited on the gullible.
Our friends smiled indulgently on us,
our enemies gloated over us, the ma-
licions assailed our integrity, the
crafty tapped their sclfeming head-
pieces and wore looks of pretended
commiseration when our misplaced
confidence was mentioned. The Hud-
son was closed to shipping on Decem-
ber 17, afier 250 days of navigation,
or nineteen fewer than 1915-16 gave
us, and a shorter open season than
any since 1907. Then we forswore
all faith in the seers of the valley,
and vowed never again to underwrite
their partings of the curtain
hides from us the best and worst that
is to come. That oath holds, We give
no indorsement to the “old timers”
of Hastings-on-Hudson who assert
that “despite the cold weather and

the unusual amount of snow so far |
short and |

the present winter will be
mild, and that after January 1 the
weather will be reasonable and spring
early.” Perhaps the authority quoted |
herewith enjoys a good reputation ; it
is all one to us:

“Warn W. TumPaiss, coal nierchant,
says bluejays never stay in Westchester
county through a severe winter. All the
other migratory birds have flown, but
the jays are everywhere,

“He and others also point to the fact
that eagles are wintering in Interstate
Park. In the early morning not less
than thirty can be seen soaring aloft
over the Hudson. They assert the eagle
is weatherwise and never stays North
when the winter is to be severe."

We hope Mr. Tomkins is not basely
pretending to weather wisdom to pla-
cate a parcel of customers whose bins
he has not been able to fill; if he is,
we warn those who depend on him
that bluejays are useless as fuel, As
for the eagles in Interstate Park,
their unusual habits have nothing to
do with storm or temperature, Even
a weather prophet ought to be able to
understand that.

Since 1916 a great change has come
over the American eagle. He is fa-
miliar now in localities which be was
never before known to frequent, This
winter he is in France. He rests
majestically over the high seas, His
shadow, bringing comfort and reas-
surance to stranger peoples, falls on
unwonted plains and valleys, hills
and mountains, which the censor im-
plores us not to reveal. He gives no
heed to snow or ice or sleet; com-
pletely restored from a morbid over-
growth of the pacific nerve, he ts con-
ditioning himself for a convincing ex-
hibition of his traditional qualities.
He scorns the réle of weather prophet
and connotes only war and victory.

fallen from our good opinion. We put
no reliance on them, They must go

SKATING IN EVERY PARK.
A Plan to

Bring Ice Rinks to All
City Dwellers.

To THE Epitor or Trre SuN—Sir: A
few weeks ago a strange spectacle was
afforded visitors to Central Park. WHun-
drede of skaters might have been seen
sliding over sheets of perfect ice in the
large ball fleld at Sixty-sixth street and
|the other fields and meadows of the park.
| This was possible through an unusual
reoncurrence of weather conditions,
namely, a heavy snowstorm, followed by
warm rain, which melted and levelled
the snow, which then froze solidly when
the temperature dropped, Owing to these
conditions there was even skating in
many other parks, for example, Tomp-
kins Square and Mulberry Park. Unfor-
Hee the sport lasted but a few days,

second snowstorm covering the ice,

| employees to clear it off.

Why cannot some of these large flelde
| he flooded every year about Novem-
ber 1 with about six inches of water’
Then after the first spell of freezing
weather an opportunity would be given
all to indulge in this most healthful form
of outdoor exercise almost every day in
the Winter without having to wait until
the ice on the lakes is thick enough to
bear safely the thousands of skaters,

When a boy in a country part of this
State, I recollect quite a large field al-
ways having been flooded late in fall,
and it was exceptional not to have good
skating by Thanksgiving. If country
clubs and the outdoor rinks in this city
ean do this, why cannot the park au-
thorities bestir themeelves and grant
this boon to thousands of indoor work-
ers to whom this form of sport is noth-
ing short of necessary? The expense
would be nothing, as the flelds mostly
are natural basins, and no harm would
be done the ground.

By the way, are not the park lakes
unusually slow in being opened, consid-
ering the amount of freezing weather
we have already had? Wave the pro-
prietora of the private rinks anything
to do with this? Joun Rooney,

COAL DISTRIBUTION.

This Landlord Learns Officially He Can

Have Fuel If He Can Get It.

To Tuk Epitor or THe SuN—Sir:
an editorial article of December

in

7 I

ni oted the statement that there was two

| daye
| eity. Would you mind telling me where
it fa and how | can get some of it?
I have an apartment house on the
{upper West Side occupied by ten fami-
| lies, and have had no coal there since
'
| yesterday afternoon. This morning 1
went to the New York County Fuel Ad-
ministrator, at 66 Broadway, and filled
out one of his cards, giving the address
of the house, the name of my coal dealer
and tHe amount of coal wanted. In
reply to my inquiries 1 was told that If
my dealer had no coal it would be im-
| porsible for the Administrator to direct
any other dealer to supply me, but if
I would “bring proof” that “any one
was hoarding coal’ the Administrator
“might be able to do something,” just
what was not specified.

From your article I should judge that
there was enough coal in the city for the
immediate needs of every one. If this
Were distributed equally, every house-
holder would have coal sufficient for his
immediate needs and there would be no

‘hardship. r

Dealers who have coal will only sell
to former customers. It seems to me
‘that the Fucl Administrator commits a

new style of music and their singing, | save error when he refuses to direct

for the Filipinos as a rule are music and’

art lovers. As a proof of thie, during |
the St. Louis Exposition in 1904 the

Philippine band was awarded the third
prize among the world’s best bands,

Italy wae the 1 and Germany was
the second
At present the are many Filipino

soldiers in the United States Army, and
the people in the Philippines are helping
and offering more imen for this war,
comprising in all about 35,000 men.

Out of 10,000,000 population only
1,000,000 are non-Christian and 9,006,000
are Christian—Christianized more than
200 years ago, and our university there
is older than any of the universities of
America. In my own town, a good sized
municipality, there were but six police-
men, and very sufficient to hold the
peace of the town, +

Can you tell me one case of brutality
that happened to any of the American

 

 

 

 

dealers having coal to supply it to per-
sons who need it whether they are
former customers of such dealer or not.
If the Administrator has power to
eompel an equitable distribution of coal
he should use it, and the excuse that the
dietribution of coal by dealers should not
be interfered with because at the present
time no déaler has more than he needs
for his customers impresses me as a
pretty poor one for doing nothing, which
seems to be the chief business of publie
officials.

on the

EXEMPTING FARMERS.

An Action Important to America and

Her Allies,

To Tuk Bprror or Tuk Sux—Sir. Your
article on the subject of farm work
for soldiers hits the nail on the head,
To my mind, one of the greatest ser-
Vices that Secretary Baker can do for
this country as well as for the allied
cause is to see to it that competent |

young farmers he exempted from mili-

tary duty so far ‘aw possible,

In this community, in which there are
large industrial enterprises, it| is prac-
tically impossible to obtain competent
farm helo, The vesult is that the farm-
ers cannot produce as much as they

would if they were not handicapped with

done by keeping the men who know how
to conduct farms engaged in that occu-

DIFFERING OFFICIAL THEORIES OF THE
CAUSE OF COAL SHORTAGE.

 

Conjectures by the Railroad War Board and Prophecies by the Inter.
state Commerce Commission.

 

I.
From the Bulletin of the War Board, De-
cember 77.

Reports of shortage of coal are be-

ing published from many parts of the | has been
This is due chiefly to the| Problem of transportation,

country,

enormous increase in the demand for |

coal and to other causes, but it cannot |
fairly be attributed altogether to lack |
of transportation.

The railroads appeal from the gen- |
eral statements being made upon this
suWect to the incontrovertible facts.
The records of the railroads show not
only that the coal operators have pro- |
duced more coa! than ever before, but
that in the eight months April to No-
vember, inclusive, the railroads have
hauled and delivered 175,986 more car-
loads, or about 10,000,000 more tons of
anthracite than in the same months of
1916. This was an increase of 15 per
cent. over the best record ever pre-
viously made.

The records show that in the same
months the railroads hauled 925,691
more carloads, or about 51,000,000 more
tons, of bituminous coal than in the
corresponding period of 1916. This was
an increase of 18 per cent. over the
best record ever previously made.

The railroads have not been able at
all times to carry all the coal that
could be offered to them for move-
ment. But has any other Industry
responded more efficiently to the de-
mands created by the war than these
statistics regarding coal transportation
show the railroads have?
railroads have accomplished what th
have under the greatest difficulties
difficulties resulting principally from
their inability to increase their plant
and the excessive use of preference
orders in Government transportation.

The charge has been made that the
inability of the railroads promptly to
move all the freight offered to them
has been largely due to the failure of
the various railway lines to work to-
gether harmoniously and unitedly in
this war crisis. We challenge those
who make this allegation to cite any
evidence in support of it. They can-
not do so, The allegation is without
foundation. The railways, under the
organization they voluntarily formed
to direct the operation of their prop-
erties during the war, have without

WINTER REIGNS.

Reflections on a Perfect Day in the
Cold Season.

To tus Eptror or THe Sux—Sir: An-

other Christmas has come! Once more

The

midnight that usners in so solemnly a
new year is drawing nearer and nearer,
and most of us are reviewing again the
twelve months almost past—their occ:
sional sunshine and their overhanging
shadows.

Winter is indeed regnant out of doors.
Nature is sleeping as though dead, and
the last leaf has fallen long ago from
the barren boughs of lofty trees A
white mantle, worn through in spots by
some recent thaw, rests upon Gale an
hill, and at times a low, cheerless wat!
is heard as the north wind
country on suburb. At dawn a
chill is felt in our bedroom, at noon it
is banished from the house, but bh)
nightfall it creeps again into the rooms
of our home. Yet there is health in t
outdoor air—it is a splendid tonic, And
there is spectacular grandeur in the be-
spangled firmament. At gloaming
behold bright and beautiful! Venus, later
bright and golden Jupiter. and = then
Vleiades, Orion and Sirius! Most
us prefer the season spring to that
of winter, yet a perfect day in winter—

the holidays of Yuletide are here!
