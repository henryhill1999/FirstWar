sset Hoth in military and civil life—~
' plem of raising physical efficiency

this War as soon as possible and
this nation safe from similiar

ent topies discussed at the twelfih
ual convention of the National Col-
legiate Athletic Assoclation at the Hotel
Astor yesterday,

It was decided unanimously that the
nation best could be served if all sports
and athletic competitions were continued,
hut tt was added that sport and the
devek nt of the military unit must
dovetail, It further was concluded and
brought out rather strongly in the
speeches that if our college men were
to get the most out of their participa-
ton ta sport the old system would have
ergo a thorough overhauling.

in Support of Sport

(FROM SECRETARY OF WAR RBRAKER.)

The officers’ training camps held by the Government were attended by
tens of thousands of young men whose minds had been trained in the colleges
and high schools of the country and whose splendid athletic condition wae
due to the collegiate and high school system of athletics. They were a
national asset of incalculable value hence collegiate athletics should have
e mind the possibility of this kind of emergency in the future. It therefore
secomes more obviously Important to spread the benefits of college athletics
a8 Widely as possible throughout the student body and to prevent their being
Monopolized by a few selected representatives. Both the training and the
Spirit of the athletle fleld lend themeelves readily to inilitury service, and as
the secondary schools of the country model thelr activities on those of the

colleges, both the practice and example of the colleges in athletics become

An example of patriotism calculated
to make many of the other clubs take
notice, was set yesterday when at an
executive committee meeting of the
Baltusrol Golf Club held at the office
of Isuls Keller, 29 Broadway, this city,
it was voted to “close up shop” from
January 2 to April 1. This will make
the first time in twenty-one years that
the club near Short Hills, N. J., has
barred its doors in winter.

The action was taken in view of the
