More News of the Furniture!

E are selling almost twice as much furniture as during the February |

days of last year. Good reason for it—more of you have come
to know the character of furniture we sell and the way we sell it;
have come to depend on Wanamaker’s as the best every-day supplier of
furniture.
And you know that the same thoroughly good productions are being
sold in this February Trade Sale, while prices are

Not Much Above Half Present Values ':

About twenty thousand pieces are still at command—pretty much
everything needed for bedroom, parlor, dining-room and library.
Not every piece of furniture in the store is reduced or offered at a

lessened price. The big sale tags tell you plainly which are—and how

 

much. They speak for us—as candidly and carefully as we would speak to
you personally.
As atule, prices area fourth to a third below December and January

prices—practically not much above half the present and prospective value.

The selling of Morris Chairs will prove wonderfully interesting—and the
lots should go ae or Monday at latest. Some at three dollars—oak
frames and denim cushions. These are a manufacturer’s attempt at crushing
competition, Of « course he couldn’t, but he hurt himself—and you'll profit
who buy the chairs, But the savings on the finer ones are more pronounced
-—nobody should try to make Morti s Chairs for three dollars.
