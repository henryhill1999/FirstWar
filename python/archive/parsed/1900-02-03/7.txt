dated Gas Company to set aside the recent

election of trustees of that company was coms |

pleted yosterday afternoon. The motion will
come upon Teb, 14 before Justice Loventritt

unwarranted figure, without the consent of
the stockholders; that this menaced the finan-
cial future of the company; that the purchase

criminal conspiracy in the interest of certain
syndicates and underwriters.”

covery’ that on or about Jan, 1 bonds of the
Consolidated Gas Company were held by the
State Trust Company to the amount of $2,000,-
O00. He says the stockholders he ror enal
would like to know whether any additional

FINANCIAL AND COMMERCIAL,

 

Fuipay, Feb, 2.

The change in speculative sentiment has be-
come 80 pronounced that it carried nearly the
entire market for securities toa highcr level
to-day, although there were no epecially
favorable developments affecting values, Wa!l
Street has no longer any use for the South
Atrican war, partly because it has become an
old story, but chiefly because it has ceased to
affect the European money market. More-
over, London, owing to the scant supply of
American stocks at that contre {8 no longer
able to make heavy sales of them in this
market whenever unfavorable news from the
Tronvaal depresses English sentiment, Tho
speculative community ja now sensibly turn-
ing its attention to domestic influences such as
the Jarge earnings of industrial and railway
corporations and indications of a fairly pros-
perous agricultural year.

The dealings on the Stock Exchange to-day
were on a more extensive seale than yesterday
and, as suggested in this column this morning
might be the case, interest extended to the
railway list, which supplied a large proportion
of the increased transactions, There was fairly
active trading jin Baltimore and Ohio isaues,
Atchison preferred, Missouri Pacific, Northern
Pacitle common, Southern Pacifle, Southern
Railway preferred, Union Pacifle common and
«., Bo and Quincy. They seored net
advances averaging more than a polnt
There appeared to be no abatement of interest
inthe iron and steel stocks,’ but in some of
them, notably in Steel and Wire and in Ten-
nessoe Coal and Iron, there appeared to be ex-
tensive realizing, Still allof them except the
firat named closed higher than vesterday.
There was further effective selling ot Third
Avenue, buta sharp rally from the lowest price
left it with a net loss of only a fraction. The
transactions as a whole were very widely dis-
tributed and indicated a growing pubiic inter-
est in the market,
