WILL THE LEAGUE LISTEN? |

 

OFFICIAL DEMANDS OF THE PLAYVERS'
PROTECTIVE ASSOCIATION.

 

No Contract With the Magnates to Be Signed
Without the Approval of Lawyer Taylor
and the Document Mast Ke Without Clauses
Against Which Protest Has Keen Made.

According to the constitution and by-lawa
of the Protective Association of Professional

Baseball Players, a copy of which is in the

possession of Tns Sun, the National League

will be asked to adopt a form of contract that |

cannot be signed by any ball player a member
of the aasociation until It has been approved
by the
of Buffalo. This polot ls made clear tn Article
VII of the by-laws as follows,

Each member, by signing hia name hereto, prom- |

{ses aud agrees to enter into No contract or agree

mentofl employment of any kind with any professional
baseball club or association whose play*rs are mem

bers of thts assoctation, or (he owner or any represent

alive thereof, unless sald contract or the form thereof
has been approved In writing by the attorney for this
association.

This, it ls believed, is a condition that a num-
ber of the League magnates will fight to the
bitter end. John L. Rogers of the Philadelphia
club, who drew up the present form of League
contract, is already on record as saying that
the demands of the players are unjust and
that no change will be made by the League
in the prevailing document. The players have
all signed the agroement, it is sald, and intend

to force the League to accept the above prop-
sition at almost any cost, The eontract to
be subioaltted to the League for adoption br
the Protective Association will embody these
polots, Ulustrated in Artigle I of the by-lawe
as follows

“This associauion shall at all thes uve tis best
eforis and promptly take all steps which it may
deem advisable, 1) w prevent auy member from
being lent (or farmed’), traded or sold to any base
ball club without his consent, unless sald lending,
troding o& selling be arranged on terms and cond
tous entirely satisfactory to Said member; (2) to pre
vent any member from being unjustly suspended
without pay, or from being unjustly deprived of any
orion of his salary by Ane or oberwise, of from
Seine In eny mar ! justly treated professionally
or financially by any c'ub owner

Lawyer Taylor has already
these demands are reasonable
league men, “if they are wise,’ will make cone
cessions of this character readily. ‘lhis parse
graph from Article Il]. of the by-lawa shows
that the duties of the Grievance Conunittee
are and also disclogua the ct that the come-
mittee ia composed of Zimmer of Pittsburg
and Jennings of Brooklyn, who must act in
concert with Lawyer Taylor

The Grievance Committee of the association shall
consist of the President and Secretary forthe first
year, and thereaficr of two membera to be elected at
the angual meetin Said committee shall have, and
itis hereby given, full powerto act {tn conjunction
with the legal adviser in passing on the merita of,
handling and adjusting all epertes grievances and
matters of difference between this association or Any
of {te Members and any club owner of owners, or any
league or association of baseball clubs

Ortevanoces will be brought to the notice of
the League 'n accordanoe with Article XI. of the
by-laws, as follows:

A commitier of one member shall be elected and kept
tn office by each team represented in this association.
Such committee shall be the sole Judge ast the Justice
of all complaints and &@rie ces in his team
and es to the advisabdliifty of submitting al-
leged grievances in his team to the Association
Grievance Committee. He shall prompUy trana-
mit all notioes, and especialiy as to arrearages
in dues, to the Seerrtary of the Assoctlation, or in
case the oMfice of secretary be vacant, to the Prest
dent: collect all fees and dues of members in Dis
team, and forward the fuly to the Treasurer; be
subject to removal at yiime by atwo-thirds vote

VICTORIOUS VESPERS HOME.

Winners of Eight-Oared Race at the Interna-
tional Regatta Arrive on La Bretagoe.

When the steamship La Bretagne was warped
tnto her dook yesterday morning the most
imposing group of passengers was the elaht-
oared crew of the Vesper Boat Club of Phila-

| delphia which returned after a decisive victory
{ in the world's championship race at Parts.
| The oaramen were standing on the hurricane
' deck with a large #tik national flag waving
| over thern, which they recetved after their
) victory. Their bronzed features denoted the
trained athlete, and the men gave the old Vesper
yell in appreciation of the return to their native

They received their fret greeting down the
bay, where @ comruittee from the Vesper Boat
Club, composed of Capt. Madden, C. Lawrence
and A. Cottingham and a number of local oars-
men, ret them on the tue Aarlem River No.1,
chartered for the occasion. The tug followed
the steamship up the river, keeping tp au in-
cessant whistling, while the men on it cheered
the victorious crew to the echo. Among those
on the dock to weloome the oarsmen were:
Mrs. J. B. Juvenal, Julius PD. Mabr, chairman of
N. A. A. O. Regatta Commitier: Fred Vilmar, Presi-
dent Harlem Regatta Association; Theodore Van
Raden, Atalanta B. C.; G. C. Sctnelder, Nonpareil
R. G, and G. Dempsey
Coxswain Abe}! was the first of the party to
come down the ganwplank, with the rudder of
the racing shell tueked under his arm, He
was at once beateged for particiJars of the race,
as only meagre reports had been received
He said that the course wus an excellent one,
with only @ Slight bend in the 1 mile and 153

yards. It resembled the new Speedway course,
with the exception that there was no ’
hinder or ajd the «rews on the Seine

wind blowing against the oarsmen, The caliber
of the crew was, however, proved in one of the

| the coxawaina wer jostly boys, Who zigzagged
the crews all over the river

The coxawaln recetved no prize an ta cus-
tomary in this country, but the meinbers of
the crew trooped down the gangplank, each
carrylug a bronze trophy about ¢ lahteer Inches
Nigh and representing a panther attacking a
stag. It gp peara that in the final heat of the
race Coach Dempsey stuck @ small American
flag in the stern of the boat, f
to the crew not to let the other boats pass it.
| The flag was afterward presented to Smith,
the American District inessenger boy, Who was
at Paria on the return journey after deliver-
ling hie n to Pretoriu. Coach Dempse
| told the story of tha trip to a reporter of THe
| BUN fn the following words

“We had considerable trouble tn getting our
shells to the ecens of the regatta. They were
conveyed on three diferent cars, and though
| we arrived at our training quarters on a Mon-

day, it was not until the following Thureday
| thatthe boats arrived, The wen did opt suffer
| frorn aeasickness at all, and they went to wo x
{rmediately in a borrowed shell. The men
were boated twice a day, and went over three-
quarters of the distance at full speed, slowing
up for the rest of the pay When going at
high pressure they rowed about 84 or 87 to the
| minute, a fast stroke, but one that it was nec-
essary tor them to maintain to wia over a short
course against the good crews we had to moet
There was not much tn the trial heat, as our
boys had it won from the etart and simply
paddled in.

The day of the final heat was the worst
that we experienced while there. A big wind
was blowing and the water was in no condition
for fast iine, The Vespers got away quickly
at the start, slighUr [n advance of the other
crews, and pulling thelr fast stroke, eraduelly
drew away unti] at five-clghthe of a mile they
led by two Jenaths, with the three other crews
bunched. From that point to the finish all
the crews spurted, the Vespers winning by
three open lengths, while the Ghent crew beat
the Holland eight by one-half length. The
quality of the crews which the Amerie is
| defeated may be judged from the fact that
in the trial heat Holland crew covered
the course of } mile 158 yards in 4 minutes
49 seconds, while the Ghent crew !n the trial
heat for the Grand Challenge cup at Hen'e
was beaten br only three-quarters of a lengt
by Leander, the winner of the cup. Fnalish-
men who were present at both regattas ex-

reased the opinion that the Veevers would
nave won at Henley by five or six lengths.
| When asked whether there is any likelihood
of an English crew coming here to try con-
clusions with the Vaspers, empeey said

vith etructi

essage

 

 

 

“Not the least ‘he Enegllehmen wonld
have no chance with our crew and! guess they
know it, Tha Vespers rowed better than they
ever did before, and their work was the finest

xhibition of rowing 1 have ever seen. The
| {mprovement ve ue {n @ great mensure to
the fact that all our efforts were on this oc-
easion conceptrate on the eight. When the
| crew rowed here the men too part In other
eventa on the same day, some seulling and
| others with sweeps In pers and fours, They
were lengths faster In the Paris race than tn
the trial event at the National Regatta.

 

SEPTEMBER 11,

“The arrangements for the regatta were |

first class, and the crews sent away in a better
manner than {in this country. The starter
stood on the banks of the river ao that he waa
| able to get the boate In a direct line The

shells were Uned up with the bows level, and
| this put us about six feet back of the other

orew in the trial heat, as our hoat was that
|

muoh longer. The start is by word of mouth,
not by i tol, and before the race our 1e
were well drilled in the French word “Parte!

by which they were deapatched.”

The oaramen were all pleased with thetr
| trip and treatment abroad. They were en-
tertalped at a banquet by the Socletle Nautique

de la Basse, Seine, after the racea. The shella
were transferred from [La Bretagne to the
railroad depot on the Harlem River, and the
oaramnen left on an afternoon train for their
homes. Arrangements have been made for
a bangiet {n honor of the crew, to
at Philadelphia. ®ho Vesper boathouse has
been reg ly decorated in celebration of the
crew's victory at Paris.

Ramohr and Ten Eyck Matched—Titus and
Mebrboff May Hace / gain.

The unsatisfactory results of several senior
eculling races this season will probably lead
to two interesting matches with the idea of
eettiing dleputed points, before sculls are put
away for the winter. E. H. Ten Eyck of Wor-
eester, who did not defend his tiUe as cham-
pion of Amertea, challenged J. A. Rumohr of
the Harlem Rowing Club to row at the Point
of Pines, a summer resort near Boston, for a
prize eaiued at $160. The latter has accepted
and the race will take place on Sept. 20. Unless
Rumohr rows {n much better style than he did
| at the Middie States regatta on Labor Day,
| he will have little chance against Ten Eyck,
| but the supporters of the flarlem man say that
| when he oares to exert himself he can at least
give Ten Eyck @ hard race, as shown by the
speed exhibited when he rowed up to the latter
in the trial race for the Parts regatta

The complications arising out of Rumolhr's
fouling of Mehrhoff at the Middle Siateg re-
qatta may lead to another match, tn which
tie interest will be almost as great as in the
rtruggle between the two champions ©. oS
Titus of New Orleans waa dissatisfied with
the ruling of the referee on that oceasion and
has challenged Mehrho, the winner of the race
| to another contest The Union Boat Club
{s trying to include the match In the programme
| for its regatta on Sept 22 but Mehrihoff has

not yet consented to this arrangemwat, tuouga
