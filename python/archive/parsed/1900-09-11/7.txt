REV. MR. LOYND'!

A London Despatch Says He ts in Glossop, ta
North Derbyshire, England.

Newacrok, Sept 10—A London deapatch
received here says that the Rev. David Loynd
is now at Glossop, in North Derbyshire, and
wives as his excuse for mysteriously disap-
pearing on Aug 22 from New York, instead
of coming to Newburah, as he areed, with
the Rev. Eben Creighton, pastor of Peor le's
Baptist Church, that his parishioners could
not pay his salary The Rev. Mr. Loynd is
an Enalish evangelist and missionary of seme
note, and his excuse for returning to England
lin the unceremonious manner he did causes

considerable eriticlam here, where some facta

in connection with his case are known. In an
interview here the Rev. Eben Creighton this

ternoon sald
oe first place, Mr. Loyni ts not an or-
dained minister, [n the second place, he had
no parishioners in New York, nor was he under
any engagement Consequently nothin was
said about salary. f[ am sure that this is not

DISAPPEARANCE.

 

 

 

the reason why he left. Fven if he was ex- |

yecting salary, no word was ever said to him
hat he would or would not receive it. Mr.
Loynd came to this country wholly of his own
accord, He simply wrote to me of his wishes
an! intentions t) come, whereupon L opened
to him my house and planne: to use him as @
singer in mv evangelistic work His failure
to appear at my house when he deliberately
set out to go there coult not do other than
arouse mv anxiety for his whereabouts

Mr. Creighton thinks that Mr, Loynd made a
grave mistake in returning to England without
sending him word of his decision so to do,
He is hoping that Mr. Loynd has a satisfactory
reason for this, but can account for Mr. Loynd’s
sudden return to England only on the supposi-
tion that he became convineed that he had
made a mistake in coming to America under
| the clreumastances that he did

Mr. List had charge of the office business,w hile
Mr. Seyd looked after the buving and selling
On Aug. 7 last Mr. Seyd advertised that the

notice caused some surprise in the trade. Mr

POUR ELECTRIC AMBULANCES,
Soon to Take the Place of Those Drawn by
Horses—Gifts to Hospitals.

Four automobile or electric ambulances are
| now building for private hospitals in thie city.
The Koosevelt, Presbyterian and New York
hospitals are making the experiment, St.
Vincent's Hospital has had an electric machine

for several months

Some time ago two friends of Roosevelt
Hospital offered to aive to the hospttal two
automobile ambulances The = offer, which
meant a total outlay of $6,000, was accepted,
These ambulances are now completed and will
be put ip operation as soon 4s arrangements
are ade at the hospital stables for charwing
the machines. They are7 feet 6 inehes long,
| which is about eighteen inches longer than the
ordinary horse-drawn arobulance, and welgh
4.809 pounds each. The ambulance surgeon
no longer will shout his lungs out to the driver,
but will talk in a low tone through a speaking
tube which runs the length of the ambulance

The same firm that is making the newRoosevelt
ambulances built the St. Vincent's ambulance
and is butiding the machines for the New York
and Presb; terian hospitals. They are all wifte
to the hospitals The Roosevelt ambulances
are somewhat longer and larger than the others,

ATTACKS ALL THE POLICE.

Purdy Tells the Court ‘There's Not An Honest
Man ta tuc Department.”’

Oo the trial of Arthur Featherstone in the
General Sessions yesterday for theft, Lawyer
Ambrose H. Purdy, Featheratone’s attorney,
attacked the veracity of Policeman Marin
of the West Twentieth streat police station,
who was a witness against the defendant.

“There’a not an honest man in the Police
Department of the city,” Mr. Purdy declared
among other things, and he asked Judge Cowe
ine to charge the Jury that the absence of an-
(ther policeman concerned in the arrest of
Featherstone was an acknowledgment on the
vart of the prosecution that his evidence would
have been in favor of the defendant and not
in accord with Martin's

Judge Cowing said that while he would not
conour in the lawyer's wholesale charge, h
would allow that the absence of the secon
polleeman might be construed by the jurer
as an acknowledgment that his evidence w.@
not have been a help to the prosecution. ‘lie
Jury disagreed

FINANCIAL AND COMMERCIAL.

 

Monpbar, Sept, 10.

While the business in stocks to-day was limited,
the tone of the market was good, There were
not many stocks that did not gain in price,
Conditions continued satisfactory, President
MoeKinley's letter of acceptance of his nomina-
tion for a second term had a distinotly favorable
influence on the financial situation While it was
known that money was moving to the South tn
sorne volume and that it soon would be flowing

to the Weat, the offerings of tunds, both on eall ,

and on time, were in excess of the demand and
rates were practically unchanged

The state of foreign exchange was such
as apparently to preclude gold exports, for
the present at any rate. If there are to be
no further shipments of gold to Europe, the
requirements for handling the crops probably
can be supplied without difficulty. Were
there a normal order of things abroad, Imports
of gold might be looked for this fall, but there
ia tension in all the European money markets
and 80 long as this continues to be the case
gold will not come this way. Gold doubtless
will keep on coming from Australia, as well
as from the Klondike and Alaska, and these
arrivals, with the output of the Western mines,
will add st-adily and largely to the country’s
stock of money

There has been an important increase in
national bank circulation since the new finan-
cial measure became a law, This is some
thing that has contributed materially to the
ease in money throughout the country In
September last yearthe New York banks lost,
in round numbers, $26,000,000 in cash, Sep-
tember this year will hardly show a loss of
half that amount The bank statement on
Saturday showed a surplus reserve of $26,-
056,250 = Aocordingly, the position of the banks
is a strong one The fact that speculation
is light helps to hold down rates for money
The belief is growing that rates may not at
any time during the remainder of the year go
above 6 per cent

While the news of the devastation in Texas
by the tropieal storm caused a sharp rise in
cotton, ite effect on stocks was small The
shares of roads that sustained property dam-
age, or were likely to lose traffle as a conse-
quence of the storm, receded only fractionally
The election in Maine was not a speculative
factor to any appreciable extent, and the com-
plleations in China were disregarded  Brook-
lyn Rapid Transit led in the dealings A good
many shorts in this stock were covered and
there was a material improvenent in its price
It was said that the detailed annual report
might be issued at the end of the week

he annual report of the Metropolitan Street
Railway Company did not stimulate trading in
its stock People’s Gas was in request on the
understanding that the gas war in Chicago
would be brought to an early termination
Sugar Refining displayed etrength, although
it was lass active than usual The steel stocks
were quiet, but thelr tendency seemed to be
to move to @ higher level Notwithstanding
the threatened strike in the anthracite coal
regions Reading first preferred was bought
and it pleked up in price. There was a fair in-
quiry forthe Granger stocks, Atchison, Union
Pacific and Southern Railway preferred. Bouth-
ern Pacific was sold
