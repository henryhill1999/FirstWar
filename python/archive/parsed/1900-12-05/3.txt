NEW RULING ON RETIREMENT IAW.

Men Incapacitated for Sea Service May Not
Retire While Fit for Other Duty.

Warntncton, Deo 4 -The Attorney-Cieneral
haa rendered an opinion that a naval officer
fujured in the line of duty and incapacitated
for sea service may not be placed on the retired
list as long as he is able to perform other duties,
The case on which the opinion was found is
that of lieus George Maliison (Junior grade),
who, while an ensigniin 1895, received injures
onsh{pboard, by the breaking of an anchor chain
which enused the amputation of a leg  Sub-

sently he was promoted without objection
to be Lieutenant,junior grade,and ts now oligihie
for promotion to the full grade of Lieutenan
The Atrorney-General holds that Taeut. Malli-
fon received his injuries in the line of duty and
that “such wounds do not incapacitate hitn
for other duties in the grade to which he shull
he promoted "

Lieut Mallison will be promoted subject to
the necessary examination. He is. stationed
at Seatue, Wash, as Hydrographio OMcer

DIMENSTONS OF THE CANAL

“A depth of 4 feet at mean low water
and a bottom: width of 10 feet were adopted
fs standard dimensions for a canal in exocava-
tion by each route. ‘This width is for stratght
sections: on curves with a radius of lesa than

for cach goo feet reducuon of radius, the width
thus becoming iso feet on a curve of 6,000 feet

tom width is increased to 200 feet, in the San

{n fresh water, If the heaviest class of freight
steamers is to use the isthiaian canal, 85
fectisthe leastdepth that should be adopted

A wiuth of 150 feet will allow all but the very
largest ships to pass each other in the exca-
vated portions of the canal; if two such large
thips meet, one will have to take the bank
while the other goes by. smaller ships will pass
each other aud larger ships without stopping

“The most diMticult engineering work in con-
nection with the Nicaragua Canal project,”
sayé the commission, ‘is the construction of @
dam across the San Juan River to hoid back
the waters of the lake and enable ite level to be
regwaied, It is of great importance that this
dam should be located above the mouth of the
San Carlos River, as the lutier discharges at
times as much as 100,000 cubic feet of water per
second, carrying with it great quantities of
sand. The Nicaragua Canal Commission made
search for a dain site above the mouth of the San
Carlos, ip Whatis called the Agua Muerta (dead
water) One was found at a place about two
tutles above the mouth of the San Cerlos River,
The maximum depth to hard rock is about forty
feet below sea level, or about 100 feet below
jow water tn the river at the site, which will
iuake it necessary to construct the foundation
ofthis part of the dau by the pneumatic process.
fhe datu in the deepest part will then have a
height of about 150 feet. As the pneumatic
process is an expensive and slow one at best,
this Comuniseion has made arch for an alter-
native site a few miles further up the river,
where the topographical and surface indications
seemed lo offer favorable results, Oue has been
found which gives promise of amore sulslactory
abd loss expensive solution of tus proviem.

TAN YEARS TO BULLD THE CANAL,

“The time required to build the Nicaragua
Canal hinges almost entirely on the time re-
quired for the construction of the Boca San
Carlos dam. After a harbor las been opened
at Greytown, and a railroad construct +d, the
way will be open to attack the worn from a
great many points at the same time, so that if
apie funds @re then available the excava-
tion of the prism of the canal ought to be com-
pleted in a comparatively short time if prose
cuted with vigor Phe construction of the dam,
however, will bea costly and tedious operation.
hight years would probably be « reasonable
estunuate tor the time of building this dam.
