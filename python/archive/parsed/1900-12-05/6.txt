Variety show followers will be startled to
learn that the Ruesell Brothers are playing a
new sketch. For more years than it takes most
persons to achieve a cure of the vaudeville
habit, these comedians have been made up
ae Irish servant girls. In that disguise they
quarrelled comically, one Russell sang a ditty
sentimental in the quality of tenor that isa
staple, the other burlesqued bits of tragedy,
and both danced a lively jig. This was the
formula long before continuous shows were
known. The only change from it was a brief
burlesque of “The Two Orphans,” in which the
more comic of the two Russells was the blind
girl, It was funnier even than his too famillar
travesty of “Camille,” but was not retained
Now the two, after hesitation #0 pronounced
as to bring about a week's postponement, are
plaving a really fresh sketch at Proctor’s Fifth

Avenue. George M. Cohan isits author. “A
Romance of New Jersey” isa title that doesn't
fit very closely, because the fun depends solely
upon the Russells, who still are Irish servant
girls and stil are quarreling

At the time of Sir Arthur Sullivan's death,
“Patience” was in revival in London for the
first time aince {ts firet long term, excepting
{n mubnrban theatres. The separation he-
tween Sullivan and Gilbert was so complete
that, because the librettist directed the re-
hearsals, the musician would not go near
them. It was a coincidence that Oscar Wilde,
whose travesty of estheticiam was the sub-
fect of the “Patience” satire, died in the
firet week of the reproduction, Sullivan
had written the melodies of a! new Irish
operetta, but had done nothing with the

IMPORTER SUSPECTED THEOBAID

When Hie Tranks Were Heid, Necanse He Had
Kan Against Theobald Helore.

Tt came out at the Custom House yesterday
that Willam H Theobald was the customs
oMoer that Julius Stern, {mporter, whose
trinks were detained on the arrival of the
Louls for appraleal of their contents and
afterward released, suspected of having
caused the detention. Mr Stern went to the
Custom House yesterday and was referred
to the Collector's offlos. Here, according
to Deputy Collector Couch, be made no com-
plaint against anybody and did not mention
Theobald’s name. It did not appear that
Theobald had caused the detention of his
trunks this time, but there Is a story of two
years ago back of Mr. Stern's suspicions

Theobald and he were schoolmates and
are members of the same lodge and Jewls)
congregation. They met abroad two years
ago at the time Theobald was interesting
hitaself in Phyllis Dodge and her diamonds
Theobald is said to have asked Mr Stern
for one of his ecards and writing his name on
the back of it to have returned it :

 

Nr

remarking
When vou come back vou just let me know

Iwo or three weeks later Mr Stern did
come back to this country His baggage
was passed all fieme by the regular officers,
but then a special custome officer appeared
Mr. Stern was made to go back on the stear-
ship and there he was stripped and searched
and all his effects were searched with the
discovery of nothing but a few unitnportant
articles upon which sooner than have any
further fuss he paid $3 or 84 of Guty

Mr. Stern was very angry and he talked
about the matter freely, denouncing to var!-
ous persons the treatinent that Le believed
Theobald was responsible for It {4 to this
talk that he attributes his papers when
he landed from the St. Louis Inst Saturday
He declared certein articles in his baggage
that he intended as presents, and aleo soe
samples of the sort of merchandise in which
he deals, for which samples he had consular
invoices. His baggage was examined cares
fully by the customs inspectors and he paid
$285 duties. The trunks were on the point
of jeaving the pier when he encountered
Theobald. The trunks were presentiv again
taken in charge by the custome officers an
ordered to the appraiser's stores. Their
contents were examined on Monday and ft
was found that $20 too much duty had already
been collected” It appears that trunks con-
taining merchandise imported as merchandise
must always go to the appraiser's stores

As to af s Theonald said yesterday: “1
have nothing at all to do with that case 1
did sea Mr. Stern on Saturday, but 1 had
nothing to do with sending bis trunks to the
appraiser's stores Yes, it is a fact 1 saw
him in Paris two years ago. Why, we were
schoolmates. 1 have no quarrel with him,

Harry N. Ayres of 28 Debevoise place
Brooklyn, who boasted of Die influence with
Renator Thomas ¢ Platt ond who waa ar
rested ou Saturday night for sending threat
*wag lettere to Mra Mary Curry, a young
widow of 15 Debevoise place, was arraigned
before Magistrate Brenner in the Adame

street police court yesterday

Mre Curry testified that she hed known
Avies for three years She ssid he called
at the house on Saturday night last and in
the presence of her brother-in-law, Thomas
Curry admitted sending the letters It came
out in the course of the examination that
Patrolman Thomas Fay, who waa recently

transferred from Brooklyn to Staten Island,
Visited Mra. Curry at times and that Ayres
became jealous of him

Ayres then took the stand He admitted
the charge and said 1 wrote the letters
What's the use of denying it. I wrote them
to keep Mr Fay from going to Mre. Curry's
bouse as 1 didn't think him a proper person
to come around. 1 did It for the sake of the
lady and of him as well But, Judge, I'm
harmless, I assure you, perfectly harmless.
1 wouldn't hurt anybody.”

Harmless’ said Magistrate’Brenner. “Then
why did you write such letters?”

“For the lady's sake,” said Ayres. "I hope
you wont tind me guilty and send me to jail
I will lose my job and be thrown on the street

like a dow Can't vou put me under bonds
to keep the peace. L'll keep it, indeed I will—
lam perfectly harmless.”

What do you mean by writing ‘lan ready

to strike the blow that will stagwer some
one like the kick of a mule?" asked Magis-
trate Brenner

{ meant that I would tell another man

who is interested in Mrs. Curry about Fay,”
pad Ayres

“What do vou mein by saving: ‘Iam going
to shoot him down lke a dow I have done
ing What I am going to do?’ * Magistrate
ner asked

[ sinply meant that T would not ho'd my
tongue anv longer,” said Ayres

Patrolman Thomas Fay then handed a
letter to Magistrate Brenner and begged
him to read it. Magistrate Brenner said
it was not part of the complaint and could
not be read, The patrolman, whose eyes
were filled with tears, again begged the Mag-
istrate to read it

“This man has injured me an awful lot,”
said Fav

In this letter Ayres had written these ex-
tracts

“T waited around for hours for the police-
man to come and take me, but none showed
up, and it is just as well for him that he didn't,
for I was ready to sand him to the same kind
of a.@rave that Tommy Fay, vour Irish Catho-
He friend, will wet just as sure as there is a
God above, if he don't quit you forever

  

After 10 P M tomorrow I can thank you
for sending me to my death Your own ree
lations are talking about you and him No
wonder IT got wise and your children look
upen you with suspicion You must be
crazy to throw vourself awav ona dow like
he is He haa made vou look in the eves of

hundreds lower than a dog.”

“They are on the lookout) Now, toa tell
Fay's wife where he spends his evenings
and a sweet ecandal is going to be in the
yapers about vou And all your own fault
Nobody to blame but yourself You surely
mist be crazy or nearly so Fay tells

vou he is not married he lies and deceives
you Ask his own parenta whether he is
of ia not, but not the one he tells rou to ask
A scoundrel like him would sell his oath for

 

A beer

Ayres said he meart no harm hr these
threats and pleaded that he was as harm-
less as a child) His emplover testified that
Ayres was ateadyv, sober and industrious
and a good bookkeeper

“He mav be all of that.” said Magistrate

Rrenner, “and at the same time mav he dane
werous The defendant is held for the Court
of Special Sessions

Rail was fixed at $490. and as Ayres could
rot furnish it: he was sent back to Raymond
Street Jail

 

FOR UNITED EVANGELICAL FFFORT.

William Philips Rall Explains Scope of Recently
Inaugtrated Movement,

William Philine Hall gave out a statement
vesierday concerning the national movement
for evangelical effort within the ehurches
which was in part formulated on the previous
afternoon, and imperfect tnformation
cerning whic, he said, had already been
published) The conference, held in the
Twenty-third street association rooms, was
attended by representatives of Boston, Phila-
delphia and New York churc!.es and societies,
and letters were read from men prominent

in various religous bodies ail over the country
As to what was decided Mr Hall ssid ;
All at the conference were agreed aa to
the importance of a united and evangelical
effort within the churches, to be begun as soon
fs possible, and to be mii: tained not merely
during the opening month of the new century,

cone

 

 
 

     

   

 

Dut permanently The suggestion wae made
that the movement be directed by representa-
tive mon! ters and invimen of each of the
evangelical den nations «and represe ta-
tives of ea of the evangelical Christian
societies. Their effort is to be effected by
such persons as individuals and not as oMecial

 

ftheir churches and societies
The movement is to have but one objeet in
view, namely, the simple preaching of and
witnessing to Christ and Pim erucified for
the reweneration of the unsaved and the
sanctification of believers

“The movement is founded upon the Bible
as the Word of God and upou the evangelical
basis. By common consent all controversy
is to be barred, and the entire movement ie
to be carried on by the churches aad Christian
socie es.
