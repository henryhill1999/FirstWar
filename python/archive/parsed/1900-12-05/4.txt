NEW BUYER AT GARDEN,

JOHN ALFRED GFTS SEVERAL HORSES
ron THE RAHAMA ISLANDS.

Seventy-one Head Sold Yesterday for 818,000
The Haron Witkes Mare Princess Mackey
Hringe @1,080 Trotter Albert Powell
Knocked Down tot. Maver of Rocheeter.

Phat New York ia (he centre of the horse
market of the United States, If not of the
world, was proven yesterday by the interest
manifested on the part of buyers from @ very
partol the country and from Europe, at the
Fasig-Tipton Company's at) Madison |
Sjuare Garden lt is doubtful if there ever
was such an attendance, both of buyers and
the general public on the second day ofa
second week's suie, When the least desirable |
horses are supposed to be allthatislett. For
eight days tniilionaire horse breeders, w ealthy
road drivers and a myriad of horsemen of
lesser degree have stood about the arena of
sat in the boxes and watched some of the
best light barness horses pass under the
hammer without a sign of luiling inverest

Many good things are being shown on the
last days, 4nd yesterday prices were hept up
beyond expectation. Many animals were’
sold at better prices than the most astute
horesinan would have predicted. ‘There were
no sensational sales, but the regular run of
prices was surprising. The top amount of the
day was realized for the brown mare Princess
Mackay, by Baron Wilkes, in the consignment
from Mason Farm, Taunton, Mass., J. Stewart
of this city getting her for @ J.V Bay-
Mee's bay trotter Albert Powell, 2.18',, created
aripple of exciternent when he was driven in
and two or three horsemen wanted him, but
they all dropped out at $700, except T. Meyer,
of Rochester, who secured him for $710.

The foreign buyers added several to the
lot which they will ship to Europe on next
Saturday, although they were bought under
New York names. They will take over more

from this sale than they did last December,
ppd the prices they have paid will averace
er.

One of the features of thesale is that few of
the horses are bought by local horsemen . 7
great majority of them go to other places |
which is proof tat New York is the great
distributing point. Yesterday an entirely
new fleld for the American trotter was un-
covered by John Alfred, who bought two or
three for exportation to the Baharna Islands
Several combination harness and saddle
horses were sold for good prices last night.

SKIPPER OF NEW CUP DEFENDER.

 

Manager Duncan Appoints Capt. Urias Rhodes,
an Old Yacht Handler.

Urias Rhodes has been appointed skipper
of the new America’s Cup defender. Mr.
W. B. Duncan, Jr, made the announcement
yesterday afternoon. The appointment
Will be pleasing to all vachtsmen. Last year
while it was agreed that Capt. Charley Barr
was an able skipper, many did not like his
selection as the sailing master of the Co-
lumbia because he was born in Seotland.
The fact that he ts a naturalized citizen of
this country made no difference with these

critics
Capt. Rhodes is an American. He was
born 48 years ago, and has been a

sailor as long as he can remember. He lives
with his family at Bay Shore, L. I. He has
served on yachts froin the loweat position
before the mast His first experience in
@ cup race Was 43 a seaman on the Atlantic
in 1886, when that sloop sailed against the
Puritan and Mayflower in the triais for the
honor of defending the trophy against the
Galatea. Next he was mate on the Volun-
teer. After that he had charge of the
schooner Sea Fox and then the Montauk.
When John EF. Brooks had the schooner Lasca
built Capt. Riodes was appointed skipper and
he handled that yacht for four years. When
J. 1. Watson went across the Atlantic in the
Lasca Capt. Rhodes was the sailing master
and navigator. In 1898 Mr. Duncan selected
Capt. Rhodes to sail the Defender, and in all
that yacht's races against the Columbia she

was superbly handled and in some races
Cart. Rhodes clearly outgeneralled@ Capt.
Rarr on the Columbia, Last season Capt.

Rhodes had charge of the schooner Emerald,
owned by W. E. Iselin, but that yacht did not
take part in any races.

Capt Rhodes is a modest, retiring man.
He has hosts of friends and is well liked
by the crews he has commanded. He is
particularly good at the start of arace. This
was shown by the way he handied the Le-
fender, and Capt. Sycamore will have to be
a wonder to get the better of him.

 

Annaal Meeting and Dinner of Manhasset Bay
Yacht Club.

The annual meeting and dinner of the
Manhasset Bay Yacht Club was held last

ty-third street. The usual reports were

{shing condition. The following officers

Commodore, Hazen L. Hoyt, steamer Belle Hazen;
Vice-commodore, M. Roosevelt Schuyler, cutter Jessica;
Kear Commodore, Stephen W. Roach, steamer Emeline;

| for three years, George B. Wilson and James Francs;

for two years, Augusin Monroe and Julian Rex; for
one year, Horatio k. Harper and W. W. Phillips.

After the dinner prizes won in the club's
regattas last summer were presented. The
fortunate yachtsmen were:

A. MacCreery, Seymour J. Hyde. Ralph N. Ellis, J.
R. Maxwell, ¢. T. Pierce, W. Holah, J.8. Appleby, Johns-
ton de Forest, H. M. Crane, L. J. Alburger, K. Bavier,

New York. It was an even game through-
out the first century and then the Westerner
cut away from his adversary with runs of
12, 12, 25, 146 and @ He kept up the pace to

and asked the court to set aside the verdict
Some of the reasons advanced would have
been humorous, only for the serious elect
the verdict might have ontheir means ofearn-
Ing a livelihood. There are many new cases,
the result of last season's campaign; several
old ones which have been held over, or appeals
for rehearing, und @ inass of evidence which
will have to be considered. Secretary Gochers
collection of legal-looking documents gave
the board room the appearance of a busy
court.

One of the most interesting cases of the
session was that in which Vernon Miller,
the young driver and trainer, sturdily de- |
fended himself against a charge of halvng |
used the pacer Topsy 5., 2.00%, a8 a “ringer |
under the name of Garnet. The latter is a |
chestnut mare, foaled in 1804, and made a |
record last season of 2:14%. Miller hails
from Oneida Castle, N.Y, where he runs @
farm on Shares successfully He
that parties approached him last spring and |
tried to get him to sign a paper about a horse, |
Which would enable them to make not less
than $300 out of the transaction an | he should |

ward, he alleged, one of the par.ivs sial
he would make him sweat for ref ising

Mr. Miller proved conclusively by his own |
teatimony and several affidavits that he |
had bred and raised the mare Garnet. He |
campaigned her last season and drove her |
in sixteen races. When he reached Brock-
on, Mass., her identitication was called for, |
{t being charged that she was Topsy 8 He |

Trotting Association in motion in an effort
to find Topsy S., as {t was said that Garnet
resermbled her closely. W. F. Steadman,

where it was said at the tlme that she was

Was about to send a man there to see her,
he was told that she had been shipped to

The report of the race at the time created

S. S. Layman entered a protest against
a fine of $50 which was imposed upon him
by the judges at the Empire City Grand
‘ircuit meeting last fall, in the 2:21 trot, with
ip T., wherein it was alleged that he laid
up heats He said that his horse was hitting
hhnselt and he could not turn him loose for
fear he would break and that he received
po chance to win. He was represented by
a lawyer, but the board sustained the judges
and he will have to pay

Quite an interesting story was brought
out in a case wherein Driver Birney asked
for the identification of the mare, Fan fs.
» that defeated his entry im a race at \\il-
famsport, Pa. It was said that she was a |
thoroughbred, sent to Kentucky to be bred
to Hanover; that she liad been broken to har-
ness and showed a lot of speed at the trot
png galt. Driver Wilson, who handled
annie K., said that she was ail right and
Was not a thoroughbred. Birney met
William Hukill of Paris, Ky., in Madison
Square Garden rstperou afternoon and was

told that the thoroughbred mare bred
by Pierre Lorillard and sent _ to Kentucky
was dead, and that the mare Fannic h. was
by Bourbon Kussell and all right. As soon
as Birney heard this he went before the
board and withdrew hia protest.

An echo from the noted Dandy 9. case,
in which the negro, Joe Hicks, created so
much merriment before the board last year, |
was heard yesterday, when the application
of James O'Brien, alias James Red, for re-
moval of expulsion, was brought up. I
will be remembered that Dandy 0. was raced |
under the name of Dr. D.,, and then mys-
ertously disappeared. The application was |

Several cases in which gulleless owners
of racing material made or thought they had
made conditional entries were heard and in
every instance the board ruled that they
must pay the entrance money, William |
Bailey, former Vice-President of the Louis
ville Association, applied for a release of the
fine of $650 paid by that association under
protest, in the case where the organization
was ordered to report suspensions against
drivers whose fines it had remitted Mr
Bailey said that the association had remitted
the fines through misingormation regarding
its power todo so and threw himself on the
mercy of the board. The application was |
denied. Several other cases of toment. |

were disposed of by refusal of reinstatement.

Harry K. Deveraux, the amateur reinsman
of Cleveland, was present to get a ruling of |
the board as to whether his horse, John A
McKerron, that won the cup of the Boston |
Matinee Club and went a mile in 2:10, should
receive a record. ‘The matter will probably |
be decided to-day

Phil Daly Defeats Jockey Sloan at the Traps,

The fifty-bird match yesterday at Inter-
state Park between Phil Daly of Long Branch
and Tod Sloan, the Jockey, for $250 a side,
resulted in a victory for Daly by a score of
43 to a2. It was intended that each man
should shoot at 100 pigeons for $100 a side,
but the easterly gale that swept across the
grounds, coupled with the driving and blind-
ing rainstorm, caused the match to be de-
cided as above Both men shot in capital
form. Daly was a trife the steadier, but
Sloan's judgment was excellent_and he used
his 8 snd barrel with fine effect Of his
lost birds, four fell dead over the boundary
At the half-way toark they were even up,
but in the last twenty-‘ Ive Tod fell behind

After it was all
conqueror to another meteh and they will
rave it out again shortly at the same traps
fundreds of dollars changed hands on the
result Daly was the original t i hour

will run a club in Baltimore undes the -—
pleas of the new organization oF there wil
he a clash with the National, McGraw says
he will take the matter into the courts if the
National League interferes with his venture.
"The National League magnates, as a whole, |
are saving nothing which appenrs strange in |
view of the explosive propensities of many of
them. For this reason it 16 believed that the
scheme is cut and dried and that when an |
fron-clad alliance between the two, Leagues |
has been effected, the ball players’ associa- |
tion will be thrown down hat 1. It is gene- |
rally believed that the American Leaguers |
lookingthead to the time when the agree-
met binding the National League clubs |
together will be dissolved. That will occur |
{immediately after next season and there will |
he one of the biggest upheavals on record '
in baseball. This is what Johnson is after |
and his friends say that the American will |
for a new organization, |
from which objectionable persons and exist-
\

 

 

ins evils will be eliminated

The National magnates have so far re-
frained from openly antagonizing the Aineri- |
can League, whieh turther convinces the
uiblic that everything is understood, But
ii reports are true there may be an outbreak
at any moment after the magnates arrive,
According to reliable information the Na-
tional League, because of poor business last
season and the enormity of the debt tneurred
by the reduction of the circuit from twelve
to eight clubs, is anxious to lighten its finan.
eal burden The advent ot the American
League affords a chance to do this. ‘The
National purchased the grounds in Wash-
ington and the franchise from the Wagner
brothers for $37,500, to be paid in notes cover. ;
ing three years ne-third of this amount |
has been paid. The grounds in Baltimore
were purchased from Abell, Von der Horst, |
and Ebbets for $30,000, of which
The National
usiness,wWant the
aome money for

 

Leaguers, pice on sve - b
American League to put up.
Heright to play ball in W ashington and Balti-
more and there comes another rub. The
qnagnates say that James Manning, who ts to
have Washington, ought to pay over at least
412,000 to the League and that the Wagners
themselves, for the good of baseball, should
forfeit #10,000 of the debt dn return for the
Philadelphia franchise In the American
League, which the Wagners are after. The
mnagmaites also see a chance to make McGraw !
and Robinson pay part of the money due to
Hanlon & Co, but MeGraw has decla ed
that he will not put up a cent for the league
park in Baltimore, but will build another
gronnd at his own expense that will be more
venient. So it can be seen that there is
tv of work before the magnates so far
