ALASKA,

SEATTLE, May 28.—The present week will wit-
ness the closing of the great rush to Cape Nome
for this season, twenty-three steamers and
thirty sailing vessels having departed from
thia port since April 15, when the schooner
Gen, McPherson led the fleef out,
ships are due to sail from Seattle within the
coming week, and thev will carry 2,000 pas-
sengers. There are 6,000 already on the sea.
The steamers that have gone are announcing
their seoond sailing dates from the middle to
the last of June, anticipating but little trouble
in unloading freight and passengers on the
open roadstead at Nome, where knowing ones
predict their trouble will only commence,
There are no facilities for landing excepting
by the lighters and surf boats carried by each
vessel, and these will fare badly among the
rollers.

While this Nome stampede has apparently
overshadowed everything else here, there has
been a ceaseless tide flowing into Alaska by
other routes. There are regular steamers
plying on the inner route by way of Linn Canal
and Skagway, which sail daily from thia port,
frequently carrying 100 to 200 passengers.
These steamers, besides being large passenger
earriers also load heavily with freight, which
consists mainly of provisions and mining mach-
inery, the latter increasing very rapidly
and denoting a large amount of mining de-
velopment in southeastern Alaska and the
Klondike, This inside trade with Alaska,

attention, has been steadily increasing and is
growing beyond the capacity of the present
fleet of steamers. It is not only in the gold
and copper mines that the country is rich, nor
is it in the fishertes; coal and petroleum will
soon be among the leading productions. Sey-

WARSITINGTON

Srartir, May 28—The Manila mine in Kel-
ler district, Stevens county, whieh has been
under bond to Spokane parties, will be taken
up this week and the mine will pass into new
hands. The censideration is¢75 000, The Little
Joe, inthe same district, has also changed hands
at a similar price, New strikes are reported
in several of the leading properties, particu-
larly the Cuba, which is showing ore that runs
as high as 60 per cent. copper, besides good gold
and silver values, Rich copper is being found
in the Dewey and other properties,

On Kanaka Buy, San Juan Island, mining
operations are being carried on, the minerals
being copper, gold, silver and lead. The veins
are of goéd width and the ores carry values
from $30 to $40 per ton
on tidewater, where vessels can take the ores
frog the wharves and transport them to a
smelter at less than $1 a ton, The develop-
ment is not suffteient to determine the extent
of the deposits, but the location is very attrac-
tive.

In Republic district there isa henithy
twenty to thirty properties are un
opment

There is more activity ins Okanogan district
than in any ether section of the State, because
Eastern capital is taking hold of partially de-
veloped properties and going to the deep where
they are developing good mines.

&8 ore can be treated at a profit, whereas. three
vears ago the smelter charges exceeded that
amount and no ore was ahipped unless the

LAKE REGION IRON MINES.

Duuuta, Minn., Jane 1.—Several exploring
parties on the Menominee and Marquette ranges
ave stopped work because they found no
ore of quality high enough to pay. The de-
mand for low-grade ore seems to have dropped
out of sight, and independent properties pro-
ducing this class are preparing to close or re-
duce their output. In this manner quite a
reduction in the output of the Lake region
will be gradually ected. There is a sort
of preliminary arrangement for restricting
@ production that looks larger now than it did
a few months ago, and some of the large com-
panies are Fotfonhing in explorations and
new properties In a quite marked way. There
is still an active demand for mines that can
be bought at prices that are considered rea-
sonable. As a result the independent ex plora-
tions, particularly on the Mesaba range, con-

The American Steel and Wire Company
that closed its Sauntry mine last week has
reopened shipments with one shovel.

At the village of Michigamme, which up to
a year ago had. been deserted for a score of
years, there are now five busy mines and 500
men in them. These forces are added to as
as fast as room is found in the workings.

Echoes ef the Harlem Regatta—Several Rec-
ords Broken,

Except in a few instances Harlem River oare-
men got a respite from active training » eater
day. The more sensational performances at
the regatta on Saturday were the theme of
general comment on the balconies and floats
and many plans were made by beaten crews
to reverse the order of finish in the National
Regatta.

A study of the record tables showed that the
Vesper eight, in addition to defeating the best
crews in the Metropolitan district, covered the
one-mile course in the fastest time on record.
This was 4 minutes 58 seconds. The best pre-
vious figures were 6 minutes 1 second, by the

Nonpareil B. C. junior eight in 1890, The first
Bohemian senior eight won in 1804 in 4 minutes
53 seconds, but owing to a schooner being
anchored at the beginning of the course, the
distance was reduced, and the tine is not ac»
cepted as the record,
he members of the Harlem R. C. were con-

siderably upset by their defeats in the senior
eights and senior doubles, but have by no
means relinquished the hope of winning at the
National In one or both of these events, Several
causes are aaniqned for their defeat by the Ves-
pers in the eight-oared events. The principal
one is that the Harlems were forced to row
{n an old paper shell that is down at the middle

The crew previous to the regatta rowed a
trial over in 4 minutes 62 seconds, which is six
seconds faster than the Vespers’ winning ime,
The fact that Rumohr had rowed in three hard
races and Nagle inone rer to the eight-oared
event is also thought to have contributed to
the defeat of the local arew.

, The Harlems took the defeat of Romohr and
Nagle by Juvenal and Hedley in the double
even more to heart than the falling down of
the eight, They predict a speedy reversal of
theform. The poor showing made by the New
Yorkers is traceable in a measure to the posi-
tions, as the localmen were unfortunateindraw-
ing the New York station. It is also thought

 

 

'
|
!
j

that the Harlemites were not properly keyed |

up for two races within four davsand that their
brilliant vietory over Juvenal and Hedley at
Passaic on Memorial Day took the edge off
their sculling.

The record for the intermediate four-oared
vig crews was also smashed on Saturday by the
Institute, who covered the mile in 5 minutes
N2)¢ seconds against 5 minutes 44% seconds
made by the Vespers in 1804, The four crew
of the Harlems also established new figures for
the junior gig race of 5 minutes 364% seconds

REAL ESTATE NEWS.

 

 

 

The forma! records of transfers and mort-
gages turnished the only items of exceptional
interest in realty circles last week. The sales
announced at private contract were not es-
pecially noticeable. On the other hand, those
persons who have been buying valuable prop-
erty recently seem to have settled quite unan-
imously upon last week as the most desirable
time to take title, the result being the transfer
of all the pieces sold by the Roman Catholic
Orphan Asylum through the Barney-Sheldon
syndicate to the purchasers; the lota on East
Seventy-third street sold through John N
Golding to Joseph Pulitzer, and of the Filth
Avenue Hotel and Madison Square Theatre
property to the Fifth Avenue Hotel Land Com-
many.

The latter transfer was of especial interest,
for it brought out in a manner what is likely to
become of that property, acter present leases
expire in 1998. Mr. Eno said on Saturday that
the choice lay between a hotel building and an
| office building, with no decision as to either

Should an offlee building be put up the plans
| contemplate a particularly fine structure. The

matter is pather far in the finer fat now, how-

ever, and when the time to buile

be easier to tell whether the hotel trade has

moved along uptown or whether there would

be a sufficient demand for offices to warrant the
company to build. Not a few of the leading
brokers of the city declare that the building of
office structures is being overdone. This opin-
ion is shared by brokers in the Madison Square
neighborhood, as well as those located down
town in the financial district. In the course of
time there will doubtless be demand for all the
rooms contemplated in the structures now in
process of erection, but just now the demand ts
said to exceed the supply. The same views
are held regarding the erection of apartment
houses, and it isa fact that quarters may be

| secured well uptown atremarkably low prices,

the decision. Lenny should not have reer\ved worse
than a draw, for he met Barrett's rushes with pre
cision and was fresh at the finish. Neither were
marked to any extent. FEaddle Dougherty waa the
