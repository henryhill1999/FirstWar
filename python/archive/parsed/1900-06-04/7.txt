AUTOMOBILISTS RETURN.

eeneneeeaa
Nine Successful Ones Stragsic Back From
Philadelphia.

Nine o'clock yesterday morning was the time
ordered for nine automobilists and their car-
riage companions to leave Philadelphia and
return to New York, from where they had
started in a total company of twenty on
Saturday morning. The order was not a cheer-
ing one, but most of the chaffeurs heeded it and
started, if not at 9 o'clock, at least some time
during the day. They arrived, most of them,
here last night. There was no attempt at
kéeping in line or together on the way home.
They simply straggled back. The dinner at

the terminus in Philadelphia was probably
that has

the most oongratulatory affair
ever happened in automobile history
in America. It celebrated the first run of

more than 100 miles ever attempted by auto-
mobiles, and while nine finishers out of twenty
starters may seem asmall proportion to the in-
experienced, it was more than the sharps ex-
pected, The latest arrivals, who were not re-
ported in THE SUN yesterday, got in between
11 o'clock and midnight. They were: Capt
flomer Hedge and Langdon Barber, in a steam
machine; Harry L. McGee and Edwin Adams in
an electric surrey; L, R. Adams and Fred Gano
in a gasolene carriage; W. H. Hall and Henry
N. Fletoher in a wasolene runabout, and John
Milliken and,Robert J. Graf in an electrio sur-
rey.

Because of the lack of order in which the
motor vehicles left the Waldorf-Astoria at 7:30
Saturday morning and the independent way in
whioh they ran the distance, accurate details
were diffoult to obtain, and at Philadelphia It
was learned that instead of two electric vehi-
cles there were three inthe run. Of these, two
surreys finished. The racing electric vehicle
that won the fifty-mile race on Long Island was
stalled tween Princeton and Philadelphia.

While the facts in the case of this first long
run of motor carriages are dry, the adventures
ot the affair were colorful. The run was not
admitted to be a race, yet every one tried
to be first. From the Waldorf-Astoria in
was 4 case of “devil take the hindmost,’’ all the
way to the city of brotherly love. Going to the
Battery the aristocratic men on the motor ma-
chines ok to Mott street, Mulberry street,
South Fifth avenue and Third street, below
Washington Square and they were entertained
by early morning sighta of ‘‘the other half," that
were new to them, evenif they were not regaled
by the composite odors that were jnstas new
and more strange. A reporter of TAR SuN rode
beside a young man who ia estimated to be
worth $10,000,000, and he said that the sighta of
the East Sidv streets at that hour of the day
were novel onestohim. Hestared at them like
a boy at the circus. He did not seem concerned
at the short turns, sudden  swerves
and short stopa the driver made, nor
seem to care how close the auto
came to a collision with @ wagon or
a pedestrian. He was exverienced and knew
that his lawyer would attend to matters. of
damages, The steady vibration and sudden
jolta that made the reporter ‘sit tight,” and
made his hair stand, although it was not his
first tripon an automobile, passed unnoticed
by the young millionaire  “autofan.’’ He
smoked a pipe and talked with the driver about
the machinery of the car

Going over Staten Island from St. George to
Tottenville, probably every one went astray
The idea was to go along the shore road to Fin-

erboard road and over it to the Amboy pike
The leaders forgot to make the turn at Fort

Wadsworth and the others followed them
and had to turn. back, One steam  ma-
chine, too far behind to be guided by
sight of the others turned to the

right on the Amboy road and reached St, George
again. This was the runabout occupied by Ar-
thur W. Robinson of New York and Charles ©.
Moore of San Francisco, They got to_Totten-
villetwo hours behind the others. The first
machine to quit was a gasolene brake ridden by
V. ki. Macy and managed by F. W. Walsh. it
stopped at Giffords, Staten I-land, about ten
miles from New York, and returned.

The most novel velicle in the run was an im-
pores “theatre "bus,"’ under the direction of
..E Sechwartzkopf and a driver. Inside the
‘bus were Gen. Roy Stone, Winslow E. Busby,
William Hazelton and BE. S. Hyatt. Itwas a
gasolene machine of the “forecarriage’’
style. Other machines were occupied by
Louis B.S Myser and N.H. White, Dave H.
Morris, George Isham Scott, chairman of the
Tours and Runs Committee of the club; Gen.
George Moore Smith, Al. Riker and A.H
Whiting: 8 T. Davis, who was second to Riker
in the thtiy-mile road race on Long Island: A. R.
Maxim, W. H. Hall, Capt, Homer W. Hedges,
J. Ho Milliken and HLM. McGee; HM. Bylesby;
Robert Graff and. M. Butler

In front of the hotel in Philadelphia a com-
ieal hing Pappened President Chamberiain,
who finis first, stood on the walk alongside
of his nine-horsepower machine with a beaming
countenance receiving congratulations from
the Automobile Club of Philadelptia, which
with President Henry G Morris at its head, ha
turn: d out it stvle to greet the tourists even
in the rain which poured upon the anto-
fans from 4:30 o'clock on, The loeal club sent
its members out into the highways to guide and
cheer the dilatory ones President Chamber-
lain hada proud reception for about twenty
minutes; then he wot into his carriage to take
ittothe stable. The vehicle did not move four
feet before the near front wheel came off and
fell flaton the asphalt. The nut had come off
and also the ball bearings, having no retainer,
had dropped out and gone in devious directions
over the slimy tar Then the vehicle was
“lacked up onachampagne box and ( hamber-
lain, looking at it, said) “‘Well, we got to Phila-
deiphia, anyhow.”

An American Fox Terrier Goes Abroad,

Hands Up, the wire-haired fox terrier which
won all before him when brought out last Feb-
ruary at the Westminster Kennel Club show,
was shipped to England on Saturday by the
Lucania, The dog will be exhibited at the
Crystal Palace in October at the Fox Terrier

Club shows at Derby, Birmingham and Liver-
pool when it will be time to sail again for New

ork for the Westminster event, Lands Up is
by Go Bang, the wire-haired champion that
cost G. M. Carnochan $2,500 two years 0,
and his dam is Belle Duval, by Claude Duval, a
sinooth-coated dog that cost Mr. Carnochan
$1,800, They are record prices in the breed,

According to Our Doga,G. M. Carnochan haa
consented to judge fox terriers at the show
of the English Ladies’ Kennel Association,
He will sail from New York on June 10 and be
abroad for a month, He was most anxious to
take over his crack puppie, Cairnsmuir Growler
but the English quarantine regulations bared
the way. These regulations are very strict and
it is on account of them that Hands Up cannot
be shown until October, He is to be handled
in England by George Welch, Castle Donning-
ton. near Derby, | Hands Up will be kept muz-
zicd and isolated for three months in the strict-
est of quarantines, and he will be inspectod
every fortnight by arepresentative of the Board
of Agriculture.

GOSSIP OF THE RUNNERS,

COMMENTS ON THE RACE BETWEEN
ETHELBERT AND JEAN BERAUD.

The Coming Suburban Furntshes a Rare Op-
Portunity for Both to Meet Imp All Are
Engaged tn the Brookdale Handicap To-
morrow—Rich Programme for Gravesend,

Regular tollowers of racing and the thou-
sands of citizens who select the sport as the

  

ideal foundation for a holiday are still discuss. |

ing the Ethelbert-Jean Beraud duel of Saturday, |

Winners and losers agree that It was a great
race and that the better horse, on the day,
won, but there are many admirers of the Whit-
ney horse, who cling to the idea that he would
have been a factor to the finishline “ifhe only
had one or two ham races in him.” Jean Be-
raud had been over a year in retirement, and

| although he received a thorough preparation,

a ec —  — SSSSSSS SSSSSSSSSSSsSSSSsSS

his efforts were confined to friendly brushes
with stable mates. Such tests may be satis-
factory when ganged by the watch, but in-the
opinion of veteran horsemen are not to be
relied on until the animal has received at least
one opportunity of duplicating in public what
he is considered capable of in private. As

one of them put It yesterday:

“A thoroughbred knows the difference be-
tween training and racing almost as well as
your typical college athlete. He will reel off
quarters in company that he realizes is friendly,
at a gait that looks fine on paper, There is
nothing to worry about and the pace is gener-
ally made to suit him. An actual race is a
different proposition. The pinch that is not
looked for in training may cone at any time
and find the horse unable to respond.”

Ethelbert, on the contrary, had been “through
the mill” in earnest, and in view of his impres-
sive triumph in the Metropolitan Handicap
the wonder {s that the bookmakers ventured
to bet 7 to 10 on Saturday, The odds indicated
a wholesome respect for Jean Beraud and a

lively recollection of the fact that his only two
appearances last year were si Nalized by classic
victories, But the most loyal of Jean Beraud’s
admirers are peady to concede the crown to
Ethelbert, and if he retired to-day he would
carry with him the prestige of “King of the
four-year-olds ”

Owner Perry Belmont {8 too good a sporta-
man, however, to stop at this stage, espectally
while admirers of I:np insist that she can trim
any*hing in training. There is no necessity
for anot her special sweepstakes, as the Suburban
ia only twelve days away. In this classte feat-
ure of the Coney Island Jockey Club's com.
ing meeting Fthelbert’s penalties raise him
to top weight, with an impost of 120 pounds
as against Imp's 128 and Jean Beraud’s 127,
A better opportunity for both Imp and Jean
Beraud to measure strides with Ethelbert could
scarcely be arranged, and it is the general hope
that the three will accept the issue, The pres-
ence of these noted rivals would be alone suf
ficient to make the next running of the Sub.
urban memorable, but there are others in the
big Sheepshead Ray race that will‘have to be
reckoned with, W, C. Whitney {s the fortunate

ossessor of a fortinidable second string In

ilmarnock, the latest Withers hero, The
colt’s triumph at Morris Park brought him a
Srfurban penalty of eight pounds, but even
that lets hiro in at 100 pounds Kinley Mack's
Brookly® Flandicap victory raises his weight
to 125 pounds and makes the prospect all the
more {nteresting, Few withdrawals of any
note haye yet been recorded, and indications
point to a laree field and one of the greatest
races ever run over the trying Suburban course.

Meanwhile the sport at Gravesend will keep
racegoers busy, A fine card is presented for
to-day, with the Criterion as the stake feature,
The specialty scheduled for to-morrow ts the
Brookdale Handieap, with $1,000 added, for
three-year-olds and upward, at one mile anda
furlong. The handicapper rates Ethelbert as
seven pounds better than Jean Beraud and
Imp, but there is little probability that the
champion will undertake to shoulder 184 pounds
so soon after the sweepstakes, Wednesday's
card includes a highweight handicap on the
flat and a steeplechase handicap over the full
course, while sandwiched in between {s the
popular Gazelle Stakes of $3,000 for three-year-
old fillies, at one mile and a sixteenth. The
Manlhanset Stakes of $2,000, for two-veareolds,
at four and a half furlongs, is the chief event
on Thursday's ecard, and on Friday the May
Stakes for three-year-olds, at six furlongs,
will be run,

The programme for Saturday is one of the
best of the season, It onens with two handl-
caps, one for sprinters and the other for horses
tuned up to go one mile and a quarter, These
races pave the way for the Great American
Stakes of $12,500 for two-vear-olds, at five fur-
longs: the Broadway Stakes, with $1,500, for
three-vear-olds, at one mile and a sixteenth,
and the Grand National Steeplechase Handl-
cap, with $5,000 added, of whieh $2,590 is cone

In the recent automobile show at Agricultural
Hall, London, there were more than 100 ex-
hibitors and a great variety of styles. The in-
teresting facts about the show were the ap-
pearance of only three electric vehicles and
three steam-driven ones. The steam machines
were of American make_and concerning them
a report in the London Graphic says:

“Tf appearances were everything, the light
steam car inight be regarded as the motor ve-
hicle of the future, for this American product
glides about the arena with almost swanlike
a@race. and ass léntly as an electric launch, Its
performances are very captivating.”

Then follows this remarkable statement:

“Tt must be pointed out, however, that to pro-
duce the steam three times as much petrol ia
required as would alone drive the vehicle, and
that twenty-five to thirty miles isthe Ihmit of
{ts journey without refilling of the boiler .’’

All the machines, excepting the six mentioned,
were driven by gasoline motors. The \ests {n-
chided startling performances, In one a vic-
torja was driven up an inclined plane, just wide
enough for the wheels of the carriage, and
stopoed on a platform only a few inches longer
than the wheel-base. Another trial was to run
the car down a flight of steps and turn it sharp
to the right at the bottom,

An instructive incident happened at the
corner of Nassau and Beekman streets last
night, but it was instructive chiefly beoause
the great mass of cyclists nowadaya have not
been riding more than a few years. To one or
two old time riders who were witnesses it was
amusing. A hey of about 15 years stood at
the corner with a bicycle over the front wheel
of which a truck had just passed, The wheel,
which had a metal rim, looked as if it was tre
