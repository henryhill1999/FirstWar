If it be asked how, with these restricted
bank aeeon vaodations, the stock speculators
n London do business, the answer is that they
d na different way from ours, or rather in
t vay that it used to be done here, thirty or
vears ago, Then, as the veterans of the
stock Exchange will remember, speculative
sve. and purehases were made as time trans-
actions.and “seller 60,” “seller 30,” “buyer 60,”
and “buver 9.” oceurred more frequently in
the reports than “seller 8” or “buyer 3” do now.
Rrokera gave credit to one another, putting
up or taking, as the case might be, margins of
10 per cent. and asking nothing from banks
but to certify their checks an hour or two before
they made them good by deposits. Now all |
sales as between the brokers are made for cash,
and the banks furnish it. In London trans-
actions in stocks” on time are settled twice
amonth on “settling days,” as they are
called. If the buyer cannot on a settling day
conveniently take up his purchases, he pays
the wller a premium called “contango” for the
pris postponing the fulfilment of his
tract to the nextsettling day,and a seller

uncollectible. The new Currency act is not
Perfect, but, for the present, it works well, and
efforts to amend it will, until its defects are
demonstrated by experience, be. futile.

Nevertheless, the belief prevails among other-
wise intelligent people, that the sensitive-
| Meas of our financial system, and its liability
to derangement by the crises which periodi-
cally attack it, are due not to our universal
mania for speculation, but to our currency
laws, which need only to be amended in ac-
cordance with their views to insure us immunity
from all financial evils. Observing that every
summer the withdrawal of money from our
commercial centres for crop moving purposes
shakes the card house fabric of high prices
reared by the aid of bank loans, and sometimes
brings tt down with a crash, they imagine
that this withdrawal of support could be pree
vented by a more liberal issue of bank notes,and
that if it were thus prevented the speculative
card house would be as firm aga rock. They
do not consider that their remedy would work
only when first applied, and that successively
greater and greater issues of bank notes would
have to be made year by year, until their vol-
ume would be inflated beyond control und
would collapse by its own weak nese.

How unnecessary an unlimited supply of
bank currency is to the healthy conduct of
business as well as to profitable banking, is
proved by the example of the 88 banks of England
and Wales already mentioned, which, alto-
gether, issue only £1,000,000 of notes. These
83 banks have, in the aggregate, a
capital and surplus of their own, amounting to
only £70,000,000, but, as has been said, their
depoeits are £566,000,000, and their loans and
interest bearing investments £674,000,000,
which is nearly ten times their aggregate capi-
tal. The result is, that their dividends, without
any aid from the issue of circulation, are, in
some cases, 20 per cent. per annum, and the
market value of their shares aggregates £142,-
000,000, npon a par of £46,000.000. Nor is there
any complaint in England and Wales of a scarcity
of currency, although the whole of the issves
of all the banks, inciuding ihe Bank of England,
is only £29.000,000 and none of the notes are
of a iess denomination than £3 or $28. Not
only does this small amount suffice for ordinary
use, but it meets the demand both of harvest
time and of the Christmas trade, being sup-
plemented by the use of checks and by a large
amount of gold coin, the supply of which is
increased when necessity arises, by imports of
gold from other countries.
