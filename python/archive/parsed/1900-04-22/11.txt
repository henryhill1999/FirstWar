A BRILLIANT FINISH TN THE AN

as gool a game as the ‘gallery

  

 

seen this season, at lenat with

and the “best ball’ barred, They were
Craig M Hamilton of Baltusrol, who
began hia career by winning the
Av.diews cup in the publie competition
at Van Cortlandt Park, whieh was managed
by THe SUN in DSi, and KR. © Watson, Je

of Weatbrook, who played his frat game in
the saine over that course, The day
was charming for golfing, for there was
neither sun nor wind, and there waa again
following

year

an impressive and) enthusiastic

Watson won the match, but only on the
nineteenth hoe Hamilton, a8 a set-off
to his defeat, hat the luck to win the
gross score prize in the hbandieap and he

also captured the ranner’s-up cup, The two
were often together in the
naments during the winter, where Watson got
the better share of successes, Although he has
won any pumber of cups in Florita during the
past two winters, this isthe first M, G. A, tours
nament Watson has won with the exeeption of
the one at Knoliwood last July. Now he hus
eyes on the amateur championship.

Watson has much the move orthodox style of
the two, for Hamilton only tekes a short, fore-
arm awing, yet from eleven of the tees the latter
had the betterof the drives, But in most of
these cases it was the roll on the ball that

compelled Watson to play the odd on
the second shot, The former, however,
had the better of the putting. and it

waa due to this that he had the lead tothe
eleventh green. Yet Hamilton missed yard
putsto win both the fourth and fifth holes.
Barring this there was not amistake by Haml-
ton untilon the fair green forthe ninth hole,
when he topped with the brassy and was
bunkered. To the same hole Watson did sot
make a miss either, except chances lost ia put-
ting

A yar? put that only rimmed gave the first
hole to Hamilton, The second was halved,
due toa fine approach by Harvilton from off
the green when Watson had the least to do
