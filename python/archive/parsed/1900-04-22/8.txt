Hall of the New Haven Itailroad, which has just

secured control of the New Haven Steamboat

Company, made a statement to-day in which

he confirmed the story that his road is now in

It was learned to-day that the price paid

Mrs. Marling Choked and Beaten With a Ke-
volver by the Man She Refased to Marry.

Kocuestren, April 2l.—Mra Alice Marling
36 years of age, was found by a policeman in the
apartments of “Dr.” Louis Kircher, at 501 Joseph
avenue, this morning, with her face and clothing
spattered with blood and a dozen ugly gasheas in
her head) The woman was unconscious. She
was placed in an ambulance and taken to the
Homcropathic Hospital The police set about |
examining the apartments where the woman was
found. ‘There was blood all about, and under the
bed they found a revolver, the butt of which was
matted with blood and hair. Two of the cham-
bers had recently been discharged ‘

Shortly before noon Mrs. Marling recovered
consciousness, and she was able to converse,
She said that last night she was at the house of
her next door neighbor, taking care of a sick
woman, and that “Dr.” Kircher, whom she had
known for some time, called at her home about
9 o'clock, She was summoned from the neigh-
bor's house by one of the children, and she talked
with Kircher in her front yard. He is an artist,
as well as a magnetic physician, and he told her

that he had some new paintings at his apartments
that he desired to show her He persuaded her
in this way t accompany him to his apartments
at 501 Joseph avenue, aluiough she had at first
told him that she could not go away and leave her |
children at
After arriving at bis apartments she says that
he showed her some paintings and renewed en-
treaties that he had made on different cecasions |
to her to marty him She told him repeatedly |
'

|

 

that she could not marry him, and becomiig
infuriated at her refusals he drew from his pocket
a revolver and told her (hatif she did not consent
to become his wife he would kill her She tried |
to wet out of the room, but he grasped her by tie |
throat, at the same time striking her on the heed |
with ihe revolver, He threw her down, and while
she struggled flercely to get out of bis wraey he
tightened bis grip on her throat and continued |
to pound heron the head with the revolver, In
the excitement she could not tell whether or not |
any shots were fired. He soon overpowered ber
and she lost consciousness. ‘The next she re- |
called she was lying on the floor and she was
alone — ‘The sun was shining through the win- |
dow. She staggered to the window and braced |
herself up until she saw the officer and attracted |
his attention, when she again fainted |

NOTES OF LEGAL EVENTS.

 

The Executive Committee of the National A»
sociation of Referees in Bankruptcy has just
published an interesting and valuable report
concerning the practical operation of the Bank-
rupt act of 18998. A convention of these referees
was held at Chicago tn July last, at which this
executive committee was appointed, The
chairman is Mr, William H, Hotchkiss, of Buf-
falo. whose name has frequently been mentioned
among the candidates for District Judge of
the United States for the new Western District
of New York. He is one of the best known ref-
erees in bankruptey in the country, having
taken special interest in his work as such from
the beginning. The report of his committee
finds much to commend in the Bankrupt
law and declares that as a whole it has reduced
litigation batween debtor and creditor by one-
half, transferring lawyers’ and sheriffs’ fees
to that extent into dividends for creditors.
Claims are said to be easily and cheaply proven,
dividends are paid without appreciable ex-
pense and we are told that “the intervention
of an attorney is in ordinary cases unneces~
sary.” The most serious objection is made to
that feature of the law which «ives the right to
demand a jury trial, without proviston for the
pay of the jury. This enables the bankrupt's
attorney to delay the proceedings indefinitely in
where there are jew stated terms
of the Federal courts

 

A person who has perfornied responsible judi-
cial services for the United States ought not
to have to wait from forty to fifty years for
his pay. From May 24, 1853, untill March 20,
iSét, Edwin DeLeon was Consul-General cf
the United States at Alexandria in Feypt.
At that time our Consuls in China and Turkey
exercised certain judicial powers, including au-
thority totry all citizens of the United States
for crimes committed in those countries, In
his judicial capacity as American Consul, Mr,
DeLoon performed services during the period
we have mentioned for which he was never
compensated during his lifetime, although
he caimed to be entitled under the law to $1,0W0
a year. {lis representatives have applied
to Congress for the pay thus withheld and the

An appellate court in Louisiana has recently
decided that the publication on Sunday of a
Judicial notice is inefeeal DUrpose
and is to be regarded as though it had never
been made, Many of these notices relate to
the sale of property. A
ment of this character is declared to be not
only an invitation topurchasers and an ine
citement to competition for the goods or land
to be sold, but also a citation or notification to
all parties to the litigation to attend the sale
and protect their interests, Such a citation, it
is held, ean be served only on a business day

this is the action of electment bronght in

behalf of the Montank tribe of Indians, after
they were defeated in their first suit against

the twenty-ei¢hth volume of the Appellate

panes of their lands, they had no means of
entoreing that right. It was suggested that
the Montauks should apply to the Legislature
| for redress, or that possibly a suit might be
maintainable by a member of the tribe on
behalf of himself and the other members, The
latter sugwestion was adopted in an action
brought by one Eugene A. Johnsen. Tis
complaint was upheld by the Appellate Division
(a2 Aprevate Division Reports, 626), but the

for the public to have there cheap conveyances

Strand, but he could find no authority for euch
an undertaking in the statute which empow-
ered the London County Council to acquire the
tramways. The phrase in that statute author-
izing them to do whatever waa “convenient
for working the tramways" was not broad
enough to embrace the operation of terminal

We observe that the Court of Appeals on
Friday denied a motion for a reargument tn
