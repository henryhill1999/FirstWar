properly played, Sheckard ran clear froin frat

where the Champions exhibited to the apecta-
tors that base running coupled with batting
well placed can do more to win games than
merely standing on a bag waiting patlently for
a a toxendinarun with a long, lucky
smash. In a word, they played “Hanlon bail.”
.The New Yorka took the bat in hand when
Umpire Emalie called play at 3:30. o'clock
Two strikes on the first two balls pitched were
called on Van Haltren, who knocked the third
into the air for Kelley to gobble up. Mercer

ting. But the batsman pounded to De Montre-
ville, and Mercer reached second, There was
applause for Capt. Davis when he plodded up
tothe plate, He smiled and put up a fly for
Keeler.

‘Now get at ‘em! That wasthe ery of the

the orena, and when Sheckard waiked to first
on ciled Dalla there was a roar of delight.
Keeler, the mite, whois a mighty sticker when
his “lamps” are properly trimmed, pushed
the ball toward Doyle. Sheckard was on
the way for second = like a grey-

until he landed unmolested on third. The
New Yorks did not see “Sheck” at all for
Doyle and Hawley were too busy try!ng to

the Brooklynite’s path when he was two
yards from the bag, Jennings rapped the
ball toward Davis, a moment later just as

Sheckard started for the plate, Davia had no
time to cut off the run. 60 he threw Hughey
outat first. That was team work at the bat
with a vengeance and the scientific cranks
went into ecstasies. Kelley waa third out when
siorie gathered ja a rather wile throw from
aierever

“Weil tia that seore right away!" yelled the
man with the white fedora, “Lhe New Yorks
will win the pennant!”

With Doy'e out in the second inning, Selbach
secured base on bails and prompt!y tried to
steal, As Gleason mateno attempt to hit the
bail, as he should have done, MeGulre’s grand
throw to De Montreville shut the ranner off
with plenty to spare, Then Gleason lobbed
one to MeGinnity and died, Hawley had great
speed in the last half and the Champions went
out in order.

Grady opened the third with a base on. balls.
He tried to steal, Hawley making no effort to
hit. MeGuire’s arm ahot the balldown to De
Montrevilie again and Grady was nailed before
he hatachance totenen the bag. Hawley then
struck out and Van Haltren’s tall foul fell into
MeGnuire’s mitt. As Hawley’s speed again
blanked the Brookiyns in rapid succession,
the cranks sat back prepared for » battle of
pitchers,

“Here we go!" the Harlem ‘“‘rooters" bellowed
na Mercer made his second base hit, a drive to
ser in the fourth, Hickman busted one down
to Casey, and the midget, first making a bluf&®
throw to forve Mercer et second, got the ball
to Jennings too late to stop the batsman, Davis
was cajled upon fo crack it out of the Jot, but
he bunted straight toward third. MeGinnity
wrabbed the bali and shot it to Casey, thereoy
forcing Mercer,

“Why didn't Mr Davis Ait that pennant down
there?’ asked a Brooklyn girl, who was trying
to keep seore

“Because,” replied her wise escort, “he gota

That's allt”

Doyles boomed one high up for Sheekard to
eatoh and was the second out, Then Selbach

smashe! the ball so hard at MeGinnity
that when it struck the “Iron Man's”
mitt it rebounded toward the © plate.
It was A. serateh hit and the panes
were filled. “Now, Gleason! Break it!” the
New Yorkers wailed, but MeGinnity put on

side. A chance to score was lost and the
Brooklyn shouters were happy again, After
Keoler had flied to Belbach in the jast half
Jennings niade the first hit of the eume off

into first. A moment later a swift throw from

WITH THE TROTTERS,

Arion in Training for the $20,000 Stallion
Hace —ilens Falls Stake Entries,

When the New England Ureeders’ Association
announced a purse of $20,000 for a stallion race
at the fall meeting, nearly all horsemen jumped
0 the conclusion that J, Malcolm Forbes would
be represented at the contest by either Bingen,
2:06',, or Peter the Great, 2.07',. But the signs
now point to Arion, 2.07%, a4 the prospective
starter from the Forbes stable. Trainer Henry
Titer took the $125,000 stallion to ReadvillePark
last week and is going w “feel him out’ before
the date of the big race. Arion has never ful-
filled the promise of his wonderful performances
483 a two yearold, and his owner is reluctant per-
manently to retire him to the stud without an-
other trial, His mile in 210% to high wheel
sulky at two years of age is universally looked

upon as the most remarkable performance ever |

made by a trotting horse. No other two-vear-
old ever got within seven seconds of this ark at
even hitch, and the pneumatic sulky has not yet
enabled any youngster to quel the record it
has stood unequalled since 1891, and ix now the
only champion record in the books that has sur
Vived the revolution in sulky building,

The prediction was made by all the critics when
the Electioneer colt trotted in 210", aa 4 two
earold that he would some day set the record

low 2:05, and when the pneumatic wheels came
Out in the following year to help all trotters along
at the rate of four or five seconds to the mile it was
expected that Arion would eventually shade the
2.00 mark. Mr. Forbes sent him to Charles Mar
vin of Smuggler and Sunol fame, and then to
Budd Doble, the great trainer who had driven
Dexter, 2.4744, Goldsmith Maid, 2:14, and Naney
Hanks, 2.04. Put the colt failed to train) on as
expected. The best that he could do as a three
yearold was 2:10';, and though tried repeatedly
in the following year his fastest performance was
a mile in 207%. As he trotted pneumatic
sulky neither performance was equal to his two-
year-old record, Mr Forbes gave him another
trial in 1804, starting him against Wirectum in
the $15,000 stallion race at HKocton The horse
was not well at the time and Directum defeated
him easily in 2.10. This was Arion's last public
performance. He was sent to Mr. Forbes’s farm
near Readville and has since then been kept in
the stud. Heary Titer, the young man who is
how going to try his hand with Arion, developed
and drove to 4 reoord of 2.05", the five vearald
trotter Nico, by Arion. Titer also drove Mr
Forbes's crack stallions Bingen, 2:064,, and Peter
the Great, 20754, when they gained their fast
records last vear

Glens Falls has outstripped every other town
