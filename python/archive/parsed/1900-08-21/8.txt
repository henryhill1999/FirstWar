The type of hose in general use la short--a

“Until two days ago (July 16) there had heen
no hot weather here, and the phenomenally
backward season had an injurious effect on
the buainess of Jobbers and shopkeepers who
had stocked summer fabrics and olothing.

“American-made ladies’ shirt waists have
been a source of particular anxiety, as the best
shopkeepers had this year very heavy stocks of
them r faw consignments of these shirt-
waista were put on the British market in the
summer of 1898 and found @ ready sale, for in
neatness of ft and novelty og design they were
very attractive and surprifingly superior in
price to blouses of English or German make

“In the apring of 1890, shopkeepers enerally

ve to dealers in American shirt waists what
Sev considered were exceptionally large
orders, but the summer demand was far greater
than antioipttatad, Consequently, shopkeepers
pot in etill larger stocks for this summer's
sale, but the unseasonable weather has so far
interfered. There probably has never been
an a ticle of ladies’ clothing which has so com-
pletely dominated the British market :

An American storekeeper s capital is jn
his tock, as he does not give long credit, while
the capital of the British shopkeeper is repre-
sented on his books, for he gives very long
and free credit, and therefore cannot have
a big etiock. On account of this sm ll stock
custom, there still exista in Fngland a type
of jobber or small wholesaler long since wiped
out in the United States and manufacturers
here are willing to accept small orders and to
giiarantee the filling of repeat orders

“The American manufacturers of shirt waists
hove done nothing in the way of meeting «mall
order demands, and while they have deserved

elr season's stiecess, owing to the merit of
their articles, they must not expect the sale to
continue unless they hereafter take care of the
trace in the way customary here, for the Brit-
ish manufacturers have had their lesson an
will compete next year, They will eell in emal
lots wilt call the article a blouse instead of a
shirt waist, and their salesmen will appeal
to the shopkeepers to assist their industries
by buring of these who employ British labor.

It is extraordinary that British shopkeepers
have for two seasons stocked heavily with
American blouses, and {t can be attributed
only to the great superiority of the American
article, but they will not stock American blouses
again if they can get British-made blouses ot
anewhere near the same attractiveness in
smal! lotaand witha guaranty that their sec
ond orders will be executed have heard
that one London merchant had sales of Ameri-
ean shirt waists totalling $277,300.50 and a sales-
man for a big wholesale house who travelled
with mea ina railway carriage the other day
said that two-thirds of his blouse sales this
vear had been American. He has also sold
some thousands of Ameriean braces (suspend-
ers for men) and said it made him smile when
he met well-to-do Americans travelling here
who, when questioned, boasted they wore ‘im-
ported suspenders.’ He inspected, at my sug-
gestion, the suspenders I was wearing (bought
n New York for 50 cents), and said that their
ejual could not be produced here or in France
for that price at wholesale

“an American manufacturer who has called
at the consulate told me that, finding several
years ago he could no longer compete in cominon
cottons at his New England mill with the cheap
labor of North Carolina, he sold his old ma-
ehinery toa company then building a Southern
mill and studied the processes of suspender
manufacture here and on the Continent. He
boasted that, while the British manufacturer
had only about eighteen styles, he manufac-
tured about one hundred and fifty-eight styles
his first senson, and claimed his suspenders
were better and cheaper, for he had adopted all
the good processes, rejecting those he thought
merely traditional, and had put in labor-saving
machinery, of which he had invented, the
reat being de od by clever men whom he
emploved for the purpose
erica manufacturers of all garments
fas rwear of the many cotton and
1 nds can, if they adopt the proper
merchandising methods, more than duplicate
the success of thé shirt-waist manufacturers

Great Britain. By a well-planned cam-
palgn they could simply take command of the
market and furnish shopkeepers with articles
which would, T am certain, be a revelation
to their customers.”

TO READ OFF BAD IMMIGRANTS.

 

Arrangement Made for Inspection by U. S,
OMctals at Canadian Ports,

WASHINGTON, Alig. 20.—Asaistant Secretary
Taylor of the Treasury hus returned from Can-
ada, where he has been in consultation with offt-
oials of the Canadian steamship and railway
limes on the subject of immigrant inepection
by United States officers there. Mr. Taylor
believes that an agreement reached petween
the lines and this Government for the examin-
ation of aliens destined for the United States
will prove effective in preventing undesirable
foreigners from entering this country over

the Canadian border, The steamship con-
vanies ugteed to allow this Government's
napectors and physicians io exumine all
immigrants arriving ut Canadian ports and
to deport those found clsensed ung
undesirable. The railway companies agreec
net to sell tickets to lmmigrantsa to

Places in the United States uniees they had been
exumined and had cards to show their right
to come here It was further arranged that
wll immigrants should be examined by this
Government's surgeons at the place of embark
ution in Europe, both thoee destined for the
United States through Canada und those sus-
pected of intending tocomehere. Itiethought
that the feur of the establishment of border
imniigrant stutions will lewd the companies
to assist this Government's inspeotora in dolug
their duty rather than to throw obstacles in
the way of uclose watch being kept on undesir-
able immigrants.

The Americun steamship lines are not in
favor 4f this arrangement, and bave asked
Mr. Taylor to hear thet side of the question
They suy that the laxity of inspection in Canuda
under such an urrangement has inade it pos-
sible and will make It possible for foreigners
to come here after landing on Canadian soil,
whether this Government's laws would exclude
them or not

YOUNG STACEELES RS 18 SANE.

Was Released From Sanitarium a Week Ago
~—Justice Hooker Signs the Papers.

Supreme Court Justice Hooker has affirmed
the verdict of ine Sheriff's jury declaring Newton
B. Stachelberg sane, and the papers in the case
were filed in the County Clerk's office in Brookly8
yesterday. Young Stachelberg's fortune is
estimated at $300,000. His relatives alleged
he was insane and had him committed to San-
ford Hall in Flushing. A commission was
appointed by Justice Dickey to take testimony
as to the sanity of the young man, and they held
a number of sessions. The testimony waa heard
before a Sheriff's jury. Young Stachelbere
testified to leading a fast life in the Tenderloin
and losing large ®ums of mosey in gambling
He became despondent, he aaid, and went to
Routh Africa, where he entered in the irregular
cavalry of the British Army. Last spring he
received word that one of his brothers had died,
and he returned home. He subsequently went
on a spree, he said, and his relatives had him
committed to Sanford Hall, the physicians
certifving that he was suffering from paranola
Before he went to South Africa he turned hie
property in truat over to hie mother

Since the commission made its report Justice
Hooker received a letter from Melvina Stachel-
berg, the mother of Newton, in which ehe said
that she had had several interviews with her
son and was now satisfied he was sane. It
appears that young Stachelbere was released
from Sanford Hall a week ago at the request
of his relatives, since which time he has been
transacting business in Manhattan

 

ROW WITH TICKET SPECULATORS.

 

One Speculator Arrested on Complaint of a
New York Theatre Manager.

There wasarowlast night in front of the New
York Theatre between Sire Bros, proprie-
tors of the place, and the ticket speculators
Four speculators were trying to do business
and twice as many employees of the theatre
were trying to stop them, by warning would-
be purchasers that tickets bought outside the
theatre would no! be accepted at the door

Two men, Who were apparently acting as
dummies in favor of the speculators, bought
two ticketa on the outside and then tried to get
into the house. They didnot succeed. Their
loud argument with the proprietor of the
theatre attracted a crowd and the police were
finally called upor to clear the lobby, In the
course of the row David Marks, one of the spec-
ulators, was arrested on a charge of disorderly
condu t, made by the business manager of the
theatre

THE
MAXIMO GOMEZ TO CUBANS.

SAYS THE REVOLUTIONISTS SHOULD
GOVERN THE ISLAND.
ae
A Circalar in Regard to the Coming Consti-

tational Convention-Governor General
Wood's Advice Opposed—-Revolutionists,
It Is Thought, May Control the Convention,
Spectal Cadle Despaichto THY SUN.
Havasa, Aug, 20.-Gen, Maximo Gomez
has written « circular letter to the press in
order, he explains, to prevent old and well-tried

revolitioniata from being deceived in the
coming elections, Cubana, he deolares, must
not confound jdeas with principles, Honor

demands that the latter be saved even at the
cost of life

The constitutional convention, hesays, should
be composed of genuine Cuban revolutionista,
the convention being the outcome of the revo-
lution. Nobody should be elected a delegate
who has defamed the revolution or who at the
last moment joined the revolution after having
opposed it. Many rich and intellectual men
have proved by their actions their antagonism
to the revolutionary cause. These should not
be elected. The time has come for the people
to see clearly. Men should be loved not for
their knowledge and talents, but for their vir-
tues and patriotiam. Gen. Gomez demands
that those who are to manage the affairs of the
country should be elected on account of their
worthiness rather than their wisdom, Until
the republic is established society in Cuba can-
not be properly arranged. For this reason the
Spaniards are standing to one side waiting un-
til the establishment of the republic shall make
all equal.

By declaring that only revolutionista should
he elected to the convention Gen, Gomez is
following the course pursued by him before
the municipal elections. He also asks the people
to act contrary to the advice now being given
to them by Gen, Wood, namely, to elect the
most competent men, no matter to which party
they belong. The fear is expressed that the
revolutioniste will form a large majority in the
convention, Moat of the candidates are revo-
lutionary Generals, including the Civil Gov-
ernors of the various provinces. It would
seem that a majority of these candidates are
utterly unfitted intellectually to perform the
work they will be expected to perform.

ALABAMA MOB DIDN'T GET HIM.
=
Military Fecort From New Orieans to Mont-
gomery ta the Case of Jacobl,

New ORLEANS, [a., Aug. 20.-Sanford Ja-
cobi, the young man wanted in Montgomery,
Ala., for attempted asaault on a@ girl in that
city and over whom the States of Alabama
and fouisiana have been fighting for three
months, was taken to Montgomery this morn-
ing under military escort to prevent a lynching.
Jacobi fled to New Orleans after the Mont-
gomery episode and has been in prison here
ever since, trying every legal means in his power
to prevent being sent back to Alabama, Gov.
Heard of Louisiana refused to honor the requi-
sition papers of Gov. Johnston of Alabama

until the latter pledged himself to protect
Jacobi from the mob, which had threatened
to lynch him, The case went throug the
Lousiana and United States courts of
which declared that Jacobi must go back to
Montgomery. A military eacort, consisting of
wjuads from two of the militia companies ©
Montgomery reached here on Saturday, but
the Sheriff of New Orleans refused to surrender
the prisoner until this morning, when he was
turned over to Sheriff Payne of Mogtgomery,
accompanied by the militia with fixed bayonets.

It was reported from Alabama that a mob
might attempt to board the train at Greenville,

 

which is very greatly incered against Jacob, |

as it is the home of the girl. he Sheriffe
of each of the Alabama counties through which
the train passed were therefore telegraphed to
in advance to havea force of men at the several
stopping points to prevent mob violence Th

recautions were sufficient and Jacob! reach
Kiontgomery without injury.

DADY'S HAVANA AFFAIRS.

His Action at Law Declared to Be am At:
tempt to Hamper the President.

Argument in the suit brought by Michael
J. Dady, the Brooklyn contractor, to restrain
Governor General Leonard Wood of Cuba from
promulgating 4 new municipal code for the
city of Havana, on the ground that such action
wouldinjure Mr. Dady's “property rights” in
that city, was heard yesterday by Judge La-
combe in the United States Cirouit Court.

Dady's property rights consist in quasi-con-
tracts entered Into between himeelf and the

 

 

city prior to the Spanish-American War for |

sewer and street paving improvernnenta.
Frank DPD. Pavey, Dady's counsel, contended
that the proposed action of Gen, Wood was
an arbitrary exercise cf military power, and
an attempt to violate the rights of the plaintiff
under the laws of the United States and the
Treaty of Paris

United States District Attorney Burnett,

pearing for the Government, sid that Gen

oot had deolared it essential to the health
of Cuba as well as to that of his own soldiers
that he should have the supervision of drainage
street paving and sanitary affairs in general
upon the island. Gen. Burnett said that the
application of Mr. Dady was an attempt to
hamper the action of the President, who, as
Conmmander-in-Chief of the Army, bas charge
of the military operations of American troops
abroad. Briefs were submitted and Judge La-
combe reserved his decision

Imperialism amd Militarism, He Says, Are
False Cries.

Synaccese, Aug. 20 Major-Gen, ©. O.
Howard spoke on the issues of the Presidential
campaign this afternoon at an outing of the
Syracuse Republican Club held at Lakeside
Park on Onondaga |.ake. The largest crowd
assembled this vear at a political gathering tn
Central New York was present to hear him.

“Imperialism is a false ery,” he said. “Never
have I seen a Republican who wants a king or
who wanta this nation to be run as other na-
tions arerun. The doctrine of the Republican
party, which has been proclaimed for years, is
to carry the republican form of government to
other nations The Democrats raise @ cre
against inilitarism. I am amilitary man, but
never have been able to find out what they
mean by militarism. If they mean government
by the military, that is all bosh, for there
isn't an offieer in the United States but that
prefers a civil toa military jurisdiction. If by
intlitarism’they mean they are opposed to our
young men learning the things that will enable
them to uphold the flag, then they are opposed
to triotiam. Oneofmy sons, Col. Guy How-
ard, was killed in the Philippires while flehting
for the flag. and another one is fighting over
there now. Don't talk to me about taking down
our flag and giving the Vhilippinesavway. It's
an insult.”

the complaint said that he had noticed Fried-

that he had seen him pick up trifles on several
occasions, but had let It go by till lately he had

Friedlander was very indignant He said
that he hada wife and two children and he had

Acting Mayor Guegenheimer received a
letter yesterday from Lachman & Goldsmith,
who complain that thelr client, Willlam RK.
King, is the victim of a monopoly, and that
he ia being heldupon a eity contract. King
got the contract from the Armory Board last
June to make alterations on the roof of the
Twelfth Regiment Armory, for which he was
to receive $6,959. According to the spectfica-
tions the new roofing was to be covered with
fireproof mineral cement, the same aa that
on the roofa of the Ninth and Twenty-second
Regiment armories. The Ninth Regiment
Armory roof 1s covered with material made
only by a company in Montreal, Canada. A.
4. Hall.a contractor of 17 State street, this city,

who did the Ninth Regiment Armory job, Is
the sole agent for the Montreal concern in

this State

According to the complaint made by the
lawvers Hall will not sell King any of the
ceruent. called for in the specifications, and

Architect. Telfer of the Armory Board wont
jer King use any other material, Hut Mr
‘Telfer, it is said, is satisfied with the painting,
carpenter and masonry work already. done
by Kin King as a last resort asked fiall if
he would not put the cement on himself, and
requested him to furnish estimates for the
work. Hall wrote to King on Aug. 15, but
instead of sending estimates he sald that he
would furnish and put on the cement and as-
sume apart of the cost of the work already done
if King would assign the contract to him. Con-
tractor Hall tacked a poatecript to his letter
in which he sald: “Mr, King may come
out better than he expects.”

King, through his lawyers assured the acting
Mayor that there are fireproof roofin ce
ments as good as that contr: lled by Hall and
asked that a special meeting of the Armory
Board be tafled to modify the contract Mi
Guegenhelmer said that he would call a meet-
ing of the Armory Board on Thureday unless
the matter could be adjusted in the meantime,

WANT MISS LOCKWOOD POR TEACHER.

Another Meeting to Try to Persuade Sound
Beach's School Board to Reappoint Her.

Sovsxp Beacn, Conn., Aug 20.—Another at-
termpt is to be made to have Miss F. Ida Lock-
wood reappointed primary teacher in the dis
triet schcol. The School Committee refused to
appoint Miss Lockwood because she talked too
much about them and Principal F. H.
Strong of Meriden. The principal is
young and Miss Lockw« od considered that

she should not look toa man half her age for
instructions. He sought to have a Mr. Morgan
elected on the Schoo! Committe>in June 6o tbat
Miss Morgan, a normal graduate, migat be ap-
pointed as teacher of the primary. Miss Lock-
wood worked forthe reelection of Gilbert H.
Ferris and won. Then she felt sure of an ap-
pointment, but the mafority of the committee
said she had used harsh words against Mr
Strong while electioneering for Mr. Ferris and
would not engage her

She had as.ecial district meeting called and
the voters requested the committee to reap-
point her. On Friday last the committee noti-
fled Miss Lockwood that they would not heed
the request of the voters, Shefears that Miss
Morgan will get the place and her friends have
presented a petition to the committee to call
another meeting to instruct the district to ap-
point her.

The committee has sole power, not the dis-
trict. So the effect wit] be useless. The meet-
ing will be called, however, by thejcommittee as
required by Jaw, but in a day or two Miss Tock-
wood's successor will be appointed and it may
be Miss Morgan. Chairman Ferris of the com-
inittee says.

“The Sound Beach &ehool Committee are
very obstinate men to deal with. They are not
bidding for popularity ora reelection They
will not be swerved one hair's breadth from
what they consider the path of duty

hands and alell out his money. The clerk,
Dan Cameron, handed Harrington $4, but
wheo Harrington started to leave the store he
opened fire on him Harrington returned

Party of Twenty-seven to Hold a Convention.

The valiant twenty-seven who jumped into
he political arena at the Plaza Hotel two months
ago to rescue the United States from deatruc-
tion by organizing a new political party and

nominating candidates for President and Vice-
President, will hold thelr convention in Carne-
gie Hall on Sept. 5. The twenty-seven have
appealed to most of the nen who are opposed
to both McKinley and Bryan and whose
names are known to become thelr candidates
but nobody would accept. The twenty-seven
sent a delegation to the Indianapolis Liberty
Congress, {n the hope that its members might
be induced to nominate a third ticket, but the
J. {herty Congresa was packed by the Bryanites
and the twenty-seven were laughed at. They
will not permit anybody to attend the Carnegie
Hall convention who will laugh
