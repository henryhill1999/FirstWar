Flint’s Fine FURNITURE

THE SMALL HOUSE
WITH DEAL FLOORS.

ere is a capital suggestion.
nie small Sown iuees with deal
floors, where nailed down carpets are
used in all rooms, a large and restful
effect is produced by covering the main
soem of each story with the same
t.’”
ry it, you who have suffered fro
cramped and narrow apartments, and
see what an air of roominess results.
Small, conventicnal patterns, or, if
the carpets be used as a grounding for
rugs, plain colorings to harmonize
with the different color schemes—dall
reds, blues, greens, browns are here in
every weave and from 27 inches to 9
feet wide
Summer furniture still further re-
duced to make room for autumn de-

eigns.

DRESS GOODS!

The Fall Dress Goods Season starts here To-day and with the greatest
offering we have ever made. We have just purchased from one of the largest
Makers of Cheviot in this country his entire production tor this season, goo.s
that were woven for the finest Retail and Suit Manufacturing Trade, They
were secured by us at a price that will enable you to purchase to- day a dress or
as many yards as you like for less money than the Wholesale Houses and Suit
Makers would have to pay for goods of the same quality in Hundred Piece

“40,000 yards of
Strictly All-Wool High Grade
Cheviots

in rough twill and Zibeline finish, some 45 and 48 inches wide,
other grades 50 inches wide. Over two-thirds of this great stock is in
Black, the remainder in Light and Dark Navy and Brown. We have
divided the Collection into two lots and will sell them at these prices:

The Regular 1.00 Quality at 5O* yard.
The Regular 1.25 Quality at 69% yard,

Search through the entire line of Dress Materials for the present and the
coming season’s wear and you will not find a fabric suitable for Entire Cos.
tumes and Separate Skirts that will give you as much satisfaction in Wear and
Style as these goods, Nine out of every ten women will be looking for them

this Fall.
