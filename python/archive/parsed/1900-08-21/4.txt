LONG A SECOND MYERS.

 

The American Quarter-Mile Champion Sweeps
the Board of English Prizes.

Maxwell W. Long, the American quarter-mile
champion, has scored so many wins onthe Eng-
lish cinder paths since the international meeting
at Paris that his success now rivals that achieved
by the late L.. E. Myers, who in several seasons
almost swept the board of prizes in middle-
distance races onthe other side. From 100
yards to a quarter of a mile the New York A.C.
man appears to be tnvincible, and by winning
several races at the shorter distance he really
eclipses Myers's preformances, asthe old Man-
hattan A. C. sprinter was unable in his day to
take down the numbers of the English flyers
ati0o irs.

In addition to the many wins already reported
by cable or mail the London Field of Aug. 11
chronicles the success of Long in several races
at thetwo-day meet of the For onc.C., Oldham,
on Aug. 4 and 6 and at the ¥ ctorla C. C, sports
at Stoke-on-Trent on Aug. 7. J. W. B. Tewks-
bury, the old University of sapey iveaie sprinter,
was also successful at both of the above meetings.

On first day of the Royton sports Long
won the quarter-mile handicap from scratch,
defeating a big field, to whom allowed long
starts, in 51 4-6 seconds. Long ran in fine form
took command at the head of the straigh and
won by three yards from B. Heap of the Man-
chester A. C., 20 yards start. In the final
heat of the 220-yard handicap Tewksbury, who
ran from scratch got on even terms with his
field in the straight and, finishing all out, won

by 4 yards in 22 3-5 seconds from H. Lester
of lKdham, 4 yards. Tewksbury also
took second

plgce in the 100-yard handicap
from the one-half yard mark, in 10 1-5 seconds.
On the concluding day of the sports it rained
heavily, which accounts for the slower times
recorded, Long won the 100-yard scratch race
from T. Jervis of Manchester and C. W. Majury
of Belfast in 10 3-5 seconds, and the 220-yard
handicap from scratch in 23 4-6 seconds. Maiury
who is one of the best Irish sprinters, finished
second from the long mark of 8 yards in
the latter event.

At the Stoke on Trent meeting Long ran
perhape his best race on the other side. He

isplayed fine pace inthe quarter-mile handi-
con under unfavorable conditions. Wataon
o vonapert, who had 10 yarde start, led until
within iy yarde of the finish, when Lon
went by with a fine burst of speed and won al
out by 5 yards in 49 85 seconds. Tewke-
bury won the 300-yard hurdie race from scratch
WER qonoumamnate ease in the fast time of 38 4-5
seconds.

 

Experts to Piay Roque.

Norwicns, Aug. 20.-The nineteenth annual
gathering of the expert roque players of the
Eastern part of the United States will open
to-morrow morning at 8 o'clock on the grounds
of the Norwich Roque Club in this city, under
the auspices of the National Roque Aassocia-
tion of America. Up to last year this game
was known as croquet, but at the last annual
meeting it was decided to change it to roque
in order that the modern eclentific game as
played at the championship tournaments here
might not be confounded with the old-fashioned
lawn game played for social purposes, and the
name of the organization had to undergo a
similar alteration for the same purpose. There
1g every reason to justify the prediction that
the tournament will be the most interestin
and suc ‘u one at has mn hel
here since the first competition in 1882,

country will rticipate, and a series o

YORKS WIND UP THE TRIP
BY DEFEATING PITTSBURG.

 

 

Cincinnatis Win From St, Louls Agein-—in the
Recent West vs. East Series Pittsbarg Did
the Best Work-—Bostons Excelled Their
Rivals From This Part of the Circatt,

With New York's victory at Pittsburg yes-
terday, the last Western trip gf the season
was completed. The Eastern teams played
fifty-three games on the trip, of which they
won twenty-two and drew one. The Pitts- |

burgs made the best showing against the East, ,

winning ten out of fourteen games, St, Louis

captured eight and lost five, Chicago won seven
aud lost seven and Cincinnati took five out of
eleven, playing a draw with the Brooklyna,

The best work done by the Kast was that of the

Hostons, who played fourteen games, of which

eight were victories and #ix were defeats, The

Brook lyna won six, lost six and played a draw.

The New Yorks won six out of fourteen, while

the Philadelphias took a big turnble, losing ten

out of twelve. The Western teams have one
more trip to make East, which means that,
barring accidents, the Brooklyns should win
the pennant again quite easily, The Bostons
are playing much better ball now than io the
early part of the season and have a chance to
climb into second place, especially in view of
thirty straight games they are acheduled to
play at home, ‘The Cincinnatis easily defeated
the St. Louis team yesterday and are again
back in sixth place. The Bostons, in fifth
place, are within ten points of the Philadel-

phias, who are third. The Champions have a

lead of sixty-nine poiots, which looks safe,

The results;

New York, 4; Pittaburg, 2.

THE UNDOING OF

More Reasons Why the Pablic Is Losing Inter-
est io Baseball.

The resignation of Oliver Tebeau from the
management of the St, Louls team and the
appointment of John MoGraw in his place,
which was foreshadowed in Tue SUN when
the Mound City team was here last, means that
the Robisons have grown desperate because
of the low standing of the St. Louis team and
have been forced to make a change because of
public clamor, It remains to be seen just what
McGraw can do with the men who could not
win under Tebeau's direction, It may be an-
other case like that of the New Yorks, who,
under the management of Buck Ewing, could
not play ball a little bit, but who immediately
braced up when George Davis succeeded Ewing.

“MoGraw will have to make the present St.
Louis team win more consistently than it has
been doing if he expecta to enjoy the support
of the rooters, Baseball in St. Louis this sea-
son has been a big disappointment, not only to
the patrons of the game, but to the owners of the
club, The Robisons put up as much as $25,000
before the present season opened to etrenge 1

Manuger Hanlon concludes to let Kelley go, |
he will plus Sheckard permanently in lett

ng of players, by the way, has grown to ve
uite an evil, and has convinced the public
that the muanates are unusually open in their
desire to get the public's money. The trans-
fer of the timores to Brooklyn, the Cleve-
lands to St. tous, the Louisvilles to Pittsburg
und the contribution of Mercer, Bowerman,
Hickman, Frisbie, Selbach, Hawley and Smith,
gratis, to the New York Club can be held up
as un example of what the mugnates have been
doing to attract patronage. And yet in spite
of all there deals the magnates admit that
the business of the present elght-club League
is so poor thut a return to the old twelve-club
cireult appears to be desirable

American League Prosperous.

While the National League magnates are
complaining about the light attendance, the
progressive American League appears to be
enjoying unusual prosperity. President Ban
Johnson has enforced the rules against rowdy-
iam, has compelled the teams to play quick
games and has made himself a most useful
chief executive. On Sunday there was a con-
flict for the first time this season at Chicago
between the American Teague and the Na-
tional league teams. The Chicago American
Teague team, under Charles Comiskey'’s man-
agerneot, played a double-header with the
Milwaukees and the attendance was 10,500,

He Will Cease to Direct the Cherry Diamond
Athletes on Sept. 1.

Harry Cornish has resigned his position as
athietic director of the Knickerbocker A. C.,
and ithas been accepted by the Board of Gov-
ernors of the club, to take effect Sept. 1. It is
understood that the well-known tiainer intends
to retire from the field of instructing athietes
entirely and that he has another business in
view, although he has refused so far to divulge
the nature of the new enterprise contemplated.

There appears to be no doubt that the un-
pleasant notoriety caused by his unfortunate

connection with the Adams poisoning case is
the real reason of Cornish quitting the athletic
world. Officials of the club, however. state that
the director has by no means been forced out of
the organization, nd thathe is as popular as
ever with the members of the club. Cornish in-
tended to resign long ego. and it was cnly at
tho earnest solicitation of friends that he oon-
sented to remain in charge o! the athletics of
the club durine the past sumuiner.

James Ek. Sullivan, President of the Knicker-
bocker A. U., % en questioned on the subject
esterday, said ti at he learned on his return
rom Paris a few days ago that the athletic di-
rector bad handed in his resignation and that
the club was sorry to lose his serv.ces, as Cornish
was a great bustier anddid yeoman servicein
orgavizing track, baseball, football and aquauo

teams.

During the past decade Cornish has madea

rea’ name or himself in the athietic world.

n i890. when amateur athletic: was aimost
a caead letter in the New Enclan
trict, he took charge of the athletio de-
partment of the ton A and ran

the rst big indoor meet at Me-
chanics’ Hall, for which more than 600 entries
were received. The B. A. A. indoor meeting
has been an annual oawre since then, but not
one of the sets of eames bas been & xreater suc-
cess than the initial meeting. From Boston
Cornish went to the Chicago A. (. and it was
under his direction that the World's Fair cham-
pionship meeting was couducted at the Winay
City in 1803. In 19 Corui b assumed charge
of athletics at the Knickerbocker A.C. His ad-
vent in thiscity boomed up the sport consider-
ably gad he was especialiy heipiul to the
schoolboys who were encouraged by meetings
open to members of the Interscholastic A, A. at
adison Square Garden, and almost unlimited
facilities in the @ymnasium of the Cherry Dia-
mond organization

Cornis grgenived a water-polo team strong
enough to defeat the hitherto invincivle aquatic
experts of the N. Y. A.C. fer the water polo
championship and also turned out some good
football and baseball teams He was a first-
class athlete, and was of particular avvant ge
to the club in aports on the gridiron and
Giamond, as he piayed both football and base-

all we.

The tdea of holding an incoor circus to in-
crease the interest |) gymnastic work also
evolved from Cornish, and a quarrel over the
details of the circus up to the trouble
tween the athletic director and Roland Burn-
ham Molineux. who was a champion rerformer
on the horizontal bar and one of the stars of
the ciroua.

LIGHT WIND FOR YACHTS.

CORNELIUS VANDERBILT'S RAINBOW
SCORES AGAIN FOR NEWPORT CUP.

Only a Margin of Fourteen Seconds Between
the Winner and the Yankee—Leadeors Change
at Each Mark—Exciting Rush for the
Finish Line—Another Cap for 70-Footers.

Newport, Aug. 20.—The. Rainbow, owned
by Cornelius Vanderbilt, won the 70-footer
race to-day in the series for the cup offered
by the Newport Yacht Racing Association,
and as a result she now has eix points for the
cup, against the Yankee's nine, the Mineola’s
eight, and the Virginia's one, It was a very
unsatisfactory race. as the wind was contin-
ually shifting, and it was so light that the
15-mile triangle was sailed over but once,
At the two marks the Rainbow was led by an-
other boat, but by clever seamanship Capt.
Parker worked her into a position where she
had the advantage, and she crossed the linea
winner by 14 seconds,

The wind was very light in the early morn:
ing from the northwest, but it looked as if it
might freshen. The yachts stood outside
shortly after 10 o'clock, the Yankee leading
On board the Rainbow was Mrs. Vanderbilt,
and she proved a mascot indeed. Mr. John
R. Livermore was on the Virginia. There were
no guests on either the Yankee or Mineola.
The committee boat Mirage, with Mesars. R. N.
Ellis and A. Cass Canfleld of the committee on
board, took up her position off Brenton's Reef
lightship at 11:10, and twenty minutes later,
the advertised time for the start, the wind was
60 light that the postponement flag, code letter
B, was set. Soon after the wind freshened
some and it was decided to make @ start at
11:45. Code flag C, indicating the triangle,
was set at that time and the start was made ten
minutes later. There was some mancuvring
for position.

The Virginia got the weather berth, with
the Yankee in the neat best position, but just
before crossing the Rainbow luffed across the
Yankee's bow and fell away so that the latter
got her back wind. In this way the Rainbow
got the advantage and crossed the line Oret,
ten seconds ahead of the Yankee, the Virginia
a few seconds later. The Mineola crossed five
seconds after the handicap signal, well to the
leeward. All the boats carried balloon stay-
sails and big jib topsails. It was a reach of
four miles to the first mark, the wind being on

the port beam. The yachts had gone but a
short distance when the wind began to drop,
and Yrom a lst of several! degrees they contin-
ued to rise on their keels until they had gained
an upright position and fioally filled away ono
the opposite tack. There seemed to be a belt
of softness, and the yachts had just enough
headway to shoot through it from the north-
erly wind into the southerly wind on the other
tack. The Mineola saw the wind coming from
the south and was the first to point up for it, fol-
lowed by the Rainbow, there being little dif-
ference in their getting it. The Yankee and
Virginia pointed up higher into the northerly
wind, and lost some minutes thereby. The
Mineola was the first at the mark, she round-
ing thirty-five seconds ahead of the Rainbow.
On the reach she beat the Kainbow by fifty-three
seconds, but from that time on she was badly
beaten by the Rainbow. The mark was rounded
in the following order

With the wind a little westward of south,
it was a reach (to the second mark, The Mineola,
Rainbow and Yanké put for offshore, while
the Virginia went inshore, which proved a had
move as it was very softand when she got to
the mark she had lost haif an hour. On the
wind the Rainbow and Yankee did some great
work, the latter in particular eating right
through the lee of the other two hoats. The
wind all the time was hauling more to the south-
ward, and the yachts finally could lay their
course for the mark. On the wind

the best time, beating the Yankee 2 minutes and
66 seconds and the Mineola nearly 8 minutess
At the mark the Yankee was 29 seconds ahead
of the Kainbow, but she made a poor turn and
allowed the Rainbow to shoot up to windward
of her. The Rainbow soon had the Yankee

| blanketed and passed her without difficulty.

 

As soon as the boats got free wind they went
alo side by side for some time: finally the
Rainbow crawled ahead, and soon there was
daylight between the two boats. The head
eaila were taken in and ballooners set, and this
increased their speed. The Mineola did not do
this until she was half the way to the ightship
when the other boata drew away from her.
When about two miles from the lightahip it
was seen that the boats could not finish the Brat

round inside the time limit, 2's hours, and code |

flag B was set on the committee boat, indicatin
that the race would be finished in one roun
All the time the wind was hauling more to the
eastward, and about a mile from the finish
spinnakers were taken in, and with ballooners
belli well out, the yachts came rushing
for the finish line. It seemed to be a question
which one would win, but as they drew nearer
it was seen that it was the Rainbow's race
by a narrow margin. On the run the Rainbow
had made up the lead the Yankee had on her
at the outer mark and 24 seconds besides.
Ae the Rainbow crossed the line Mrs. Vander-

Lawson stable, whose name has been changed
to Dreamer, is showing such « that horse-
men will keep a shar) “ve on him wherever he
starts. Those who saw him win his first race at
Albany think he !s better than the sensational
Boralma. In the 223 trot he showed flights of
speed that marked him as a “comer.” His
astest heat was 2:15'¢: but in the fourth and
fifth heat, when Annie Wilkes, the favorite,
was eight or ten lengths ahead of him at the
half, he would cut loose after her, and was
separately timed the latter halves in 194 and
105. it i@ intimated that he is likely to be the

ANNIE BURNS'S BLUE HILL,

 

The Little Gray Mare Takes the Stake After
a Hard Fight.

Boston, Aug. 20.—-Grand Circuit week at
Readville opened under the most auspicious
conditions this afternoon, The weather was
perfect and the attendance large. There were
four events on the card, the 2:90 trot for the
Blue Hill stake of $5,000, the 217 pace and the
2:25 trot for three-year-olds, a purse of $2,000
being offered for the latter race. Naturally
interest centred in the Blue Hill and the last
event. The Blue Hill attracted attention on
account of the large entry list and the size of
the purse, and every one was curious to see
what 7s Ww Lawson's Dreamer
would do in the youngsters’ class.
The Blue Hill went to Annie Burns, as was
rather expected, on account of her having the
record of 2:12',, the beet of any of the field,
although things looked blue in the third heat,
when she went into the air at the first turn and
barely escaped being distanced. In Dreamer,
the crowd had a great disappointment. He
was the favorite with many, at even money
against the fleld, although Major Delmar was
liked by many. In the very firet heat of the
event Dreamer acted badly and at the quarter
post went into the air, and it took Gatcomb
the length of the back stretch to get the black

gelding down on his feat once more, but it was
then too lute, as the distance flag hud fullen
The first @vent to be started was for the Blue
ill stake. There were eleven starters and on
this account it was difficult for Walker to get
them away in anything like fair shape fut
after several trials he was su ul. Annie
Burns picked out first place in the heat on the
home stretch, from Mr. Middlemary, the pole
horse, In the second heat, it was a neck-and-
neck go between Annie and Mr. Middlemay,”
but the little gray mare proved too speedy for
the welding. After Annie broke in the third
heat Dillonite went to the front and took it
easily, In the fourth, Annie had such a poor
position that Dillonite and Gracé Onward were

nearly home hefore she got clear of the fleld,
but in the fifth she ra the life out of Dil-
lonite and won by @ length

There were gixteen starters in the 2:17 pace
and eatery 8 ireamure grove, himeolt a pod
one by ng the event in straight heats, Fre

. Wedgewood was favored somewhat, but he
was oR y close to the winner in the first heat.
Gy falnut was pick to win the 2:12 pace
and excepting the second heat, when the brown
geldin, wee a trifle off, he had things his own
way ‘\ta or Delmar was hardly counted
upon towin the purse for three-year-olds, but
he made things so lively for Emma Winter and
Junitara in the first heat that his stock rose,
He also took the second and third heats. Sum-

BRILLIANT TENNIS IN THE FINAL‘OF
ALL-COMERS CHAMPIONSHIP.

 

 

George Wrena Unable to Offset Larned's Rash-
ing Net Play—The Wiauer Will Play Cham-
pion Whitman for National Honors To-day
~Allen Wins the Conselation Singles,

Newport, Aug. 20.--William A. Larned of
Summit, N. J., redeemed himself in the final
round of the all-comers championshin lawn
tennis tournament at the Casino here this
morning, and to-morrow he will have his first
chance for the national championship after
ten years of hard work at the game. Larned
beat George Wrenn in the final this morning in
the easiest fashion, Wrenn getting only seven
games during the match. The ease with which
Larned won to-day materially improved hia
chance of success to-morrow, for a hard final
match the day before challenging the fresh

champion is considered a very heavy
handicap against the challenger Wrenn
did not show «as good form 4

against Gore on Saturday. Unquestionably
the different style of pluy affected Wrenn's
game. He could make little headway against
therushing, brilliant net play of Larned, where-
as Gore's base-line tactics were an entirely
different proposition and offered unlimited
opportunities for attack on Wrenn's part,
Wrenn tried to play safe to-day in the hope of
putting Larned off his game, burt it was no use,
and Wrenn was never in the hunt from the
start.

In the first set Larned did not get under
way at once, but after losing the firet game
he ran three straight without the score reaching
deuce. The fifth game was Wrenn's and the
sixth was close, but finally fell to the Summits
expert, who lost the next and then ran out the
set with two love games. Score, 6-3. Wrenn
kept pluckily at his work in the second ont,
and the first three games were al) deuced, Larn

etting two of them. But. Wrenn's chances
‘aded here,for [.arned settled down into one of his
invincible streaks after the score had reached
2-1, andin the next three games Wrenn got
just one point. After “neg the set by &—2, there
was a short rest and then Larned came out and
ripped Wrenn up again In astounding manner.
He took four of the first five games, in all fou
of which Wrenn got only 8 points, while ne
pressed him close in the single game he lost.
One more game, the seventh, went to Wrenn,
Then Larned took the eighth after it had been

deuced six times, andthe match was over,

Larned won by eighteen games_to seven, and
scored 108 points against 69 There were five
love games, all of which went to Larned and
six deuce games, four of which were won by
Larned and two by Wrenn The match was
the shortest fina! at Newp: rt for many years,
lasting less than an hour and a half.

In looking back over the tournament. it is
more than ever apparent that the British ex-
porte had not any chance to win, They were
oth drawn in the lower half while all three
of the crack American players, Larned, Wright
and Davis were in the upper half. 1t is safe
to say that all three of the first-class Ameri-
cans, as well as Champion Whitman, could
easily have beaten either of the visitors. Wrenn
was probably the strongest of the men in the
lower halt, but there were probably five players
in the upper half who could have
beaten hin and this years’ tournament. will
add one more strong argument in favor
of “seeding” the draw for the chaimn-
pionship in future. Larned's chances for the
championship to-morrow against Whitman
are thought to be about even. Every one
knows just what Whitman can do but no one
knows what Larned will do. If the latter
atrikee one of his brilliant streaks and can hold
it to the end of the match, nothing can prevent
him from winning the championship, but on
the other hand he is not at all sure to hold his
nerve until the end, even if he gets ahead. He
has repeatedly failed to hold an apparently
winning lead in previous years when he has
seemed to have strong antagonists at his mre

COLUMBIA FOOTBALL PLANS.

 

 

The Squad Will Start Practice at Brantord
Point Sept, LO—New Blood for Team.

W. B. Shoemaker, manager of the Columbia
University football team, is making preparations
for what promises to be an even more success-
ful season for the wearers of the blue and
white than the campaign last fall turned out,
At present the manager is at Riverside, Conn.,
but he bas made al! arrangements for the pre-
liminary practice of the squad. The candidates
will meet at 10 o'clock on the morning of Sept,
10 at the Murray Hill Hotel, where the squad
will be organized and taken to Branford Point,
Conn. ‘There its every facility for practioe at
that place and the men wiil be put tr rough the
usual training course until the Ume comes for
them to enter cones, when they will begin real
hard practice at Columbia Field.

Sanford, who turned out such @ good eleven
from scant material last fal!, has again been
secured as coach. He will be as-isted at Bran-
ford Point by former Captain ‘Burt’ Wilson
and the veteran player, W. P. Slocovitch.

The colivge is move ambitious than ever and
have outlin da schedule of gaines harder than
ever attempted before by a coilege te m.
Gams have been srranged with the big four,
Yule, Harvord, University of Pennsylvania and
Princeton, in addition to one with the Carli le
Indians and seven other hard teams. All these
w li be played w thin two months, so it ie ap-
parent that the Columbia boys have their work
on the gridiron cut out for them

That the team will be a good one is evident
froma pamphiet issued by Ma ager Shoemaker
in which he state- that many of the old piayers
will return to college and describes those who
will again donhe blue and white as follows

“Weeks and Morley, matchless half packs;
Wright, hercu ean centre; Knapp, shilful left
tackie: Smyth, bulldog right tackle, and those
other knig te of the gridi_on Woiff, Denman,
Berrian, Erving, Bruce, Van Holvenberg, to
say nothing of popular Capt Tom 8 mons.”

Ro addition to the above about forty promis-
ing players picked from a large number o
candidates have been selected to goto Branfor
Point, where a few good men are almost sure to
be developed int» stars by coach Saniord. The
team will be further reenforerd by a number of

ood men who will enter college this fall. C.

. Rodgers who played a strong game on the

tering college, requesting the men who have
the least foothall ability tohandin their names
