and Eberman were also connected with the
concern, About April 1 Ebergian had the
name of the door changed to Hall & Co. and

to float Electric stock on the market and to
manipulate the atock with a view to unload

 

it on the public 4 few days later, between
4.000 and 6.000 minmeograph copies of the ful-
lowing ciroular letter were sent out

Goslin had an office on the same floor as

Hall ¢ Co. directly across the court, so
that alenals could be ex: hanged between the
two oMfces. The firm of Hall & Co
waa rin by Goslin and Morgan. Then Robert

A. Ammon, so the affidavit asserts, appeared
t the office and suggested that the company be

Neorporated. Ha secured the incorporation
under the laws of New Jersey in) April, 180,
under the name of the New York Electrk Brake
and Coupler Company. The concern had no

asneta, bul advertised for a patent, which they
never purchased. Two other long circulars
were then sent ot, advertisements, reading
like the first circular, were inserted in news-
papers all over the country and more than 200
telegrams were sent out urging persons to buy
the stock. Charles (. Weedon, a curb brokef,
who was at that time working for R. F. Grey,
according to Alexander's affidavit managed the
saleofthestock onthe curb. CGoslin, Alexander
eays, gave him instructions regarding the sale
of atock and fixed the price on the curb) from
day to day. About June 25, ise, Rugene I.
Packer called at the office, but for some time
Nl knowlege of the deal on hand was kept from
im. Packer finally learned of it and was
taken in. His part was to go to Denver and
buy stock of the company on margin.
Romer. in his affidavit, says that in the latter
t of June, 18%, Louis Bogert, Thomas J
Bib ns, Gerard M. Eberman and Kugene |
Packer were sent out through the United States
to buy Fleetric Brake stock on margin through
different brokerage firms who had wire con-
nections with New York. Goslin gave Packer
7,700 with which to go to Denver and buy 300
shares of the stock ona 25 per cent. margin, or as
much leas aa he could buy it for, Romer adds
t henever aaw any of the officers of the New
ork Electric Brake and Coupler Company
{n the office of Hall & Co. that the company
never had any factory plant or assets of any
kind and that no books were kept, except as
to atock trahsactions, In the latter part of
July Goslin withdrew his support from the
rket and the stock fell to mothing at once
t is now, he says, absolutely worthless and
there have been no sales for a year,
pe particular charge against the six de-
fen ta is that Packer, with their knowledge
and gonsent, went to Denver under the name
of Edward Patton and induced Charles B
Whitehead, a broker, to purchase for him on
margin 800 shares of the stock, Packer paid
head $4,420.50. Whitehead charges that
he paid the difference and still holds the stock,
as Packer left Denver immediately after the
eal was made. An order for the arrest of
Goslin was issued by a Supreme Conrt Justice
on Aug. 10, 1900. Bail was fixed at $17,000,
on which Goslin was released.

SPECULATOR ACCUSED OF FRAUD,

@Beems Like a Case of Getting Even for a Bad
Trade, Magistrate Says,

Charles FE. Wellborn, real estate dealer, of
48 West Sixtieth street, was arrested yester-
day on a complaint made by Homer J. Beau-
det, a builder of 182 Nassau street, charging
him with having secured valuable property
by fraud and misrepresentation. According
to an affidavit made by Beaudet on which the
warrant was issued, one Joseph A. Stoll owned
rea) estate at Broadway and 107th street, valued

at $860,000, Wellborn met Stoll and, Beaudet
alleges, represented to him that he owned a
quantity of whiskey, worth from $2.50

to @ gallon, which was stored at Buffalo:
eix lots in Rahway, N.4)., worth $600 each, 120
acres of jand in Florida, worth $100 an acre,
@ plantation valued at $90,000, with 84,000

He offered to trade these for

 

ay II's. tty pre t After the trad d
oll's clty property. er the trade was made
Stoll, so heaudet alleges, learned that the

whiskey was not worth nearly as much as had
been represented, and that the other prope
erty had been greatly overvalued, When Well-
born was arraigned in the Centre «treet po-
lice court yesterday Beaudet admitted that
civil suit to recover the property had been
begun in New Jersey.
You did not tell me that when vou asked
for the warrant.” said Magistrate Crane, It
s to me as if you had made a bad trade
without first making an investigation.”
eliborn was paroled in the custody of his
counse), John D. Lindsay, pending’ further
examination.

DR. cOomBS RELEASED.
A Civil Sait Will Have to Be Instituted if the
81,000 Fine Is to Be Recovered.

Former Coroner Edward B. Coombs of Brook-
lyn was released from the Kings County Peni-
tentiary at 1 o'clock yésterday afternoon, 4s
Supreme Court Justice Mattioce directed that

the fine of $1,000 which was a part of his sen-
tence was illegal. Dr. Coombs was convicted
of presenting a false and fraudulent bill for
$2,660 for inquests that were never held. He
was sentenced by Supreme Court Justice Keogh
to imprisonment in the Kings County Peni-
tentiary for one year and seven months and to
pay a fine of $1,000. His term expired on Sun
day morning, but as the $1,000 had not bee
paid Warden Hayes refused to discharge him

Former Assistant District Attorney Frederick
E. Crane obtained a writ of habeas a =
order to test the question of the legality o the
$1,000 fine. He explained to Justice Mattioe
that there was nothing in the commitment
directing that Dr. Coombs should stand com-
mitted one day for every dollar of the fine until
it was paid. : a

The exact wording,” said Mr. Crane, “is that
Coombs be confined for a year and seven months
and pay a fine of 61,000."

“Hoes it say that he shall stand committed
until the fine ia paid?” asked Justice Mattioe.
bm. No, air,” said Mr. Crane, “where there is to be
imprisonment for a fine imposed it, must be
aistinetly clted in the final Judgment.

Asalstant District Attorney Elaer contended
that it was a custom of the prison wardens to
hold any prisoner at the close of his term of
imprisonment where a fine was im i
that in this case the prisoner would be held to
serve out a day for each dollar, although it was
not expreasly cited in the Judgment.

“How long could a warden hold @ man in
such a case as this?” asked Justice Mattice _

‘A thousand days for $1,000 fine im °
said Mr. Elder, “or until the Court passes on the
case in review. It would be a farce to impose
a fine in a criminal proceeding and then let the

isoner go.”

Pr justice Mattice read the law in the matter
and then ordered the discharge of Dr. Coombs
from the penitentiary. When Warden Hayes
was served with the order he notified Dr. Coombs
who in a short time was prepared to leave the
ison. As he was leaving Warden Hayes
fanded him a new five-dollar bill which is the
customary present to all persons upon thelr
discharge. Dr. Coombs has grown & fair-
sized mustache and to all appearance isin better
condition physically than he was before he
went to prison. His counsel eave the only
remedy lett with the people is to begin a civil
action against Dr. (Coombs to recover the
amount of the fine. Dr. Coombs {is sald to be
without any money

HELD ON EXPERT TESTIMONY.

 

 

 

William J, Kinsley's the Principal Evidence
Against a Clerk Accused of Forgery.

David Wolf of 441 East 117th street was
held on a charge of forgery in the Essex Mar-
ket police court yesterday, on the testimony
of William J. Kinsley, the handwriting expert.
Wolf was the confidential clerk of Isaac Krau-
schauer, a cloak dealer of 270 Grand street.
Krauachauer went to Europe several months
ago, leaving Wolf to mail a number of checks
to pay outstanding indebtedness. One of the
checks was for a bill of $383.92, owed to Solomon
Littenberg, a cloak dealer of 300 Canal street.
On Krouschauer's return, Littenberg as-
serted that he had not received his check, al-
though Wolf declared that he had mailed it
with the rest. Investigation showed that the
cheok had been cash at a local bank and
bore Littenberg'’s and Krauschauer's alleged
{ndorsements. They declare that the indorse-
ments are forgeries. The fraud was reported
fo the Post OMoe authorities and then Expert
Kinaley was called in. He secured a sample

of Wolf's handwriting and after examining {t

declared that Wolf had written the forged

indorsements. es
Lawyer Abe Levy asked for Wolf's dis-

charge io court yesterday on the ground that
the sole evidence against him was furnished
by a handwriting expert and it would be ridicu-
lous to hold him on such testimony. Any
number of persons could haye obtained pos-
session of the check, sald Mr. Levy, and no
jury would convict a man of unblemished
reputation on @ mere opinion, The case was
continued until Friday next.

COULDN'T TALK AFTER HIS BATH.

Sarf Kaocked Mr. Clangh Down and Took
Away His Power of Speech.

PorTLaNp,, Me., Aug. 20.—John B. Clough,
a well-known citizen of Memphis, Tenn., and
Clerk of Courts for Shelby county, Tenn., met
with a peculiar accident while bathing at Old
Orchard Beach on Saturday afternoon, Mr
Clough, who ts 54 years of age, went in bathing
at high tide, when the surf was unusually high.
On account of the cold weather no other mem-

oers ofbis family went into the water at the
same time. The waves were pounding the
beach with terrific force and oue of unusual
size struck Mr. Clough when he was least ex-
pecting itand knocked him down, He was
almost helpless and had barely strength to wet
back to his cottage. As he did not rejoin the
family after some little time, Mra. Clough
went to hia room and found her husband
lving en the bed in a dazed condition. He
was unable to answer her questions except
by signs and since then has not been able to
speak. He was brought to the Maine general
hospital here and has not improved. The
physicians say {t is one of the most peculiar
cases they have ever encountered,

Allen, a wealthy farmer, was awakened early
yesterday morning by a voice demanding his
money or hts life and on opening his eyes he saw
the muzzle of a revolver close to his face. At
first Mr. Allen thought ft a joke, but soon real-
ized the seriousness of the situation and volun-
teered the information that there was some

jewelry in the bureau drawers. Mra. Allen
awoke and gave 4 hysterical scream as she saw
one of the burglars helping himself to watches,
rings and stickpina while the other man stood
«wuard over her husband. The outery awoke
the daughter and an aunt, who hurried to the
room to ascertain its cause and were ordered
back to their beds. After securing the family
pocketbook, Mr. and Mrs, Allen were locked in
their room and told to stay there until daylight,
but the daughter let them out an hour later
The loss to the family was about $100 in money

The Violin Found in Breoklym Identified as
That Stolen Five Years Ago.

Two violin experts went to Police Head-
querters yesterday and after examining the
violin which Central Office detectives found in
a Brooklyn shop last Friday night said that it
was not only a genuine Stradivarius, but that

it was the viol@ which was stolen from Prof.
Ivan Joseph Bojtin March, 1895. The experts
were John Friederich, a dealer in violins at 16
Cooper Union, and Bernard Sinheimer, a violin
instructor of 160 East 170th street, Mr. Sin-
eimer, the detect! ves say, was Signor Nicolini's
violin instructor when Nicolini was thinking of
purchasing the violin in 1895, and he then ex-

FINANCIAL AND COMMERCIAL.

 

7 Monrpar, Aug. 2.
The stock market was saved from stagnation
to-day by the operations of several houses hav-
ing direct’ telegraphic communication with
Chicago and by a few Board Room traders.
The first named were sellers, particularly of
Poeple’s Gas and the Granger stocks, and the
majority of the traders followed the Chicago
lead. The principal demand for stocks came
from a speculative interest that had been play-
ing the long side of the market for some time
past and which apparently disposed of some
of ita holdings when prices were at their best
last week, No reason was advanced for the
comparatively heavy selling of People’s Gas,
though a reduction in the dividend was sug-
gested, as it has been many times before, by
the operators who were bent upon depressing
the price of the stock, At a substantial frac-
tional recovery, People's Gas closed more than
a point lower than on Saturday. ‘The dealings
in it were larger than in any other stock
Brooklyn Rapid Transit very nearly approached
it in reapect to activity and was sold effectively,
apparently because of the sudden death of the
senior member of a firm that has to an extent
been identified with the property for several
years, The alleged basis of the selling was
#0 unsubstantial that the stock rallied sharply
and recovered at the close the greater part
of the loss sustained early in the day.

Other stocks in which the dealings exceeded
10,000 shares were Sugar Refining, Atchison
preferred, Union Pacific and American Steel
and Wire. The lastnamed was neglected until
the late dealings, when it was bid up sharply
and it was one of the few stocks that finished
fractionally higher than at the close of last
week. The only noteworthy net gain was that
of 3*{ polots in General Electric on light trans-
actions. The absence of support was con-
spicuous in Sugar Refining and in consequence

it sustained a net loss of nearly 2 points, Lon-
don took no active interest in this
market and prices abroad were, according

to cable advices, depressed by moderate sell-
ing from this side. If the Chinese complica-
tions and the domeatic political situation had
any effect upon the speculation it was of a
negative character, that is, those circumstances
tended to repreas speculation. The only local
occurrence of interest was the disbursement by
the Sub-Treasury of nearly $2,250,000 on ac-
count of the redemption of the old 2 per cent.
bonds, making the total disbursements on that
account Saturday and to-day nearly $3,750,000
In the late dealings the market rallied, chiefly
on the repurchases of stocks sold early in the
day. The closing was dull and irregular.

Cotton was quiet at a moderate advance. Liver
pool was disappointing, but dry weatber still pre
valled Inthe Atlantic States, a continuation of the
fair weatber was predicted, receipts were as light as
ever, crop advices in many cases were distinctly un
favorable and the spot markets though Gull were
firm. Accordingly there was little inclination to sell
and ona demand from local and Southern sboris

rices readily advanced ‘The Chinese news was less
avorable than recently, reports from the dry goods
trade were bearish. Texas crop advices were some:
what better and increased receipts are expected. The
drought tn the Atlantle States, however, was the
Goreenee factor. August was depressed by liqui
