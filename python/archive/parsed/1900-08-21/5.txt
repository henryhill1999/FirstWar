The Message to Aguinaldo,

Mr. Bryan has given to AGUINALDO
his solemn pledge that if he is elected he
will summon Congress to alienate the Amer-
fean territory in the Philippines and to
make the Filipinos independent of the
authority of our Government while we
continue to be responsible to the world for
their deeds or misdeeds.

“Keep up your insurrection yet a little
while longer,” he says. “Keep on killing
our Lawtons, If I am elected President
your cause {s won.”

The necessary expenses of a student
in the academic department of this unl-
versity may be computed at from $190 a
year upward, according to the mode of
living; this estimate, however, ts exclusive
of the tuition fees, which range from $60
to $100 a year, but are remitted to
natives of Virginia, There are a number
of scholarships, which relieve non-Vir-
ginians also from the payment of tuition
fees, and some special scholarships which
entitle the recipients to from $200 to $250
a year, There are, moreover, five fellow-
ships conferred upon deserving graduates.

The equipment of the university for the
work of instruction, alike in the academic

perialismus grows worse, That newspaper
is now raving against prosperity and
the full dinner pail. Mark these symp-
toms of acute Bryanity:

“The tomates of our almshouses and jails are fed
three times a day. The worst oonricts in our State
prisons have thelr dinner pails Milled as @ matter of
course. ‘Ihe farmer does as much for his cattle. The
cows get their corn with regularity, aod likewise the
pigs their swill. But are HANNA & Co, quite sure
that American workingmen are to be captured and
taken Into the {mperial camp and harnéssed up to
drag the chariot of the trusts tn a« triumphal proces-
sion of grasping greed and soulless commercialism
by the mere assurance that they shal! fare as wellio
the matter of meals as papers and criminals, and be
as regularly fed as if they were cows or swine?"

So a full meal, or a series of full meals, is
disreputable and bestial. It makes a man

proved bad. It simply concentrated the medi-
cal supply at the divisional hospitals, leaving
the regiments lacking needful medical atten-
dance. New Jersey has been one of the leading
States in National Guard matters; {ts medical
service should maintain its standard.

Cariyle on the Man With the Hoe.

To THE Fortor or Tak Sun—Sir; It has
often happened in my experience that a well
chosen quotation bearing on a mooted question
will end the whole controversy. I need there-
fore no pardon for introducing the following
passage from Thomas Carlyle, which, so far
as I can see, settles the “Man With the Hoe”
question {mpartially. It occurs in his chapter
on Helotage:

“Two men I honor, and no third. First, the
earth-made

that the Imperial party must have done some
rapid travelling to get eo far on their Journey
to Bi-an-fu supposing they left Pekin on the
11th as first stated. The Japanese cavalry are
said to have left Pekin in pursuit, but if the
court has the start and escort described, it
seems rather arisky adventure.

The Japanese, who have taken the lead, ap-
pear to have coinein conflict with the Chinese
troops guarding the Imperial palace soon after
entering Pekin on Wednesday and fighting was
still going on when the last despatches reached
Japan. Thelr headquarters were in the
Japanese jegation, but the main body of the
division was quartered in the villages
outside the Anting gate, one of the
northern gates of the Tartar aity,
The reports, however, are so fragmentary
and some so contradictory, that we shall have
some time to walt before having a clear view of

thousand now stationed here in favor of the
Demopop party. You will undoubtedly think
this is expressing It too strong, but if you were
over here you would find the sentiment in favor
of holding the Philippines as here stated. The
insurrection has at last been brought to a 6uc-
cessful end. All organized armed resistance
is something of the past, though there are a few
bands of inhuman flends (iadrones) still at
large, murdering, burning and robbing where-
ever they go. if these people call themselves
patriots, why don't they quit murdering in-
nocent people, burning their houses and carry -
ing Wealthy Filipinos off to the mountains hold-
ing them for large ransoms? ‘This is the kind
of warfare the American soldiers have w deal
with at the present, but they are assisted by all
right-thinking Filipinos. Nearly every = in-
eurgent officer has n brought in and with
one or two exceptions have taken the oath and
sworn to defend the flag of the United States.

would be convicted, We do not want to
gee him convicted; we are very far from
wanting to see him hanged. It is our sincere
belief that when he sent his message of hope
and patience to the insurgents in Luzon
Mr. Bryan did not understand the full sig-
nificance of his words, or foresee their pos-
sible cost measured in the life blood of
American soldiers now executing the laws
under orders from the United States Gov-
ernment.

But Mr. Bryan might incriminate himself
technically by overt act of treason a hun-
dred times without incurring one-hundredth
part of the blood-guiltiness In which his
Message to AGUINALDO has perhaps al-
ready involved him beyond withdrawal
or reparation

His accuser is Henry W. Lawton, who
wrote home a few days before he was slain
by an insurgent:

“If Tam shot dead by a Filipino bullet, [t mightas
well come from one of my own men, because I know
from observations confirmed by captured prisoners
that the continuance of fighting Is chiefly due to
reports sent out from America.”

And what report that ever went out from
the Leversons, the ATKINSONS, the Wrn-
sLows and the Scarnzes in America ia
comparable in murderous potentiality to

 

FERSON, it contained, at the time of the
fire in 1895, some 53,000 volumes, By con-
tributions from sister institutions and
from publishing firms and private individ-
tials, the number of volumes has already been
nearly restored to the figures attained before
the fire, It is expected that liberal money
appropriations toward the further en-
largement of the library will be made by
the Board of Visitors in the near future.

We add that in pursuance of the prece-
dent set by the great English universities,
summer courses in Latin, chemistry, anat-
omy and law are offered at Charlottesville
to those who are able to give only a small
fraction of the year to the acquirement
of a liberal or professional education,

 

Northern and Southern Treatment
of the Negroes,

Southern newspapers are suggesting,
very naturally and very reasonably, that
after the Jate riotous assault on negroes in
New York Northern people might becom-
ingly reflect on the Biblical tlluatration
of the beam and the mote before venturing
to anathematize their Southern brethren
for “negro outrages.”

“We never knew any mob or riot in the

eating and give up the Philippines."’ There
are not many persons sufficiently altrutstio
to take this advice. So common are com-
mercialism and greed, and of 80 much more
importance than AGUINALDO to Tom, Dick
and Harry are Tom, Dick and Harry!

 

Baseball.

The manager of the Brooklyn baseball
club, Epwarp Hanon, has expressed
frankly to a reporter of the Cincinnati
Enquirer his conception of proper conduct
on the part of ball players, looking upon
them as a belied and aggrieved group of men.
Regarding the question of bad language
he said:

“The men who play baseball are not a lot of dum-
mies. ‘They may call the umpirea ‘stiff’ ora ‘lobster’
ff they think they have been unjustly called out; but
this talk about obscene language is merely all rot.’

The League two years ago made a great
ado about regulating the language of the
players, We commend to them Mr. HANION's
opinion that any criticism of the umpire not
positively indecent or vile is all right.

Mr HaNton's rejoinder to the complaint
that the players constantly violate the rule
forbidding them to question the umpire's
decision, the necessary foundation of com-

pensable, for thy daily bread

“4 second man I honor, and still more highly:
Him who ts seen toiling for the spiritually indis-

sable; not daily bread, but the bread of
Rife. Is not he too in his duty; endeavoring
toward inward Harmony; revealing this, by
act or by word, through all his outward en-
deavors, be they high or low? Highest of all,
when his outward and his inward endeavor
are one: when we can name him Artist; not
earthly Craftsman only, but inspired Thinker,
who with heaven-made Implement conquera
Heaven for us! If the poor and humble toil
that we have Food, must not the high and glo-
rious toil for him in return, that he have Light,
have guidance, Freedom, Immortality? -These
two, in all their degrees, T honor: all else is
onal and dust, which let the wind blow whither
it listeth.”

And again’ “It {s not because of his toils
that CT lament for the poor: we must all toil,
or steal (howsoever we name our stealing),
which is worse; no faithful workman finds his
task a pastime. The poor is hungry and athirst;
but for him also there ia food and drink; he is
heavy-laden and weary: but for him also the
Heavens send Sleep, and of the deepest; in his
smoky cribs, a clear dewy heaven of Rest en-
velopes him, and fitful glitterings of cloud-
skirted Dreams. But what I do mourn over
{s, that the lamp of his soul should go ont; that
noray of heavenly, or even of earthly knowledge
should visit him: but only, in the haggard
darkness, like two spectres, Fear and Indigna-
tion bear him company. Alas, while the Bodr
stands so broad and brawny, must the Soul
lle blinded, dwarfed, stupefied, almost anni-
hilated' Alas, was this too a Breath of God
hestowed in Heaven, but on earth never to he
unfolded! That there should one Man die
ignorant who had capacity for Knowledge,
this I call a tragedy, were it to happen more
than twenty times in the minute, as by some
computations it does. The miserable fraction
of Science which our united Mankind, in a
of Nesclence, has acquired

 

placed is atill entangled in Manchuria, though
gradually overcoming the Chinese and Man-
chu resistance, The European Powers, in-
cluding England, that are represented by
squadrons and contingents, seem more anxious
about particular parta of China than for the gen-
eral {nterest of the Empire, which in the ab-
senceof a collective understanding and agree-
ment among the Powers tends to bring about
that territorial partition so much to be depre-
cated. The French Minister of Foreign Affairs,
M. Deloassé Jeq@predited with the desire to have
an internatiopal conference meet in Paris to
settle the Chinese question, but unless it aa-
sembles at a very early date it may only
meet to register accomplished facts or to
raise discussions that may lead to war be-
tween some of the Powers. The separate ac-
tion of several of the European Powers {n con-
nection with alleged spheres of influence adds
to the uncertainty of the who'e situation,
which is increased rather than diminished by
the reported determination of other Powers to
participate with England inthe control of the
Yang-tse Valley.

YOUTSEY'S TRIAL CALLED.

Pat Off Until Tharsday to Allew the Defend-
ant's Health to Improve.

Grorortown, Ky., Aug. 20.—The case against
Henry F. Youtsey, !ndicted as one of the five
principals in the murder of William Goebel), was
called by Judge Cantrill this morning. Youtsey
was well enough to beincourt. His attorneys
filed a motion for continuance on the ground
that he was too sick to stand atrial, that one
of his attorneys, Mr. Stephenson, had typhoid
fever and that fifty-two out of fifty-four of his
witnesses were absent. State's Attorney Frank-
lin opposed a continuance on the ground that
due diligence had not been used by the defence.
Col. Nelson for Youtsey said that subp@nas
were senton June 21 for W.S. Taylor, Charles
Finley, W. J. Davidson and W. O. Bradley to
the counties where they usually re-
sided. He read the affidavit which said
that Taylor and Davidson would testify
that Youtsey had a gun in the building

only for the purpose of defence and that it had
no connection with the killing of Goebel; that
Finley_ wouldi testify that he tur. over to
Caleb Powers all_the keys he had tothe doers
of the office. The affidavit of Dr. Carrick.

the Supreme Court yesterday Justice Fitzger-
ald, who had known the late Justice Smyth
closely for years and had sat with him in Gen-
era! Sessions, said:
“Before taking up the business of the day I
desire to announce to the bar the death of Jus- *¢ ¥
tloee Smyth of this court. At this time and
under the existing circumstances I could not
trust myself to speak of him either asa man or
aJdudge. He was a dear, personal friendof « e
mine, and one to whom I am deeply indebted
for acts of kindness extending over a great
number of years. I suppose the Justices of
this court at some future time will take appro-
priate action. For the present I will direct that
the clerk make a minute of this announcement,
together with the expression of my deep regret
and high regard for the lamented Judge."
It ts required by law that this branch of the
court shall be open at all times except on hoil-

days. Justice Freedman in Special Term, Par!

I, also spoke in eulogy of Justice Smyth, and

announced that out of respect to his memory

his part of the court would not be held to-day

All motions set for to-day will stand over until
) to-morrow.

The two parte of the Court of General Se<-
sions, which are nni thia month under
Judges Cowing and McMahon, were adjourned
yesterday morning upon motion of Acting Dis-
trict Attorney MolIntyre out of regpect to the
memory of Justice BMyth. The adjournment
was until to-morrow morning. Justice Smyth
was once a Judge of General Sessions.
