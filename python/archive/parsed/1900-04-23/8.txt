rent to $50,000 and paid half their faxes by rent-
ing stores to the Second National Bank and
others, while the billiard rooms, eafé, bar and
} r ving in revenue enough to equal
theamountof the rent. It is certainly a well
paying property and there is much speculation
as what will be done with it. The tnost |
widely accepted belief is that the owner of a |

department store willbuy ft with the intention |

rereeting a store on its site when the present
leases run out

The site of the hotel was oceupied in 1850 by

ST. GEORGE' 8S MEMORY KEPT GREEN.

He Stands for IPravery, Chivalry, Patriotism
and Piety, Dr. Morgan Says.

The St. George's Society went to the Church
of the Heavenly Rest yesterday afternoon for
the special service held in honor of England's
patron saint. A large American flag hung on
the right of the altar and a large British flag
onthe left. The Rev. Dr. D, Parker Morgan,
the rector, preached the sermon, St. George,

he said, stood for bravery, chivalry, patriotism
and piety

“TItisthe memory of his patron saint that
strengthens the heart of the Englishman and
enables him to perform the heroic deeds for
whieh he is famous,’ the preacher said. “It is
the thought of St orga that spurs the Enge-
lishman on to face danger and undergo sulfer-
{ng and conquer difficulties for his country, as
he is doing to-day in South Africa. And Fne-
lishinen here or men of English descent are
none the less true and lovalto their adopted
country that they ce‘ebrate the day of Eng-
land's patron saint.”

THIEV AND MONEY BOTH HELD.

Victim From Pennsylvania Wants to Kaow

How He's to Get Home Without Cash.
John Michaels, a miner, came up from Penn-

sylvania last week to see the sights, He wan-

dered along the Bowery on Saturday night til
he reached McGurk’s dive. Then he stood on
the sidewalk with open mouth gazing at the re-
sort he had heard about Inthe mines

trousers pocket and was running up the
Bowery. Michaels put after bim then, but was
being left behind when Policeman Sander
stopped the thief

Hollies, who said he came from Boston and

had no home here, handed over the $8 to the
policernan and pleaded guilty to the charge of
robbery in the Yorkville police court vesterday
The miner asked that the money be returned
to him, as it was all he had to pay his board
here and take him back to Pennsylvania
Magistrate Mayo explained that the pejceman
would haveto keep the money until the pria-
oner's trial in General Sessions, as it was the
principal part of the evidence against him

“When will the trial be held?’ inquired
Michaels.

The Magistrate could not tell him

“But how will I pay my board or buy a ticket
back to the mines?” the miner next wanted to
know.

The Magistrate said the situation was very
unnleasant, but couldn't be helped

“I suppose I'll have to tramp hack to the
mines. I wouldn't be any worse off if the thief
got away,”' was the miner's final comment.

The Magistrate told him the money would be
sent to him after the prisoner's trial.

REAL ESTATE NEWS.

Although the week just finished has been full
enough of business to cause brokers to look
back upon {t with satisfaction, especially in re-
gard to the auotion sales, the coming week
offers the most Important property listed for
gale atanction this season, that of the Fno
estate, comprising the Fifth Avenue Hotel and
the Madison Square Theatre. The former Del-
monico place at Broudway, Fifth avenue and
Twenty-sixth street, will be sold on the same
day and by the sume auctioneers, Peter F.
Meyer & Co

The lat of private sales made last week shows

that investors ure beginning to buy more tre. |

quently along the line of the Rapid Transit
subway and especially near the places where
the stations are to be. Prices are probably as
low at present as they will ever be, and the tn-
vestor with the ready cash can probably make
a better bargain to-day than some months
hence, This is particularly true concerning
property well up in Harlem andin The Bronx.

The sale of the property of the Pell estate was
the most important of the doings at auction
The failure of the bidder on Broadway prop-
erty to sign the memorandum of sale after the
property was knocked down to him, was a sur-

prise to real estate men, who hope to see the |

Supreme Court declare that he must fulfil the
contract which he made when he bid for the
property after all the conditions and cireum-
stances affecting it had been made known by
the auctioneer before he began calling for bids
There is much gossip concerning motives
which might have influenced the bidder not to
complete the purchase, other than the one
given.

The following are the tables by districts, for
Manhattan and The Bronx, of the convey-
ances, mortgages and projected buildings for
the week ending April 21:
