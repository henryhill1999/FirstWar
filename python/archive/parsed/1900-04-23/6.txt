£ 7.000.000 of new stock, the report of which

< impending a few weeks ago, ita officers de-

ied as vehemently aa they could, threatening
dire vengeance on its authors, nobody ventures
to qecuse them even of Inconsistency,

In view of these faets, and of hundreds of
otiors ike them, moralizing on the depravity
they involve Is “a wasted alms of breath.”
Nor is it of more use to warn inexperienced
operators against being deceived by similar
tricks in future The confidence game and
the “wreen goods” swindle have been exposed
often enough, one would think, for them to be
well understood by every one who can read the
newspapers, but they find fresh victims daily
ko, too, the schemes for making fortunes out
of nothing, such as those for which one ad-
venturer has just been convicted and sentenced
ty prison, and another ts on trial, are anything
but novelties, but they seem to be new to
many, and toattract themas sugar does files.

rhe root of the evil is not so much in the

edness and the perverted Ingenuity of those
who thus practise upon the eredulity of the
publie, as In the widespread moral unsoundness
of the public itself. The recorded transactions
of the Stock Exchange.of the Produce Exchange,
of the Cotton Pxehange, and of the other arenas
of mercantile speculation, show that the num-
ber of people who are trying to get money,
not by getving property or rendering service
in return for it, but by speculating upon the
chances of the market, is enormous, Fvery
one of these gamblers fancies that he is skilful
enough or will be Incky enough to beat his
opponents, and is neually quite willing to assist
his skill and his luck, by any device not forbidden
in the Penal Code. Outside of the exchanges
is another multitude who bet upon horseraces
or risk their money in the numerous gambling
saloons, which, though thelr existence is oM-
cially denied, notoriouly infest our great citles

When, therefore, the unscrupulous stock
operator aims at persuading the crowd to
buy stocks of him at prices {far above their
value or to sell them at prices as far below
it. he has for his ally a greed for money and
a disregard of honesty equal to his own. Those
who buy of him or sell to him faney that they
are going to get the advantage of him. They
assume either that they know better than
he does, what the commodity he offers is worth
or that, although they do not know it, other
people equally ignorant may be found to pay
them nore than they pay for it, or to sell it
for loss than they sellitfor. This is the charac-
teristic of all great speculative crazes, When
prices are rising every ona who buys, no mat-
ter at how high a price, calculates on selling
@! one still higher, and, when they are falling,
he expects to buyback what he sella on more
favorable terms. Ordinarily, too, one who

short" believes he is wetting more for
what he setia » tnan it is worth and that he is
profiting at the expense of the buyer
i to the desire for gain by buving and
seeding stocks, is that) for large incomes
frow eapital. In the competition for good
Investments, the undertakings which have
provel their trustwortiiness by a long ca-
f snceess, become deservedly favorites,
and participation in their profits can be pur-
aedonly at prices which reduce the
income from them to a low fleure. Obviously
thye who buy into them before their success
is damonstrated get an advantage over thore
who walt, and it is on a skilful employment
ofthis fact that the launchers of new scheme.
depend for customers, Experienced investors,
who have learned the truth of the Duke of
Wengton’s maxim, ‘High interest means
bad eourity.” are not easily caught by the
captivating promises of these adventurers
hat there are plenty of people who are, and

reer «

w sieve that high Interest = and
eed security go together. Instead of con-
eudes that because a stock is low priced
ts value 4 doubtful they assume that the lower
tis the better it is for them to buy. By a

Pimnors of inereased dividends they Jump
tothe conclusion that the rumoris well founded
ani pay, as we saw them paying a vear ago,
Twiee as much for stocks as the dividends

they have since made would have justified

It \s noticeable, too, that the victims both

to be scarcely worth having. The question
resolves itself into this: Which is more desira-
ble, a small income with vafety for the princi-
pal, or a large ono with a probable loss
of the principal? It would seem that no eensi-+
ble person would hesitate to choose the small
fnueome with safety, rather than the large one
with the risk it involves; yet multitudes do
Just the contrary. ‘They #ay that they eannot
liveunless they get the large income, not
considering that in trying to get it, they may
come to having no ineome at all. Men, too
who ought to koow better, encourage them
in their delusion. For exemple, in opposing
the Mortwage Tax bill proposed at therecent
Fossion of the Legislature of this Statea num-
ber of savings bank presidents gravely de-
elared that a reduction of the interest paid
to thelr depositors would ditcourage thrift!
As if the littl interest pald on deposits, Le
it more or less, was of any importance com-
pared with the safety of the principal! So,
too, itis frequently said that a low rate of Inter-
est makes it not worth while for a working
man to lay up money, but that, if hel« to
getonly 2 or 3 per cent, ayearfor it, he may
as well spend it as he goes along, Those who
talk in this way forget that if uo interest at
all were paid, the principal would still be worth
something, and that, before the days of sav-
Ings banks, money was hoarded in hidden
receptacies,as it still is in India, as a provision
for unforeseen emergencies,

For all this, the mass of the public will go
on believing that what Mr. Morgan. Mr. Carne-
wie, Mr. Whitney, and the Rockefellers have
accomplished in the way of making fortunes,
every ong may accomplish if he only has good
luck. They overlook the fact that these men
have not only had good luck, but possess ex-
tracrdinary ability, and that their ability has
counted for ten times as much ip their success
as their luck. They delude themselves with
the idea that they are quite as capable as any-
body to judge of the merits of an investment,
and acting on this delusion they become an
easy prey to sharpers who encourage them
init. So it always has been and so it always
will be MATTHEW MARSHALL,
