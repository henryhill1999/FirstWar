West Show this year will be for the most part
what it has always been. Some of the indi-
viduals that used to wet all the applause and
some new ones have come in For instance,
there is Con Willams of the “R bar T’ outfit ob
Rawhide Butves, Wyo. Con Williaiis isn't feel-
ing just as good as he might.

“Pour weeks ago yesterday,” he says, “Il was

The outfit, it sent me to Omaha for tre: itment
and they cut bie open and fi Mme up some,
but Laint just in shape to ride a bucking horse
yet.”

Some of Con's companions, who are elder

than he in the show business, say that when he
was coming over from Jersey City on a ferry
boat and all the wonders of lower Manhattan's
sky were spread out before him,they asked Con
what he thought of it, and they say that he said
in the most puzzled way:
