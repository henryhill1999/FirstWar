PROSPECT OF A SENSATIONAL RACE
FOR THE FUTURITY,

 

Unusnal Number of Highly Tried Young. |

sters Eligible for Next Saturday's Big
Event—Saratoga Presents an Attract
ive Programme for lis Closing Week.
The advent of the classic Futurity supplied
the chief topic for this week among horsemen,
regulars and casual racegoers, Since the now
historio event was instituted {np 1888 by the
Coney Island Jockey Club {t has never prom-
{sed such a race aa invites patronage at Bheeps-

head Bay next Saturday. At least three stables |

hold strong hands and recent developments at
BHaratoga have so altered the complexion of
affairs that the issue grows more Open as the

date approaches, A fow weeks ago it way)
generally conceded that the Keenes
had the stake “cornered” with

Ulympian, Tommy Atkins and Cap and Bells
The stable has also a maiden daughter of Dom-
ino-Dart Maiden, named Spry, and another
Domino filly named Noonday that is said to be
one of James Rowe's surprise packages, The
latter may be ridden by Sloan, It looked to be
acase of the famous ‘‘polka dots” all the way
up to last week, when John EB. Madden cut loose
W.C. Whitney's colt Ballyhoo Bey at Saratoga
{na morning gilop. Kingston's son devoured
space at such a olip that Madden signalled to the
Jockey to ease up, but the colt was in a racing
vein and, despite restraint, went Ove furlongs
over a poor track in 1:00, Aboutthe same time
Irritable got in his fine work and burned up
the track at Saratoga in such Impressive style
that the rail birds immediately rated him as
fully twelve pounds better than Bonnibert.

The uncertainty of the outlook for the big
classio is stimulating the ambition of other
owners and one of the best if not the largest
field on recurd is anticipatedif the intervening
trials prove satisfactery to the various owners
and trainers. Beside Ballyboo Bey, the Whit-
ney stable has a maiden named Sneaky, by

Medd! er-—Silvie, and the highly tried colts Prince
Charles, by Joyali t-Yorxville b ile and Eik-
horn, by Belvicere--Elkhorn L ss. As useful
supporters of Irritable the Fietachmanns cio
turn out their Sir Dixon colts, Blues and
Shooter and their Margrave youngster, Mur-

ravite, while the chances of Telamon, Ondur-
dia, Elizabeth M., Helen O'C., Sweet Lavender,
Tower of Can les, Apple of My Kye, All Green,
The Parader, and Lady of the Valiey are not to
be ignored.

The Futurity will be effectively inuroduced by
the Fall Handicap of $2,000, first of the annual
series of three which carry an aggrecate vale

of $6,500, The first race of the set is for three-
year-olds and upward at six furlougs onthe
main track

‘The racing furnished by the Saratoga Asso-
clution enters on ite last week to-day as the
promoters do not see any profit fn utilizing the

are e ough plums left to check the exodus from
the Spa, ¢xoept among train ra who. have rods
in pickle for the Futurity. The card for to-day
is unusually attractive and promises high-
class sport. A weill-fliled six-fu long dash for
four-yeir-olda and upward leads up toa han-
dicap for three-year-olds and upward at the
trying distance of one mile and three-six-
teenths. Firthis event the topwelaht isd. H
Carr's useful and well-named Fonso horse,
Wait Not, out of Wait Awhile. There was a
time last season when the title was regarded as
a joke, as the horse persisted in waiting
at the post = and whipping in severai
moderate flelds. More recently, however,
Wait Not has justified his nomenclature,
and although he has not raced since May 20 at
Gravesend he wil probably bear out the handi-
capp 18 high opinion of his morits. Whether
Wait Not can win at the weights {s another
question. Such recent prominent performers
as Trillo, Peaceful, Alsike, Kiog Bramble and
Radford have all to be considered, and the
amateur form students who try to beat W. 8.
Vosbureah athisown game are confronted bya
hard proposition this time.

The handicap paves the way for the second
running of the Grand Union Hotel Stokes, a
double event worth in the aggregate $12,000, for
two-year-olds, J Schorr'’s crack Hindvo
colt, Alard Scheck, Won the first d vision.o: the
rece on Aug 4 from The Parader and Luke
Ward, ali carrying 112 pounds. The Schorr
colt covered the five furlongs easily in 1:00 flat,
and as a consequence will have to shoulder a
-even-pou d penalty to-day. His stable mate,
Lady Schorr, isin at 11@ pounds and on her
last race will probably be the choice of the
stable.

‘The two runners up on Aug. 4are not named
to vo again, but J_E Seagrass Far Rockaway,

who then figured among the ‘also rana,”
accepts the save welght of 122 pounds, The
reppet pair. Prince Pepper and King Pepper,

BIG FIGHT NEXT
Fitz and Sharkey Will Meet on Date Oriai-
nally Selected,

Bob Fitzsimmons did not do any work yester-
day, but confined his exercise to a constitutional
on the board walk at Bergen Beach, In the
morning Fitz went in bathing. He is an ex-
pert swimmer and gave an exhibition to some
of his iriends.

Lanky Bob's sore left hand ts apparently
on the mead, At least it appeared so to THe
SUN reporter who examined the member care-
fully. All that remains of the accident is a
slight scar and a little swelling. Fitz, when
questioned regarding the hand eald that it was
ali right. In fact it is aound enough, he says, to
warrant him indulging in boxing again Bob
will begin to-day and will put on the gloves
with Bob Armstrong, the colored heavyweight
and Jeff Thorne, the English middleweight.
Fitz says that Armstrong will remato with him
unul after the fight. He considers him a good
man to have around training quarters and
says that Armstrong is fast developing into a
clever pugilist, Although Fits is in excellent
shape already he does not propose to take any
chances. fle is afraid if he leta up in his labors
entirety he will become stiff.

Reginning to-day Fite will make wrestling
a part of bis programme. He hus engaged
Prof. Atlas, who has met Ernest Roeber and
others on the mat. Fits expects to engage tn

daily bouts lusting three quarters of an hour
with Atlas ws he Uhinks that wresUing 4 u great
test for urman’s wind, Fits seemingly is net
at all decided as to his future plans, When
asked by the reporter whether he would pos

“I think Sharkey's strength and rushing
tactics will wear Fitz down,” said Tom. “te
will win all right and 1 predict that the mill
will be a short one.”

‘The Sea Side Sporting Club has finally yielded
to the request of the public and sporting men
from all over the country and yesterday at a
meeting of its directors the club decided to
change the date of the big batttle from Aug.

it. Both. Fitzsimmons and Sharkey readily

MoGovern and Jordan May Not Fight After

It looks as {f Ben Jordan will have to re

chance of meeting Terry McGovern. Late
on Saturday night Martin Dowling, who rep-
resents Jordan's interesta in this eountry,

wis informed by Sam Harris that McGovern
would take on the Englishman, but it appears
that Sam made thls promise without due de-
liberation. Terry, who starts on the road
the latter part of this month, finds that he
is unable to cancel the engagement and Dow-
ling was notified last night of this. fact.
MeGovern says he is not afraid of Jordan or
any one elae, but he does not see how he can
break his contract without legal trouble. The
matehmaker of the Twentieth Century A. C,
is confident that he may yet arrange a match
and told Dowling to wait until to-day before

said that Wringe was too good a inan for Parker
to beat. It did look that way, but in the
last two races Capt. Parker has fought it out
with Wringe at every opportunity and his work
has been loudly. praisec

It was reported to-night that Mra. John Jacob
Astor was to offer a cup to be raced for by the
70-footers as soon as they finish the series for
the Newport Yacht Racing Association eup,
In order to win the latter the Rainbow would
have to win all three races this week, while
if either the Mineola or Yankee captures one
race the Rainbow will have no show, The
Virginia cannot possibly win the cup as she
has only one point to her credit.

LAWN TENNIS.
a
Wrenn's Success the Talk of Newport~-English
Players Disgasted.

Newport, Aug. 19.—fHlostilities were sus-
pended here to-day among the lawn tennis
experts and those who are still left in the un-
finished struggle are glad enough of the sin-
gle day's rest before the final and challenge
rounds of the championship are played. George
Wrena's success is the talk of all the tennis
men, To-morrow he will meet Larned and
many believe he has a good chance to win
from him. It will be remembered that Larned
never has been able to win the all-comers’
tournament here, although repeatedly a etrong
favorite. In his #ix years of successive strug-
gles for the championship between 1802 and
1898, Larned was beaten four times jn the finals
and twice in the semi-finals, Although the
odds favor a victory for Larned to-morrow,
the betting being 10 to 8 or 10 to 7 in some cases,
that is no guarantee that he will win, for the
odds were $ to 1 on Davis against Paret last
year and he was beaten, and Larned if no more
certain in his play than Davis. In fact he
has always said he was “hoodooed" at Newport,
and he is hoping to break the spell to-morrow,

Larned is living aboard of Richard Stevens's
steam yacht in the harbor here, and he has been
keeping quiet to-day, resting for the fina] strua-
gle to-morrow, while Wrenn has gone out of
town for a change of air, Most of the other
tennis men have been about the Casino all day
talking over the battles of the week, and few
have started off for their homes or the next
tournament at Niagara-on-the-Lake, Both of
the English experte are still here and they
talked freely about their lack of success

Gore, who was captain of the ioaleb chal-
lenging team, is chagrined at his defeat, for he
wus sure of beuting Wrenn yesterday, and did
not even fear defeat when the score was two
sets all,
off his game, but it fs also true that Wrenn de-
serves a great deal of credit for putting him
off by forcing his weakest points and taking
every advantage of his inability to lob. He
has not been in us good physical condition as
he should have been, the water here havin
affected him somewhat, but he owed his defea
more to his bad temper than to his health.
Wrenn's delibegaje manner bothered him
so much that Hin under the restraint
of playing slow@r than he was accustomed
to, After the match he said he could not get
up any interest in the play. He was bored,
he declared, by Wrenn's slowness and quite
off his game He said he was heartily sick
of the whole thing, and had had enough tennis
for the season, and would not play any more
when he got back home, He and Black will
stay here to see the championship meeting
finished and will then sail for home on next
Saturday's steamer from New York. Black
is as much disgusted as is Gore. fle said to-

thousands of dollars, trav-

day:

“Fancy spendin
elling thousands | miles and wasting a month
or more of time, and then not winning a single
match, It's frightful, ian’t it?”

Champion Maleolm Whitman arrived here
on Friday and began practising at once for his
defence, He has shown. wonderful form so
far, easily beating every player who has tackled
him. The general impression mong the ex-
perte is that he will not be beaten. If Larned
should win to-morrow and challenge him,
will have a chance, of course; and if he should
be able to strike one of his brilliant streaks
and hold it till the end of the match, he might
win the championship. Wrenn's style of play
is thought to put him out of the range of prob-
abilities, for Whitman is much tco clever at
steady play to be beaten by any other man of
the same type. It will take a brilliant rushing
net player to wid the championship from him.

 

 

WRESTLING.
Bothner Defeats the Rassian Giant in Straight
Falls.
George Bothner, the wrestling instructor

of the Pastime A. C., defeated Alexander, the
Ruasian giant, in two straight falls yesterday.
The contest, which attracted :nuch attention
because of the disparity in the size and weight
of the men, drew a larce crowd to an enclosure
on the banks of the Fast River at Sixty-sixth
street, where the mat was placed on the grass
and a space roped off for the spectators, Alex-
ander weighs 180 pounds and is 6 feet 2
inches tall, while Bothner barely tips the beam
at 140 pounds. The men were matched to
wrestle Greco-Roman style, with the proviso
that if the Russian gained the first fall, the sec-
ond bout should be catch-ns-cateh-can, and
if a third bout became necessary the style
should be decided by the toss of a coin, Strangle
and full Nelsons, or any hold that sbut off the
wind were barred.

Bothner was as brown as a berry and the
dark hue of his skin was a marked contrast
to the delicate pink of the Russian when the

Atter a few seconds tryin
for a hold Bothner bobbed his head up and
caught the Russian on the nose. It started to
bleed and this appeared to confuse the giant
when the pair dropped to the mat, The big
man made an attempt to down Bothner, but
quick as a flash the little fellow turned the
tables and secured a rolling fallin one minute,

After fifteen minutes’ rest the men came
out for the second bout. About a minute was
spent in futile efforts to gain a hold. Then
Bothner dropped voluntarily to the mat. The

body hold and spun Bothner
around gingerly. but failed roland his shoulders
on the mat. After trying a_few holds and
good deal of play around the Russian's injured
nose Bothner got the giant's head in chancery
His arm was around Alexander's iaw and Ref-
eree Frawley looked to see if it was one of the
barred holds

1 haven't cot a etrancle hold.” calmly said
Bothner, and with that he twisted the Rus-
sian’s neck until the latter went down in 4 min-
utes 40 seconds

Refore the main bout L. Jost of New York
and W. Miller of the Pastime A. C. wrestled
at 126 pounds. Jost gained the first fall in
2 minutes and 15 seconds and Miller the second
in 2 minutes and 45 seconds. The men wrestled
out time in the third bout

At Vailsburg yesterday, the old style of
pacing with multicycles minus motors was
reintroduced, but it wes of a poor quality, and
the feature of the programine, a ibmile
race between John King and W. 8. Fenn, “the
boy wonder,” did hot amount to much. The
vacing was ragged and the riders repeated]
font their pace. It was, however, a fairly close
contest and Fenn, who led by a few yards up
to the thirteenth mile, was beaten by 150 yards

The other races furnished good sport. Al
Newhouse came to the front in grand style in
the half-mile professional, beating rank

Half Mile Ope:

 

Eighty-one riders started at 6 o'clock yes-
terday morning in the second annual run of

the Penn Glen Wheelmen of Brooxlyn. The
course Was to Coney island, Rockaway, Lyn-
brook, Herm by way of the

ystead and back
Merrick pond The roads were in good con-
dition and sixty-seven of the star! ors finished
in time to receive medals. Six women started
and all of them flushed, They were Mrs.
Francis Bartels, Miss M. Seaman, Miss Sophie
Buell Mrs, Frank Moore, Mrs. FE. Brown, Mra,
J. Millette. Capt, Fred W. Beyhi of the Penn
Glenn Wheelmen was captain of the run. C.
P. Staubach, of the Century Road Club, was
pacemaker of the first division with D. M.
Adee and D. Reilly assistants. J. Sehearson
and W. ieghenhetmer paced the second division.
A large silver joving cup that was offered as
a prize for the club having the greatest
number of finishers was won by the Century
Road Club Association, which had twenty-five
men check in. At Arverne the first division
was scattered and seven or eight riders bowled
over by a drunken farmer on horseback, who
deliberutely charged the wheeling party. One
man who finished broke the rim of his front
wheel and walked four miles to a repair shop,
yet got in within the time limit. One of the
oddest tricks ever done in a century run was
that of a rider who broke his wheel at Valley
Stream. He was “broke” himself, but he made
a deal with a repair man Where by he traded
his broken new wheel for an “old tub,” got some
cash to boot and finished the ride with money
in his pocket.

 

The Cnttenbure races yesterday were wit-
nessed by the largest crowd of the season,
| The sport was up to the average and some
| snappy finishes oceurred. The best race was
i the half mile amateur which Bedell of Lyn-
| brook won by inches. The one mile_match

men, and Schreiber, Harlem Wheelmen, was
too easy for Schofield to be exciting, the Brook-
