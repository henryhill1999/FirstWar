avocess IN AMASSING WEALTH,

Whether the increased activity, which the
gtock market displayed last week was due to
oe genuine revival of public interest, or whether
ft was a show gotten up by the brokers for
thelr own purposes, in a question which no
mere onlooker can answer. Still, that the de-
monstration ta in favor of higher prices is grati-
fying, and that the large exports of gold have not
been made, this time, as they often heretofore
have been, 44 retext for a selling movement.
shows a conscfousness of the country’s financial
etrength, which ia in pleasing contrast to the
selfedeprectation which has eo long prevailed
among us. Moreover both are evidence of a
preponderant belief in the coming defeat of the
gllverite candidate for the Presidency, and fn
the maintenance of the present solid foundation
of our financial system

The ¢ f Mr. Collis P. Huntington and
the inciden's f his long and sucoesaful pursuit
of wealth have received in the newspapers the

  

place of f nence usually accorded by them
to the doings of milllonatres, For, in spite of
the efforts of moralists and religious teachers

to disseminate the contrary belief, the vast
majority of peop's, as newspaper editors know,
are convinced that the good things of this
worldare the things best worth striving for, and
that the nan who accumulates the greatest
fthemis the one most to be respected
Not that the same estimate of
the desirability of riches does not prevail in
other cour triesaswellashere. Theonly differ-
ence {a that elsewhere, honors, dignities and
politica! power are more sought afier than
they are with ua, and that the attainment of
them {« the occupation of a creater number of
able men. Here wealth takes the first rank,
and political and literary distinetion the second,
andoeven polities is, by many, resorted to merely
asan instrument for acquiring wealth. Our
politictans often become rich, but our rieh men
gekiom go into polities after they have acquired
their rhc as they very frequentiv do in
Great Britain, for example, Even those of
our newspapers who profess the loftiest prin-
ciples habitually sneer at a “ mere politictan,’
witie ther have no words of reproach for mera
money grubbera, and into what Is called the
best society the men who direct public affairs
are rarely admitted. In that soclety, Indeed,
{t la not the posseasion of wealth only but its
lavish expenditure that gives distinetion A
man may have millions, but unless with them
he builds magnificent town and country houses,
furnishes them expensively, and gives coatly
halle and banquets, they go for nothing In com-
parison with the millions of those who spend
them for the entertainment of the pleasure
seeking crowd. In the financtal world alone
does wealth, as wealth, command respect, and
{t commande it there because of the power It
gives its owner to make and to mar the pecuniary
fortunes of those by whom he is surrounded

it ia curious to observe how tmbedded in
our language and in our Ilterature has become
the conviction of the preéminent value of
material wealth By “goods” nothing else
is meant than things good to eat, drink, wear
and in other wavs capable of contributing to
phraical enjoyment. When a man is said to
be “worth” so much, his value is computed
in money, and not by reference to his virtues
and usefulness, When Shakespeare's Shylock
calla Antonio “a good man.” he explains it br
adding “My meaning. in searing he ia a good
man, {s to have vou understand me that he
a sufficient; yet his means are in supposition.”
In Thackeray's Vanity Faotr we read “You
tee,” said old Osborne to George, “what comes
of merit and industry, and Judictous specula-
tiona and that. Look at me and my b&nker’s
account. Took at your poor grandfather,
Bedley, and his failure And yet he was a
better man than | was this day twenty reare,-—
a better man, | should eay, by ten thousand
pound.”

Mr. Huntington's progress from poverty
to affluence repeats generally, in its incidents,
that of dozens of other men who like him have
begun with nothing and ended by possessing
millions, Indeed, so often have others done
what he has done, that some tmperfectly tn-
formed theorizers-among them Mr, Andrew
Carnegie have laldit down as a prinviple, that
no man who did not start in life poor, ever
attained emimence. How far this is from the
truth we have only to look around us to see,
That success, even in amassing wealth, has
been frequently achieved by the possessora
of wealth at the outset, is proved by the ex-
ample of the late Moses Taylor, by our living
J. Plerpont Morgan, by Mesara. W. K. Van-
derbilt, August Belmont, James Stillman, the
Asiors, the Goelets, and dozens of others
When it comes to politios, literature and science,
history i« full of the names of eminent men
who began their careers rich. and never made
a dollar in their lives in mereantile or indus-
trial pursuits, Mr. Huntington, we are told,
had at the age of 14 nothing, and earned
only $% the first vear he worked for himeeif
This $&4 he saved, and in two years more added

iter s

quan
and admired

hes,

to It enough to make it $175. He was then i7
years old, and by the tme he became 2! he
had accumulated capitul enough to enable
him to go into partnership with his brother
{on @ country store In six years more his
meant had become sufficient for a business

venture in California and from that he went
on, step by step. to the building and owner-
abip of vast railroad properties and to dying

for he died after all,—“worth” $27 000,000

A nasty reading of Mr. Huntington's blog-
raphy, as the newspapers give it, leaves upon
the mind the Impression that success in asm aas-
ing wealth ls not a difficult thing to achieve
All that seems to be necessary is to save up a
few hundred dollars early in life, go into bust-
ness with them, and thereafter to roll them
over and over jike a snowball until they become
a many nulllons as are desired, It fa not
considered, that, while many men can and do
save up $84 and more in their fourteenth year,
and, by the time they are 17, are possessors of
at least £:75, very few ever add to this 6175
enough to make it, by the time they are 2),
@ much as $1,000, and fewer still make it after
years of toil as much as $100,000. Evidently,
Mr. Huntington had something more than the
faculty of saving money: be had a genius for
soqulring it, as men have a genius for playing
the violin, for writing books and music, for
military affaires, and for politios

For example; up to the time that Mr. flunt-
ington Joined with Messrs. Stanford, Hopkins,
and the Crockers, in building the Central Pa-
ciflo Railroad, he had aceomplished no more
in the way of amassing wealth than had been
done by dozens of contemporary California
Adventurers, or than has been done elsewhere
and at various times by thousands of other
men. fe had toiled incessantly and of what
he gained by his toil he had spent no more than
he absolutely needed to keep himself alive.
The fatigue and the privations be voluntarily
endured, the unremitting strain to which he
subjected himself and the vigilance with which
he watohed for every chance of making @ good
bargain, were not peculiar to him. Multl-
tudes have gone through the same experience
@od with the same result. Unlike those mul-
Utudes he had a business sagacity that looked
beyond merely piling up dollar upon dollar,
day after day. He saw, as few others saw,
the possibilities of profit in building the Trans-
continental Railroad on the liberal terms offered
by Congress, and he had the courage and the
self-reliance to stake his entire fortuneon the
Correctness of his judgment. Had it been
wrong he would have been ruined: jt provec
to have been right and he won millions by it,
He was lucky in having the opportunity offered
him: and lucky in having the ability to appre-
Clate and seize it. It lay open to the whole
World; be was one of the few who knew enough
to take advantage of it,

What ts true of Mr, Huntington is true of ali
the others who, like him, have posseased in an
ag degree the talent for amassing wealth.

ordinary man he launched out into great enter-
prises, extended his business over the whole
world, invested largely in New York real estate
and thus was able to leave behind him the mil-
lions which his descendants etill retain, There
were dozens of Staten Island boatmen who once
seemed a4 likely to become millionaires as Cor-
nelius Vanderbilt did, but they had not his ge-
nius for profiting by their opportunities, and,
therefore, while he went on from ferry boating
to steamboating, and from that to running
ocean steamships and finally railroads, they
kept on in the usual Jog-trot routine, and passed
away in obscurity. Jay Gould is another
example of the same kind. Had he not pos-
sessed unusual money-making ablilty he would
probably have been nothing but a land surveyor
to the end of his days, and have accumulated
bo more than a modest competence, Similar
cases abound, but it is not necessary to mention
them. The race for riches is Ike one on the
turf. The fleld start out pretty nearly all
abreast, but the one or two best horses soon get
to the front, leaving the others to achieve no
more than the reoord, that they “also ran,”
Fortunately for thé world, the conviction that
he has not a talent for amassing wealth comes
to @ man only after repeated efforts and re-
peated failures. Every young aspirant for
fortune in his vocation assumes that he is going
to succeed as a matter of course, He may not
look forward to the greatest prize tn the lottery
but he ia sure in his own mind of winning a tol-
erably big one. As a budding lawyer once suid
to Mr. William M. Farts, who was congratu-
lating him on his adnilssion to the bar, and
expressing the usual good wishes for his future;
“1 do not expect to become an Evarts or a Howe,
but I think I -hall find a place where my abilities
will be recognized.” Blessed illusions of youth!
Rlessed cabbage, that ever dangling before the
donkey's nose, And ever receding, as he atretches
hie neck to capture It, forever keeps him trot-
ting after it! MATIARW MARSHALL.
