It was on the morning of April 12, 1s, that

passengers--an officer and a man near the
town of Baler, where they were to try anil cise
cover the position of a church in which it was
sai. a party of Spanish were bereiget by in-
surgente. The men were lance! safely, but
Gillmore’s boat was ciscovered by the enemy
@ little later as he was gving back to the mouth
of the river which tows past Baler. To throw
off suspicion as to the real purpose of his tmp,

THE NEW CUNARDER BRINGS A
TOWNFUL OF IMMIGRANTS,

Doesn't Horry Them—Wasn't BKullt To- Gives

Heds—Boy Lost His Mother and Search-
ing Parties Keanited Them-®-Day Boat,

The new Cunarder Ivernia, the third largest
steaiuship in service, exoseded only by the
colossal White Star Uner Coeanic, aud the

North German Lloyd record-holder, the Kalser

Wilhelm der Grosse, completed yesterday her

tmalden trip from Liverpool and Queenstown to

this port. She was not bullt for breaking re- |
cords, but for making revenues. Uf she does as

well on her future trips a3 she has on her first

voyage she will answer. She brought 2,000

tons of cargo, consisting chiefly of machinery,

which is lews than onesixth of the dead weight
she can carry, but she had more than 1,700 lin-
tinigrante, nearly all the third-class passengers

that she could accoumodate

On other English liners the designation “third

class’ means steerage The Cunard folks say

there is no steerage aboard their new ship. The
immigrants have better quarters in her than
the second-cabin ooean croasere had less Wan
@ quarter of a century ago ip first-class single
screws. They sleep on wire mattresses in
| rooms on the main deck that can conveniently
accommodate from twotosix persons They

also have @ smoking room and two promenades,

one on the open deck for fine weather, and tbe
otherin a large iuclosed space op the upper

deck There are uiso a sitting room for women,

baths for all hands, and in every room @ wash-
stand, mirror, water bottle and glasses Every

iniougrant in the ship who was old enough t
talk suid yesterday that he would rather truve
on the ivernia than ve ashore

The voyage, except op Saturday, was pleas-
ant ‘hen there was amoderate gale But the
weather had little effect on the big ship, whore

that they had assured her that he was all right

more about the matter, feeling contident that
