A Blow at Personal Liberty.

Hereafter, if a cortain bIU now tn Congress
becomes a law, whenever a eftizen of any
Btate has been indicted by a Federal Grand
Jury in another State or in another district
he will no longer have any rights before a
committing magistrate, However innocent
he may be, he will not be allowed to show
his innoceace; he cannot be heard in his
own defenoe, but voiceless, will bo forth-
with remanded to the custody of a United
Btates Marshal and carried by force to the
strict where the indictment has been
found, and, perhaps, summarily couvicted

nocomplished? Tho worls {s already half

passed the Senate of the United States and
ja now in the Committee on Judiciary of
the Houso of Representatives. It ts a bill
which, in briog, makes the indictment alone
absolute and conclustve evidence of the
gnilt of the person ac cused,

For more than a century, and In fact ever
fince the enactment of section 33 of the
@udiclary Act of 1739, it has been the law
that before yon cin remove to another
district amy person aconsed of crime
against the United States, {it must be
shown t the Judve to whom an appll-
cation ts made for an order of removal
that, {n fact, a crime or offence against the

In the case of a man whose removal ts
gought tn the State of New York, aa the
law stands to-dov, he ts entitled to jnst
guch an examination before the Federal |
Judge or Commissioner as ts held before
committing magtstrates in this Rtate,
Facts and circumstanroes showing the
probable guilt of the neceused must be

by oral testimony of witnesses, Aurraise or

ment found in the district or State to
which it is sougnt to transport him {s not
fuflictents because it !s not legal evidence
that any ortme against the United States
has been committed, but is merely tho
opinion of a Federal Grand Jury in the
place where the indictment has been foun » |
An fndictment is merely an acmusationor a
pleading drawn up by a District Attor-
ney, not even formally vertfled, and
designed only to put the defendant on trial.
The defendant to-day, by the well-settled
law as interpreted by the decisions of the
Federal Courts, has an absolute right, in
his own defence, to adduce evidenoe of his
{nnocenos, {n order to save himself from
unfair accusation and unfust perseoution,

In the recent Gaynor case Judge AvDISON
Brown of the United States District Court
followed his dectsion tn the Dana ease heard
fn 1895, and held that the acensed has
the right to examine witnesses in his own
behalf when arraigned for removal, and
that such rizht cannot lawtully be denied,
In the Dana ease tha learned Judge used
this striking language:

“In making this provision for an observance of the
practice in ase tn the State ¥ here the arrest is made,
fe may be reasonahis sumed that the intention of
the Judictary Act was to prevent the hateful appear.

“Salvation, O Salvation!”’

As the Seoretary of the Church Missionary
Soetety of London remarked at the Mis-
slouary Conference on Monday, this present
or nineteenth century has been the period
to which Protestant missions have chiefly
been confined, but a very great part
of the progress achleved has been within
the last fifty years only. The missionary
inovement began almost simultaneously
ainong the Protestant Churches and ta their
conception {t became soon of foremost
{mportance, Tho early missionaries, on thelr
return visits, recefved an enthusiastic wel-
come and thelr reports from lands then
strange aroused the passionate religious
feeling expressed in the famous missionary
hymn:

“Shall we whose souls are lighted
With wisdom from on high;
Shall we to men bentgiued
The lamp of life deny?
Salvation, O salvation,
Tho Joyful sound proctatm.
Pill each remotest nation
Has learnt Messiah’s name.”

The test of the depth and fervor of the
religious faith and devotion of a Church
was the consunuuae fire of {ts missionary
zeal, Of tho inhabitents of the world, at
least two-thirds were men “ bentghted,”
ond stil, in spite of the half century of
notive and self-sacrifeing missionary effort,
tho ratlo remains about the same, or, in
round numbers five hundred milifons in
Christendemn to ons thousand millions in
*henathendom fy this we do not mean
to imply that the work of evangelization
has been without fruit, but that great aa its
numerteal results have been, the converts
made have not exceeded the natural growth
of the populetion and probably have fallen
below it. Actually they have heen rela-
tively few. Tt has seemed and still seems a
hopeless tasic, but as a missionary to India
declared last Sunday it ia not hopeless to

of humanity and in introducing our

however, they are conferring practical
benefits on the people among whom they go
which must tend to conetliate the favor of
many, inspite of the distrust provoked by
European conquests and reasonable fears
that nominally Christian civilization Is yet
to be forced on them violently and their
own social and political systems to be com-~
pletely destroyed. We should feel the same
{f forelgn aggression threatened us, What
right have we to complain of the exclustve-
ness of China when we shut out the China-
man from our country?

The spectacle of this great gathering in
Now York in behalf of the Christianization
of the vast majority of the world who are
of other religions ts full of impressiveness,
and the more so at this time when the
foundation of Christianity is assailed by its
own appointed defenders. The missionary
movement thus celebrated is the most em-
phatio expression of absolute faith in the
Bible which could be made. If that un-
questioning religious sentiment was changed
{nto intellectual ecriticiam like that of so
much of the current theology, the whole
movement would at once be brought toa
dead stop, for agnosticiam is not aggressive.
Only when Christians are able to sing

* Salvation, O Salvation,
The joyful sound proclaim,”

with full hearts and burning conviction, can
the missionary enterprise make headway.

A Queer Speech.

The Hon. Davip B. Huy pitched his dis-
course at the Democratic dinner in Syra-
cuse on Monday night on tho lofty note of
opposition to centralization of power {in our
State government. Hostility to that is
time-honored Democratic doctrine, but the
New York people have not discovered so
far that they are suffering tyranny from the
government at Albany, and, smiling a little
at the Senator's perfervid denunciation of
it, they are amazed at his ilustration.

Mr, Huw attacked the State Board of
Charittes for Its recent crusade against
the Gerry society, and, as Mr, Hine
wrongfully declared, against “all the pri-
vate charities” of the State. In asking
the Legislature to curb the Gerry society
in accordance with tha manifest Intent
of the Oonstitution, the State Board
of Charities acted on no personal grounds,
but represented the endeavor of the very
State itself to recover its right to visit and
inspect various houses and charitable in-
stitutions where now the proper guard
against possible abuses may not enter.

The failure to pass this wholesome legis-
latino was an odious blot upon the record of
our kew-making body at Albany last winter;
and thie failure was only acoomplished by
the concentrated efforts of lobbying, mis-
information, prejudice and other means
which cannot be oriticised too severely, As
a result, over six hundred institutions in our
State, containing over 80,000 inmates, many
of thom subject to personal restra!nt, are
now wholly removed from any Sfate care,
Grave abuses and scandals will be the sure
end of all this, and we regret to say that
the responsibility for the intolerable cond!-
tion of affairs restaupon Mr, HILL, the coun-
sol of the Gerry organization, as inuch as
upon any man.

Mr. LULL may successfully reconsolidate
and reorganize the New York Democracy,
but it will be on somo other issue than
“State centralization.”

The Army bill that will be reported t t}

The sections in the original bill provid-
ing that one in three promotions to the
ranks of Major, Lieutenant-Colonel and

An entirely new section provides for the

and for the promotion of the Adjutant-
General to the rank of Major-General. If
the latter deserved promotion cannot be
given to Brig.-Gen. ConxBin without the
senior Major-General obtaining what he

Baseball.

Theopening ball game of the year between
tho clubs of Boston and Philadelphia in the
latter city was criticised by the Hecord as
stained with fraud:

“Frrors made by Durvy and Low® may have been
Bocidental, but they looked bad—so bad tn fact, that
quite a number of spectators remarked that !t looked
@5 hough the Bostons did not want tu win, Just
what object the players could have tn trying to lose
does not appear, unless they wero working under or
ders from the management io order to bring out a
large crowd toxlay

Baseball has long since ceased w be a sport with the
meh who Manipulate the game, but the players have
always been given credit for honesty in thelr endeav-
ors towin, Should tt be discovered that the club
owners and players are partners in the show business,
as it were, the pubdite will soon drop the game, Just as
{twas dropped when UaALL, CRAVER and DEVLIN
brought !t into disrepute, away back tn the '708""

In Justice to the players tt should be sald
that there has never been valid ground for
suspecting that theirs was a hippodroming
business, where the contestants won or Lost
{n accordance with orders laid down with an
eye to the gate receipts. But professiona!
baseball has for years been kept outside of
the category of genuine sports by a manage-
mant which has tolerated, with a persistence
that could scarcely signify anything loss
than deliberation and intent, the disorder
of rebellion against the authority of the uin-
plre. This year began as usual with ex-
pressions of virtuous determination to put
this form of rowdyism down, yet at the
very opening game betwoen the New Yorks
and Brooklyns, in this city, on one occasion
the New York players, in violation of the
rule, crowded about the umpire to find fuult
with his decision

The Philadelphia Record is not warranted

RIGHT AND JUST.

The Extra Allowances to Gen, Brooke and
Gen, Ladiow for Expenses ta Cuba,

To 18 Eptron or Tun SuN--Sir: Gen, Cor-
bin’s statementin THe SUN to-day in reference
to the allowances made to two or three of our
higher officials in Cuba, ought to setile the
question to the satisfaction of all fair rainded
people, When Secretary Alger visited Cuba
he found that Gen, Brooke and Gen Ludlow
were defraying the expenses of entertaining
@ great many people out of their own private
pockets. Gen, Brooke, for instance, had as his
guests Gen, Garcia and his whole staff, and
other Cuban officers were enjoying the hospl-
talities of Gen. Ludiow

Now, Gon Brooke tn his capacity as Major-Gen
eral Inthe United States Army was under no obli-
gation to entertain anybody, but as Governor of
Cuba, to which position he had been appotnted
by the President, he was bound by the custom
in Cuba, and, in fact, to @ greater or less extent |
fn all civilized countries, to keep up @ certain |
amount of state and to dispense at the Gov
ernor’s mansion a generous hospitality |

The saine was true, toa leas extent, of Gen
Ludlow, the Governor of Havana, Everybodys
of prominence that came to Havana, ar a
among tham I remember several United
States Senators, called upon these high oficlals,
and were entertained by them

Secretary Alger, having seen these things with
his own eyes, on his return to this country dea-
termined to make them all that
would at least la part relimburse then for these |
extraordinary expenses allowances |
were made to them not as oMoers of the United |
States Army, but as the Governor of Cuba and
Governor of Havana, and they were very
properly charged not to the United States but
to the Cuban Treasury, The expenses were in-
curred for the benefit of Cuba, and they were
justly paid out of the Cuban funds, To have
required either of these offlcers to pay such ex-
penses out of his own private pocket would
have been simply robbing him for the benetit

allowances

vers of the United States Army, have no applis | resorted to a liberal use of eucalyptus oi
cation to these cases, Section 1269, which is An even odder case in point ik one which
hails from India. A merchant. returning ta

the one relied on, is taken from the Act of duly
15, 1870. Section 240f that act, after providing
for the pay of oficers of the Army, says

And these sums shal) be Infull of all commutation
of quarters, fuel, forage, servants’ wages and cloth
ing, longevity, rattons, and all allowances of every
name aud nature whatever, and shall be paid
monthly by the paymaster

This was an appropriation act and was evi-
dently intended to regulate the payment of
United States Army officers out of the United
States Treasury. But the allowances made by
Gen. Alger to Brooke and Ludlow were made to
them not as United States Army officers but as
the Governors of Cubaand Havana respectively,
Tho President, had he seen fit, might have
appointed civilians to these officea, as he has
recently appointed Judge Tait to be Governor
of the Philip; If he had done so, no one
would have objected to his paying them a fair
salary and reasonable alowances, Is {t Just or
fair that Gon. Brooke and Gen, Ludlow, because
they happen to be army offloers who were
appointed to posta in Cuba, because the Presi-
dent thought thern peculiarly fit for the pur-
pose, and who could not well refuse to accept
these appointments made without their solici-
tation, should be required to pay all the ex-
penses of these posts out of the salaries which
they were previously receiving as army offioers?
The mere statement of thequestion seems to be
a sufllcient answer to it

The President !s now administering the gov-
ernment of Cuba, not under the laws of the
United States, but under the law of nations.
Congress may, of course, by an act passed with
his consent, or in case of hia veto by a two-
thirds vote of each house, terminate this ad-
ministration and put an end to the military
eecupation of Cuba, but until {it does so he
represents the sovereignty of the Untred Btates
as Coramander-m-Chief of ita Army and Navy
in Cuba, and under the law of nations may
appoint such officers and make to them such
allowances as he sees fit, to be paid out of the

RAILROADING IN MEXICO,

Reasons Which Cansed a Train Crew to Make
for This Side of the Border.
From the El Paso Herald

Yesterday evening there arrived tn VF) Paso
on We Mexican Central passenger train a
brakeman lately employed on the Jimuleo
division who had been compelled to flee from
the country or take his chances of going to
Jail. His name is withheld by request as he
sud he might want to return some day and,
moreover, persons ignorant of the conditions
in Mexloo might misconstrue his sudden fight.
On Sunday last he was running on a freight

train between Jimuleo and ‘Terreon The
track is very crooked and it is imporsiole for
an engineer to Bee any distance ahead around
the curves. A party of five Mexicans were
walking on the track and on aceount of tle
urve the engineer was unable to see them
until he was only a few feet away. [le tne
slanuy appiled the air, but it was too Jat

Iwo at least of the crowd, one @ man and
the other apparently @ Woman, were str k
and knocked off the track. The engineer
instantly put on all the steam he coula carry
and rau on at full speed without stopping to
learn move.

At ‘Torreon the train was sidetracked and
without saving a word to any one the entire
crew departed tn. different directions. The
eondnetor and engineer headed for Eagle Puss,
one brakeman and tieman disappenred, and one
took the passenger train for kl Paso that cane
along an hour later. The last arrived here
last night without diMeulty.

To a reporter he said: “The conditions are
