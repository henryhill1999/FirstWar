Bowron, April 24 All parts of the United
Btates were represented at the fifth annual
convention of the National Assocation of
Manufacturers which opened in Lorimer Hall,
Tremont Temple, this forenoon and which will
continue antil Thiumsday The session begun at
Ml o'clock, delegates to the number of —
800 being welcomed by President William
Lincoln of the Chamber of Commerce. eee r
Myers of the House of Representatives spoke
to the delegates on belwlf of the State and
Mayor Hart extended a cordial welcome for
the city.

After Mayor Hart had concluded
marks, the President of the association, Theodore
C.Search of Philadeiphia,took the chatr and,after
announcing the standing committess, read his
annual report, in which he touched upon the
most vital businesssproblems of the day. Mr.

Search said

“Wages have beenendvanced in nearly every
industry and in many’instances there have been
several successive increases, 80 that labor
may be regarded as participating in a very
substantial way in the prosperity of the present
time Without undertaking to speak in detail
of the prevailing prosperity, I wish to call
attention to one fact which gives striking
evidence of the excellent business conditions
of the past year. The number of failures in
the United States in 1809 was less than during
any year since 1883 and the aggregate llabilities
were less than at any time since 1880. The
total amount of liabilities involved in business
failures in 1899 was $90,870,889 as compared
with $130,662,899 in 1808 We have to go back
to 1880 to find a smaller total—€05,752,000.

“The European situation is one of greatest
interest and significance to us just at this time.
Great Britain is engaged in a tedious and costly
war which not only makes heavy demands
upon the industries of the nation but also
seriously hampers their operations by the
withdrawal of thousands of their skilled workers
for military service. In Germany and Bel-
gium manufacturers are employing all their
productive capacity and still are unable to
meet the demand for what they produce, The

commerce and industries of France are subje

the additional impetus which a «reat world’s

that the total receipts on Jan. 31, 1000, were
$71,226 and the expenses to date $65,977. Penn-

ion against this committee and all other or-

chandise, your committee recommends mak-
ing an effort to obtain national legistation.
Your commi'tee believes that if anact were
passed forbidding any steamship line to accept
goods for any port to whieh they did net run
unlesa it agreed to accept as full liability for
the goods while on the connecting line as while
on its own, they would very quickly meet the

mission could he so enlarged as togiveit power
over transportation lines plying between the

ies or not, your committee is not prepared to

“The changesin the railroad world are not

announced, The Reading is determined to tn-

secure control of the Leluwh Valley, leaving
the Delaware and Hudson and the Delaware,
Lackawanna and Western as the only coms

NEW RAILROAD TO BE BUILT FROM
THE ANTHRACITE FIELD.

The State Kallroad Commission Authorizes
the Construction of a Road Along tho
Abandoned Delaware and Hudson Ca-
nal From Kingston to the State Line,

ALBANY, April 24. The State Railroad Come
mission has granted the application of the Det-
aware Valley and Kingston Kailway Company
for permission to construct a steam road from
Kingston to a point in Sullivan county op the
State line opposite the boroughof Lackawaxen,
Pa. The road is to be eighty-one miles long
and will be built along the abandoned canal
of the Delaware and Hudson Canal Company. A
section of the road, sixteen miles long, will ex-
tend from Lackawaxen, on the Pennaylvania
side of the Delaware River, to Hawley, Pa,
there connecting with the Erie and Wyoming

Railroad
“The app ieanta avow,"' say the Commission-
s, “that their object is to open a shorter and
more practicable and economical route than
any existing fromthe Lackawanna and Wyo-
ming anthracite coal flelds to tidewater. The
surveys and the testimony show that the grades
and curves on the proposed line are fewer and
much easier than those on the railways of the
companies opposing the a »plication, ‘and that
they are all ‘in favor of the load,’ as railway
experts phrase it, while the grades on the
opposing Hines are mainly ‘against the load.’
These conditions must necessarily conduce to a
greatly lessened cost of operation tor the pro-
jected line The applicants also show that they
ean control and have already concluded
optional or preliminary contrac ts forasufiicient
annual tonnage of coal from the anthracite
mines to yield a liberal profit from the oper-
ation of the newline, exclusive of any consider-
ation of local trafic to be gathered along the
route
‘The board is of the opinion that the appli-
eants’ road does not parallel railroads opposing
it. Iti not disputed that the Erie's haul is
made diMleult by opposing grades, and is there-
fore more costly to operate and logically more
expensive to the consumer of the product
transported) No doubt exists as to the feasi-
bility of the projected route The existing rall-
roads may be willing, even ready, to furn{sh all
the cara necessary for the transportation of all
the coal produced in this region at Prevail
rates of transportation; but, if the prevai
ing rates are based honestly upon the cost of
the service and if the physical difficulties
of the existing method and means of
making the haul are unavoldably greater ty than
they should be, or than ther actually will be by
4 more feasible and cheaper route and means of
transportation, and upon which a consequently
exe rand yet remunerative rate will bec varged
for the service, then the ‘public conventence
and necessity,’ which thetlaw requires to be
shown in a proceeding as this one, will be sub-
served by the construction of the line herein
cor emplated
‘It coal, a prime necessity of life, can be fur-
nished to the people at lower cost than {t has
averaged in the past, they are entitled to have
it { made available through
of a new road or any other
nrovernent in conditions Che
ning of the eost of coal at points
of delivery and consumption will tend vastly to
the building up of new as well a present ine
dustries, to the comfort and cony eot the
people generally, and, it may be uate, partic.
iarie of anthr acite coal, that it will tend in
large measure to promote public health and
cleanliness ino the cities and villages of the
State This last consideration is one to which
the Le els lature and the health authorities of the
State and its cities have for several vears past
wiven serious attention. Anot her considerat a

WEEKLY REPORT.

Weather Conditions Generally Favorable; Too
Much Rain in Some Regions.

Wasnincron, April 24-—-The weekly crop
report of the Weather Bureau {seued to-day
eA. *®

The temperature conditions of the week
ending April 23 were generally highly favorable,
but excessive rains in the Southern States
greatly interfered with farm work and caused
destructive floods. In portions of Alabama,
Mississippi and Louisiana much replanting will
be necessary as a result of the inundation
Farm work has also been retarded asa result
ot heavy rains in the eastern portions of Kansas
and Nebraska and southern Missouri. Rain ts
much needed in Montana, North Dakota and
over the northern portion of Minnesota. While
freezing temperatures occurred in the upper
Missouri Vallev and middle and southern Rocky
Mountain regions, It appears that no serious
injury has been done

The week has not been favorable for the rapid
progress of corn planting, but preparations for
this work have been very active in the more
northerly sections and under favorable
weather conditions will progress rapidly, Plant-
ing has been generally retarded where not com-
pleted in the Southern States, and also from
Kansas and Oklahoma eastward over the Cen-
tral Mississippi Valley, being later than formany
years in Tennessee

The Ratiroad Monopoly Established by *' Dia- Strongest

mond Joe " Broken,

The second railroad line ever built into Hot
Springs, Ark, has just been opened. It is called
the Little Rock, Hot Springs and Memphis Raal-
road and it will run a through train service
from Memplis to HotSprings In connection
with the Ilinois Central it will furnish a direct
route between Chicago and Hot Springs \ |
partof the connection between Memphis and
Hot Springs is made by way of the Choetaw |
route. This new tine breaks the long monopoly
held by the original Hot Springs Railway, |

about twenty-two miles long, which was built
by Joseph Reynolds, better known as “Diamond |

FINANCIAL AND COMMERCIAL.

Tuespay, April 24

The stock market reflected the same diver-
gence of opinion on the part of professional
speculators that was discernible yesterday It
was not however as pronounced. ‘The disposi-
tion to sell predominated while the buying out-
side of the purchase of about 25,000 shares on
bidance by foreign arbitrage houses, Was
chiefly to cover shorts. ‘The iron and steel
stocks were comparatively neglected for the
first time in ten days and allot them showed a
tendeney to rally Some of the less active
issues dike Steel Hoop and Tin Plate
scored noteworthy net advances The Street
is beginning to modify its despondent views re-
warding the steel and iron industry, It ishope-
ful of a change in the executive management of
the Steel and Wire Company at the next meet-
in of the directors on May 7. It is also being
led to believe that the reaction in the trade
which has been accentuated by the bad man-
agement and by the unserupulous speculative
operations of the ebairman of the Steel and
Wire Company, may result ina healthier con-
dition of the business than has existed for some
tine past, yet without a serious impairment of
legitimate profits

The feature of the market until shortlyhefore
the close of business was extensive selling of
Baltimore and Ohio common and Reading first
preferred, The impression gained ground as
this selling progressed that ft was for account
of a prominent operator who professes to have
been heavily interested In those stocks for some
time past, Since the collapse in Third Avenue
and the subsequent squeeze of the shorts
in that stock, incidental to the acquirement of
controlof the company by the Metropolitan
Street Railway Company, the operator re-
ferred to has not been in the best of health, and
the Street suspected that his return to business
yesterday and to-day was chiefly for the pur-
pose of reducing some of hia ventures that are
being affected adversely by a declining market
There has, unquestionably, been other and
more substantial selling of the anthracite coal
stocks than by the interest just referred to.
There are indications, also, that the recent ex-
traordinary advance in Baltimore and Ohio
common brought some actual holdings upon
the market,

The sensational episode of the day occurred in
the last half hour, when Sugar Refining was
advanced nearly 6 points from the lowest price,
and at asiight reaction closed nearly 4 points
higher than yesterday, The movement was
accompanied by the customary reports of a
settlement of the sugar trade war, which the
President of the American Refining Company
tersely describes as “the usual lie” As @
matter of fact, the war is as sharp as ever,
and fresh aggressive tactics may be adopted
by either side without any notice whatever to
upper Wall Street. The hurried covering of
shorts in Sugar Reflning at the close of busi-
nese and the effect of those operations alarmed
the short interestin People’s Gas to an extent
hat lifted the price of that stock 1% per cent.
The for Missouri Pacific was fairly
well sustained by reports that the Standard Oil
eapitalists who control the Missouri, Kansas
and ‘Texas Railway have purchased enough
Missouri Pacifle stoek to bring about a close
and natural alliance between the two proper-
ties. The total transactions were considerably
emaller than vesterdnay and the closing was in
the main dull and irregular
