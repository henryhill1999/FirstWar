It wasngnia day at the elnb. There was a
throng to follow the plavers, templed ont alike
by the anticipations of fine golfand the superb
day, and, during the luncheon halt, when the

table accommodations of the clubhouse
were quite exhausted, the lawns were
filled with piente parties taking such
refreshments that could be gathered

by forays on Steward Bastable There waa a
@reat gathering of woren present, including
Mrs. Bull, Mrs. Henderson, Miss Clements, Mrs.
W. H. Sands, Miss Arnold, Miss Mills, Miss
Hicks, Miss Whipple, Miss Richmond, Mrs. F
M., Carnrick and Mrs. MN. Garland, with many
more of golfing fame, but the gathering of the
men was most remarkable. Nearly every club

Although Travis’ medal score was the better
of the two, a comparison of the cards will likely
show that Douglos bore the main burden of the
confilet

The distances were: 346, 137, 371, 180, 464, 511,
299, 827 and 368 yards, ina nine-hole round of
S00 vards The seasation of the first round
was Douglas's second hole in 2, whieh he
rimmed on his drive The worst break,
perhaps, on the side of the best ball, forthe
cards show when the lone game was foovled,
was when Douglas, after being on even terms
with Vardon onthe eighth green, each having
played 2, took 3% more to hole out, so that the
champion won in 4to5, a hole that should have
yeen halved After this round Varden was 4

Was notsuch a perfect machine

Vardon's first hole on the second round was
marked by one of his umique shots A very long
drive had found s hanging lie on the hill thar
slopes to the sancer-like green, Whichis guarded
by abunker Standing square to the ball, with
the right foot well out, Vardon stabbed down
on it with the mashie, eotting a ligh earry that
made the green and enabled hing to get a par
four ‘The second hole Vardon halved with
Douglas in’ From the third tee, without any
excuse, although the boundary line is so close
that the local roles | ons penalze by
the loss of distance, Varden pulled his
drive out of bounds, and, while he holed out in
four more, the best ball wonin4dto5. Vardon

Rasic and His Wife in Court.

InpranApotis, April 24- The attorneys for
Amos Rusie and his wife reported tn court to-
day that they had failed to agree upon the
terms of settlement outside of court and Judge
Allen was asked to pass upon the petition of the
wife for money to pay attorney fees and for
support pending the litigation Rusie’s ar-
torney argued that his elient was not now

employed and was not drawing any salary
from the National Baseball League while he
is here attending to his private business,
and it was more than probable that this
absence from his duties would jeopardize his
salary for the entire season — An affidavit made
by William Rusie, father of the pitcher, was
also read in court and showed that the son had
no property Whatever and no interest in any,
and these two points were urged against the
wires petition for an allowing of $500 for attor-
ney fees The court finally entered an order
requiring Amos to pay to his wife $100 by May
las her expenses inthe sult and also $25 per
week till the case is finally decided It is the
purpose of Mrs Rusie to push the case to trial
as soon as possible and the pitcher, it is said,
will remain here till it is finally disposed of

Mr Blaney appearing as counsel for the prison-
ers, saying that he had no right to be there
The objection waa overruled

aguinst the prisoner. Mr Oliver shot questions
at Keardon like bullets from a rapid-fire gun
He asked hitn all about hia connection with the
Mazet Committee, who paid him, when, how,
and bow much he was paid Many of the ques-
tions were exeluded by the Magistrate Mr
Blaney put in a remark and Mr Oliver. im-
mediately pounced on him: and questioned his
vernelty

hite was held in $!,000 bail for trial Then
the Magistrate ordered the stenographer
to add to the minutes a statement signed by
the Magistrate that Mr. Oliver had refused to
conduct the case as ordered by the Court, and
had persisted in making remarks which were
out of order

Asthe next case

ing Mr. Oliver, “wet to bea lawyer, you'll bea

up his storm of objections Once when he was
turned off froma certain line of questions he
broke out with “But Psuppose T can trace the
motiveof all this work and show that it ts

When be was reproved againa little later he
anid he was sorry that Magistrate Deuel was so
