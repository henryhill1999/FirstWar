BEGINS TO-DAY AT GARDEN CITY.

Sixty Pairs Are Eligible for the Thirty-siz-
Bole Wdal Piay Qualifying Round —
Thirty -two to Keep On at the Match Game
—Dw 4las and Lockwood in Brilliant Form.

This .iorning, when the bell of St. Paul's
riage out the hour of 7, play will begin in
the amateur golf championship of the United
tates. G. H. Ingalls, Cincinnati, and Fred-
erlok O. Beach, Meadow Brook, will open the
ball. Thereafter, at intervals of four minutes,
the other pairs will be sent off. There are 121
entries, but C. L. Tappin, Westbrook, has de-
cided to waive the quest of golfing honors fora
month of salmon fishing, which brings the pos-
sible starters to sixty pairs, If there are no
hitches the last pair will leave the first tee at
10:86 o’clook. Non-arrivals at the scheduled
time will drop to the foot of the list and the
pairs in readiness move forward, so that there
is little fear but that ail will be off by 11 o'clock.
It will take each pair abouttwo hours anda half
to complete the round of tie links. The early
paire will begin to come in by 10 o'clock, and
after a quick luncheon they will be ready to
start out for the second round before noon,
which would indicate that the contestants will
all be through by 6 o'clock in the evening.
‘The play will be at thirty-six holes, the makers
of the three lowest scores winning outright very
nandsome silver cups. Only the lowest thirty-
two scorers will be eligible to play after to-day.
The qualified sei will keep on to-morrow at
thirty-six holes match play, winners meeting
winners on the succeeding days until Saturday,
when the victor in the final will be title-holder
for the year. He will receive a gold medal and
his name will be inscribed on the U.S. G, A.
champion vase, the gift of the late Theodore A.
Havemeyer, which will remain in the possession
of his club until the next championship, The
runner-up wiil get a silver medal and the two
who fail in the semi-final round bronze medals.
‘These are the only prizes, and there will be no
minor competitions of any sort during the
week.

Fourteen of the entrants qualified last year,
when the event was heid at Onwentsia, near
Chicago, the gold medal scure being 168, Seven
tied at 187 for the last four places on the list.
‘Twelve more of the present entrants failed todo
as well as 187. This is the sixth amateur
cbamptonship since the organization of the U.
§.G.A. There were thirty-two etarters in the
tirat, held at Newport in 1805, who represented
ope olub in Chicago and nine in the East.

 

 

Nearly twice as many clubs are represented this
vear than there were startersat Newport. The
120men hail from sixty different clubs. The

fleld includes the pick of the golfing talentof the
country, who will receive a chance to prove
their relative skill without being crowded
through the fair green or having to wat for
long periods for their turn at congested tees. An
inst. noe of the national spread of the game is
shown in the list of States represented by the
sixty clubs:

New York, 22; New Jersey, 10; Pennsylvania, 6;
Massachusetts, 4; Connecticut, 3; Rhode Island, 3;
liinola, Oblo, District of Columola and Wisconsin,
each 2; North Carolina, Michigan, Missourl and

GLEN Cov, July 1.--At the Nassau Countr
Club links yesterday the final in the competi-
tion between the eight club teams, which
started three weeks ago, resulted in a close and
exciting contest hetween Teams 7and1. The
issue was in doubt until F. 8. Male won the last
hole from_L. J. Busby, giving the victory to
Team 7. The scores follow:

Team 7—J. B. C. Tappan (Capt), 0; G. H. Moore
0; U. D. Eddy, 4; F. S. Male, 103 G. 8. Goodrich, 0.
Total 14.

Team |—Howard Maxwell (Capt.), 0: H, W. Thayer,
6; L. P. Rider, 0; L. J. Busby, 0; Tw. Strong, 7,
Total, 12.

The finals in the consolation were aleo played
with the following result:

S. P. Hopkins (Capt.),2; A. C, Humphrey, 2; A.
Holland. 0; Valentine Mott, 5; A. C Sherwood, 0.

Total, 9.
H. F. Whitney (Capt), 0; C. H. Pope, Jr., 0; P. D.
Handy, 0; William Beard, 0; H.-H. Hogins, Jr., 6.

Total, 6.

In the ball sweepstakes for Classes A, B and
C, the results were;

Class A—H. L. Pratt, 00, 10—80; A. L. White, 101,

| 12—80; C. O. Gates, 100, 9-91; Howard Maxwell,

. B. Macdonald, H. J. \ higham and '

Sco)
F. 8. Douglas. Neither Macdonald nor Whig-
ham ie entered this time, but Dou vlas, runner-
up last year, willtry again. Withthe exception
of A, G, Lockw od of boston, who is a son of
Capt. Lockwood, Honorarv Treasurer of the
Weston-sup r-Mare Golf Club, Engiand, tie
other entrants are of home development. Both
Douglas and Lockwood are gran follere, but
eac | has been beaten by homebred players in
hard-fought matches, in which the issue was
clearly se'tied by the better golf. This time
the great question is not whether a homebred
ean win, for last year's championship and sib-
sequent open tournaments have settled that
isgue, but whether the younger set of players—
the college and school boys-—will hold thelr own
‘ainat the older set of our homebreds

th Douglas and Lockwood are almost sure
to qualify, buton their records, forty of the
entranta have nearly as good chanoes for a
place among the first thirty-two, not to speak
of wha: some of the outsiders may do who hita
lucky streak. The scoring, therefore, should be
very close in the quilifying round, for no one
will dare to try to save himeelf for the subse-
quent match play. As arrang: d for to-day the
oourse will have 6 playing leneth of 6,184 yards.
Ideal golf is figure it. 77, but the bogey score,
which shoul : be equalled by the cracks who are
on their best game, is 81. What may be re-
warded as an average round for any of the best
men was that made by . Prentice Kellogg of
Princeton yesteriay. It was:
Sins teed £4645 6465 4 542
5475 5 6 5 3—45—87

On this basis there should be a crush of scores
to-day between 174 and 180 for the thirty-six
holea, and, {if the weather is favorable. 180
whould be about the high mark to qualify.
‘There is usually a falling off or the laat few
places, so thite 185 may getin. but it is safe
to assert that a player who cannot record 180
will not last long at match play. It isnot
thought that 174 will win the prize for the best
soore. The trend of opinion {ts that 165 will be
made. A few think that there will be a 162,
while any number of ibe be-t informed plavers
are willing to wagera groxa of golf balls that
170 will be beaten.

ing is too uncertain to attempt to pick out
a lat of those who are apt to qualify. for be-
tween the first forty men luck to a degree will
hea factor. The links were crowded last week
by the entrants. Many have refused to give out
their scores, but data have been gath red up
that por by the straw to show how the wind
will blow. Douglas on Thursday made an §2,
and yeaterday, ina round with J. Stewart Gil-
leapie, he finished with this fine score:
4 465544 4 5-40
In. -46365 686 5 5 4-—-45-—- 83

Lockwood had an 88 on Saturday, and he
was well under 90 yesterd y The best the

resent course has been made in is 82 John

d, Jr, and Percy Pyne, Jr., hiving equalled
oucias at that notch. The former has been
averaging 85 and his game is much stradier
than when he was the int ‘rcollegiate champion,

year havin ay! a@ finish on his style. A.M,
Coats, Regin: Brooks and H. R. Jolfmston
are others who mays paved in Scotland and
they are all in good trim. Johnstone ia the
Chicagoan who won the Southern Cross cham-
pionship last spring. He 1s a terrific driver, but
not ap over-accurate one in direction, The
Bostonians, H.C. Leeds and J. G. Thorp, the
latter runner up in 1896, have been practising
ously. The former did an 89 on Saturday,
and yesterday Thorn had an 84, They were
joined vesterday by Quincy A. Shawof Myopia,
who did an 88. He payed with Harriman, the
title holder, who has not heen trying for a
soore, but has been training hard. Like Vardon,
he believes in saving his efforts for the actual

Walter J. Travis, who, ever since his victory
in the M.Q@. A. championship has been hailed
as the winner of the ‘double event” by his
clubmates at Garden City and Oakland, is in
aplendid condition, He held the record of the
links before it was extended, and, on Thursday,
turned inan 8. Since then he has beon play-

Players losing their ballin the pond playing
from the eighteenth tee may drop a ball under
penalty of one stroke, That thos» in high golf-
ing places are not always infallible in their
games was Cemonstrated yesterday when both
Secretary Kerr and Treasurer Heebner of the
U. 8. G. A., who had a match on, failed to clear
the pond, to the profit of G. L. Hubbell, who
had wagered each a golf ball that he wou!d not
make the carr’. This hole is an entirely new
one of 152 y irds, and a great improvement on
the former home hole, the green being before
the clubhouse. The time when each pair is to

Jeffries Replies to Rahlia,

Champion J!m Jeffriesreturned to town yes-
terday after a brief tour up the State. The
first thing the Champion did was to consider
the ulitmatum of Gus Ruhblin, who wants to
fight the boilermaker and who has concluded
to give the latter a week in which to answer
hia defi. In regard to this Jeffries said to a
reporter of THE SUN:

“Ruhlin has no right to say what he is going
to do and what he will not do. I am the cham-
ion and if any one is fring to do the dictatin
j will be the one. I told him last week I woul
fight him and I intend to keep my word. My
arm will not he well until August and I cannot
fight before that time. T want to meet Ruhlin
in the East before the law abolishing the game
in this State goes into effect because we can‘get
more money, You can state that if Ruhlin
yosta a forfeit L will cover it at once, As to
iis threat to meet Fitzsimmons before meif
I don’t hurry all I can say tv lethim do so, If
he wants to become champion he's got to lick
me first. That's all I have to say on the sub-

ect.”

' Jeffries, arm is getting along nicely. Ais
hysician has ordered him to wear the arm
n a steel brace supported by leather straps

and the member is healing under the treat-

ment. Jeffries will leave for Mount Clemens
in a few weeks so as to get into condition for
his proposed mill with the “Akron Giant.”

NEWS OF THE WHEELMEN.

 

Ool. John Jacob Astor Renews His Member-
ship in the L. A. W.

Col. John Jacob Astor, who has been a mem-

ber of the New York State Division, L. A. W.,

for several years, has sent in his renewal

| fo prevent his membership from expiring on

| tunate enough to be at Sheepshead Bay course |

last Saturday will not soon forget the extraordi-
| nary exhibition of speed and endurance given by
the old black mare Imp. To appreciate fully the
merit of her performance {t should have been
seen as no description could convey more than
an idea of the consummate ease and lack of
friction or bustle with which she mowed down
records. Little Odom had Imp well in band all
the way during what would have been, to the
| average stake horse, a trying ordeal, In

the case of Imp it looked like an open

gallop and her gait seemed so effortless that
only those holding fly-back watches realized

the pace at which she was travelling. The first
mile in 1:39 2-5 furnished an inkling of what
might be expected, but some skeptics said:
“She can't oarry that clip for six furlongs
further;” quite overlooking the palpable fact
that the mare was moving as free and fresh as
when she started and skimming over the
ground with the clock-work precision of an
automatic machine, She made the remarkable
time of 0:12 4-5 for every furlong of the race and
might have gone on indefinitely at the same
rate if Odom had let her. As it was,he was unable
to do more than check her speed until she had
almost completed two miles.

Imp covered the first mile and a quarterin
faster time than was ever made eliher in the
Brooklyn or Suburban handicaps and it will be
interesting to note what she will do in her next
handicap engagement, which will probably be
at Brighton next Saturday. This Brighton
Handicap, by the way, is the richest of the
series, which began with the Metropolitan, and
has still over fifty eligibles, including all the
popular performers Qof3 years old and up-
ward,

Sinoe the publication of weights, thirteen of
the Brighton nominations have incurred penal-
ties, ranging from one pound to twelve. Imp
at 128 and Jean Beraud at 127 pounds, each take
up one pound over the original bandicap and
John Bright 120 and Box 119, are cairying two
pounds penalty each. Ethelbert’s victories
oblige him to shoulder 129 pounds, an extra
impost of three pounds, and Raffaello 116, The
Kentuckian 109, Sarmatian 100 and All Gold 97
pounds, are m:mbers of the \our pound penalty
class. Kinley Mack's original allotment in the
Brighton was 121 pounds, His Brooklyn and
Suburban triumphs, however, serve to advance
his official burden to 127 pounds. The three-
year-olds Kilmarnock 113 Standing 112, and
Petruchio, 102, are each penalized twelve pounds
for spiing stake y.ctortes, ,

Having begun their June meeting 80 aumpio-
jously with the historic Suburban and kept
interest on edge since with a wel-selected se-

uence of attractions, the working officials of
the Coney Island Jockey Club ure anticipating a
sensational climax on Independence Day.
This afternoon a distance hundicap for three-
year-olds and upward paves the way for the
Jernal Stukes, a pre-furiong dash for two-
year-old fillies, with ten speedy youngsters en-
gaged. A handicap over hurdles is scheduled
to follow the stake.

Ample provi-ion has been made for an ideal
Fourth of July celebration, All ages are catered
to in abighweight handicap, but this will be a
mere infant echool cracker to the second run-
ning of the Double Event, one of the star
features on the two-year-old schedule, The
first ha,f was won on the opening day by Tower
of Candles, who will have to shoulder a seyen
pound penalty in consequence. For earlier
successes the Fieischmann cracks will also suffer
ip the weight adju tment, but the principal in-
terest in the race centres in whether James Kowe
will accept with Comrnando, whose revised
{mpost would also be 129 pounds. The manner
in Which the mightiest offspring of Doimine—
Emma C., carried 122 pounds to the front in the
Great Trial of $20,000 on Saturday made It look
as if a penalty then would have made no dif-
ference. ,

» The crowning event on Wednesday, however,

will be the Lawrenoe Realiz :tion for three-year-

olds, at one mile and five furlongs. It promises

spore absorbing spectacle this year than ever
efore.

Before horsemen get through at Sheepshead
Bay on Wednesday it naturally occurs to them
to perfect plans for a return trip to the pice
ture-que park in the fall and the Coney Island
Jookey ub comes out with a timely pro-
@ramine of attractions that are still open for

| ally

July 3. In contrast with the prompt re-
newals by such men as former Secretary

of the Navy W. ©. Whitney, Gov. Roose-
velt, Lieut.-Gov, Woodruff ahd Col, Astor are
the complaints of some of the rank and tile
who do not think the League worthy of support.
rhe following letter from a Brooklynite, who
gives his name and League | number,
but prefers a pseudonym to stand for his plaint,
is characteristic of a few others that are re-
ceived at intervals by THE SUN:

TO THE EvITOR or THE SUN—Sir; I noticed
the letter by “Coaster Brake" In your tssue of June
18, and if permitted todo so would indorse his com-
plaint. Lato a member of the L.A, W.. but really
why I cannot say. Formerly the L. A. W. stood for
something in the way of wheelmen’s rights, and actu
ave its members a fair equivalent for the money
paldin. One fe.t pride in being a member and also a
certain amount of protection wasassured, Butto-day
itis a farce and all that we fought for is lost. Sucha
thing as wheelmen’s rights do not exist so far as the
1. A. W. or the police (excepting the cycle squad)
are concerned, 1 have never fn Brooklyn seen
a driver of a wagon reprimanded even for a violation
of road rules excepting, as stated, by the cycle squad
Any falr-mind-d person can see for himself how fla-
grant the violations of road rules are by taking a pos!
tion on Bushwick avenue, Brooklyn. “All the heavy
trucks, grocery wagons and such, use the asphalt
Sirtps and only a few of them turn out fora bell.
Driving on the wrong side of the road, or stopping
with the horse headed wrong way; turning corners on
the short and the wrong ‘ime, never even looking
around or giving any notice, thereby endangering
any and all in the vicinity, are common occurrences,
It is only due to the wheelmen's alertness that more
serious aceldents are rare.

Between 950 and 960 Bushwick avenue some bulld-
ings are being erected and as the block Is a short one
ae and about half the street are obstructed by
sand, lumber, bricks, &c. The road rul s governing
obstructions call fora red Hight to be placed at either
end at night, yetin the our weeks that this has! een
so no red light was used at all, A white light appears
instead and 4s white lights are common ne doesn't
see the obstruction tll he hits it. Atthia pointl have
seen many narow escapes and some falls. The po-
lice must be very setive not to notice sich flagrant
violations and putastoptothem AsfortheL. A. W.,
I for one will not renew my subse'{ption when it ex
fires, and I know of ot'ers wo are muc® more
nterested tn @ litile protection than in the monoto-
nous wrangle over the “racing ques ion,"’ or “the
const’ uction of good roads In China for the benefit of
the Boxers,"" or even @ short cut to the moon ona
wheel, Charity begins at home.

"NO COASTER BRAKE."
The letter was referred to an official of the
League for comment. He said:
“lam afraid that this letter is from one of the
class of members who, when they pay their
dues, do it not to support an organization that
seeks for and obtains the great general good o
eveling, but In expectation of getting some-
thing like pepeern and candy in return, IT do
not remember the time when the 1. A. W.
watched over the road conditions in front of
its members’ doorsteps, The writer should
have his attention called to the fact that the
Leagne is responsible partly for the existence of
the cycle aquad and for many of the asphalt
stripainthecity, The inefficiency of the police
must be attributed to the Ppiitioal adiministra-
tion. As a good member it is his duty to canse
an arrest incase of violation of law and then call
upon the Jeague to support hin in the prose-
cution. Tf he was in the right it would do so,
‘The writer of that letter should be reminded
of the sidepath. law obtained by the League
last year, and of the bill regulating ordinauces
and preventing unjust arrests by country con-
stables and excassive fines. Also he should he
told about the good roads plank that the 1, A.W.
had inserted in the RKepnblican platform
and the good roads bill introduced into Con-
rress last term to convince him that the League
fi not asieep. As for his personal profit, he
might consider that the Brilletin, the discounts
at hotels, the discounts offer by the book
and periodical departments,the facilities of the
touring department and several other features
offer him something for his money beyond
being a supporter of a noble organization.”
There was an interesting bicycle race on
the four-lap board track atVatlsburg yesterday.
t waa a two-mile event in which most of the
star riders were competitors and the winner
was to be decided by the greatest number of
ointa won. They were awarded at ever
ap, five for the first man, three for the second,
two for the third and one for the fourth, the
eighth and last lap to count double in the number
of points. In addition to this arrangement
a prize of $5 was offered in each lap to the man
who was leading. Cooper, Maya and Walthour
went In strong for the lap prizes, while Kramer,
MeFarland and Fisher saved themselves for

JULY 2, 1900.’

DUNDESS DEFEATS MAHLON,

THE BOSTON TROTTER MEETS HIS
MATCH ON THE SPEEDWAY.

 

Page and Baylight Apparently Willing to Let
Each Other Alone—Notable New Horses in
Evidence—Peter Manee Out With Felicia
~The Driveway Two Years Old Yesterday.

Page, 2:00% and Baylight, 2:82), were
among the most conspicuous trotters that
stirred up the dust on the Speedway yester-
day. Hooked to a ight two-wheeler Barney
Goodwin's big horse went down the road time
and again at a spanking gait, bowling over
everything that came along. He didn’t meet
any of the shining lights, however, or if he
did meet any of them he lost them somewhere
between Dyckman street and Washington
Bridge. His sweeping stride and true, square
way of going captivated every horseman on
the road.

“Page always makes me think of the boy's
essay the horse,” remarked a curbstone
critic the great trotter from Orange county
swept past. “The boy started out, you know,
by saying, ‘A horse has four legs, one on each
corner,’ That describes Page toadot. He's
one of the few four-cornered trotters that
never hitches or goes rough-gaited, and I'd
like him for it if he couldn't beat 3:00,”

The owner of Page has not been heard from
in response to the challenge of Nathan Straus
to trot the pick of his string against Mr. Good-
win's flyer. A good many horsemen believe
Pawe can beat any one of Mr. Straus’s trot-
ters and they cannot account for the failure
of his owner to accept the defi. For some
reason or other the speedy son of Polonius
has not measured strides in a brush this season
with more than one or two top-notchers, Most
of his fast work has been done either without
company or with horses not in Page's class.

Baylight, like Page, was in the exhibition
business yesterday. George A, Coleman, who is
driving the equine “Jersey Lightning” again,
sent him over the speeding ground with his
old-time rushes. He trotted so fast that he
was nearly always at one end of the road when
Page was at the other end.

“Somebody seems to be dodging,” was the
comment of a sidewalk critic as he saw Page
walking slowly up the road two or three times,
while Baylight was going down the centre
at top speed, Just who was doing the dodging
was not 80 apparent, Baylight is one of the
many trotters with present pretensions to
the title “King of the Speedway.” In a short
brush one day last week the big, brawny Jersey
flyer gained a victory over McMillan, 2:17%%,
the horse that gave to Cobwebs, 2:12, the worst
defeat of his Speedway career.

Mahlon, 2:18%, the showy, trappy-galted lit-

tle black trotter that Jack Trout of Boston re-

cently sold to Charles Riley seemed to have
missed the guiding hand of his old driver yester-

y. He was beaten early in the day by Mr.
MeNiece’s bay pacer Major, Later on Louis
J. Kahn's neat little bay side-wheeler, George
Wallace, 2:1744, took his measure in a fine brush,
the Boston horse going somewhat rough and
without his old turn of speed. Henry Zahn, Jr.,
driving the big bay trotting mare Dundess,
228%. by Dundee, then took a fall out of both
Mahlon and the pacer. Before the cay ended
Mr. Riley's handsome trotter improved his way
of going. His stroke was true when he turned
for a farewell bout with B. T. Kearns’s black
pacer Drex, 2:16%,, and his speed was such that

e closed a big patch of Gayl h after making

a losing break in the first furlong. Drex hel
the lead to the end, but the margin by which he

won at the point of rocks was as narrow aa the |

box of the one-man speeding wagon to which
the horse was hooked.

Drex's star periormance was made in a three-
cornered brush withthe pacer Anheuser, 2:24%.
Dr. H. D. Gill drove the latter horse, starting
up away in front of the bay and the black as they
went down the road. Drex kept up the stern
chase past the point of rocks and finally over-
hauled Anheuser, beating him out on the hill.
Anheuser is a newcomer on the Speedway. He
is a California horse that gained his record inthe
Middle West in 1896. Dr. Gill brought him out
as a dark one yesterday, but the horse had not
gone the length of the Speedway before a sharp-
eyed horseman from the West recognized him
in the throng.

E. J. Willis's fast brown pacer Chip won a
brush from Dundess, 2:23'¢, and George Wal-
lace, 211744. After showing the way past the
end of the stone wall Dundess made a ee
break, some part of her harness having broken,
Farlier in the day Dundess defeated Chip,
Mr. Fullerton, 2:21, the Yonkers pacer that
\..). Clark drives on the road, ourpeteed some
of the knowing ones by coming out sound and
fast yesterday, and defeating George Huber's
ehestnut stallion Prince Altara and others.
Mr. Fullerton pulled up lame one day last week
and the crities had laid him on the shelf for
the season. A. M. Myer brought out a notable
newcomer in the chestnut pacing mare Belle
West, by Double Stroke, a son of Belle Sayre,
by George Wilkes. The mare gained a record
of 2:0’, at Indianapolis in 1897, She out-
footed Max Hornberger’s half-bred Arab pacer
Aleppo and one or two others, but waa not
seen in a brush with any horse of her own class.

Another notable addition to the list of Speed-
Way steppers was the bay trotter Freeland
2:17, by Alfonso, the son of Baron Wilkes an
Alma Mater, Freeland is now owned by E.
F. Pierce. William Hoegg drove a royally
bred young trotter in the chestnut mare Palo
Alto Sprite, by the noted stallion Palo Alto,
2.08',, outof Sprite, the dam of Eqotist, Sphinx,
Electrite and other good ones. . G. Schmidt
sent his crack pacer Excellence, 2:18, down
the road a few times at smashing sp . The
black horse ig just recovering from an attack
of pinkeye. Peter Manee had the fast little
trotter Felicia, 2224, going at racing speed.
The old “steeple climber's” right hand was
in splints, but that made no difference when
it came to driving a trotter, In going home
from Speedway Park one day last week a cable
ear crashed into Peter's road wagon, crush-
ing it to splinters and throwing the old-timer
to the pavement with such violence as to frac-
ture the bones of his hand,

After speeding Felicia. Manee drove Ben
Lichtenburg'’s newly purchased pacer, Robert
C., 2:10%, in a brush against W. R. Rose's Sir
Fld, 2:14%, and four or five others. All save
Robert C. and Sir Eld fell by the wayside be-
fore the end of the road was reached. Manee
made a hard drive with the strange horse, but
he could not beat the Rose pacer.

Yesterday marked the close of the second
year of the Speedway, the great drive for trot-
ters having been opened on July 2, 1893,

 

Death of Charles Backman, the Well-Known
Trotting Horse Breeder.

GosHEN, July 1.—-Charles Backman, the well-

known trotting horse brecder and owner of the

Stony Brook Stock Farm, was found dead in

his chair at that place on Saturday night. The
cause of death was heart disease. He wag
about 76 years old.

 

Princeton's Athletes Make a Favorable Im-
pression in England,
Srecial Cadle Despatch to THE Sun,

Lonnon, July 1.—-The performances of the
Princeton University track team yesterday at
the London A. C. games, Stamford Bridge,
created a very favorable impression, especially
in the pole-jumping contest, which was a feat-
ure of the day's sport. Horton injured the base
of hia spine. The members of the Pennsylvania,
Georgetown and Brown untversities and Boston
College teams were present,

 

Bouts at the Westchester A, ©,

The Westchester A. C. held a number of
bouts on Saturday nightat Tuckahoe. The at-
