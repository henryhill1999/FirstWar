DIVIDEND DISAPPOINTMENTS.

The factor which | seems ems to have the most
influence, Just now, in depressing the stock
arkot, 's disappointment at the failure of
a. Jeading railroad and industrial companies
to declare dividends proportionate to their
earnings. The Atchison, Topeka
Fe Railroad Company has, oe
dividend on its preferred stock to
eee er cent. rate to which the stock is
entitled, but it pays nothing on the common.
Tho Southern Railway Company pays but 8
cent. on a preferred stock which is entitled

and Sar ita

~ per cent. Chicago, Milwaukee and Bt.
Paul keeps the dividend on {ts cormmon stock
down to 5 per cent. per annum, although it
shows earnings on it of 10 per cent. The
Nortliern Pacifle directors have just refused

to de lare more tha’ 11 per cent. semi-annually
on the con mon etock of their company. The
Baltimore and Ohio, from which 5 per cent. on
ite common stock was confidently predicted
g few weeks 4x0, has as yet declared nothing.
The Wabash has similarly failed to pay any-
thing upon its $26,500,000 3 debontures. The
New York Central pays no more than 5 per
cent. and the Lake Shore, out of earnings
which apparen tly warrant 10 per cent., no more
than7 per cent. One reason given for the recent
fall in Brooklyn Rapid Transit stock is a fear
that, instead of the 4 per cent. or even 5 per cent.
op it, which it was asserted to be earning, its
pusiness for the year just closing will show
little if any profits at all, especially if due al-
Jowance is made for the Special Franchise
tax, which now seems likely to be upheld by
the court Of the numerous industrial com-
panies from which so large returns were ex-
pocted a year ago, only a few pay anything
on ther common stocks, and some do not pay
aven the stipulated dividends on their pre-
ferred. American Sugar common reduced Its
dividend one-half last January, and there it no
talk of a restoration of it to the old figure
it is to be observed that the gross earnings
> the railroad companies above mentioned
are still as large as those which within a year
carrier uthern Rallway preferred up to 58,
St. Paul common to 186, Northern Pacifle com-
mon to 57, Baltimore and Ohto common to 89,
Wabash B debentures to 43, New York Cen-
tral to 144, and Brooklyn Rapid Transit to 137,
and in many cases are larger. It is in the net
earnings that a decrease is manifest, though
in some cases, as in those of the New York
Central and the Lake Shore, they exhibit large
gains. The reports of the industrial compa-
pies are not full enough to Justify comment on
them, but the general impression is that those
eompanies too are earning less net profits in
nto their gross receipts than they
were a vear ago, and that their stockholders
r only will be disappointed of getting more
‘ividends than they have been getting, but
even get less,
f » of railroad directors to pay the
ed dividends which stockholders have
. ected is said to be dune partly to a convie-
a their part that the monev can be more
eniploved in improving the roads, and
a prudent regard to the posslbility

1 nt an inereased rate of dividend now
e tobi shed from being maintained, Their action
brngs into renewed prominence the difference

betwoon Aimer'can and European railroad finan-
ciering, which was discussed in this column five
weeks ago. As was then shown, the European
system is to pay for permanent improvements
by calling up from the stockholders fresh capital,
as has just been done by the New York Central,
the Pennsylvania and the Baltimore and Ohio
railroad companies: the American, upon which
the companies Just mentioned have made an
innovation, is to pay for improvements out of
earnings and to adjust dividends accordingly,
The European system has the advantage of
giving to railroad stockholders every year in
dividends whatever their property earns in
that vear: and, owing to the greater uniform-
itv of business conditions tn Europe, these
dividends fluctuate but little. Recently, in-
deed, the rise in the price of coal threatens to
reduce the net earnings of European railroads
very considerably, but the rise is not likely to
be permanent. The American system, as it
has hitherto prevailed among us, secures uni-
formity in dividends, but at the expense of those
stockholders who do not hold their stock
long enough to get the benefit of the money
wthheld from them and applied to purposes
the returns from which are slow in coming.
Thus, for many vears, the Lake Shore di-
rectors so managed their finances that although
the road was really earning much more than
the dividends paid on its stock, their accounts
did not show it. They included in operating
expenses vast sums spent on track and equip-
ment, which, now that the stock has nearly
all passed into the possession of the New York
Central Railroad Company, enable them to
figure out net earnings of nearly double their
former amount. The Chicago, Milwaukee and
St. Paul directors and the Southern Railway
directors seem to be doing the same thing.
Tey keep their dividends down and their
e enditures for permanent {mprovements up.
(course, it is not certain that the results of
th or poliey will be always as favorable as
| se of a similar one has been in the case of
thie Lake Shore road, but it is highly probable.
The same thing may be said of the other rail-
! companies, the managers of which are
evoting large amounts of net earnings to new
construction instead of paying them out in
vidends. The future may vindicate the wis-
dom of their course but it will be future and
not present stock holders who will benefit by it.
\s the market shows, the loss of stockholders
under the American system of railroad finance
is not limited to their loss in dividends,
When they attempt to sell their stock they
find, as we see, that buyers will not make allow-
ance for future prospects but insist on estimat-
ing values by the dividends now paid. Men
go upon the principle, apparently, that a bird
in the bush is worth much lesq than one half as
much as a bird in the hand, no matter how

a

 

 

\

certain to be captured eventually the bird in the |

bush may be. None of the railroad stocks
which have lately suffered large declines in
market price are yielding to their holders less
income than they were a year ago, and some
are vielding more; but, because they are not
yielding as much more as seemed to be assured,
purchasers argue thet they must eventually
Yield Jess, and make their bids accordingly,

Nothing in the condition of the money market,
at all events, justifies the recent fall in the prices
o! stocks. The few inillions which the Treas-
ury is withdrawing from the banks which hold
Government deposits, will soon be paid out again
for the redemption of the $25.000,000 of called 2
percent. bonds; the shipments of gold to Europe
aresmalland intermittent; the usual summer
demand for currency for crop moving PUT, oOses
Will be supplied,this summer at least,by the isene
of new bank currency, the engraving and print-
ing of which are going forward with all possible
speed: and the borrowing of busfness men for
business purposes is not large enough to raise
interest rates above 1'4 ner cent. for call loans
hor above 9, 4and5 percent. for money on longer
time. If, therefore, buyers are shy of buying
stocks, and owners are pressing to sel] them,
It is not because of the diMeuliy of borrowing
Money but of a sentiment which cannot be
explained by reasoning.

Ry some, the prevalence of this sentiment
is ascribed to the uncertainty of the result of
the coming Presidential election. The suc.
eessof Mr. Bryan and his Populistic, anarchis-
He following is said to be possible if not prop-
Able, so that cautious people prefer to await
their vetual defeat rather than act upon it be-
forehand Nothing, indeed, is absolutely certain
iD this world, but if Mr. Bryan could not in
1808 carry more than half the States in the
Union, and get only 2 out of every & votes
in the Flectoral College, it is dificult to see how

can do any better this year. A large por-
Yon of his own party concede that his insist-
Dee on free silver to which he now seems
Committed, will be fatal to his cause, and the

Mocratio anti-imperialist, anti-trust ery
co hot he enough louder than the Repub-
loan to save him. In any event, a Bryanite
Vetory will be as damaging to the value of
Money, as it will be to that of stocks, so that
@ man may as well own stocks as own money.

ications growing out of the troubles

in China are also referred to as a reason for

Umidity, and we are reminded that the war | @ale Neme,

in South Africa with its attendant enormous
expenditures, is as yet far from being ended.
This is true but it must be considered that
neither our war with Spain, nor, a year ago
the South African war, had any great effect
in depressing stocks here, while the troubles
in China, even if they should prove to be of
much more importance than they are at pres-
ent, will be purely local. The Great Powers
of Europe aro not going to war with one another
over the partition of Chinese territory. Rus-
sia has no money to spare and could not bore
row any. Croat Britain has her hands full
{n South Africa. France is in too chaotic a
Political condition to undertake foreign ag-
@reasion, Germany fears both France on one
side and Russia on the other, while the existence
of Austria-Hungary hangs upon the continued
life of the present aged Emperor Francis Joseph
who may die at any moment.

Nevertheless, it is not safe to predict the
direction which will be taken by sentiment
in regard to the values of stocks. Men ara
but children of larger growth, and as children
left alone in the dark are frightened, just pe-
cause they are in the dark, so men sometimes
fear dangers which they do not see and can-
not describe. Barring this element of doubt,
the financial prospect is in every way cheerful.
