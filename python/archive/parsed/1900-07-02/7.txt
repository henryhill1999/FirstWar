THE NATIONAL SAENGERFEST.

Pientc Yesterday at Ulmer Pork—Programme
for To-night'’s Concert,

The delogetes to the National Saengerfest
deserted yesterday the Thirteenth Regiment
Armory in Brooklyn, the various hotels as-
signed to the diffrent societies and the quarters
selected for their ontertainment in favor of
Ulmer Park, which lad been selected as the
scene of the pienic to precede the concerts and
give the singers their last chance for pleasure
of the same kind until! Wednesday, when the
Saengerfest is to come to an end at Ridgewood
Park, for to-merrow at 1 o'eloek the prize sing
ing will begin in tie drill room of the armory.

It will continue until late in the afternoon
and be resumed again at night

There were rehearsals yesterday morning for
the soloists and the orchestra, But none of
the choruses took part, so all the home and
visiting delegates were able to go to Ulmer
Park with the consciousness that they were
not missing any of their rivals’ tests.

The singers took with them to the picnio
grounds a considerable Saengerfest atmos
phere. Every man of them does that now
wherever he goes. He has to wear his badge
of membership in the union in order to pasa
into the armory. Then he has a badge which
shows the particular society to which he belones.
These are t)* smallest decorations that he can
get along wt). Cnly the souvenir pins which
are to be found on the prot d chests of the sing»
ers in numbers ranging trom tao to half a
dozen are to be considered extraneous, They
were ory numerous in Ulmer Park yesterday
and keot the Saengerfest spirit up to a high
degiee of pressure. .

Om) tue father of the family was entitled
to wear one colored ribbon badge on which
his quality as a singer was stamped in gold
letters, It gave the casual spectator a mild
shock to see a man who was weighing down
the end of a trolley seat with 300 pouncs, tick-
eted as a “First Tenor.” It was equally sur-
prising to see a thin, little man with a baby
n his arms proclaimed by his green and gold
badge a “First Bass.” :

All of the singers from certain towns were
labelled in this way. Ulmer Park had been
diviced into little settlements ce,oted to the
members of every society in oreer that no-
body who came might find himself lost in’ the
crowd and aiscover none of his colleagues,
The New York delegations, more numerous
than any of the others, had a much larger sec-
tion of the park, All of the societies wero
represented,

The Executive Council of the festival met
at the park, It had various matters to ce-
cide before the competitions begin to-cay,
It was decided that the societies represented
at the Saengerfest should be classified In the
