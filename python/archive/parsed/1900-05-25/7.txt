TWO $17,000,000 CHECKS
DRAWN BY KUHN, LOER & CO, TO PAY
FOR TreiRD AVENUE BONDS,

 

Receiver Grant Formally Turns Over the
Property to President Vreeland of the
Metropolitan- Transfer Made on a Trolley
Car- Work of Paying the Debts Has Begun,

Former Receiver Hugh J. Grant of the
Third Avenue Railroad Company surrendered
the property of that corporation yesterday at
11 o'clock to President Vreeland of the Metro-
politan Street Railway Company, in accord-
ance with the order of Judge Lacombe dis-
charging the receivership, because of the
solving of all financial problems ot the Third
Avenue by its 900-vear lease to the Moetro-
politan, The formality of turning over the
Property occurred on a Third avenue car at
the Post Office loop, because the law requires
that a receiver's surrender of property shail

ke place on the premises. Adrian I. Larkin
a counsel for the Old Colony. ‘Trust Company
was with Mr. Vreeland and Mr. Grant when
they got aboard the car, Mr. Grant said:

“fn pursuance with the order of the Court,
granted on May 23, vacating the interlocutory
order and discharging the receiver, and meving
received your affidavit that you have deposite

he sum of. $23,000,000 with the Morton Trust
Company, t now formally resign the Third

venue Ratlroad to you.”

Mr. Vreeland replied: “I accept it, sir, and
@ongratulate you on your work as receiver —
the shortest receivership on record.” fs

The work of paying the debts of the Third
Avenue Company began yesterday at the

ce of the Morton Trust Company

twas stated in Wall street yesterday that

uhn, Loeb & Co. have paid the Morton ‘Trust

Yompany for the $35,000,000 bonds of the Third
Avenue Railroad Company taken by tham two
checks for something more than $17,000,000
each, one drawn on the National Bank of Come
merce and the other on the National City Bank

he checks did not pass through the Clearing

ouse yesterday and one at least is not likely
to, asthe Morton Trust Company has an ne-
count at the National Bank of Conimerce, which
fa its Clearing House agent.

It is believed that these are the largest
ohecks that have changed hands in this city,
certainly in late years. A cheek for more than

16,000,000 for New York city bonds was paid by

uhn, Loeb & Co. to the Comptroller a few
yearsago. Acheck for more than $13,000,000
passed through the Clearing House in L817,
which had been drawn by the Reorganization
Committee of the Union Pacifie Railroad and
deposited in the National City Bank to the
order of the Government.

THE GLUCOSE TRUST,

Romor That the Concern Will Start Its Plants
Under a Reorganization,

Rocxrorn, Ill, May 24.—It !s rumored here
that when the plants of the Glucose Sugar Re-
fining Co, recently shut down, start again the
trust will be under another name, Trouble
between the Hamlin and Harding interests in

the Peoria plant is supposed to be the cause,
A dectsion is expected at Ottawa soon and the
Btatement is made here that the trust fears in
addition to the loss of the Peoria plant the de-
cision will bring the title to other fiinots plants
into question, It is understood here that a con-
ference of officials of the trust is being held and
that reorganization will be effected to take over
the properties of the present trust,

Two Cents a Mile for Party Fares.

The Michigan Central Railroad has been
named as a complainant against the Nickel
Plate-Lackawanna combination inthe matter of
applying reduced party fares to steamship
business. O. W. Ruggles, general passenger
agent of the mlchieaa Central, said yesterday
that his company had not made any formal
complaint, but had merely furnished certain
facts tothe Central Passenger Committees, The
Joint Passenger Committee, which meets here
on June 6, will take up the subject simply as it
comes from the Central Passenger Conunittee,
A resolution will probably be adopted amending
the rule relative to party fares so that such
party fares shall be fixed at the net rate of two
cents a mile for parties of tenor more. This
will practically abolish the sliding seale of party
fares

in Ohto,

CouumMBUs, Ohio, May 24. —Secretary of State
Kinney has denied the application of the Pitts-
burg Coal Company, a New Jersey corpora-
tion, for authority to do business in this State,
because there is a provision in the articles giv-
ing it the right to purchase, deal in and hold
the stock of other corporations. The company
has a capital atock of $20,000,000, and the incor-

yoration fee under the laws of the State would

Freight Rates Cut Kight and Left,

Traffle managers of some of the trunk lines

Louis are being eut right and left. The roads
out of Peoria also are accused of deliberate rate
cutting and fears are expressed that in spite of
the Presidents’ agreement the rate situation
will be badly demorna d before the summer is
over. The steady decrease in east-bound ship-
ments of freight is said to be the cause of rate
outting

BLACKBUR
Issues an Address Opposing the Goebel Eleo-
tion Law.

LovIsvILLE, KY,, May 24,
Democrata of Kentucky issued by Senator J. C
Blackburn at Washington and published to-
day, opposing the Goebel law, bas made @ sen-
sation among the Democratic politicians, It
was not atall well received, During the
campaign Blackburn upheld the Goebel law in
nearly every speech be made, In his address
Blackburn says:

“To assume that the Democratic party would
enact or keepon the statute books an election
law, without proper amendment, after it had
been demonstrated that such law was inade-
quate for the purpose designed, is to assuine
that the party, either by reason of the men it
nominates for office, orof the principles it advo-
cates, is afraid of the people and cannot and
should not expect their support,

Blackburn then offers suggestions for numer-
ous amendments which would prevent the cen-
tralization of power which at present exists.
He recommends a “return by constitutional
amendment’ to the form of viva yore voting as
the best method of preventing frauds, favors
the election of United States Senators by direct
vote of the people, and urges the coming Demo-
cratic State Convention to deciare for the abro-
gation of the two-thirds rule. He also eug-
geets that the party doors be thrown wide open
or the return of all who have left it in recent

MIDLEGE AGGRIEVED.

The Alderman-at-Large Says Mayor Hoos
Didn't Keep Faith With Him,

When the appointmen's of Allan L, MeDer-
mott as Corporation Counsel and John Wahl
Queen as Corporation Attorney were sub-
mitted to the Jersey City Board of Finance yes-
terday, William F. Midlege, who is a member
of the board by virtue of his office as Alderman-
at-large, remarked:

“Before voting on the approval of these two
appointments I wish to state that Mayor Hoos
broke faith with mein the appointment of Cor-
poration Attorney. He offered the place to me
After long and careful consideration I con-
sented to accept it, but instead of appointing
me he appointed Mr Queen. I was not a can-
didate for the office, but consented to accept it
at the Mavor’s solicitation.”

Mr. Midlege’s statement caused a mild sensa-
tion. He was a candidate for Police Justice,
but the Mayor appointed his own son, and, it !s
understood, that Mr. Midlege got the offer of
the Corporation Attorneyship as a consola-
tion. It was expected that he would get the
Jace up to an hour before the ennointment of
Mr. Queen was announced, Mr. Midlege voted
with his colleagues to confirm

FINANCIAL AND COMMERCIAL,

Trvurspay, May 24.

The stock market was unsettled to-day by the
failure of one of the larger brokerage concerns
On account of its extensive and unsuccessful
Ventures in the cotton market, Although the
Suspension was not aunounced until after mid-
day, the atmosphere of the Stock Exchange was,
as is generally the case before & disaster be-
comes known, saturated with rumors of the
impending event, The selling was not very
heavy, but it wasieffective, Lecause of the
absence of a demand for stocks either for inves-
tors, the speculative public, or the short interest

While it was commonly understood in Wall
Sireet that the embarrassment of the firm
referred to was wholly owing to commitments
in other speculative lines than the stock
market, the announcement of the failure, owing
to the unsettled condition of speculative
sentiment, created an undue impression and
was followed by more general liquidation
by commission houses than has been noted
for a long time past

The complications resulting from the failure
are likely to be numerous because of the large
number of branch offices and correspondents of
the firm, all of whom were engaged in securing
and stimulating speculative accounts, The
ventures of its clients were probably as exten-
sive in the grain and cotton markets as on the
Stock Exchange. Aaa matter of fact, its busi-
ness on the Stock Exchange, in common with
that of practically every other brokerage
house, has been curtailed of late by untoward
speculative conditions. The transactions in
stocks were on a larger scale than for several
days past and were fairly well distributed,
Sugar Refining again held the first place in
respect to activity and after a decline of nearly
4 points from the highest price, rallied
to an extent that left it only 1%
per cent. lower than” yesterday. Other
noteworthy net declines were sustained
by American Steel and Wire, Tennessee Coal
and several of theless active issues, The re-
covery in values after the suspension had been
announced, and even while considerable
amounts of stocks were being brought in and
soldout “under the rule," indicates that the
immediate effect of the event had been pretty
thoroughly discounted in the early dealings,
Theclosing of contracts “under the rile’ was
the most extensive that has ever taken place on
the Stock Exchange, and resulted chiefly from
the operations of the firm in borrowing and
lending stocks,

London was not anappreciable factorin the
market, although the Bank of England lowered
its rate of discount +, per cent. to 8'4 per cent
The reason for this is that it was a holiday on
the Continent and the celebration of the
Queen's birthday restricted business on the
London Stock Exchange. The closing was
dul! and featureless,
