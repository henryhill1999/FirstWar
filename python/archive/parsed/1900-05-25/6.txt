It was late last week that Jimmy and Pearl
made their plans to elope, The young man
made a series of passionate appeals to his
sWeetheart's mother, but she continued to
lauwh,and then the couple decided to get married
anyway. Jimmy had entered into an agree-
ment with his father to go down to Indian
Riverandrunanew hotel there. If he went,
his father said, he would have to stay for the
season, and thia meant along separation from
Miss Weber Jimmy was to sail on Tuesday.
On Saturday Pearl conceived a sudden desire
fora new dress

‘One pt those travelling dresses, mamma,”
she sac

“Now, whatin the world do you want witha
travelling dress?’ demanded Mrs. Weber, who
had been buying her daughter clothing that
reached only a little below the knees

“Well, I just want it,” replied the young
woman, “I'm tired of short dresses and I want
grown-up clothes "’

Mrs. Weber sighed and told Pearl that she
might have the dress that she wanted. The
young woman picked out agray cloth and had
ti made up. It eame home on Monday and on
Tuesday Pearl put iton. She told her mother
she wanted to wearit, as she was going over to
New York to see Jimmy off for Florida. Mrs
Weber interposed no objection, but remarked
good naturedly:

"My. how you and Jimmy will miss each
other "’

"Oh

 

 

 

, I don't think so," said the young wom-

an, and the remark which seemed strange fora

moment when it was made has a significance to
the mr

ther now that it didn't havethen. It
bout 10 o'clock on Tuesday morning when
dir came around and he and Pearl started
away together, Mrs. Weber didn't see them

He learned that when the Comanche was about

YALE SENIOR SOCIETY ELECTIONS.

,

Two Well-Known Men Refuse to Join Skull
and Bones—The New Members.

New HAVEN, Conn, May 24—The annual
elections to the Yale senior secret societies,
Skull and Bones, Scroll) and Keys and Wolf's
Head, which were given out on the campus to
the members of the class of 1901 this afternoon,
furnished some unusual surprises. Fifteen
men are taken into each of the three exclusive
senior fraternities and to receive an election is
the #reatest social honor the university af-
fords

The entire undergraduate colony gathered
about the old fence on the campus at o'clock,
When the first senior appeared “Jim Green-
way of the crew, a member of Skull and Bones,
clapped L. Coy, the football player, on the
back, annonneing his election, In this manner
each of the forty-five elections were made, As
each of the fortunate Juniors left the cam-
pus he waa cheered, A membership in Skull
and Bones is regarded as the greatest student
laurela Yale man can attain while in college,
but despite this two students this after-
noon refused this honor and went to Seroll and
Keys, ‘They were George S. Stillman of New
York city, the football tackle and ‘Varsity
oarsman, and George V. Reynolds of St. Louis,
prominent in the Yale Glee Club. Their action
exhibited what is called “a wonderful amount
of nerve,”” and is without precedent in Yale
history, Theimen who received the cherished
elections are

CHURCH AND COLLEGE TO MOVE,

The Ascension and Manhattan College Will Go
Where the Taxes Are Not So High,

The Rev. Dean Penny, pastor of the Roman
Catholie Church of the Ascension at I3ist street
and Old Broadway, has announced to his
parishioners that the church has been put on
the market and that negotiations have been
begun for the church to acquire six lots at
126th street and Amsterdam avenue for a new

church building. The reason for this action,
Father Penny explained, was that the brothers
in charge of Manhattan College, which adjoins
the chureh, had decided tosxell their property
and move where the taxes would not be so

 

could be obtained for both properties if both
properties, comprising the whole block, sold
together

"Then, too,” said Father Penny, ‘ the Rapid
Transit viaduct will be built right across the
ravine infront of us and that will spoil this for
chureh property."

The Chureh of the Ascension was organized
in 1854 under Archbishop Hughes. [ts first pas-
tor was the Rev, Arthur J. Donnelly, Four
pastors have died in its rectory and the older
members of the church, who have seen thelr
children and their grandchildren baptized
there, strongly disapprove of the proposed
move

MR, WEITZENBLUM EXPLAINS.

Not He That Was Horsewhipped, bat His
Friend Who Was Mistaken for Him,

To THE Epitor op THE Sun In refer-
ence to an article published to-day about me,
claiming I was horsewhipped by Mrs. McKnight
on Monday, would say that the story is not
true,

Last Saturday night at 11:45 o'clock Mra. Me-
Knight and her siater Nellie met me andmy
friend, a member of the Volunteer Fire Depart-
ment of West New Brighton, Staten Island, in
front of my gate, and not having her eyeglasses
on, she mistook my frlendfor meand struck him
a blowin the face, and the sister asked,"'Are you
Mr. Weitzenblum?"’ I answered, “It is not
your business,” and I opened the gate, inviting
them intomy garden for an explanation, but
they realized their mistake and ran hone

My friend said, “If this was nota delicate
woman L would have satisfaction,”

The entrance of the gate to the house is 150
feet,and Mrs. Weitzenblum being uneasy for
my not being home at the visual time, she was
at the window and thinking I was held up by
some one, screamed, ‘Is that you, Sig?”

And I wish this to bea retraction

the door, knocking down a young couple who
were dancing while Hughes and Wileox fell to
the floor, VanEmburgh was not seriously hurt
and he reentered the room to seek his two
friends whom he found nearly unconscious

$50,000 MINE, PAUPER SAYS,

OLD-TIME RESIDENT OF BLACKWELI’s
ISLAND SUES FOR AN ESTATE,

 

Was a Thriving Rag-and-Bottle Man -Went to
the Workhouse Rather Than Support His
Wife Says an Ursnline Convent Has Been
Wrongfully Bullded With His Money,

James Sweeny, @ pauper oo Blackwell's
Island, hasanaction pending in the Supreme
Court to obtain his half interest In assets of the
rag and Junk business which he and his de-
ceased brother had at 6to 10 Gouverneur slip
He estimates the whole assets of the business
at more than $100,000, and asserts that he was
fraudulently deprived of his share through his
sister-in-law, Cutharine Sweeny, widow of
Daniel Sweeny, who, he says, turned the pro-
ceeds of the business over to the Ursuline Con-
vent at Bedford Park, a corporation, which,
with Mrs. Sweeny, {s made a defendant,

The rag and junk business was started many
years ago by Rdward Sweeny, an elder brother,
who died in 1863, leaving the business to his
brothers, James and Daniel. They were both
illiterate, andas the business was large they em-
ployed D. W. McDevitt as bookkeeper, Me-
Devitt subsequently went to Chicago,where he
beeame rich, He js an auctioneer, mainly of
books, and on him rests much of the proof of
the plaintiff's case

James Sweeny married early in life and bis
wife died leaving one child, who is now Sister

Mary in the Convent of Merey at) Lambert-
ville, N. J. He married again and had dfM-
culties with Anna Sweeny, his second wife, In
order to prevent her from sharing in his prop-
erty, it is alleged, he let the rag and junk
business be conducted in the name of his
brother Daniel, and had the profits due
him invested in real estate, whieh was
putin the pameof Daniel. James Sweeny used
to swear to his friends that he would never
support Anna Sweeny, and whenin S79 she had
him arrestedin a police court he would neither
ay nor give a bond, andhe went to Blackwell's
slandforayear Attheend of the next two
years she swore out other warrants, so that he
Was kept there wotil issz for failure to support
her. She is still living, but tnade no further
claims upon him. He resumed his drinking
habits when he got out, and tinding his brother
dead and being unable to get any of the prop.
erty, he went back to the Island about 1883 as a
pauper and has singe remained there

In the action foran accounting which he has
brought through Lawyer Thomas J. Bannon,
he allages that on the death of his brother
Daniel in 1881, his widow took the business, sold
{t out, as well as five parcels of real estate which
belonged either half or wholly to James, and
gave all to the Ursuline Convent at Bedford
Park) Mrs Sweeny became a member of the
convent atthe time. Itiestated by the plain-
tif that her money and the plaintiff's was
largely used to bulid the convent as it now
stands, and that while it was in course of con-
struction she was made Mother Supertoer, She
is now known as Sister De Chantel Recently
she was stricken with a severe attack of rheu-
matism and for several weeks has been in a hos-
pital of the {nett

 

The willot Daniel Sweeny left all his prop.
erty tohis wife. She sold the five parcels of
realty whieh stood in the name of her husband

  

to Edward Felbel for about $100,000) The prop-
erty where ag and junk business was econ
ducted brought #38.000 and the residence In
which Daniel died on Monroe street brought
about $20,000

Lawyer Bannon showed a letter from the for-
mer bookkeeper, MeDevitt of Chicago, In whieh

 

 

as hat James s irtne nthe busl-
high, and it waa thought that a better price | D°8ays that James was A partner in ,

ness until he had difficulties with his second
wife. MeDevitt states that the Monroe street
house and a piece of property in Brooklyn,
which was among the five parcels, in fact be-
longed to James Sweeny, but were kent inthe
naine of Daniel, as McDevitt understood, to
prevent the second wife of James fromelaiming
dower or support from her husband

Sister Mary Lawrenee, the daughter of the
plaintiff, has written several letters which Law-
ver Bannon exhibited, to the effect that her
aunt secured the property of her father, and
said “Her conselence will give her no rest with
her ill-gotten gains"

Lawyer David McClure, who appears for the
defendants, has putina general denial and set
up the statute of limitations. Lawyer Bannon
says that the statute does not run acainst his
client asthe actionis infraud The case will
come upon the call calendar to-day

COL, GARDINER A GOOD WITNESS.

Complimented by Commissioner Wilcor-They
Are Still Cross-Examining,

Commissioner Wiloox took occasion yesterday
to remark that District Attorney Gardiner
made a most excellent witness. ‘He haa shown
dignity and tact in answering questions and
his familiarity with the workings of his office
and his memory of cases is most surprising,”
said the Commissioner

Mr. Deming, for the Attorney-General, re-
sumed the cross-examination of the District
Attorney, with questions about Hquor tax
cases, The witness said that it was not his
duty, but the Court's, to ascertain whether rea-
sons for moving such cases from Special Ses-
sions to General Sessions were frivolous or not
He admitted testifying that the trials of a
number of excise with eonsecutive
verdiets of acquittal before a panel of Jurymen
was demoralizing tothe jurors, but acknowl-
edged that he had persisted in putting many
such cases before the same panel

“Are you acquainted with New York pub-
lishers?”’ Mr. Deming asked

“Yea, I think I know the
them.’

Q. Of Henry Holt, and of the Sitnams?

A Of Putnam, the publisher, not the Indf-
vidual, I don't know him at all as an indi-
vidual :

notsay what they will do in the matter until

NEW LAWYER IN COURT,

She's a Woman and the Magistrate and Bar
Receive Her With Open Arms,

Just before the close of the morning session
in the West Side police court yesterday a
young woman walked {nto the court room aud
asked to see the Magistrate, “Come back at 2
o'clock,” said the gate policeman, thinking
that she wanted to join the long line of sum-
mona seekers, Apparently scared the young
woman sat down, but got up again,
@ot inside the railing and before Magistrate
Pool, to whom she presented a card engraved
“Alice Serber, Attorney and Counsellor-at-
Law.”

With her card Miss Serber presented several
letters of recommendation from prominent
erBONS to the effect that thebearer was a real
awyer and wanted to practise in the West
Side court, The Magistrate shook hands
warmly with Miss Serber, surmmoned ali his
clerks and introduced them, with this announce-
ment

“This, gentlemen, is Miss Serber, an attorney
who wishes to practise here. You are to treat
her with more than ordinary Consideration, as
she deserves."

fhe Magistrate then introduced all the court
attendants and the reporters, Miss Serber
said she was a graduate of the New York Unit-
versity Law Sehool, that her parentage was
Russian, and that she was the first woman
lawyer ever admitted to practise in the United
States District Courts She said she had prac-
tised considerably in elvil cases and that) now
she was going to try her hand at criminal work.

Tho news of the new arrival was quickly cir-
culated and a meeting of the West Side Kar As-
sociation was baatily called, the Hon. Benjamin
I. Greenthalin the chair “Tliungery Joe,"’ the
parliamentarian and watchdog of the court,
vot the floor after considerable trouble. He
said that the business was overcrowded and
that honest men were being driven out of it
every day

“Vhy," said he, “can't ve do dings in de same
vay as dey do down to Essegs Marget cord?”

He was quickly called down by the Hon, John

s00n

 

 

J. Halligan, who delivered himself of an impas-
sioned arguinment favoring the opposite and
gentler sex

‘Why, said Mr. 4lalligan, “‘shouldn’t this

newcomer be admitted to the inner ercle of
our noble profession with outstretched arms?
ller very presence will tend to make practice
here more elevating and pleasant 1 hereb
move that the following resolution be adopted

“Reaolved, That) Miss Serber be and hereby
{s elected an honorary member, without the
payment of dues, of the West Side Court Kar
Association, and that she is hereby privileged
to take all dressmaking casea which come up
in thiscourt) Any member, other than Miss Ser-
ber, who takes such a case is to be expelled im-
mediately and ignominiously,”’

The resolution was adopted without a dissent-
ing voice, as “Hungry doe” had just received
word that the free luneh counter Was nearly
empty and had gone out, leaving his hat

THE BOER WAR.

RICHARD HARDING DAVIS'S first
article, which appears in the June
number, tells of Buller’s advance
to the relief of Ladysmith and of
the battle of Pieter’s Hill. The
narrative, like all of Mr. Davis's
writing, has a human quality that
appeals irresistibly to the reader.
No other writer brings us so near
the actual scenes. The article is
illustrated from photographs.

THE BOER SIDE of the situation,
too, is shown most vividly in this
number by Thomas F. Millard,
who is with the Boer army, and
who tells, what has not yet been
| told, the methods of the Boer at-
| tack and defence as observed in
their own lines.

HOW A PRESIDENTIS ELECTED.
MR. A. MAURICE LOW, the Wash-
