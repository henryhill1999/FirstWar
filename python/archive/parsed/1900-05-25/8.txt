‘ REAL ESTATE NEWS.

 

The market was quiet yesterday. Nothing
of much importance was anriounced, outside
of the Astor lease mentioned below. A rumor
that negotiations were nearly consummated
for the sale of a large piece of property above

tion proved to be correct. The brokers in the
case admitted that negotiations were under
way and the sale, if it is made, will be in the
neighborhood of $400,000. Inasmuch as more
definite particulars might spoil a sale, they are
withheld for the present. Bryan L. Kennelly
& Co. take exception to thereport that the
property No. 174 Fulton street had been of-
fered at private sale at $42,000. The firm were
the brokersin the sale and announced that it was
sold for severai thousand more than that sum.
