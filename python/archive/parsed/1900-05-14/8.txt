commodity which the New York Dairy Product
Company is preparing to distribute, The eom-

ia the outgrowth of a conviction of Charles R
Flint that the milk business of New York can be
done by a single concern more economically
than it can be transacted by the several hun-
dred dealers who now distribute the milk from
house to house, The manager of the company
is William Graves of 19 Lawn Ridge drive,
Orange. fle told a SUN reperter yesterday
what it intends to do.

“We found," said Mr. Graves, “that there are
1,250,000 quarts of milk sold daily in New York,
and the price ranges from 12 cents a quart

down to 4 cents. The cheaper milk, while
bOssing the test required by law is really an
adulterated = milk Itis put through = tho
ereamery and some of the butter fat ts ex-
tracted from it and then skim milk {a added ao
that the milk will stand the teat, wolch is 4 per
cent. of butter fat and 12 per cent. of solid
matter

“In New York there are 2,200 licensed dealers
who distribute this milk, and I venture to say
that there ia not a dealer among them who has
nore than $100,000 invested in this business and
from that down to $6,000, and yet there are
several dealers who make trom $30,000 to $50,000
a year. According to the statistics we have
gathered, itcosts about 24 cents a quart to

istribute the milk, but we are satiafied that we
can distribute itfor a centa. quart, so that
We shail save $18,750 a day when we get our
plant in working order

“A Consolidated Milk Exchange was sup-
posed to represent the farmers and dealera
through a board of fifteen directors, composed
of twelve city dealers and three producers, an
they set the price, an arbitrary price, which the
farmers must accept for their milk. Some-
times the price was changed as frequently as
three times a month. Finally the exactions of
this exchange became so onerous that the far-
mers organized the Five States Milk Protective
Association, which has 10,000 members in the
States of New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania,
Connecticut and Massachusetts. This assocta-
thon contracted to dispose of the milk supplied
by its members for a term of five years at vary-
ing prices, averaging two and a half cents a
quart,

“Now we have made a contract with the Five
States Association so that ita product goes
through our hands and we collect and remit to
the farmers; charging the dealers five centa
acan, so that we act really in the capacity
of a farmers’ exchange. We thereby con-
trol the product, amounting to 25,000 cans
a day, eguivalent to 1,000,000) quarts
The object of the farmers in forming their asso-
ciation was that they might have some fixed in-
come, but many dealers have failed to pay for
the milk within the thirty davs they have been
allowed and we have undertaken to collect
these aceounta, which amount, Ithink, toabout
$100,900

“We have no intention of cornering t mar-
ket or anything of that sort. It is a plain bual-
ness proposition. I know from actual observa-
tion that in some apartment houses milk 1s de-
livered by as many as eight different dealers
With our delivery system we shall change that
entirely.”’

Two circulars have been {ssued by the New
York Dairy Product Company, one to the
farmers, stating that the price of milk after
May 10and during this month will be two centa a
quart, delivered at the station, for which cash
will be paid) The other circular has been ad-
dressed to tne dealersanditsays thatthe priceof
milk to the trade during May will be two cents
aquart net, with five cents a can added. Mr.
Graves said to the reporter that the company's
delivery system was not yet in operation and
untilit should be the corporation would cons
tinue selling to the retail dealers, depending for
ita profits upon the brokerage fee of five centa
acan. With the installation of the delivery
aystem, however, the company’s profits would
be larger

REAL ESTATE NEWS.

 

The week {ust passed made a very good show-
ing onthe average. While it started on Mon-
day with an unusual number of announce-
ments of properties sold, it did not fulfil the
promise thus made of a week to be exception-
ally momentous in the number of deals brought
tolight. In fact, it alternated days Indicative
of great activity with those in which the mar-
ket looked to be very dull. The twodays which
have come to be accepted as the ones moat
likely to be dull, Monday and Saturday, were
an exception to the rule, however, and fur-
nished the most important news; on Saturday
the news coming outof the several sales made
by A. L. Mordecai & Son for Potter &
Brother and on Monday were announced

sales of improved property on the southeast
corner of Fifth avenue and Seventeenth street

andon the southeast corner of 155th street and
St. Nicholas place. On the same day also Man-

delbaum & Lewine announced the purchase of

flats on Fighth avenue, near the Grand Circle,
Tuesday wasa dull day, but on Wednesday it
was learned that Whitehouse & Porter had sold
two more of the Roman Catholic Orphan Asy-
lum lota on East Fifty-second street and on Fri-

day Pease & Elliman reported the sale of the

remaining lot on Fifty-second street to Henry
D. Babcock. Whitehouse & Porter declined to

say towhom they sold ‘The lots of this prop-

erty are now all sold excepting five on Fifth

avenue at the corner of Fifty-second street,
which are down for sale at auction on Wadnes-
day at the Real Fatate Salesroom by Bryan L
Kennelly & Co | If the lots are not sold at priv-
ate contract hefore that time the sale of them
