OFFICE OF THE

Western New York & Pennsylvania
Railway Company,

104 SOUTH FIFTH STREET,

I MILADBLPHIA, Pa., April 23, 1900.

To the Shareholders
and Income Mortgage Bondholders:

Bince submitting the report of the operations of
your Company for the year ending June 50th, 1499,
@reumstances have arisen gravely affecting your
interests, which make !t the duty of the manage-
ment to submit to you the following statement

Asisno doubt well known to you, 4 large propor
tion of the earnings of your Company ts derived from
twaffic exchanged with the Pennsylvania Railroad
System, and the relationa of your Company with that
System have been for many years of the most cordial
character, and continue to be soatthia tima The
Pennsylvania Railroad Company, however, bas al-
ways had in view the importance of Huffalo as one of
{te terminal points, and this has been lately empha-
@iaed by its purchase of the stock of the Prieand
Western Transportation Company, whose inke line
runsto that city, and whose tramMc furnishes an addi
tional reason why the relations of the Pennsylvania
Railroad Company with Iuffalo should be over its
own raiia The Pennsylvania Rallroad Company has
no ownership in your property, and therefore has no
epectal interestin sending {ts traMec over your road,
but with the view of securing its own line to Kuffalo,
{t opened negottations some Ume since with your
Company for the purchase of the controlling Interest
in your property. It had no desire to destroy the
value of your property by Dullding a competing road,
but did naturally desire to secure for lines in {tw own
interest the profit resulting from the transportation of
{ts raficfto and from Buffalo, especially in view of
the proposed establishment of large steel works and
other industrial estataishments in that city, which of
Beceasity will draw a large amount of coal and other
trafic from points on the Pennsylvania Railroad Sys
tem.

Not being able to agree with your management
upon a basis which we could recommend for your
acceptance, the Pennsylvania Railroad Company
took out a charter and adopted a location for 4
line from Wilcox on the Philadelphia and Erte
Railroad to the State line between Pennsylvania
and New York, to be continued under a proper
charter to Buffalo, where the Pennsylvania Rail-
road Company has already acquired large terminal
properties, in additiqn two those betonging to the
Erfe and Western ‘Transportation Company. Your
management then had further protracted negotta-
trons with the Pennsylvania Railroad Company,
as a result whereof It has now offered to purchase
the stock and the income bonds of your Company,
at a price and upon conditions which tn the judg-
ment of your Board are fair and should be satis-
factory to you. From the Inception of these ne-
gotiations, your management have insisted thatany
offer made should be open for a definite time to all
the holders of these securities; and we are now
authorized to state to the stockholders and to the
income bondholders that if not less than a majority
of both the stock and income bonds ts deposited
as hereinafter set forth, on or before May 26th,
1900, the Pennsylvania Rallroad Company will pay
eighteen per cent, or $9 per share, for the stock
and thirty per cent, or $300 per bond, for lke
proportions of such stock and income bonds as
may be so deposited. The prices offered for these
securities are more than full as compared with
thetr current market values, and ft is needless to
say that should the proposed new line to Buffalo
be built, the traM ec now passing over your line to
and from the Pennsylvania Rallroad System will be
diverted therefrom, and your gross and net earnings
seriously depleted. Under these circumstances, and
with the conviction that the price offered {s Just and
fair, the members of your Board, who are personally
large ho!‘ rs of both Income bonds and stock, have
signified their intention of accepting the offer made
by the Pennsylvania Rallroad Company. Believing
that the acceptance of this offer is for the best inter-
ests of those concerned, they cordially recommend ft
for your acceptance, and the Board of Directors at
thelr meeting of this date have formally approved tt
and directed its submission with their endorsement to
the stock holders and income bondholders of the Com-

~ Dany.

In order that the offer of the Pennsylvania Rail-
toad Company may be avatied of, It is necessary
that deposits of sald stock and bonds should be
made on or before May 26th at one of the following
depositories:

The Commercial Trust Company, Philadetphia, Pa.;
Speyer & Co., New York City, N. Y.;

Speyer Brothers, London, England;

Laz. Speyer Ellissen, Frankfort-on-Main, Germany;
Teixelra Oe Mattos Brothers, Amsterdam, Holland.

Upon the deposit of said stock and income bonda,
temporary negotiable receipts will be issued there-
for, and should the stipulated amount of said
securities be deposited by the time named, the
transaction will be closed; and, upon surrender of
the temporary receipts, payments will be made In
cash for the sald securities on and after June 15th,
1900, of which due notice will be given. Should the
holders of the said securities fail to deposit them to
the amount hereinbefore stated, the Pennsylvania
Rallroad Company has the right to withdraw Itsoffer,
fn which case prompt notice thereof will be given,
and upon surrender of the temporary receipts the
securities deposited will be returned to the owners,
Holders of these securities desiring further I{nfor-
mation will please commminicate promptly with elther
of the depositarles above named, or with the under-
signed.

By order of the Board,

SAMUEL G, DeCOURSEY President.

COPPER
CERTIFICATES

Copper King of Arizona, now being 4 bullion pro-
ducer, will sella limited amount of copper, for future
delivery, represented by certificates entiiing the
holder to stated amounts of refined electrolyte cop-
per, Atites designated warehouse in New York City

These certificates will be sold ata discount of | per
cent A month, calculated forthe length of time they
are to ruh to maturity, and they will bot be lasued to
run later than December 31 of this year, nor fora
Shorter time than ninety days.

The price at which the copper ta sold will be the
one ruling for refined electrolyte ingot copper, at the
time of the issue of the certificates, but the purchaser
will be protected against loss by any decline in the
rice of the metal during the life of the certificate by
teine entitied to the face value of the certificate in
copper at the market price, at the time thatthe certifi
cate Is redeemed, ora cash customer being obtained
therefor at its face value

For tnstance, should a purchaser of a certificate
when copper Is selling at 17 cents a pound find that
the price of the metal ts but 15 cents when he wishes
to redeem his certificate, he will get his copper atthe
lather price. If copper should go above 17 cents, the
rise will be to the benefit of the purchaser of the cer-
Uficate

To foundrymen or others who wish to buy copper
for future delivery, the purchase of these ceruficates
will be found most advantageous and profitable, as
the holder ts secured against all loss due to any fay.
sible deeline tn the market value of the metal and has
the advantage of the rise in price Uf such should oc-
cur) until the certificate matures

For investors wishing to make short time inveat-
ments that are safe and profitable, these certificates
should be very attractive, as they have all the ad-
vantagesof siiver bulllon or other warehouse mer-
chandise certificates and can be carried without the
Hability of loss due to fluctuations of the market
Value of the bullion, and can be obtained at a@ dis-
count atthe rate of 12 per oent per annum.

For further information regarding these
certificates apply to Copper King of Ari-
zona, 33 Wall Street, New York. _

WEEK’S RECORD IN MINING.

—— al

KLONDIKERS ATTRACTED TO THE
BIG SALMON RIVER.

meneeunan®
Nome Big Nuggets Found Along the Stream
and Ite Tributariee-New Yorkers to Pros-
pect Along the Shores of sSoutheasternAlaska
—Coke Question Serious in the Black Hills,

Seatie, Wash., May 7.—The Big Salmon and
tributary streams have been attracting atten-
tion among Klondikers this spring by reason of
new strikes in which large nugget, worth from
$150 to $260, have been numerous. Several hun-
dred claima have been taken up and the creeks
are being well prospeoted.

In the Yellow Jacket mine, Atlin district, a
fine body of free gold ore has been struck with-
in the past week, some assays running from
$500 to $1,000 per ton. It ts sald that the vein is
125 feet wide and traceable for some distance.
This is the most extensive ledge in the district,
There is more activity displayed in the placer
mines of Atlin this season than usual, and there
is apparently more confidence since the repeal
of the allen law which prohibited Amerioans
from rating in placers.

Through the scarcity of experienced mil] men,
the old 240-stamp mill of the Treadmill has been
compelled to temporarily hang up {ts stamps,
The Nome excitement is credited with the tem-
porary shortage, hundreds of men giving up
steady employment to go to the new gold
flelds.

During the past week New York capitalists
have purchased the finest schooner on Lake
Washington, to be used in prospecting along
the shores of southeastern Alaska. They are
outfitting for a summer's prospecting, and ap-
pear to have great confidence in the country,
especially in its copper deposits.

Five steamers are advertised to sail for Cape
Nome on May 15, all loaded to their full capao-
ity with freight and all passenger accommoda-
tions taken. They will carry from 1,500 to 2,000
passengers. (ne steamer eailing this week
will carry a complete railroad outfit, including
locomotives, cars, ties and rails. This material
‘s fora line between Port Clarence and Nome
City.

A large amount of hydraulic machinery ts be-
ing ahipped to the mines on Cook Inlet, denot-
{ng a great deal of activity In a country re-
garded heretofore as being ratherslow, Several
steamers and schooners are engagedin active
trade between Seattle and the mines of Cook
Inlet. Good progress is being madein the pe-
troleum flelds of this district. A number of wells
are being sunk with good prospects.

LAKE SUPERIOR COPPER.

HavoGuton, Mich., May 9.—The Carp Lake
and Norwich mines, west of the Ontonagon
River anda little beyond the recognized limits
of the profit-paying belt of the Lake copper
district, are being worked with some substan-
tial promise for the future, Although looked
on with disfavor by many old-time miners, be-
cause of their location, both properties are
within the clearly marked limits of the Kewee-
nawan copper belt, and the men who are spend-
ing their money there should be praised for
their courage Instepping bevond the hitherto
demonstrated area of profitable copper mining.
Another mine in the same district, the Halliwell,
is to be worked again, {f the owners can succeed
{n interesting Boston capital in their enterprise,

The mortar for the alxth head at the Atlantio
mill is being set and the Baltio will soon have
two stamps running, when the present produo-
tion, about 60 tons per month, will be practically
doubled. The contract for the building and
equipment of the new Raltic mill has been let
and the mill should be able to start work next
spring.

The Calumet & Hecla ts giving additional
tests tothe Wilfley table, a device for saving
fine copper from the slimes. A new separator,
devised to assort the various grades of rock
coming crushed from the stamps, Is being test-
ed at the same mill.

The Franklin people are much pleased with
the result of their mill teston Allouez con-
glomerate rock, which ran nearly 2 per cent
mineral.

The Mass Company 1s working vigorously on

ite mill site sixteen miles south of Houghton.

The crosacut at No L shaft Adventure, driven
from the Knowiton lode, has tapped the Butler
lode, which shows well{n copper at that point.
The Adventure is being opened on the Knowl-
ton amyedalold, which is one of the five
aniyedaloid lodes traversing the property on
which jnore or less mining has been done in the
past

The Tamarack-Osceola mine combination {8
building a large extension to the coal wharf
and sheds at Dollar Bay, Although the original
shed, with a storage capacity of 40,000 tons, was
built flve years ago, and was then considered of
ample size for ten yeurs to come, an addition
was built two years ago andanother is required
this season, The necessity of an ample fuel
supply, adequate for all emergencies caused by
strikes or difficulties of nearly a thousand miles
of real and lake transportation, Causes the mine
lnanagements to lay in large supplies of coal,

Phe Copper Range Railroad ts building a sub-
stantial new coal shed here and ia reballasting
the entire line of road between Houghton aud
Mass City

 

 

COLORADO,

Denven, May 8--The San Jnan country fs
begining to open up its mining season with a
promise of a most encouraging year. The snow
is fast going off the mountains and the mining
operators are on hand with plans for much
important work. The mountains about Silver-
ton are well prospected, prices never were
more favorable for the ore of the district, and
the methods of handling the product have been
solved successfully. Silverton is quite a lead
district, and with lead ore selling for $20 more
ver ton than was obtained four years ago a
arge tonnage is brought into market.

The camp is not an easy one for limited
capital to exploit. Both the Silver Lake and
the  lowa were developed and made
dividend payers only by the application
of a great outlay of money The Glad-
stone district {s another example of the
necessity of much capital, The company op-
erating the Gold King ata big profit now was
compelled to construct a raiiway from Silver-
ton up Cement Creek to the camp, to put ina
etamp and concentrating mill and to build
proper tunnels. In the past four years seven
niills have been erected at mines for the purpose
of concentrating the ores. Several long wire
trauis were set up, developed tunnels were
bored and the mines put {n modern actentifio
working order, Last year two mills were set
np and they proved successful; this year there
{4 talk of several more. A number of Eastern
companies have taken options on old properties
and they are raising the money needed to open
the mines after the example set by a half-dozen
companies now reaping rich returns

The Silverton ores are strictly, so far as
known, furnace ores, Neither cyanide nor
chlorination processes {s available, and all ex-
periments with other processes have proved un-
satisfactory

At Howardsvillo the Niegold properties, in-
cluding seventeen claims, Teve been bonded
for $400,000 and a concentrating mill will be
orepsed this season. The vein is twenty feet
wide

In the Needles district the New York com-

Last week the first attempt of the season to
open the East Mancos gold flelds was made A
pack train was sent out from Mancos to Tim-
perline camp. There a_fissure vein was devel-
oped last season for 350 feet. Twenty or more
men will be employed and the Jackson mill has
been moved from West Manecos to operate the
ores of this vein. The vein runs from four to
eleven feet wide and the ore averages 622, with
some streaks worth 860 per ton

Leadville has added another shipping ore this
week by the initial shipment of seventy-five
tons of bismuth ore from the Ballard Mine to

Another Eastern capitalist arrived in Dead-

Ali of the old tin talk is being revived in the
Blaok Hills and there is every reason to expect
that several large deals in tin properties will be
made thia season. Itis stated that the Phila-

from under their feet. So the prospectus of

old dredging companies, when they see the

be glad to move on to Siberia or any other
handy seacoast where the swinging tides of the
ocean wash up golden sands, and where there

teries, All the companies will have to do
is to pay for their strip of gold const
and go to work. Nobody can interfer

with them: nobody can pick up a single grain
of gold sand on the Siberian coast unless the
syndicate with the concession says so. Furthere
more there will be no strikes in the new Fl
Dorado, With the exception of the skilled
mechanics and the engineers and surveyors all
the workmen employed will be Russians It {9
partof the agreement with the Russian Gov.
ernment. And it is accepted as an axiom that
sussan laborers, especially in Siberia, don't
strike.

Mr. George D. Roberta, the veteran American
miner who is going with the expedition, talked
with some reserve about the enterprise at the
Waldorf-Astoria. But still he talked,

“The whole Pacific seashore,” he said, "is
atrewn with golden sands, from the Arctic Ocean
to Patagonia, The sand dunes on which San
Francisco is built contain gold which will pan
out from $2 to $8 to the ton—not enough to
pay for working, but still pure gold. There are
old sea sands in Warren county, in the Adiron-
dacks, and in other paris of New York which
also contain gold. It is the same with the fifty
or sixty miles of old beach along the Snake
River in Colorado. The gold was ground out of
the quartz veins by glacial action and thus
mingled in loose particles with the sand

“Now Behring Sea and Straits are nothing
but a grand sluiceway formed by glaciers forces
ing their way from the Aretle to the lacitio
Ocean. The rich veinsof gold through the rock
formation which extends from Alaska to Siberia
were broken up and crushed by the grinding
action of. the glaciers The gold particles are
sprinkled all through the sea sands. Every !n-
coming wave and every flood-tidebrings then
ashore, Thetninersat Nome dig holes in the
beach and the incoming tide and waves fil
them with fresh sand which contains gold. In
this way the mines are inexhaustible, They are
constantly renewed.

“From theory as wellas from actual reports
from men whom we have sent from Alaska, we
are convinced that the same conditions prevail
on the Siberian coast as exist at Nome. I do
not know from personal experience and obser-
vation, for I have not been there, but I aim
none the less convinced that there will be such
an output of gold from that region aa the wor!
has never seen before. Weare going prepared
to make a thorough Investigation, and ft the
result is as we believe it will be, there will be
plenty of capital forthcoming.”

According to the statements made by those
interested, the Russian Government was be-
sieged with applications for the concession
which at last was granted to the syndicate in
question. Hooley, who once was the great
ITondon promoter, has nothing to do with the
company that has been formed, As the Rus-
sian laws require, it was incorporated first as a

tussian company, and then reincorporated in
England by the American and English stock-
holders,
