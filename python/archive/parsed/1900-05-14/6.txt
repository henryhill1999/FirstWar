Forexample, the selling of supplies to a rail-

ably treated as a perquisite of the directors
engaged in the business of furnishing them, or
who have friends init who pay them commis-

The greatest opportunities for unconsclen-
tious profits by directors are those arising frorn
the purchase or absorption in some form of the
properties of corporations allied to their own.
How great they are is shown by the jump inthe

fore last, on the mere rumor that the New York
Central was to take a lease of the Long Island

that his character is Gduciary, being intrusted by
others with powers which are to be exercised tor the
common and General interests of the corporation and
not for his own private interests. He falls, therefore,
within the great rule by which equity requires that
confidence shall not be abused by the party in whom
{tts reposed, and which it enforces by impesing a
disability elther partial or complete upon the party
intrusted to deal on hia own behalf in respect to any
matter involved in such confidence."

Long before this, too, Chancellor Kent, in his
Commentaries, laid it down as the law on the

subject of sales to a trustee of trust property,

that “a person cannot act as an agent for

another and become himself the buyer. He
cannot be both buyer and seller, at the same
time, or connect his own interest In his dealings
asanagent or trustee for another. It is in-
compatible with the fiduciary relation.”

It follows, therefore, that every one of the

transactions, of which there have beenso many
of late years, in which men have become buyers
directly or Indirectly of the bonds or the stock
of the corporations which they were directors
or sellers to them of commodities and property,
are illegal as well as unconscientious, and would
be so treated by the courts In suits brought by
the stockholders either to annul them in case
they have not been completed, or if they have
been completed, to recover the profits made on
them by the directors participating in them,
One or two such suits, prosecuted with vigor,
would be extremely useful in awakening Wall
Street to the law that governs the matter, and
might possibly put an end to what has become
a crying public scandal.

It may be asserted that the strict en-

forcement of the law would deprive most of our
corporations of the services of their ablest
managers, and that not enough other men, both
sufficiently competent and sufficiently disinter-
ested, can be found to fill their places. For the
credit of our country it is to be hoped that the
assertion is not true, for, {fit be true, it proves
a widespread degradation of moral tone among
us, which augurs ill for our national future. If
the corruption of our politicians, which {a the
theme of so frequent denunciation by the
press and the pulpit, is accompanied by @ cor
responding corruption among the leaders of our
business world, our prospects are gloomy
indeed. MATTHEW MARSHALL.
