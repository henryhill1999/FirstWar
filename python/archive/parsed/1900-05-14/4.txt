SUNDAY ON DIAMOND, —

Brooklyn Shut Out and New York Loves by
One Rua.
St. Lovis, May 18.—Nothwithstanding the
fact that not a car ran in this city to-day, over
11,000 persons assembled at League Park and
witnessed Tebeau's team shut out the Superbas
{n @ gaine replete with sensational plays
Jones, the left-hander, pitched a splendid

 

 

secured off his delivery, while fifteen were
made off Howell. Heldrick opened the run
wetting for St. Louis with a homer to left.
Brooklyn sent thirty-three men to the bat, only
three reaching third bag. Jones's supportin the

field was marvellous, In the ninth inning the
Superbas made a desperate but unavailing ef-
forttoscore, Sheckard led off with a drive to
third, but was thrown out at first, DeMont
singled toright and MeGulre walked. Howell
wasputout by McGraw to first, and DeMont
reiched third) Jones came to the bat and
landed squarely ou the nose of the second ball
pitched, driving well ont into left. Burkett
received it, however, retiring the side and end-
ing the game. DeMont madetwo serious errors
which disheartened his team, It is the inten-
tion of the management to complete the series
with Brooklyn to-morrow and Whesday, strike
or nostrike, All manner of conveyances were
pressed into service to-day. The score:

RECORDS OF LOCAL BALL PLAYERS,

Kitson Leads the Brooklyns and Doyle the
New Yorks in Batting.

Kelley no longer leads the Brooklyn players
in batting, Kitson now standing at the top and
Farrell moving into second place. Capt.
Kelley comes next. In the few games played
last week Keeler picked up forty-seven points
and {a close to the 300 mark. Jones also im-
proved in his stick work. Sheckard in the
meantime did not place a hit to his credit. Few
league players have been hitting the ball as
hard as Jack Doyle. He has found the oppos-

one or more hita in every game
oe feret to Doyle, Selbach has n
doing the best work of the New York players.

APPARENT INDIFFERENCK ABOUT

PROFESSIONAL HARNESS RACING,

Grand Circait Meeting at Empire City Track
Ie Doubtful. Talk, However, of Unpaid
Purses Being Settled and Races Arranged
~The Amateurs Organization Booming.

The apparent indifference of the devotees of
trotting in the matter of a Grand Circult meet-
{ng atthe Empire City track this season has
caused no end of talk among metropolitan
horsemen, Notwithstanding all reports to the
contrary those who control the course have
been trying in various ways to arrange for
such a meeting ever since the mabagement of
the Clark estate was placed in their hands
Thetr first plan was to form a club comprising
several prominent horse fanciers and to place
in the hands of the jroposed organization the
control of the sporting features of the meeting,
while the financlal management remained
under the control of the estate and (ts advisors,
The scheme found little favor among horsemen,
owlng in no small measure to the fact that
while it was on foot there remained and still

|

remains unpaid about $4,000 of the purses that
were hung up last year, and tho track was con-
sequently under the ban of the National Trot-
ting Association

Right here it should be said that the receipts
of the Grand Circuit races last season were Par
in excess of the extravagant expenditures, but
much of the money paid in as entrance fees
was diverted to other purposes than the pay-
ment of purses, and when the meeting was over
many horse owners who had contributed large
6ums In entrance fees were unable to get back
even their own money after their horsea had
won. Inthe face of this default the Empire
City Trotting Club went on and held an October
meeting at which more obligations of the same
sort were piled up. No foseing can be held at
the track unti] these obligations are dilcharged,
unless itis held independent of the N. T. A,
The matter has no bearing on the proposed
Tunning meeting, however as the Jockey Club
and the N. T. A. do not recognize each other's
rulings in such matters.

After the plan offorming a club had been
tried and abandoned, it was announced that
the track was for rent to any responsible indi-
vidual o1 association that would givea trotting
meeting there on the dates assigned by the
stewards of the Grand Circuit, the rent being a
sum about equal to the amount required to pay
off the purses and pat the course in goodstand-
ing. By this time It was too late in the season
for anybody to open installment purses, the
chiet source of profit at most trotting meetings,
and as yet no one has been found who cared to
inake good the obligations of the Empire City
Trotting Clubin order to carry out its plans
and givea meeting Now that the racehorses
pelonging to the Clark estate have been sold it
is said that the purses will be paid, thus raising
the ban of the N. T. A. which now stands in the
way of a meeting. Should this be done it is
generally believed that those who control the
property will either give a meeting or lease the
course to some one who will do so

That the mass of New York horecnien are
comparatively indifferent in the matter there
can be no doubt. Under the conditions which
existed a few years ago the devotees of trotting
would have put their hands in their pockets to
pay off the old purses, and then would have put
their names down to guarantee the paytnent of
future purses in order to clear the way fora

Grand Cireuit meeting. . But things have
changed since the days of Fiectwood Park
The Speedway has been e@pened, and with it has
come a rapidly growing Interest {n amateur
sport and a distinct falling off in the rely
ative importance of professional harness

jorses that would have been
fitted for the campaign and = sent out
on the circuits afew years ago are
now kept for pleasure driving exclusively, and
when placed in the hands of the trainer itis
merely for development or to be tuned up and
balanced for better work on the Speedway
Hundreds of horse fanciers find more pleasure
and satisfaction in driving their equine peta in
the impromptu brushes on the Speedway than
they formerly derived from seeing them race in
the hands of professional reinsmen Old-time
horsemen have repeatedly expressed the opin-
ion that the spectacle to be seen at Speedway
Park on a day when the best horses are out sur-
passes that of a high-class trotting contest ona
racetrack, As oneof them recently putit

“Everybody is out to win. There are noun.
derstandings. The commercial element that
takes to racing solely for the money there isin
itis absent. The horses make a better appear-
ance to wagon than to sulky, and with their
owners driving them the sport is altogether
more interesting.”

While there is now no organization in the
borough of Manhattan to promote professional
harness racing, ‘he amateur branch of the sport
{s represented by an association having more
than 1,000 members, which has come into
existence since the Speedway was opened
This association decided by unanimous vote |
Just Saturday to give a series of one-day meet- |

racing

{ngs for races to Wagon, amateurs driving, with
no money prizes, A dezenor more silver cups
and trophies have been donated as prizes for
the horses totry for, and ail slens point to a
season of better sport than New York horse-
nen haveever seen in the amateur fleld, pro-
vided a suitable track can be secured tor the
races

Yesterday was an off day at Speedway lark,
owing to the rain on Saturday night. Inthe
morning the road was too muddy for speeding,
and though the surface dried out so rapidly as
to be in good condition in the afternoon, few
high-class horses were seen among the hundreds
that dotted the long stretch of brown soil. The
stifling heat caused nearly all drivers to refrain
from speeding, aid so the brushes were few
and far between Dariel, 2007's, queen of
Speedway pacers, was out in the afternoon and
fieured ina brush with the bay mare Ollie
Wilkes, 2.16., driven by George Stengel of
Newark, The brown mare proved to be too
fast for the Jersey flyer, vet Ollie Wilkes made
a gallant fight, and was beaten only a couple of
lengths over the stretch from the bend down to
Washington Bridge

pern vs. Rocamora, Fttlinger vs. Koehler, while
Roething hada bye. Sclmidt adopted the Rus-
alan Defence and kept on even terms inthe
opening as wellasin the middle game. Inthe
ending he won a couple of pawns and the game
after sixty-one mv Hanham, who played
Philid or’'s Defence against Simonson, got asu-
perior position in the opening, but eventually
he made a hasty move and aliowed hia adver-
with a draw after forty-
focamora relied upon a
Sicilian Defence against Halpern, and a
very interesting «ame was adjourned atf-
ter forty-five moves. Ettlinger offered a
King's Gambit to Koehler, who declined to take

tion, and with alittle care should have won

Local Oarsmen Show Good Ferm in Practice
Spins on the Harlem,

Students of form had plenty to occupy their
attention on the Harlem River yesterday as
most of the crews arefar enough advanced in
training to admit of trustworthy comparisons
and in some cases predictions aa to the result of
the races. Theimportance of the spring fix-
tures, which include the National Regatta, ts
generally recognized and club captaina all
along the line are making big efforts to turn
outcrews good enough to obtain the coveted
trip to Paris at the expense of the N. A.A. O

During the early days of training New York's
chance of winning representation abroad in
the senior eights was thought to be with the
Knickerbocker or Bohemian crews The past
week puta new complexion on affaira, The
senior eight of the Harlem Rowing Club gradu-
ally met with favor, and after thespins of yester-
day the prediction became general that the crew
would carry off the palm from the other local
eights. The men did not have a brush of any
{mportance in either morning orafternoon spin
but the clean mannerin which they caught the
water, and pulled a strong stroke through witha
quick recovery and even swing was impressive
Every man in the boat isa thorough waterman,
and most of them are clever soullers, including
onechampion inJ,Rumohr. Thestrength of the
Harlem club is reénforced by three menibers of
last season's successful Knickerbocker A. ¢
eight, making the following formidable
combination—M. Davis, bow, C, Mase, 2, W.
Hoffman, 3; J. Rumobhr, 4; J. FE. Nagle, 5; J.
Rooney, 6; F, Wishart, 7; J. Maher, stroke; R.

Irvin, coxswain. Fred Plalsted is the coach—
and the manner in which he has brought them
along was proved on Saturday evening, when
in a brush with the Knickerbocker eight, the

The Harlems are confident of winning the
junior four-oared shell event at the Harlem re-

atta with a crew steered by the apeedy sculler,

1. Vought, who, though a senior in that class,
is stilla juntor with the sweeps. Vought from
his seat at the bow oar took the boat along as
straight us an arrow yesterday, with H. Noneu-
bacher, stroke, Hl. Burchart, 3, and H. Holton,
2 Jack Nagle made his reappearance in the
donble seull with Rumohr, after an absence
from the water for three days. Roth men are
fitand Nagle hopes to spare enough time to
Keep on edge, but if not his place will be taker
by Maher or Mase) The Harlerma also had 4
junior centipede four out, stroked by J. Schultz
and a number of single scullers, inciuding
Rumobr and Max Hirsch

‘Lhe interest in the senior eight-oared race at
the Harlem regatta was increased by the in-
formation volunteered by Dr. Peet, that the
Columbia ‘Varsity cfew wouldbea starter As
the crack Vesper crew is Coming on trom Phila-
delphia, the race may furnish a line aa to the
crew that will besentto Paris. General regret
was expressed along the river at the news that
John Exley, stroke of the Vesper B.C. eight,
had been shot{nthe arm by a footpad He is
considered the best man in that position now
rowing, and the mishap may seriously affect
the chances of the Philadelphia crew,

Coach Van Viiet had the senior and junior
Bohemian eights out in the morning. Both
crews did creditable work in long opens over
the Speedway course, Nearly all the substi-
tutes have been dispensed with and the crews
definitely made up as follows

Senlor—Marousek, bow; Behensky, 2; Drenk, 4:

onthe Harlem by a centipede four, who rowed
yesterday as follows: J. Holder, bow; G. Slater,

The Wyanoke is another club that has a lot
of promising juniors and after the weeding out
yrocess an eight has been selected that did sat-

for the junior singles, Was out twice during the

The Nassau Boat Club is now comfortably in-
stalled in its new quarters at 158th street, from
where several good crew's were launched and
took spins on the upper Harlem yesterday.
The junior four was stroked by Cree tn a long
row, while the intermediate double, made up of

consisting of J. and C. Powers, did creditable

Yesterday Haller flew after

higher game, and he believed last night that |

there waa a prospect that he would succeed in
getting what he wanted.
He hunted up W. A. Brady, the manager for

Champion James J. Jeffries, and told him that
he would offer.a purse of 125,000 francs ($25,-

fight between
Sharkey or Jeffries and Fitzsimmons

Jeffries and Toin
He ex-

plained that he did not. want the exhibition to |

come off before September,
dition’ that he outlined for the battle were as

follows:

Marquis of Queensberry rules to govern, referee to
be chosen by the two princtpals; name of referee to be

announced two weeks

The main con-

before the date of the cou

Woman Rider Challenges Inventors Resalts
at Vailsburg Links, |
One of the most astonishing features in the ,
patent-oMce returns copeerning bievcle inven-
tions is the number of devices submitted which
have for their object that of making @ bicycle

stand alone

There have been patents by the

hundred issued for contrivances of this kind, |

despite the fact that no one buys them

Here

fs a new idea, nowever, Which was presented ,
| by a woman toa dealer a few days ago:
“Why do not some of the everlasting inventors
cet up aseat to best retched between the head \
tube and the seat post tube on a drop frame

wheel, ao that a wonmpn

when she stops can

have a comfortable seat, without squatting on

the ground or perching on a

fence and at the

samme time alwavs have her wheel under guard?
‘All that would be necegsary isastrip of carpet

about four inches wi

feunda couple of ¢ carpe,

operated by thumb screws, to fit the head anc

the seat post.”

The value of the suggestion can be appre-

ciated any day by
where on the sands women may be seen siting
in the hollow of their wheels
omfortable, but many prefer to do this ratner
than sit on the sand and leave their wheels
