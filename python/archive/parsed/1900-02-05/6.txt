VIOLATIONS OY BANKING LAWS,

Now that events have soemingly demon-
strated the certainty of a long duration of the
war in South Africa, our stock market appears
to have adjusted Itself to the situation, and
henceforth, probably, neither successes nor ro~
verses on either the British or the Boer side
will have much effect on prices. Local influ.
ences have consequontly regained some of
their former imports ince. The declaration of
an unexpectedly large divi lend on the common
stock of the American L Steal and Wire Company
has had a favorable effect not only upon the
market for that stock but upon that for other
stocks of a kindred character, while the break
in Third Avenue Railroad has che eked what
promised to be a lively rise in the prices of all
street railroad securities, The political troubles
in Kentucky are likewise a factor of depression,
since they may grow into something like a
civil war, which will paralyze all industries in
the region where it prevails

Publie opinion in thia part of the country
almost unanimously reprobates the violence
to which resort has been had in Kentucky;
and our citizens are congratulating themselves
that here, at least, respect for the laws and
for the constituted authorities prevents oute
breaks like those that have taken place there,
At the same tiie, it is overlooked that here, as
well as there, legislation that contravenes the
sentiments of the majority of the eitizens of
any locality can le enforced with difficulty, if
at all. Liquor is freely sold at retail on Sun-
day in this city, in spite of the enactmenta for-
bidding it, and gambling houses and other
resorts of vico flourish openly, with the con-
nivance, it is asserted, of the officials whose
duty itis to suppress them. Laws against the
commiesion of acts not involving moral turpi-
tude aro still more laxly enforced, Of this
class are the banking laws both of Congress
and of our State Legislature, which, in so far
as they forbld transactions notin themselves
reprehensible, are virtually a dead letter.

In this respect, the general condemnation,
which has been manifested in financial cireles,
of the exposures recently made of the affairs of
the State Trust Company, is significant and
instruetive, Itis not denied thatthe oMcers of
the company have, contrary to law both made
loans {Indirectly to directors, and loans ex-
eceding the legal Hmit, but, since it appears
that these transactions did not imperil the
solvency of the institution, they are viewed as
being offences too trivial to deserve punishe
ment. Indeed, the Superintendent of the State
Ranking Department haa declared that they
were merely technien!, and has given as a rea-

son for not noticing them, that, if he did se,
econsisteney would require him to take proceed.
ings against every bank withia his jurts-
diction. Consequently neither he nor the
Attorney General has as yet moved in
the matter, and, probably, never will, The
Penal Code, indeed makes “wilful” violationa
of the banking laws misdemeanors; and it

would seem that grand juries, might, of their
own motion, without the intervention of the
Attorney General, indict for such violations
the officers of banking institutions on evi-
dence of their guilt furnished by any citizen
or citizens, but whether such evidence would
or could be adduced, as would prove that the
offences charged were wilfully committed, is
doubtful. Criminal intent has been held by
our Court of Appeals to be essential toe con.
vietion for forgery in endorsing checks bya
person not the payee named in them withthe
name of the payee, and alike criminal intent
might well be held essential toa conviction for
misdemeanor in making unauthorized loans
Similar violations of the National Bank act
go unpunished in asimilar way, The Comp-
troller of the Currency at Washington is
charged with the duty of enforcing the pro-
visions of the act. but he exercises a large dis-
cretion in doing it. His course, recently, inthe
ense of the Globe National Bank of Boston, is
only one of the many illustrations of the man-
ner In which he has permitted institutions
under his charge to continue in business for
months after they had rendered themselves
Hable to the forfeiture of their charters, and

 

when, as events subsequently showed, they
were insolvent. His excuse, which is accent: d
as good by amajority of the community, is, thy

a rigid enforcement of the Inw would not onl
have closed the doors of the offending bank,
but would have caused a panic leading to the
suspension of other and innocent banks, and of
private bankers; while they would not have
prevented the losses to depositors which after-
ward occurred. Depositors suffered nothing.
he contends, by his lenity, and might have
gaineda great deal,

The National Bank act declares
that “the total liabilities to any association, of
any person, or of any company, corporation or
firm, for money borrowed, including in the
liabilities of a company or firm the liabilities of
the several members thereof, shall at notime
exceed one-tenth part ot the capital stock of
such associations actually paid tn’ Rigidly
enforeed, this provision, it is generally
ceded, would grievously hamper the business
of many national banks with nominal eapitals
small in proportion to their surpluses and de.
posits, The Chemical National Bank, for in-
stance, witb a capital of $200,000, would be re.
stricted in its loans to $30,000 to each bor-
rower, although its total loans are over $24,000, -
000, The National City Bank has been making
Joans to the amount of over $80,000,000 on a
capital which, until lately, was only $1,000,000,
ten percent. of which is $100,000, The First
National Bank on a capital of $500,000, lends

distinetly

CON.

   

altogether $82,000,000. Tho Chase National
Jends nearly $30,000,000 on a capital of
$1,000,000, the National Park $85,000,000

on @ capital of $2,000,000,
Natfonal $31,000,000 on a capital of
$1,000,000, Nobody ventures to assert that the
loans of these banks are in excess of the legal
Hmit, and yet nobody believes that they keep
strictly within it. The National Bank act de-
clares that ifthe directors of any national bank.
ing association shall knowingly violate, or
knowingly permit any of the officers servants
or agents of the association, to violate any ofits
provisions, all the rights, privileges and fran-
chises of the assovintion shall be thereby for-
feited, and a suit for the forfeiture may be
brought by the Comptroller of the Currency in
his own tame in proper United States
Court. That no such suit has ever been
brought for making unauthorized loans proves
how little respect is entertained for the law
forbidding them

Another provision of the National Bank act
is, that “it shall be unlawful for any officer,
clerk or agent of any national banking associas
tion to certify any check drawn upon the asso-
ciation unless the person or company drawing
the check has on deposit with the association
at the time such check is certified, an amount
of money equal to the amount specified in such
check.” An amendment to the act
TAS82, adds, that any office

The same exigency still exists, and to meet it

fully certified. Whon the day’s transactions
are completed, the note is cancelled and the
law has been obeyed to the letter; but ite ins
tent has been defeated

How many other inconvenient provisions

there arein both State and Federal banking |

laws, to which no respect is paid by bank and
trust company officer-, only a careful exami-
nation of the laws wil! show, but itis safe to say
that the instances which have just been specl+
Ged by no means eahaust the list, In fact, few

  

Presidents and directors of moneyed inatitu-
tions will spare the time and take the pains to
peruse the statutes regulating their duties and
defining their powers; and it is doubtful if they
evon possess copies of them. They follow the
established routine, and when it is suggested
to them that this routine conflicta with the law
in such cages made and provided, they answer
that business cannot be done fn any other way.
They do not reflect that laws are made for the
purpose of preventing some evil, or of ace
complishing some good, and, 80 long ae they
remain on the statute book unrepealed, thoy
ought to be oboved by every good citizen, It
is enough forthem that disobedience is never
followed by punishment and is, therefore, in
their eyes, not a crime.

It is, indeed, true, that some of the provisions
of our banking Jaws have been enacted by Con-
gress and by the State Legislature without due
regard to the necessities of a business commu-
nity like that of this city. Congressmen and
members of the Legislature brought up in rural
districts and accustomed to financial transac-
tlons only on the very smallest conceivable
scale are ill-fitted to legislate upon matters In-
volving millions of dollars and which are of ins
ternational importance. Tho reported debates
at Washington and in Albany demonstrate this
beyond dispute, Nevertheless, laws thus im-
providently made are as much laws as if they
had been made by the wisest men In the world.
To flout them isto impair the obligation of all
laws, good as wellas bad, and the citizen who
disobeys a provision of banking law which ho
thinks unwise,virtually sanctions the disobedi-+
ence by other men of laws which he approves,
but which they find to be obstacles in the way
of their mischievous schemes,

Moreover, it is by no means to be hastily as-
sumed that laws, like those which for-
bid the lending of money by trust companies
to their directors, aa well as those which re-
strain national banks from making loans to
single borrowers in excess of ten per cent. of
their capitals, and from certifying checks
aginst which there are no deposits, are not
wholesome and laudable. The theory of legis-
lative regulation of bank and trust com-
pany business rests upon the assumption that
only by means of it can the publie be protected
against harm, and defective as such regula-
tion may be, it is better than none, If any
law on the subject {8 bad, the way to secure its
repeal is, as Gen, Grant truthfully said, to
enforce its execution. Nullifying it without
repealing it is bringing all law Into disrespect,
and is, therefore, a remedy worse than the
evil it seeks to cure,
