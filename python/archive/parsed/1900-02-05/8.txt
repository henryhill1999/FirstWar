THEY'RE WITH PARKHURST,

ENGELITES OV “DE ATE” APPROVE
HIS AITITUDE AS TO SUNDAY BEER,

Resolutions Telling the Doctor So Sent
to Him-Painful Pieture of the Poor
Man Shut Out of the Sullivan Saloons
Drawn by Joe Cohen of Allen Street,

There were two meetings of members of the
Martin Engel Association of “do Ate” yester-
day afternoon, The ostracized set held forth
{nthe vellar of the late Silver Dollar Smith's
saloon in Essex street Their meeting, could
be safely called an indignation me oting asthe
business consisted solely of the atring of
ene against the absent and not forgot-
ten leader of “de Ate,” who is now In Hot
springs, Ark

The swell set of the organization met at
Grand and Essex streets and considered fev.
eral bills now awaiting action by the Legisla-
ture at Albany. Dr, Parkhurst will probably
be surprised and gratified some time to-day
when be learns that this meeting cheered his
name to the echo and by 4 rising vote approved
the Harburger bill to permit saloonkeepers to
gel) beer in certain hours on Sundays, and repeal
certain provisions of the Raines law. He will
receive notification of the swell set's action in
a certified copy of resolutions which were
passod at yeaterday'’s meeting. Joe Cohen,
president of the Allen Street Literary Club

val! ed the meeting to order,

* Boys,” he said, “I have some very cheerful
news for you. You know that Martin, our
honored leader, is away to the Hot Springs.
Before he went he told me ro assist the poltse
in every way in cleaning up the East Side. In
thia work I have been very much assisted by
the Rev, Billy Leonard of the Bowery, who, on
account of his friendship with the chiefs of the
Sullivan family, has suceeeded in enlisting the
Sullivans in the work of reform, I beg to an-
nounee, also, that the Hon, Pat Farley is with
us inthis glorious work. Julius Harburger has
now introduce his bill to repeal the Raines

law. At first I was much against him, but so

any appeals have been made tometo indorse
Darburaer's proposition to allow the sale of
beer on Sundays that I have given in.

‘Fellow citizeus, we all of ue know what a
blight has been thrown over this district since
it has been impossible for us to buy a giass of
beer on a Sunday, Dr, Parkhurst shows what
a sincere mon heis when he goesto Albany

and joins hands with Mr, Harburger in a
movement toallow the poor inmates in the
tenements to get a glass of beer on the
only day of recreation they) have in
the week, The Rev. Billy Leonard
told me yesterday that he felt that
@ great injustice was being done when
scores of Germans Were turned away from

the saloons of the Sullivans on Sundays
Mr. Leonard, as the spiritual adviser of the
Hon. Florrie Sullivan, Denny Sullivan, Paddy
Sullivan and Larry. Mulligan, thelr step-
brother, believes with Dr. Parkhursi that there
are certain hours on a Sunday when a poor
man ought to beable to buy a «lass of beer,
He is opposed, however, to the sale of sptrit-
uous liquors on Sundays, andall of the Sulli-

van family agree that during chureh hours
the sale of all kinds of liquors should be
ped,
ow,” continued President Cohen, “I de.

 

sire to introduce to you the following resolu-
tions:

Wh rear, The Hon. Julius Harburgerand tie Rew
Dr. Parkhurst }ave gone to Allany to furh r the
interest» of 4 bill to allow thirsty people on the Fust
Bide to buy beer on Sunday, and

Whereas, Owing to the operations of the Raines

 

law, 80 wisely administered by Chief of Police
Devery, itis iinpos-ible for a person to buy lass
of beer in New York on the Sabbath day, be it

Kesoived, Thatthe members of the Martn Fngel
Association heartily approve of the mensure and

to De Parkhurst and Aasembirman
Harburger int efforta to enable @ poor man to
buy beer in New York on Sundays

Rasolred, That @ copy of these rea
to Dr. Parkhurst to-morrow,

“Hurrah for Dr. Parkhurst and Julins Har-
burger,” shouted the crowd. The resolutions
were unanimously adopted, and the sponsors
of the bill were cheered with a will, After-
ward, Cohen read this letter from Rosey, the
Lawyer:

Deak Conex—How arethe boys in Allen street?
We are having @ great time in Hot Springs. We

chiefs of police out here. They stay with us all the
time, We are head of the gam:

We are living on velvet, Wedon’t play roulette or
faro, We don't want to buck up against a fly dealer,
We play straight poker, There is no mechanism
about our play. We simply go into a room with

We have et some s ft marks hereand we are all

for our health, Most people come here for that pur-
pose. Weare different cattle. Yours truly, Rosey

At the meeti ne of the ostracized set, Fiddles

Finkelstein, acting leader in the absence of
Long Keaeh Reagan, said:
“Boys, we have been trun down, A young

REAL ESTATE NEWS,

 

| The aotivity of tho rea) estate market during
the past week centred In Investment transac-
tions involving the exchange of several im-
proved properties for properties cf such a
charactor that the purchasers of them will in
all probability remodel or rebuild them en-
tirely. Only one transaction of any importance
is excluded from this Presumption, Outside
of the fact that the investment feature was dis-
cernible in the week's business, it Is also note-
worthy thatthe properties which formed the
basis of these investments were located on the
important atreeta of the elty; Broadway props
erty was Involvedtwice and Twenty-third and
Nineteenth street properties once each,

These deals wero in business property
atrictly, but the week was not without sales of
other kinds, Fifth avenue realty appeared in
the list of transactions through the sale of the
Arnold catate lots near Righty-third street and
the reported sales of a full lot near Ninety-
first street and one more plot of the old Asy-
lum property, off Fifth avenue. Two
other salesof vacant lota were reported: the
southeast corner of Broadway and Ninety-see-
ond street and the southeast corner of Morn-
ingside avenue and 110th street,

The sales of dwellings included No, 23 East
Sixty-ninth street; No. 14 Weot Fiftieth street;

No, 252 West Seventy-first street; No, 320

West lu7th street; the new dwelling on the

northeast corner of Riverside Drive and LObth

street, and the northwest corner of Park
avenue and Sixty-first street,

ly far the moat interesting itema of the week
were those affecting the Broadway, Twenty-
third and Nineteenth streetssales, The twelve-
story store and loft building, Nos, 632 and 634
Broadway, built by Henry Corn, were ex.
changed by him with A. D, Juilliard for the aix
and one-half lots on Eighteenth and Nineteenth
streets, adjoining the Siegel-Cooper building,
Mr. Corn, who is well-known as a builder, will
improve these lots, now occupled by old build
ings, witha twelve-story store and loft build-
ing. The permanent disposition of the north-
east corner of Broadway and Twenty-sixth
street, the second Broadway sale of the week,
isnot known as yet, nor has the purchaser's
name been made public. The property abuts
the Victory Hotel on the north, and has been
known as the Victoriaannex. The price of this
property was reported as $400,000,

The Twenty-third street property sold was
the three-story fron-front building, Nos. 4 and
6 East, which were owned by John F, Loubat.
Together with No, 7 East Twenty-second
street, this sule is said to have been made for
about $400,000, No statement of the use to
which the properties will be put has been
made by the brokers.

On Last Nineteenth street John F, Scannell
sold his eight-story mercantile building, No.
30, and took in part payment a parcel of
Brooklyn property.

These sales are worth mentionin gin detail
not only because of their lotrinsie value but
because they tend to prove that the investor
is awain present inthe realty market, Whether
other investors will follow the example set
them last week is of course a question, but cer-

{ tainly conditions were never more favorable
than now. The opinion of a correspondent in
the current number of the Record and Guide
is worth quoting on this point, Here it is in
