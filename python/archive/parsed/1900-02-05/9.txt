half price. Why?

Makers of waists and skirts long ago found out that they lost much in time and scraps
by working the usual narrow silks. After a while their demands were heeded and certain mills
give them goods twenty-seven to fifty-four inches wide. Look at a ready-made silk petticoat
and see how far apart the seams are. Well, New York came very near having a silk store to
supply wide silks—so near that the looms were set a-going and this stock was produced, Whi:
the silks went forward, the plan went backward—and in the height of silk prosperity a certain
great mill was sick with trade dyspepsia. The pepsin of quick-selling was the one relief. You

get the silks at about half.

We don’t want your money without your good will, This is a direct statement to you,

reader; you, as if of all New York, you alone were to read it.
Won’t you think over the reasons that govern this February Trade Sale? We haven’t

asked you to buy—we shall not ask you. It seems enough to state the facts. Selling is vastly
greater than ever—there is such general appreciation of the economies.

Why is furniture cheap? What has February to do with it?

If we deliberately maintained certain prices in January and reduced them in February,
it would simply and clearly prove that we charged too much in the first place, February
hasn't a thing to do with it.

But February is a naturally dull month, when stores discharge clerks and when delivery
teains stand in the stable and ‘‘eat their heads off.’ We can make two abnormally busy
furniture times in a year—we simply divert these special efforts to the otherwise dull Februarys
and Augusts. It keeps us busier and equalizes expenses. We can afford to lessen even our
usual profits to help trade along. The furniture comes in three ways—

The New Embroideries—And a Bargain

You'll relish the show of new embroideries all the more when you know
that the prices are as low as last year’s. We managed that solely through the
embroidery chief’s happening to be abroad in the nick of time to give big orders.

St. Gall’s prettiest—edgings, insertions, all-overs and plaitings.

The Bargain is a 16,000-yard Lot

of edgings and insertions that are for all the world like the embroideries one
sees at 50c, 75c, $1 and even $1,50 a yard,

These are 8c, 125¢ and I5¢ a yard

No; not all of them—for there are some in matched sets that we'll sell at

uits willing that the store be
judged by these new Tailored Cos-
tumes at $41. Two styles—

This one is of gray broadcloth, with jaunty
bolero jacket that calls for only one button,
which is of antique pearl. But the charm
is the tailoring—the jacket is moulded into
exquisite shape—and that shapeliness must
stay, for it is sewed and kneaded into it.

The other is of camel's-hair suiting—made
with Eton jacket; the skirt with a newly-
planned plait—a width of the fabric sloped
toward the waist, showing a flat fold on
either side, penemeing like the flap of a

Yet right at the start of the season we commence a Trade Sale of new, fine, popular

—at least, the prices average half; a little above, here and there; as much under half in
of honor to the new comers—the Rotunda and the aisles approach-

There is nothing sensational about this sale, except the central fact, that silks you’d
ick from a city-ful are here in ample quantity and in all the wanted colorings, at about

These Are Very Wide Silks

Very many of these goods are in the charming tiny checks and stripes that Fashion favors
for spring; some have side bands almost like wide ribbon, which serve as trimming—some-
