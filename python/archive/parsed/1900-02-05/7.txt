AN EARLY MINING SEASON,

MILD WINTER IN THE WEST WILL
BENEFIT MINERS,

New York Capitalists Interested in the In-
vestigation of Gold and Copper Mines
on Prince of Wales Island, Alaska

Leadville District's Gain in Production,

SravtTie, Wash, Jan. 2t—-During the past
week a steamer was chartered by Charles
Lane and others to investigate for themaelves
and New York capitalists a group of forty «old
and copper mines on Prince of Walesa Island,
These properties have been located within the
past year and are giving such promise that a
capitalization of $10,000,000 has been deter.
mined upon. The present trip is to confirm
the reports that have been made by members
of the present syndicate and experis who ex-
amined the property in the early stages of de
volopment, Itisthe purpose of the owners to
construet reduction plants, build sawmills
and start a lively mining camp if the flattering
reports that have been made are confirmed.

‘To-day the Treadwell Company paid its
forty-third dividend of 374% cents per share
amounting to $75,000, Tho Alaska»Mexican
Company paid its twenty-first dividend of 10
cents per abare, amounting to $14,000, This
is all from ore that assays from $1.75 to $2.50
per ton gold, and it is such a steady proposition
that the stamps will probably crop steadily for
the next half century.

A company has been organized for the pur-
pose of mining coal at Tyonic, where the crop-
pings come to the surface along the beach, and
a great deal of float voal is found along the
shore in pieces from 50 to S00 pounds in
weight, Small steamers plying along the coast
use it for steaming purposes and pronounce it
but little inferior to that of Washington and
British Columbia. The veins exposed along
the coast are from six to ten feet wide, and it
isthe purpose of the company toopen upthe
seams, erect bunkers and wharves, where thay
van handle the coal cheaply and expeditiously,
enabling them to supply the Yukon and Nome
steamers at a price not exceeding $10 per ton
aboard vessels, A thousand acres have been
located at one point, where safe harbor is se-
cured and where fresh water is abundant,
This promises to be one of the beat paying en-
terprises in Alaska, provided the company can
avail itself of this season’a Nome business,

A number of the placer mines in Cook Inlet
are being consolidated with @ view of organiz-
ing hydraulic companies and working the
claims on a larger and more economical scale
Several companies have been organized
yecentiy on Six-Mila and other gold streams
above Sunset. Between two and three hun-
dred men have remained in the district this
winter, and have done fairly well.

 

 

 

WASHINGTON

Searree, Jan, 2.-The Jersey syndicate
holding a boad on the Eagle group of seven
claims !n Similikameen district, threw up the
bond after expending several thousand dollars
in driving cross-cut tunnels on @ very promis-
ng outerop of great width, The
owners intend to take up the work where tho
Jersevmen left off,

The Brewsterciaim, in Methow district. was
sold last week to Eastern men for $30,000, It
shows a continuous vein the whole length of

| the property, and the value in wold is high. In

one place the owners have drifted over one
feet in and the mine will
take position ainong the frat shippers of the
district this s@ason

Interest is reviving inthe hematite ores of the
Olympic Mountains, located about 38O miles
weatofSeattin. The veins are from 30 to

wide and are traceable for several
The prive of pig iron in
northwest is stimulating fresh
investigation that mag lead to the construction
ot furnaces on tide water near Seattle. Itis
estimated that thisore can be reduced at an
expense of S10 perton, with eoke and fuel ar
Pig is worth, $26 to $30
per ton at the present time

HEETISH COLUMBIA

SFATILY, Wash, Jan, 2--Lardeau district,
now provided with railroad facilittes, is forging
ahead rapidly, its rich eilver-lead ores tnding
aready market at prevaillne high prices. A
great deal of property inthe district is under
bond to Americans and Canadians, and much
of it will change hands this spring.

The shipments of ore from the mines of
Rossiand during the past week amounted to

in order to avoid confusion inthe lobby only
about thirty persons were admitted ata time,

son told him he wou'd have to wait his turn,
Mr. Everitt explained that he was a member of
the New England Society anda director of the
company owning the building, but Patterson
paid no attention to him. Thea Mr. Everitt
reached over the heads of the peop e
and poked Patterson in the ribs with his
eane to attract his attention. — Patter-
son made a remark at this which en-
raged Mr, Everitt, and the latter forced his way
through the erowd and, it is said, struck the
policaman with his fist. At this Patrersou

willing to prefer, He wanted to make acharge
of disorderly conduct, but the Judge declined
to entertain it, and so Mr. Everitt lett the
