That Has Convened Since Chriet's Ascension,

The Ecurnemtcn) Conference, which began on
Baturday, hasetirred up the religious people of
New York mare, probably, than they have ever
been stirred before. There were fourteen
meetings held-yesterday, nine of them at the
same bour. Ali of them were held In large
churches and every meeting-place was
crowded. Two meetings were held in Carnegie
Music Hall, whieh, with the exception of the
Madison Square Garden, is the biggest meeting -
place in New York city, Great crowds gathered
at both of these meetings and bundreds who
applied for admisston had to be turned away.

At the evening seasion the crowd that got into
the building wasso great that officials of the
Fire Department conmiained of the danger of
overcrowding, and so huiny were turned away
from that meeting even before the complaints
were made, that it was necessary to open the
Calvary Baptist Church and give the people a
chance to hold an overflow meeting, which they
did without the assistance of any of the ofMleials
of the Conference,

It was remarked that on Saturday night when
President MeKinley, former President Harrison
and Goy. Roosevelt were advertised to attend
the meeting and make speeches it was to be fn the afternoon the delegates
expected that wherever the nieeting was held 7 OF mission fields" The

The Rev. Dr. Julius Soper told about the at-
tempts of the missionaries to get through the
Japanese Diet legislation favorable to the
spread of Christianity. “The Japanese Gov-
ernment,” eaid he, “wants to put Chriatianity
on the same footing wifh Shintotsm and Bud-

dueed iu the Diet last year. The Shinto priests
atonee set about to defeat it and they a
plished their purpose, but it cost them $100 000

Che Rev. Dr. Hepburn, “father of Christian
milssious in Japan,” recelved an ovation when
he arose, the Japanese in the audience greeting
him {fn their native tongue. Whenhe could be
heard, Dr. Hepburn eald: “Itis true, my friends,
that I took the Gospel of Christ to Japan. When
I went there, there was not a Christian In all

Mr. Speer's address was liberally applauded
throughout, and at its conclusion the meeting
came to an end with the singing of the dox

hall and talked over the work in various parts

rhe Rey. Augustus H Strong was introduced |
as the first s of the conference and his
subject was “The Anthority and Purpose of
Foreign Missions’ The authority for foreign
missions, he declared, \ as the teaching of Jesus
Christ. Christ was- (he original tis-
sionary andit was his direct commaud to his
disciples to go forth into the world and preach
the Gospel to all men. Thesiugle word go" waa
ali that was neededin the way of authority, for it
wasa command, ‘'boreign missions,” he said,
“are Christ's method of publishing God's re-
and so of reestablishing God's
authority over an apostate and revolled
humanity. Without an uttered command from
Christ they would have claims upon us, for they
are founded in right reason and in the best {n-
gtinets of our nature But that uttered com-
mand has been added and to-day I derive the
authority for foreign missions from Christ's
express direction ‘The authority for
foreign missions is the a\thority of
Christ's example The authority for foreign
missions is the authority of Christ's character,

the authority of Christ's work, of bis love and

should nof be asked to zive up their feast days

FVENING MEETINGS,

Three Great Buildings Crowded With Im-
mense Gatherings of People,

Carnegie Hall was packed again at the even-
{ng session of the Conference, During the
afternoon standards bearing the nanies
of the different seetions of the world
from which the missionaries came were
put up in the hall and the delegates
from those places were supposed to ait near
their standards The atandards were
similar to those used at political conventions,
and the big hall had every appearance of a con-
vention hall The presence of the standards
eerved to reserve the seats about them until
just before the time for the meeting to begin
Then somebody starteda rish from the back of
the halland men and women serambled down
the aisle and seized the seats

Ifthe truth muetbetold there wore thes dur-
ing the scrarsble when there seemed a lack of
Christian spirit, At & o’clock the hall was so
crowded thatthe officials of the Fire Depart-
ment complained, and it’ was said that they
eent word tothe managenent that some of the
people must be sent out. Contrary to the rules
of the Fire Department, which are always
etrictly enforced in New York, there were
chairs placedin one or two of the aisles, not
with the consent of the managers at all, but by
persons who probably didn't know the law, and
{f they did, thought more of getting a seat
than of respecting it

The meeting was called to order by Dr.
McFwen, who introduced President A.V. V
Raymond of Union College as the presiding
officer. President Raymond eal'!ed on the Rey
Dr KR. J.Willingham of Richmond, Va, to make
aprayer. Dr. Willingham’s effort was of the
old-fashioned sort that includes a blessing for
everything on the earth and over and under the
earth. He prayed for each nation by name, he
prayed for the Leads of all the educational in-
stitutions, for all the preachers there and all
the missionaries and all the civilized avd un-
civilized peoples of the world. He prayed for
the editors and the reporters and for the re
generated and the unregenerated

The first speaker was Mr. Eugene Stock of
London, Editorial Secretary of the Chureh
Mission Society. Hehad been assigned to de-
liver a paper reviewlug tuissionary work for
the century, and he had to do it
{fn half an hour The paper was
chiefly statistical and started in with a
description of the missionaries and the nila-
sionary societies that esisted in the first year
of the century and concluded with a review of
the missionary societies and the missionaries
that are at work ali over the world at the pres-
enttime, It showed that the chief development
of missions had been eince 1850, Of the forces
that had been the weightiest io the advance of
nifssionary work, Lhe spoke of Dwight L. Moody,
of the Cambridge Seven that went to China

some years ago, of the student volunteer move-
ment and the medicalimisston, They were all
loudly applauded

Mr Stock was followed by Dr. A Schreiber, |
one of the German delegates. Dr. Schreiber is

observed Dr. Halsey, after waiting In vain for
his words to have some effect upon the crowd,
his morning we turned a thousand 'people
uway from Carnegie Hall; this evening they
are turning more away from there, and here
we ean't find room for nearly all of you. An¢

When it was found that there was bo moving
the bulk of the supertluous erowd away from
he church aaecond meeting was started in the
chapel and the speakers of the evening took
'" rn peaking in the chapel and in the main
wuditoriimn .

Atera prayer and the reading of the Serip-
tures wud’ byun, Dr. Halsey introduced Dr
Arthor (. Plersou,who took as us cubject, "The
Superintending Providence of God in Foreign
Missions During the Century.” He saids

‘The chureles could never baye attempted

"Tn foreign mission work this century is the
century of organigauon. We have now between
800 und soo major and minor societies working
inthe teld of foreign missions. There have
been three magnificent additions to the army
the med nission which has accom lished
more than any otherageney in history for the
tdvanoe of the cause, the women's inussion, that
Wondertul Epiphany of woman, extending her

lands, andthe voung people's movement, the
Young Men’s Christan Associations and the
Young Women’s Clirisuan Associations and the
Christin Endeavor Societies which in rapidity
of growth have eclipsed all other organiza-
tiona "'

Mr. Merson referred to the opportunities
afforded the mission work by the opening doors
in the Orlent and concluded by saying that the
effect of foreign missions on home missions was
not that of exhaustion but of fermentation

R. Wardlaw Thompson, Secretary of the Lon-
don Misglonary Soclety, was next introduced
ana said

The Rev. J Hudson Taylor next spoke about
the growth of missionsin China, and he told of

When it became apparent that the crowds at

that many of the peonle would have to do ther

West Filty-seventh street, a few stepa fron the
hall, andthe Ceutral Church = Shoertiy after the
main meetings were in progress the arrange-

Warner’s Safe Cure is a fine remedy for building up
a broken down system, and I know personally of several
cases of kidney and liver troubles which were permanently
cured through its use. In fact I know of nothing which
equals it and am glad to speak a good word for it.

lodged with the (hinese Government than with
any other country, but although the Dowager

Ermpress has ulways abjectly fApologized forthe

and the punishment of the offenders the rev-
ords show few cnses of the fulfilment of these
promises All the Deparwnen) can do, hows
ever, is formally to protest against such treite
ment of citizens of this country.

“Japan gives little trouble to the Christian
missionaries. I don't euppose there have been
two dozen protests from missionaries in that
kingdom during the past year, while China ture
nixhed close on to three hundred euch cases,
The protests from Japan are usually based on
more substantial causes Uhan those from China,
whore afew excited Chinks in some suburban
community cause an attack of hysterics almost
without knowing it, In Japan the natives are
not so ignorant and hence do not make demon-
strations against the Christians. Kesides, there
are not so many misslonaries in Japan as there
are jn China

"Siam recently furnished a very queer pro-
test. It seems that ina little village on the oute
skirts of Bangkok the Rev Mr, Perley of San
Francisco had established a mission and waa
spreading Cliristianity. One of the water bul-
Jocks, in common use in Siam, roamed into his
little mission meeting house one afternoon
there ure no. substantial doors to keey
out intruders—and while posing | aroun:
not only — overturned) a number of
benches of a frail character and
smashed them but also knocked a sinall statue
of the Madonna from astand and broke {tino
smithereens The entire damage was not more
than $io0in American money, but the mission-
ary considered the loss of the Madonna al-
miost {rreparable. Why he should do sol Gon 5

retend to know, but he requested the Unite

tates Consul at Singapore to report the mafter
| to the State Department, claiming that the po-
lice protection afforded him was Inadequat
nd that the accident would not havehappened
nad the distriot been properly eared for. The
Consul very properly refused to make such a
trivia, matter ie subject of correspondence
half way round the world and back again, and
eo the Rev Mr. Perley wrote out not only tis
own grievance but also charges against the
| United States Consul, a very competent ofi-
cial, who knows what he is about,

“Itimay be news to many people to know
that there area number of missionaries, mostiv
Catholics, in Chili, and that they have hard
times very frequentty. A Catholie church in
Valparaiso, oMiciated over by an American
priest, sent from the Catholie University in
this ty, was recently robbed of three of tha
siutions of the erose, inelosed in richly orna-
mented frames. The theft was unquestionably
committed by sneak thieves, and the Chilau
Government was inno way responsible, yet a
protest was fled with the United States Cons),
