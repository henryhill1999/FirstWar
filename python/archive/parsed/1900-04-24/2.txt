BIG MUSTER OF WORKING GIRLS
Hears About Mutual Helpfulness, Ideals and
Woman's Work~-Two Lone Men There.

The sixteenth annual meeting of the New
York Association of Working Girls’ Societies
was held last nightin Lenox Lyceum. About
two thousand young women and exactly two
tien, besides the nale speakera,were in the hall.
One of the men was the husband of one of the
Women speakers and he sat near the platform,
where his wife could keep her eye on him,
When the other man walked in and saw noth
ing but rows upon rows of spring bonnets and
spring gowns, he hopped into the firat seat
he saw and looked neither to the right nor
left That he might feel more at home, all
of the gir around him giggled, and one of
them remarked

“That man has a nerve, if he isn't the hus-
band of somebody here *

“After a mixed chorus, under a female leader,
bad sung “My Country "Tisof Thee," Misa
Girace Dodge read the secretary's report. This
was followed by a report from Miss CC. Wil
kinson, secretary of the National League of
Women Workers. Then Miss Virginia Potter,
President of the association introduced the
Rev Father Doyleto talk on “The Pursuit of
Ideals" Father Doyle got just aa whoo ing a
reception as 2,000 young Women could give
him the two men refrained from doing anv-
thing that would make them: more conspicuous
than they were and he acknowledged the re-
ception by saving that he felt highly honored
by having been invited to talk to such an
audience ;

Father Dovle didn't appear to be suffering
fromatage fright fle told the girls what a fine
thing it Was to associate together for their own
and one another's good, and then Mrs Fred-
eriek Nathan was introduced as the Vresident
of the New York branch of the Consumers’
League She talked about “How Bustness
Women Can Help Bach Other” Mrs Nathan
told abont the work her organization Is doing
andssid that working Women could help eaeh
other in one way by buying factorv-made gar-
ments rather than garments made in sweate
)
shops

Mrs. Nathan brought down the house by tell-
ing the rls that, if they didn't believe
that factorysnade goods were just aa
cheap ua those made ina sweatshop, she wanted
toremind them as proof of the truth of her
statement, that it was possible to buy factorys
made night dresses for a9 cents. When she sat
down, Miss Potter remarked -

“Tt think We might tear the practical value of
Mrs. Nathan's remarks by trying, on our next
shopping day, to find some of those 40-cent
nightgowns. [If you can't find them at one
pluce, keep trying, and when you find them
don't buy them.’ eM

“That's nasty, but practical,
girlin the audience

The Rev Leighton, Williams talked about
“Woman's Work and Woman's Place in the
Social Commonwealth, a subject, he said,
which took in all creation and was chosen by
his wife. “The Columbia Labor Song’ was
ang attheconclusionof Mr Williams's talk and
then the women hob-nobbed and talked to one
another abc evervthjng but shop for an hour
or more) The hall wa& cleared of everybody

FIVE TAMMANY TRAINS

 

 

 

May Go to Kansas City Instead of Two- Money
Saved on State Convention,
Tammany tall will save alump of money
through the holding of the State convention
here in this city, and it wassaid yesterday that
this tuoney would be spent in increasing the
number of the delegation that will attend the
Kansas City Convention. When the leaders met

on April @, It was not known where the
State Convention would be held, and it
wus decided that two trainiloads of root-
ers, in all about three hundred and fifty

as large & representation
could afford to have
that 600° or 700

shouters, would be
as the wigwarm
Now it is ON pee ted

braves willgo along — Instead of two special
trains there will be four, and possibly five
These trains will leave this citv on Suuday, July
1 They ought to get into Kansas City on Mon-
day night or Tuesday torning the running
tine being reekoned at forty hours. Senator
Plunkitt is trying to arrange a meal schedule
Which will bring the train to Albany for dinner
and to Rochester for supper Dining cars will
be hitehed on at Buffalo and in them the pil-
grins will eat for the rest ol the trip

Tammany headquarters at Kansas City: wil
beat the Midland Hotel, where the Hon James
W. Boyle tins hired 0 rooms Tt Was planned
that each room should wecommodate two per-
sons at least and some three With the
increased delegation it will be necessary
to double the braves up again, putting

BROOKLYN WOMAN NEARLY MUR-
DERED IN HER OWN HOME,

Stranger, Who Said He Wanted to Buy the
House, Felled Her With a Whetstone
Wrapped in Two Stockings -Five Wounds
on Her Head and Her Right Hand Broken,

Mrs Jennie Warwanz was murderously as-
fauited at her home in the two-story frame
building at 10 Adelphi street, Brooklyn, last
Friday morning, but the police suppressed ail
news of the occurrence and the faeta only
leaked out yesterday Mrs Wargauz was alone
in the house when the attack took place, her
husband, Julius Warganz, who isa clerk, being
downtown at business, the two older children
at school, and Madalaine, 4 years old, playing
with some other children on the sidewalk = ‘The
house, which is owned by Mr.) Warganz, is for
sale and a notice to that effeet is lung in the
front

About 9:30 0'clock a man about 30 years old
rang the bell and Mrs. Warganz responded
He said that he had called to look at the house
and was admitted. After looking around the
parlor floor he remarked) “IT think the house
will justsuitme. IT would like to have a look at
the cellar’ Mrs. Warganz then opened the
cellar door and the stranger asked her to go
down first, but somehow her suspicion had be-
come aroused, and she declined, saying that she
would remain where she was until heexamiued
the cellar, Heremainedin the cellar three or
four minutes and on bis return asked the
woman to show him the second floor, She went
up stairs ahead of him and had just entered the
front room When she was struck on the Lead
trom behind and rendered unconscious. From
the nature of the wounds, she must have been
struck several times

Noone saw the stranger leave the house and
an hour elapsed before Mra Worgang regained
consciousness and was able to creep down stairs
and open the front door The neighbors found
her on her bands and knees on the stoop,
with her face and head covered with blood
She was carried into the house and Dro Martin
Amidor of 187 Park avenue summoned The
doctor found that she was suffering from. five
severe on wounds, mout over the right eve
and a broken right hand =  Vhe injuries had
been inflicted with a round whetstone, wrapped
in tWo stockings, Which were found in the room
in Which the assault took place Nothing in the
house was disturbed, showing that robbery was
hot the motive, and Mrs Wargang says that the

MAYON IN ERUPTION,

Col, Howe's Description of Oar Philippine

Volcano,
Among our few wide awake volcanoes inAlaska,
Hawaiian islands and the Piilippines, the most

Lioposing and one of the largest ia Mayon, in
tue southern part of Luzon, about 200 miles
from Manila, whieh had another outburst of

actlvity on March J, after several years of coin-
parative quiescence Mayon is an alinost per-
lect cone and one of the mostsy mmetrical moube
tains in the world, On all sideg, it slopes gently
from the culninating point, about 0,000 feet
above the sea, and its base covers an area of
elg@hty square Von Deasche in isi76
and Jagor at an earlier date reached the sum-
mit, but neither of them found any trace of a
erater properly so called

Jn his report of the eruption last month,
Col, Howe says that large streams of lava were
seen at night flowing down the mountain. It
is possible that the glare of the red hot masses
in the night made the lava streagus appear much
lurger than they really were or it may be that
Mayon has departed trom its hitherto consistent
record of ejecting very lite lava during its
frequent eruptions. Col. Howe also says that
@ thin eloud of ashes constantly fell, Jt is for
the prodigious quantity of ashes ejected that
the eruptions of Mayan have been chiefly noted,
Sometimes this ejected matter is carried away
on the winds as far as Manila, whose streets
were covered with it in the famous outburst of
isi4, and hamlets near the mountain have Veen
completely burled under these outpourings.

Col, Howe's report depicts a voicano under
its terriic aspects. The column of smoke
rising several miles above the summit, the
stones thrown high into the air, the bright day

darkened by the pall of sigoke and ashes, the
earth movements that shook the houses at
Legaspi, elght tulles away, the leugthening

 

red streaks of lava on the mountain slopes and

 

the rumbling aad roaring produced) by the
volcan orees, all contmbuted to the appalling
» e. But the disusters Mayon has caused
have been insigniiicant in comparison with

those due to some other volcanoes in the Ma-
fayan Archipelago, and not many of the Philip-
pine islauders Lave th their helgnborhood such
