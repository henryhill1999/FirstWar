STEFI COMPANY
JOLIET ROD MILL

“AGAIN,

ILLINOIS
DOWN THE

Because the Steel and Wire Company Asked
for a Delay of Deliveries Only Temporary
~Federal Stect Expected to Have a Say to
Future in the Steel and Wire Board,

Developments in the steel and fron situation
yesterday included the announcement of the
closing down of the rod mill of the Hingis Steel
Company at Joliet, Tl, Indications that, as a
result of the rediction in the price of wire nails
ordered by the Ameri¢an Steel and Wire Com-
party, the eut nail manufacturers are likely to
reduce prices; and an admission that the wire
company {8 contemplating an advancnin the
price of ita export products ‘This admission
was made by the sales agent of the conpany
Despatches from Pittsburg report that the
manufacturers of cut nails will meet in that
city to-day and discuss a@ reduction in prices
in order tocompete with the wire companies

The closing down of the Ilinois Steel Com-
pany 's rod mill throws between 600 and 700 men
outof work. KE. H Gary, President of the Ped-
eral Stee) Company, said of it

“The Mlinois Stee] Company, one of the con-
stituent companies of the Federal Steel Com-
pany, haa a rod mill at Joliet which has a
capacity of about two hundred thousand to
ayear The American Stee! and Wire Com
need and have been using in their wire mills
at Joliet,substantially the total outputo! these
rods produced by the steel company, The
wire company purehased 100,000 tons of
rods to be used during the tiret six

months of 1900, and have taken about sixty
thousandtons of the same, but have asked a
temporary eessation o! deliveries as to the buls
ance” For this reason, the steel company, has
goes to temporat ly close the rod mill at
oliet, having received positive assurances froin
the wire company ‘that the delay will not he
long continued and that all of the rods eon-
tracted for will be taken within a. very sh rt
time. The Winois Steel Company also las mills

t Milwaukee, Wis at North Chicago, at

Vest Chiengo and at South Chieago, The
total tonnaye of steal produced by the constit-
vent conipanies of the Federal Steel Con ipany
amounts to over two milion tonsa
from which it will be seen the tonnage produc ed
by the Joliet mills ix smail in comparison with
the whole.’

John W. Gates, chairman of the American
Ateel and Wire Board, who spent Sunday ar the
Westchester Country Club, where he played
golf, was at the office of the wire company yes
terday afternoon. A published report to the
effect that he was going to resign the chair-
manship and tha: he was in poor health and
expected to wo to r urope soon atter the
directors’ meeting on May 7 was sentin to

THE SUN,

LONG ISLAND R. R. STOCK UP |

UPON THE MAYOR'S SIGNING rue |
BRONX-QUEENS BRIDGE BILL,

Reports Revived and Fiatly Denied Again
That New York Central Has Obtained
Control of the Other Road-Bridge Pur-
Ports to Re a Wholly Independent Scheme,

Mayor Van Wyck approved yesterday the
bill which permits the New York Connecting
Railroad Company to build an elevated rail-
foad structure and a bridge over the East
River from a point in the borough of The Bronx
to Bushwick Junetion in Queens, Apparently,
as a result of this, Long Island Railroad stock
went up 4 or 9 points, and the reports that the
New York Central had acquired control of
the toad were revived

The proposed railroad bridge will pass over
Randall's and Ward's islanda and Hell Gate,
and will be 185 feet above high tide. The ob-
ject of the company, of which Oliver W. Barnes
is the President, is to bring Long Island into
direct railroad communication with the New
England States and the West by way of the
New Haven and New York Central railroads.
The company proposes to build a doubletrack
eteel and iron viaduct, beginning at the Port
Morris branch of the New Haven Railroad,
near St. Mary's Park. Besides steam, freight
and passenger trains, electrio cars will also
traverse the bridge. The officers of the com-
pany say that it is to be an independent con-
cern, carrying the cars of all companies with-
out discrimination, The estimated cost of
the structure is $5,500 000, Its estimated time

'The Mayor signed the bill after a hearing on
it, at which President Barnes, John MeDonald,
counse) to the company and Alfred P, Boller,
its chief engineer, appeared

The rumors that the \ auderbilts had bought
ee Long Island road were circulated last week

nd denied by both President Callaway of the
Tee York Central and President Baldwin of
the Long Island, Onthepre er
bill through the State Legisiature
were made by

essofthe bridge
statenerts
some of the supporters, from
time to time, that the New York Central peo-
ple were interested in it. No authorized re-
presentative of the New York Central,however,
appeared to @peak for it. So far as the records
show,the New York Connecting Railroad is aa
independent enterprise

After a meeting of the Reecutive Committee
of the Long Island Railroad yesterday afternoon
President Baldwin declared with positiveness
that the Long Island company had no interest
in the Conneeting railroad, knew absolutely
nothing about its plans. and had never entered
into negotiations with ite projectors

As farasthe rumors that the Vanderhil's
ot the New York Central has acquired, or is
about to acquire, control of the Long Island
Railroad,” continued Mr. Baldwin, “I can say
that here is absolutely hinthem. There
has noteven been anv talk of_traffle relations
between our road and the New York Central.”

The Long [sland Railroad Executlve Come-
mittee yesterday eonsidered matters relating
to the growth and future development of Us
company 8 passenger businese President
Baldwin aubmitted a chart covering a period
year

notrna

of several vears which showed that last
the spring and fall passenger trafe increased
materially. This increase, he asserted, was
due to the fact that the New York people who
have homes on Long Island leave their city
homes much earlier in the spring and return to
later in the fall than formerly, This
makes a great dilference in the shipments of
freight and

SCHOOL OF MARINE ENGINEERING,

New Department at the University—More Hall
of Fame Jadges.

The New York University Executive Commit-
tee met yesterday afternoon at the office of
William F. Havemever, 82 Nassau street, and
decided to add a new department to the School
of Applied Science, to be known as the depart-
ment of marine engineering. Mechanical,
chemical and civil engineering have already
adepartment each. The new department will
be especially well situated for the practical
study of marine engineering, for there Is an
{mportant shipbuilding industry just below
Univerelty Heights at Morris Dock, where
several torpedo boats are now building for the
United States Government, and the Webb Ship
Building Academy is a short distance to tle
north. The head of the new departinent will
bo Prof. C. C. Thomas, who has been the chief
engineer of the Globe Iron Works in Cleveland,
until recently, and is now designing the torpedo
boat destroyers which are to be constructed
for the navy by the Maryland Steel Company

FRANK TILFORD,
GEORGE R. SHELDON,
A. R. PIC Kk,

To the Stockholders of the

Consolidated Rubber Tire
Company:

In order to prevent the alarm that might other-
wise result from the extraordinary advertisement
appearing above the names of Frank Tilford,
George R. Sheldon, and A. R. Pick, Protective
Committee, I deem tt Incumbent on me to say that
the financial condition of the Company Is sound,
its eredit excellent, and its business prosperous,
If the above-named gentlemen had given themaclves
the slight trouble of presenting to me their request
for Information concerning the matters about which
they are apparently so eager tu Inform themvelves,
before taking an action so damaging to the tn-
vesime@ value of your shares and so injurtous to
the business of the Company, I should have been
glad to have furnished it to them.

In this connection {t ts proper for me to say
that when a short time ago | was tendered, on
part of the Board of the Company, the office of
President, I conditioned my acceptance on an ex
amination of the books by the Audit Company of
New York The result of this eaam!nation 1 tn-
tended to embody in my :eport to the stockholders
at the annual meeting on May 7th, where it
properly belongs; under the circumstances, how
ever, I feel it escential to depart from this usual
course, and present the same herewith as follows:

THE AUDIT COMPANY

The Louisville & Nashville Ratlroad Company,

amination of the condition and affairs of theCompany
to be made, which examination disclosed a floating
debton March Sist, 1000, of $1,350,143 68, all of
which ts unsecured; and quick assets, proceeds of
which can be used toward paying same, amounting to
only $198,000

Further, that payments of dividends for many years
have been made out of funds which should have been

| propertly devoted to the maintenance and eatenston of

the property, and that additional expend!tures will be
necessary, which can only be met by a suspension of
dividends.

The examination further shows that the Company
will be unable toresume payments of dividends fora
period of at least five years

Under these circumstances, and In order to relleve
the stockholders of the Nashville, Chattanooga & St.

FINANCIAL AND COMMERCIAL.

Mownbay, April 23

Conflieting views were very distihetly re-
flected in to-day's stock market, At the open-
ing, and, indeed, throughout the forenoon, the
feeling of distrust created by last week's une
savory developments in the management of the
American Steel and Wire Company found ex-
pression in fatrly heavy selling, not only of the
fron and steel stocks, but of rafiway issues
aswell. Theaelling was chiefly by commission
houses and presumably for customers who
hadecome disgusted with their unfortunate
experiences in recently issued securities based
upon the iron industry. London was also &@
factor. The market there for American securt-
ties was lowor and foreign arbitrage houses sold
on balance at least 25,000 shares, This change
in the attitide of London was due tn
part to the untoward developments in
this market and also to the steadily
hardening of discount rates abroad. The
foreign exchange market was affected to an
extent by the selling of stocks by European
speculators, but the underlying cause of the
strength of the exchange market is obviously
the wide and unuaual difference in discount
rates between New York gnd London, That
money flows from one finaficial centre to an-
other in response to the higher interest rate is
as well an established axiom as the fundamen-
ta! principal of hydrostatics,

It is because of thia evident tendenoy at the
present time that European bankers are mak-
ing no efforts to attract gold from this country.
With their knowledce of various governmental
and commercial requirements they perceive
that discount rates abroad are likely to rule at
full figures for some time to come, and that in
due time the difference in rates between the
two continents will result in the
transfer of specie trom New York to
London. In the meantime a consider-
able proportion of the speculative community
gnores this prospect or belittles the probable
effect of the event upon the local money
market. Similar disregard is shown of dimin-
ishing Treasury disbursements on account of
bonds presented for conversion There ia,
doubtless, money enough fn the country to
transact its business, but a decrense in
the supply cannot take place, particu-
larly in the prevent condition of the local
bank reserves, without having rome effect
upon rates of interest. Sight exchange ‘old
aud closed to-day within 44 @ cent a pound of
the rate at which bankers will find it cheapor to
ehip gold than to buy billa to cover their draw-
ings It ispossible that specie may not go out
this week, as the steamship service at the end of
the week is unsatisfactory

It became apparent before the day was half
over on the Stock Exchange that the further
liguidation in the active iron and stoel stocks,
and particularly ingSteel and Wire, waa being
taken advantage o! to cover la ree contraocta on
the short side of the market, This starteda
general covering movement and also induced
some nimble traders to switeh over to
the long side The pool in Missouri
Pacific did effective work in turning the
course of prices and there was some persistent
and extensive buringjof Sugar Refining that
mode the bears !n that stock scramble. An un-
confirmed report that New York Central in-
tereats had secured control of the Long Island
Railroad accompanied a 9 point rise in the
stock of the |ast named company and also
etimulateda lively upward movementin Brook-
lyn Rapid Transit. Other stocks that were
take: hold of with good effect upon prices were
teading first preferred, People’s Gas, Norfvi«
and Western and American Tobaoco,

The final outcome of the trading was matert-
ally higher prices for all of the stocks that have
been enumerated as well as for Federal Steel
and for Steel and Wire Enough others, how-
ever, closed lower to give the list an appearance
of irregularity, Net losses were austained by
Atchison and by Ba'timore and Ohfo isanes, by
New York Central, Pennsylvania, Louisville and
Nashville, St. aul and many of the minor iron
and steel issues The matn motive of the specu-
lation appeared to be to cover shorts on a large
scale, and it looked as if speculative holders of
railway stocks, including London, improved the
opportunity to reduce their ines. The closing
was in the main steady
