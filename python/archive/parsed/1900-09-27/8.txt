BAD DAY FOR FAVORITES:

ONLY ONE PUBLIC CHOICE FIRST TO
THE LINE AT GRAVESEND.

Red Path Captures the Standard Stakes With
Easo for T, Hitcheook, Jr.—Kiner Soores
Over the Hurdies— Autumn Outfoots a
Smart Fleid in the All-Aged Handicap.

The interesting process known to old-time
racegoers as “skinning the lamb” kept the ring
busy at Gravesend track yesterday, It was
almost a complete success from the bookmaker
standpoint, as only one favorite squeezed
through. That did not materialize until the
fifth race, when all but speculators with large
capital or credit had reluctantly decided to
“look on” for the rest of the day

The card provided by the Brooklyn Jockey
Club was up to the highest midweek standard
and the patronage was in proportion, At-
mospherio and track conditions were faultless
and the eport was thoroughly enjoyed

Six useful three-year-olds made up the fleld
for the Standard Stakes, a dash over the short
éix-furlong course. T. D, Sullivan's every day
colt, Hesper, wae considered good enough to
win, He was playod from 2 to 1 to 8 to $ by
the sporting crowd from Dry Dollar's stamping
ground. Gold Or carried the paddock money
and trainers could see nothing else in the race
His Royal Highness as usual had speed to
burn and made a clipping pace for half a mile

 

It set them all dizzy but Red Path, who moved |

up without an effort when Henry called on
him and won easily by two lengths. Hesper's
bulldog gameneas proved inore than a match
for the speed of His Koyal Highness and Sulll-
Van's colt got up in time to take the place

The card led off with the hurdle handicap
three-year-olds and upward at two miles
eight flights. A fleld of seven furnished
neat guessing proposition. Three Bars

over
a

with Finnegan up scared the bookies so much |

that they asked for odds from the start. Long
Isle, Chal enger and the tiumne pair were about
equal second choices The favorite and Chal-
lenger alternated as pacemakers with the othera
close up and all jumping disgracefully. Three
Bars held his own well to the turn for home
but Einer tiptoed the lot in the stretch and
won by four lengths. Long Isle closed fast
from a rear position and beat Challenger a
neck for the place. Three Bars lost a share
of the money by a short head

The handicap for all ages, which led up to

the stake, found the talent again hopelessly
out of line. Belle of Troy and King Barley-
orm were sent to the post equal favorites,

with Jack Point next in demand, The Hildreth
party and trainers geperally thought Autumn
a good investr it at 5 to 1 and their educated

 

 

  
  

 

judgement proved correct age the sturdy Ur
gelding went off in front and stayed there,
winning cleverly by a leneth and @ half from
Jack Point, The latter lowed to the last six
teenth pole, where Odom got him. going in time
to steal up on the railand beat Belle of Troy
a head

Rolling Boer was the general choice in the
selling dash for two-year-olds, but a lot of
money was invested on Pleasant Sail, and
the Bathampton filly brought if home in good
style, although with little to spare. Kolling
Boer, Monad and Cherished came next in order,
at one length intervals. Miss Ilanover turned

 

     

    

 

 

      

into the stretch like an easy winner of the fifth
race, but Annoy came along in grand stvle and
won by a head. The Hildreth gelding was
entered to be sold for ao) and J. F, Sehorr

GRAMME AT WHITE PLAINS.

 

 

Four-in-Hands Make a Good Display on Malf-
Mile Track—Colinette, the Newport Winner,
Overlooked ia Saddle Class—Stubbora Con-
tests in the Harness Races-The Awards.

At the Westchester Fair and Horse Show at
White Plains eyesterday the nclosure on the in-
fleld in front of the grand stand was a con-
etantly shifting scene of heavy and light har-
ness horses, saddlers, jumpers and pony teams,
while the trotters were contesting for purses in
the racing events on the half-mile track. Ten
thousand persons were on the grounds and the
society folk of Westchester county were outin
force,
A splendid class of horses competed for the
ribbons, Inthe class for harness pairs not ex-
ceeding filteen hands the award was well re-
ceived, although it was preity generally be-
lieved that had Miss Marian Holloway’s pair
not been hitched wrong they would have taken
the blue ribbon. They pulled from the pole and
did not show as wellas they might have done.
There was quite a good show in the roadster
class, and it required some time for the judges
) to make the award. They were inclined to
| juvor the brown gelding, Foxmet, which the
old trotting horseman of Syracuse, A. J Feek,
sold to Dr. Wentz a short time ago; but on call-
| ing to their aid C. T. Willlams of Connecticut,
|

who objected to the dock tailof Formet, the
blue was pinned to the bridle of Quarter Cup as
| the beat type of roadster,

| Inthe saddle clas-, Colinette the sorrel mare

HORSE SHOW AT READVILLE.

 

   

Awards Made in Fifteen Classes-Bad Driving

in the Races.

Boston, Sept. 26.— Of the three events on to-
day's card for the breeders’ meeting at Read-
ville only two were finished owing toupsets
which occurred in both. Several drivers were

 

suspected of pulling their animals in heats ¢

which they apparently could have easily wou,
and the judges have reserved decision until
to-morrow as to what punishment they shall
{rpose upon Golden and McKenney, drivers
of George and Con Withers respectively In
the 2:10 pace George took the first heat easily,
but finished last in the next two. Then Me-

Kenney drove the gelding under the
wire in the first place again, but fol-
lowed this up by finishing fifth in the next
heat Some of the spectators were
furious at McKenney and expressed their

opinion freely. In the sixth heat Marsh drove
George and had no difficulty in winning it and

the race. Con Withers in the 216 trot alter-
nated in the third and firat placeg, though

Golden protested that it was through no fault
of his that the gelding went up at critical
moments, W. O'Neil, driver of E. C, was

fined $25 for repested!y scoring lengths in
advance of the pole horse in the fifth heat of the

(216 trot. Tom Marsh was given $100 for driv-
ing George so cleanly to victory in the sixth
beat of the 2:10 pace. Summaries

Anaconda Match.

Ternr Harte, Sept. 26—Joe Patchen, 2:01\,

amatch race for a purse of $4,000, and C. K.G
Billings's pacing gelding Free Bond was schede
uled to go against bis own record to wagon of
2:44. These attractions, together with "The
Wabash"' 2:20 trotfora purse of $5,000 as the
trump card of the regular rac'ng programme,
brought ont several thousand people. Rain

caused the postponement of the chief features |

after seven heats had been decided.
J. T. who had woh a heat in the
219 trot yesterday, ended it up by

two heats in 2.1844 and 2:16'4 without any of
the fleld getting dangerously close to him. The

Ohio mare, Lady Pipes, won in the 2:14 class

was an even money favorite in the early aue-

did not try for the first heat and Annie

NEWS OF THE WHEELMEN,

Amatear John Lake HKetarns With a Recerd
of European Saccess,

According to Johnny Lake, the Staten Island
amateur, who went to Paris as @ special ama-
teur representative of this country, Cooper and
McFarland are now riding in excellent form on
the other side. Lake arrived late on Tuesday
on the Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse and was about
the downtown baunte of the cycling fraternity
yesterday. He was locking as if in thorough
condition and expressed himself as pleased with
his trip, the right to which he wun at the chame-
pionship races at Milwaukee in July.

Lake's successes abroad were much more
noteworthy than the brief cable reports have
indicated Not only did he finish second
in the two-kilometre world's amateur obam-
pionship, but be also won the handicap at the
Pare des Princes track, starting from scratch,
Probably his greatest victory was scored at Ber-
lin, where be defeated Paul Albert, the German
crackajack, in a match race, beat two out of
three. At CopenhagenjLake defeated Henle, the
Danish star who a few years ago
won the 190-kilometre championship of
the world. This was a ten-mile race behind
nace. Brugzone, the Italian, suffered defeat

rom the American at Antwerp in a match raoe
and at Nantes, France, Lake won the Gran
Prix in a good tleid and scored also in the lap
race”) Inthe Expositionevents run this month
the Staten Islander was third in the Grand Prix
and finished second from seratch in the handi-
ean. Lake wore the colors of the Harlem
Wheelmen during a'l his European racing. Last
there was an informal reoeption in
honor at that club

The secretary-treasurer of the L. A. W. yes
terday sent out the following as a general po
tice

‘It having been represented to this office that
@ party or parties Claiming to represent the
Leegu: of American Wheelmen are eellin
hote! sigps and other privilewes in the towns o
Homor, Ithaca, Waterloo, Auburn and Seneca
Falls, I beg to announce that the New York
State Division L. A. W. has norepresentative or
agent authorized to dispose of or sell these privi-
leges other than the regularly appoluted con-
suls of the di trict; all other parties are ewind-
lers and should be promptly arrested.”

Thus far the efforts to introduce automobile
racing asatrack sport have plainly demon-
strated two things, frat, that as.et sportsmen
have nota sufficient number of machines to
make good fl-ids, and, secondly, that a system
of hand capping that shall take cognizance of
horse power, similar to that in vogue with re-
gardto steam and napht’a launches, is very

 

much needed to equalize the different machines
and bring about close finishes, Even with
the various types of machines classi-
fled with regard to the different kinds

of power, gasolene, steam and electricity, there
isno balance in a race because of the variations
in the horse-power strength of the different en-
gines A French machine of 24 horse wer
starts against one of the same make having 16
horse power. The big one wins by one mile
in five. The performance is interesting to an
exten!, butit isnotarace. This was the case
between the racing machines of A. C. Bostwick
and D. Wolf Bishop at Guttenburg recently.
Then several stent “aTriages are started, one
of them carrying a boiler capable of 100 pounds
mcre pressu e than any of the others. In such
events the resu t isa foregoneconclusion barring
mishaps. The Automobile Ciub and the National
Cycling Association have both made some show
of regulating motor machine racing, but aa yet
nothing has been done in the way of establish-
ing a handicapping system, That there will be
abundant interest in we.l-contested races
tween motor vehicles was sufficiently demon-
strated at Trenton, when on the first day of the
Inte:state Fair there were a couple of eventa in
which the compeling chaffeurs raced aside
by side for several miles and a crowd of
from ten to twenty. thousand got exolt
enough to The difficulty of ¢
hand.cappl: such races indl-
cated in t that the closest race
yet seen in this vicinity, a ten-mile
event at Trenton was won by a light steam
nacniae of 12 horse eee, against a heavy
gasolene machine of 16 horse power, both being
especially built for racing. Weight will be @
factor as well as the engine power in any sys-
tem designed to bring autos to a fair basis for
racing. With theincrease in the manufacture
it may be quite possible next year to get good-
sived flelds of machines of the same stvie,
“weight and horse power, solthat the race will
depend upon cleverness of handling. Even
then there will be need for a handicap system in
order to vary the programme
