OCEANIC COMES IN LAME.

A Propeller Blade Lost at Sea—Miss Datsy
Leiter Among Her Passengers.

The White Star giantess Oceanic came into
hort yesterday from Liverpool] and Queens-
town hippetty-hop, having lost one of the
great blades of her 20-foot port propeller on
Sunday afternoon, presumably by contact
with a piece of submerged wreckage or & drift-
ing log. The shock attending the twisting

off of the big blade was felt all over the ship,
Capt. Cameron stopped the liner and lowered
a Boat. He had lost propellers before and
suspected what had happened The men in
the boat found the blade missing and fo re-
sorted to the captain. The ship then resumed
her voyage, losing only afew hours because of the
mishap

Misa Daisy Letter, youngest daughter of
Levi Z. Leiter of Chicago, and sister of Lady
Curzon, wife of the Viceroy of India, was one
of the Oceantc’s passengers. She waa ac-
companied by her mother. She was met at
the pier by her brother Joseph. Mra. Leiter
drove to the Waldorf-Astoria alone, and Miss
Leiter and her brother, with Lynford Biddle
and Miss Marion Biddle, fellow voyagers of

ias Leiter, went back aboard the ship and
ad luncheon with Capt. Cameron.

Other passengers on the Oceanic were Max

OR A DWELLING HOUSE,
READ THIS!

There never was a time in the history of New
York when there was sucha large and aban-
Gant supply of housing to let in proportion to
the demand as this year. The result is that
hundreds of owners are offering reduced
rents, while others, thoaggh nominally main-
talning the old rents, make concessions in the
way of free occapancy. No tenant can be sure
that he ts obtaining the terms he is entitled to
according to the actaael condition of the mar-
ket without an exteoded tour of investigation
and of diplomatic negotiations with agents.
Save yourself the necessity of a personal search
and of aseless debates by inserting an adv. in
THE SUN stating the kind of accommodation
you want and the approximate location, ihis
will secure for you the best terms the market
has to offer.
