LOW WATER SUPPLY IN BROOKLYN.

 

Alarmiog Shortage Which Only a Heavy Fall
of Rain Can Make Goed.

There is such a serious shortage in the water
supply in Brooklyn that a heavy rainfall within
a day or two will only save the inhabitants
of the Eighth and Twenty-second wards, which
compose a large part of the territory in South
Chief
Engineer Robert Van Buren sent this commu-
nication yesterday to Deputy Commisstoner

Moff tt

“Owlng to the very low depth of water at the
Hidgewood reservoir basins we shall probably
be compelled to shut down the new East New
York avenue main by the end of thls week, or
early next week, unless we should have rains
in the meantime; in fact, the East New York
avenue main above referred to may have to
be shut down to-morrow or the next day. I
thus advise you that you may be aware of the
situation and take any measures or give any
waridag you may deem proper,”

Mr. Moffett said

“Thia fa not a question of economizing at all.
The fact is we haven't "f% the water, and so
the main will be shut off if relief does not coma
{n the way of rain The effect of this will be
that the people of the Eighth and Twenty-
second wards will get no water except possi-
bly on the ground floor, and maybe they wont
be able to get it there. They will get some
little relief fn that section from the new con-
nection with the Gravesend water fupply at
Fifty-second street, but what that will amount
to we do not know. I authorized the engineer
in charge to take whatever steps he deemed
proper without oonsulting me, and he has
simply notified me of the action that will have
to be taken.”

THE SUN, THURSDAY,

A TALE OF LOVE AND LIBEL:

NEW YORKERS, CUBANS AND A BRIT+
ISH VICE-CONSUL INVOLVED.

Latter’s Alleged Letter About a Sham Mar-
riage in Caba Basis of the Libel Suits
Brought After Mrs. Robert Glean Had Left
Her Husband and Attempted Suictde,

In a suit brought by Louis M. Glean here to
recover $10,000 damages for libel from George
Dobson and bis wife, Mary Ann Dobson, the
scene ts laid in Cuba. The charge of the plain-
tiff is that the Dobsons circulated a letter they
said they had received from John 8, Harris,
who for twenty-five years has been British
Vice-Consul at Sagua la Grande, containing
derogatory remarks about the plaintiff and
his brothers and falsely saying that the plaintiff
had gone through a sham marriage ln Cuba.

A member of the Dobson household in this
city for a number of years was Minnie Twit-
chen, an orphan, and a niece of Dobson. ‘The
Dobsons were introduced in 1897 to the three
brothers Robert, William A. and :.ouls M. Glean.
The Gleans are the sons of wealthy parents
whose property is in Cuba. Robert Glean
married Miss Twitchen last November and a
few days later they set sail for Cuba. They
had intended to reside in Cuba, but Mra. Glean
returned five months later without her hus-
band and told the Dobsons she had been de-
ceived into marrying a man who was already
married. She informed the Dobsons that she
had found in Glean's pockot two letters from
@ woman named Antonia, who had four children

of whom, sha said, Robert Glean was the father.
Two of the children had died of starvation
during the Spanish war. Mrs. Glean,atter dis-
closing this information, attempted to commit
suicide

Dobson, after hearing these, matters from
hig niece, wrote to Vice-Consul Harris to get
information about Robert Glean and his a! eged

or Antonio St, Ana,
wrote, went through a sham marriage
Robert Glean at the same time as her
was married to his brother Louis.” The letter
sal! that most of the persons who could bear
witness to the sham marriage were away or
cea‘. Mr. Harris wrote that he would rather
see a daughter or niece buried than have her
marry one of the Glean boy .

tobert Glean does not appear to have litt-
gated about the letter, but his two brothers
save done so, In the suit of Louls M Glean
the Dobsons have set up all they say they have
learned about the alleged sham marriage of

 

 

the two Glean boys The two girls were
daugliters of the overseer of the estate of the
father of the Clean boys The girls had tne
sisted on a marriage, the Dobsons aver, and
Robert and | is Clean invited a party of
friends, including Judge lage of that district,
to Sagua, where a marriage ceremony was
yerformed between the two @irle and the two
brothers, but no record of the marriage was

made. The Dobsons set up in mitigation of

sister |

| the stage inanager knew

damages that, while Robert Glean was court- |

ing Mise Twitchen, he was writing affectionate
letters to Antonio in Cuba, saying she was
the only girl he ever loved

Louis M. Glean says that_he has never mar-
ried, and that his brother Robert never mar-
ried any one but Miss Twitchen

On a motion for further particulars of the
alleged sham marriage set up in the answer of
the Dobsons, Justice Truax of the Supreme
Court yesterday reserved decision, William A.
Glean has an action pending to recover $10,000
damages from the Dobsons for circulating parts
of the Harris letter reflecting upon him as one
of the Glean boys. As an element of damage
he sets up that his engagement to marry Grace
Viola Byington was declared off by her when
she learned about the Harris letter

Miss Byington brought suitagainst William
A. Glean thls summer to recover $10,000 dam-
ages for staternents alleged to have been made
by him reflecting on her character, While the
suit was pending Miss By!ngton sent for Wil-
liarn A. Glean and explained that she had learned
that he had not made the statements against
her and afterward her suit was dropped. On
her motion to discontinue she averred that she
was induced by Dobson to sue Glean, Dobson
denies that he induced her to sue

WOMAN LENT $4,000

 

On False Representations, She Says—Causes
the Borrower's Arrest.

Albert C. Albertson, who describes himself
as an electrical and chemical engineer, with an
office at 156 Fifth avenue, was held {n $5,000 bal
by Magistrate Hogan in the Harlem police
court yesterday on a complaint of grand lar-
ceny made by Mrs. Mary H. O'Reilly of 211

to Albertson various amolnts to be used as

security in his contracts, The representa-
tions which Albertson made to her regarding
his responsibility, and on the truth of which
she was induced to lend her money, she says,
she has sinos learnod were false.

The specific charge made agalinat Albertson Is

she says, represented to her that he had receivec
u check for $7,000 from the Western Electric
Company and had sold a patent toa Company
knownasthe Pennsylvania Steel ail Company.
That company was to pay him $200,000, be said, if
he would allow the attorney for the company
$25,00, He must first advance one-third of
the $35,000, and as he had the check for $7,000,
he needed $4,000 more to make up the necessary
$11,000, She believed his statements and
lent him the moner.

Alberteon was arrested at his office on Bepst,
12, He denies the larceny charges.

LIVE TOPICS ABOUT TOWN.

A fashion that is finding greater acceptance
every day in New York is likely to be the despair
of the champagne agents. Many of the hostesses
who entertain most frequently aud elaborately
now eee that the labela are washed from the
champagne bottles. This leaves the guests
in ignorance of the kind of champagne they
are drinking. As a champagne bottle is yery
likely at a private dinner to be wrapped in a
napkin,the necessity of this precaution to cone
ceal the brand is not always apparent. It is
inimitation of a habit that has prevailed abroad
for some time and probably derives the vogue
from that fact. In liouses of the London nobii-
ity and at all the court functions at Windsor
or any of the palaces the labels of the cham) age
bottles are allremovedinorder that no person
may be able to say that this brand of wine or
the other is drunk there. Champagne agente
may weil fear the introduction of such a fashion
here, although some of them are eo frequently
in the houses of their clients that they can ex-
piain what the brand is if other means of dis-
covery be lacking

One of the tenors at rehearsal the other
morning followed the stage manager wher-
ever he went. There was no escape for him.

Wherever the manager went the man stood |
whispered the tenor |

athis heels, “The spot!
always, “Show me the spot that Jean de Keszke
stands on when he sings, Everybody knows
that he hasn't a high C to his name, But he
knows the spot.” The stage manager looked
weurily at the tenor and shook bis head, “Yes,
there is one,” answered the singer, to his ex-

pression rather than to anything he said,
‘and you know where it is. Just show that
spot and, English opera or not, I'll hit ‘em on
Monday night.”

The stage manager was busily engaged
in a discussion with a chorus girl, who, faithful
to the traditions of her comic-opera training,
would insist upon moving backward and for-

ward in time with the music; but he knew
that he had to. satisfy the tenor,
“Just walt until to-morrow,” he said,

“and I'll show it to you. It's marked with a
brass tack, but you'd never find it yourself,
Walt until then and you will see it,”

After the rehearsal the stage manager told
one of the carpenters to drive a brass tack at
the left-hand aside of the stage, The next day
it was pointed out to the tenor, who could not
be ir duced to budge an inch from it during
the third act of “Faust.” In vain the con-
duetor shouted to him, while the other singers
were in despair at his imimovabhility, Only
what the cause of
this was, and he was s» satisfied at being able
to attend to his work uninterrupted that he was
silent. The reat of the singers are still won-
dering why in the world the tenor for the first
time ip his career clung so persistentiy to one
spot and would not move in spite of their re-
quests that they not be compelled to remain
on one side of the stage whenever they are
acting with him, But the tenor knows and so
does the stage manager. Only the singers
are still puzzled

 

 

Some idea of the extent to which the manu-
facture of Turkish cigarettes has increased in
this eountry may be gathered from the fact
thatone man who began a year ago to buy a new
brand whenever he saw it now has ninety
boxes as the result of his investigation, Each
new box was kept na evidence of the existence
of another make and scarcely a week passes
that does not add ore or two more boxes to
hia colleetion So confident is he that many
more brands exist that he has de
tarily to give up the search for new
the number of one hundred and filty has been

reached, It was not many year ago that
two companies had practical ooentrol of the
Turkish cigarette business in this country.

Now, in addition to the much increased impor-
tations of thesearticles, the local manufacturers
turn out @ great number and are oon-tantly
increasing thei output,

LUTHERAN CHURCH SPLIT UP.
Majority of St. Stephen's Congregation Want
the Rev. Mr. Gab'e to Remata,

The congregation of St, Stephen's Evangelical
Yaitheran Church in the Flatbush district tn
Brooklyn has decided by a vote of 88 to 28 to
request the Rev, Luther D. Gable, the pastor,
to withdraw his resignation, which he tendered
recently at the demand of the counctl of the
chureh. At a church meeting on Tuesday
night @ report was presented by the council
defending its action in asking the pastor to
withdraw. It was contended that he had not
exerted himself in any wary to ralse funds for the
church and that a more active and able min-
ister was required in the emergency, The
vote refusing to accept the resignation was
a eurprise to the members of the council and
flarry A. Mayer, who once ran for Mayor of
Brooklyn, and five of his associates tn that
body tendered their resignations. Several]
members of the congregation also handed
in their resignations.

The younger members side with the pastor
and the older are againet him. Should the
Rev, Mr. Gable decide to remain the seceding
members will probably organize a new church,

discussion
forth by
federation of all Catholic
States, In speaking on this subject the Rev,
Dr, F. H, Wall, pastor of the Church of the
Holy Rosary, Manhattan, and National Presl-
dent of the union said
“There is no doubt that the Catholics are
| discriminated against, although they simply
demand their rights under the Constitution,
, Take, for example, the Indian school question,
This Government eattered into a solemn Cove
nant with the authorities to the effect that
if the Church established, built and equipped
schools and furnished teachers that the Gov-
ernment would maintain them, This agree
ment has not been lived up to by the United
States, Other religious denominations that
had built schools have relinquished those
schools to the State, The Catholics will not
do this and still keep on teaching, although
' the appropriation for the schoola which the
Government makes yearly is very small and
Soon, probably, the

is yearly decreasing

appropriation will be nil.

“Then take, for examples, the looting of Catho-
lic churches in the Philippines by the American
troops. Some of the sacred relica from the
churches are now exhibited in store windows
on Fulton street in this city. And iu both
the Philippines and Cuba many of the school-
houses, built and equipped by Catholics, were
eontiscated by the American eon inanders
for Government use and occupation

“One of the most unjust edicts ever pProe
mulated, anedict reading more like an ukaseof
the Czar of Kuseia, was that of Gen Leonard Wood
the Governor General of the sland of Cuba
refusing to recognize @ marriage & jernnized
by the rites of the Catholic Church, performed
by a priest of that churoh, and declaring that
hone but a civil marriage contract would be
valid. Such an edict was iniquitous Ih the
extreme and clearly showed discrimination,

Again, no Catholic was appe jinted as A meme

ber of the Philippine Comission, notwith-
standing the fact that the commission was
sent as emissaries of the United States to @
Catholic country, where the greater portion
of the population belongs to the Catholio
Church.”

Catholic Benevolent Iegion, the Ancient Order

POLICE VIEW OF THE RACE RIOTS.

No Clabbing: No Riot Really, Jast Mobs of
Hoodiams and Shooting From the Houses,

President York of the Police Board yesterday
finished the investigation into the charges
of brutality on the part of the police toward the
negroes in the race riota of Aug. 15 and 16,
Eleven policemen who had had various posts
in the zone of the rioting testified that they had
not seen any clubbing of negroes on the post
of their brother officers, but that on the con-
trary the bluecoats extended every courtesy
to negroes “who were not getting bad,” inas
much as they frequently escorted them to their
homes.

| Capt. Cooney of the West Thirty-seventh
street station gave Commissioner York a short
history of the riottroubles, He said he had not
connected any of the rioting with the murder
of Policeman Thorpe —in fact,he did not think
it waa rioting, though, he added, at one ime
| pistols were being fired from the windows of
every house in Thirty-seventh atreet between
kighth and Ninth avenues. His men did not
club the negroes or treat them in & manner
| which could possibly be called brutal, Cooney
said, and he had at all times full control of the
situation, Heconcluded by saying that ff he
had not handled his men aa he did the riot would
| be going on auill.
|

Inspector Thompson was the last witness
called, fle said that when he reached the West
Thirty-seventh street station they showed him
knives, revolvers, bludgeons, dirks and other
; weapone that were being used in the rioting,

but when he got outside he saw no serious trouble

except in West Thirty-seventh atreet, between
| kighth and Ninth avenues, where a fusiliade of
| bullets was coming from every house, and a
| ghower of bricks, stones, bottles and fragmenta
of furniture was descending from the roofs.

Besides that, there was nothing more serious

than a disturbance and a gathering of hoodlumsa

on the corners.

bonght a new horse last week, and yesterday
morning August Muller, who is employed as
a driver by the firm, teok the horse and a brand
new delivery wagon out on his rounds, The
horse didn't like the trolley cars. When shortly
after noon a car crept up behind the wagon
at Seventy-ighth street and Second avenue,
and the motorman sounded the gong, the horse,
blind with fear, bolted for a drug store on the
corner, Muller managed to swing him around
© that the wagon just hit the curb. Then

gallop.

Annie Dresner, 14 years old, of 203 East fev-
enty-fifth street, stood across the street just
as the runaway was approaching Third avenue,
Khe saw the horse coming and was so confus
that she was unable to stir and stood still until
the horse had knocked her down. ‘The wagon
massed over her. A few yards further on Do-
licernan Dramdrich seized the horse's bridle

law increasing the pay of schoolteachers have

been more than justified. He sald

“It is stated that for the fraction of the year
