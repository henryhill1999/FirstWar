FINANCIAL AND COMMERCIAL,

Wepneapay, Sept. 26
The course of stocks to-day was irregular
until in the last hour, when a general advance
took place as the result of information that was
said to foreshadow an early termination of
the strike in the anthracite coal regions The
men employed tn the Markle mine were re-
ported to have accepted the terms proposed
by the owners of the mine and this was con-
strued as an important gain, in its moral effect,
for the other mine owners. It was thought
that the action of the Markle men in adjusting
their differences with the owners of the mine
without the ald of the officers of the United
Mine Workers of America, who brought on the
strike, would open the way to direct negotia-
tion between the men and the owners of the
other mines. The movement in stocks follow-
ing the Markle settlement disclosed that, while
the atrike had been without any important
influence in disarranging the financial situa-
tion, tt had at least served to prevent an im-
provement in values
There was no advance in the rates for money
despite the fact that the flow of funds to the
South and West continued unabated and that
the Treasury was gaining cash heavily from
the banks, It has been demonstrated that
the banks have the money situation under good
control, and that there is litUe danger of a
aqueeze in money in any circumstances The
Treasury Department has evinced a disposition
to provide such facilities and extend such aid
as reasonably may be expected of it in main-
taining the equilibrium of the money market
There has been no extensive disturbance of
loans, nor is there likely to be, Sull, it is pre |
sumed that some calling of loans will be found
necessary from time to time. In this matter
the banks will doubtless act with unusual care,
There was a further decline in sterling exchange,
making the total decline in demand bills three-
quarters of a cent in a week. The supply of
bills is much in excess of the requirements of

remitters, The strike news was
a large demand for Reading first
stock and it moved up rapidly in price. The
other anthracite stocks likewise rallied, al
though the trading in them large,
New Jersey Central was particularly buoyant
