Open Champtonship Echoes—Scores at Soran-| Jobn Thoraycrott May Design the

ton and Philadelphia.

With all the “talent” back in town there was
no lack of news and views afloat yesterday
about the open championship ‘Tom Hutchin-
son, who was Taylor's playmate, sald that if
Taylor bad been putting he would have beaten
Vardon ten strokes, for, as it was, on more
than one green, the open champion took three
to get down from within thirty feet of the hole
To show how experts differ the pro who cad-
died for Vardon, ‘Tom Kendelow, passed this
opposing Opinion

“Vardon could have won by five or 6ix strokes
had he taken any chances. I told hirn re-
peatedly to try for the hole on his put, but
he would not. ‘What's the use, 1 have lui
beaten,’ was all that he would say, Many
tines he took a four or a five where @ stroke

less would have sufficed.”

Huteluason led Taylor to the fourteenth
hole but fell down on the list four, the same
holes proving his “hoodoo” on every round
In Saturday's match with Will Smith, the open
charapion of 1808, Hutchinson was tL oup with
8 to go, when the rubber-soled shoes he wore
becamn: 60 slippery in the heavy rainfall that
he could not bold his footing, so that Smith

SIR THOMAS'S NEW YACHT.

Challenger.

Spectal Cable Despatch to THE SUN
Lonpon, Oct. tL—The Pall Mall Gaaette says
that the question of tseuing a challenge for
the Armerica's Cup came before the Royal
Ulster Club first at a meeting held on
Oct. 2, at which Col Sherman Crawford
presided Th: Hon, Charles Russell
wus present and informed the come
mittee that Sir Thomas Lipton was
to challenge for the Cup and requested the elttb

to take the necessary steps in the matter

This announcement was received with
ateatest sati-faction, The committer det ided
to send a chalense, Aceording|y one was
drafted and mailed that safe aflerioon

Ihe Central News says that George Watson
has comtntsioned to bulid the new
challenger for the America's Cup and that
his provisional plane thereforare already coti-
pleted. It is understood that these provide for
aculter embodying many novelties

The assertions of the Central News are dis-
counted by statements made by both Sir Thomas
Liptun and Mr. Russell to a correspondent
of THB BUN to-day. They say that the
mission for the building of the new challenger
has not been allotted as yet. It is not prob-
able that Mr. Watson will design her, they say,
but it is very likely that cle task will be assigned
to John Thornycroft

C Oliver _l-e the man of various victories

over the British in the sailing for the America’s
Cup, is first thought of because of his successful
work, Which goes far to establish him as a
safe nan. Then there is Herman B. Duryea,
the man whor Capt Bob Wringe found to be
so hard to beat in the 7#foot races the past
summer Mr. Duryea’s ability as an all-round
racing man, as proved in beth the So's and

JEPPRIESS REPLY TO CORBETT.

Will Not Fight “Pompadour Jim’ Unttl He
Meets McCoy Again.

Because Jeffries reiused to reward his chal-
jenge -eriously, Corbett yesterday sent the fole
lowing Message to the Chatopiun, 0 how show lo
exjiliting in New Englaud:

Your silly reply to my honest challange which |
you request me to Go ahead and Sight MeCoy for the

  

benefit of the Galveston euferers, proves co clusive y
thal you are @ pour champion and kiiow that | am
your master, Now, | wu Deht pand lt the evibre
r ceipts gu to the Galvestun s ifferer vow be 4 man
of a mouse

Many of the former Champion's intimate
friends do not think that he is sincere about
fwhting Jefiries or any one else Corbett,

however, says he means busine-sandtocon in @
the doubting ones le has already commenced
to train in @ local gymnasium As predicted
JeiYries insists on Corbett taking On someone
else tirst, The « hampion in auswer to Corbett's
defi, said

“[f Corbett la really cesirous of facing me let
him meet Kid McCoy again for the benefit of
the Galveston sullfleres. Their last mate!
ended ip uch An upSalistactory manne: that it
woul, be @ good iaea for then W meet once
more. If John L. sullivan, whom [ revar as
a good Ju: ge, Bays it is nota ‘Take’ [ will then
gla ly meet the winner. My an bition now is
to tackle Bob Fitzsimmons, Failing inthis I
have given the next promise to Gus Ruldin.
This isa fair proposition.”

There are only two places where a meeting
between Corbett and Jefiries conld be held,
Caraon City or San Francisco, The authorities
of the other cities throughout the United States,
is seems will not tolerate a mutch between any
of the bla fellows at present. Corbett ap
parently ts not inolined to fight MeCoy again
and hia attitude in this direction has placed
him in @ rather embarrassing position.

youngster, Silver Dale, looked best at the
weights and was played in preference to Fire-
arm and Unmasked. The bunch of eight came
down the first hill at a tremendous clip with
Firearm, Unmasked and Lady Uncas most
prorainent. Crossing the Withers course Lady
Uncas slightly in front of the other
pair and a lot of buruaping ensued. Unmasked
forced his way through in a drive, but after
beating Lady Uneas a head, was disqualified to r

TROTTING AND PACING,

Kellmont Beats Mr. Croker’s Chanty at the
Parkway Track.

Driven by Jack Curry, Chanty, Richard
Croker’s chestnut gelding, trotted about the
best race of his life in the 2:16 class at the Park-
way track yesterday. He did not win, but,
being his first start this season it was @ sur-
prising feature of the day to see him go #0 well
He was the contesting horse in every heat
Former Senat r Jolbn 4. McCarty's Inclana

bred gelding Kellmont showed mare Geert in
the last three heats and won the race, put by a

Chanty captured the first heat
Cockertll's bay gelding Swift, an
old Speedway favorite, driven by Ticehurst,
that made a warm fight for a part
of the way in every heat, taking second place
from Chanty in the fourth and last heat

Kellmont’s first heat wasan easy one
under the wire next to the last horse, but he still
continued favorit: in bot! the book and auction
pools, After Chanty's victory in the first heat,
Curry made as herd a drive as he ever did in
his life for the next heat. Chanty and Kell-
mont drew away trom the buneb turning Into
the streteh and came down head and head
Those who were back of the wire thought
Chanty had a shade the better of it, but W
Dickerson lifted Kellmont under the wire a
scant head to the'good. It was the most ex-
citing race of the day and a match between
Kellmont, Chanty and Nigger Jack may be the
result

Helle Arlington ,driven by Snyder, had the
