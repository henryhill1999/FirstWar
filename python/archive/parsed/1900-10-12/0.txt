against the Manchus and not the foreignen.

All these reports of a rebellion in the south
and central provinces of China against the
Manche originate in Shanghai, and this fact
alone is euffloiant to cause them to be re eived
with more or leas suspicion Despatches from

anti-foreign turn Pive missions at liaking
Chow are sald to have been destroyed.

The information received up to the present
time does not enable an accurate estimate of
the altuation to be made. The Chinese tn-
fignation and alarm because of the foreign
military activity at Shanghai are represented
by some of the English correspondents to be
based on rumors of German designs fn Shan-
