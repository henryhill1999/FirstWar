Questions for Bryan and Towne,

The Omaha Bee's statement that Col
Bryan formulated with his own pena pro-
} gramme for the Sioux Falls Populist Con-
} vention calls for an explanation from the
standing Democratic candidate
As BRYAN was sure to be nominated for
d President at Sioux Falls, suggestions or
directions from him were in order as
to the Vice-Presidency only. The Bee says
that they were to this surprising effect:
‘Nominate no candidate for Vice-Presi-
dent, or, if you do, take some one that will
, withdraw if called upon, We must so play
upon the prejudice, pride and conscience of
the Democratic party, whose candidate I,
BRYAN, would be, that if necessary the
prestige of originating at least one of the
two candidates on the national ticket must
be reserved for the convention to meet at
Kansas City. If enough Sioux Falls dele-
gates take themselves so seriously that they
insist on a full ticket, give them a candidate
for Vice-President also, but pick a man who
when nominated will put into our hands his
letter of withdrawal!”

This is a trickful scheme, but it
Bryan's? Andis Towner, the Sioux Falls
candidate for Vice-President, privy or sub-
missive to it? ‘These questions must be
settled at once on the authority of each
suspected statesinan, or Col, Bryan's

forwardness will visibly shrink and fade

A Chance for Enterprising Publishers,

We understand that the Hon, James 1)
RICHARDSON, now in theimisery that springs

ing to justify his pretended “copyright "of
a Government document on the general
ground that) although he cannot
property in the separate messages or proc-
lamations of the Presidents, compilations
are proper for copyright, and
that his method, style, or system of com-
pilation is original with himself and there-
lore entitled to protection

This is humbug of the same stuff that all
if the Hon. James D. RICHARDSON’S per-
pnalexplanations are made of

Nothing that RicHarRbsoON can find in
DRONE’S or any other treatise on copyright,
or in any court decision as to the validity of
copyright on compilation as distinguished
from copyright on the matter compiled, has
the slightest bearing on his offence. The
case might be different if the eompilation in
question was not a Government publica-
tion, But it is a Government publication,
fit the atatute is distinet, specifie and un-
mistakable on that point, superseding all
common law or general theories on the

RICHARDSON was then chairman of the
i House Committee on Printing and it was he
; who managed this bill on its passage
Hy through the House. He not only under-
} stood fully the amendnent explicitly pro-
{ hibiting the copyrighting of “any Govern-
; ment publication,” but he accepted it when
it was offered by Mr. Dinarry, and declared
his approval of it. His lucid remarks on
the importance of preventing private greed
from obtaining a monopoly of any Govern-
ment publication begin on page 1,457 0f Part
2 of Volume 25 of the Record, the day being
Sept, 13, 1893

‘The Government gets the cost of the plates, and
{fa publieation ts valuable this provision simply en
ables the public to get the benefit of it cheaply The

the United States. It is open to all other
publishers on precisely the same terms as
it is open to the possessors of this pre-

tended monopoly, except that the new
publisher will have to pay the Public

We may say, however, that Barcus has
already printed 22,000 sets of ten volumes
each, and admits that a further edition of
6,000 is in press. Roughly stated, the aver-
age price obtained per set is $30, Theaverage
agent's commission is about $5. The actual
cost of production is 75 cents a volume, as
returned by the Public Printer; let us say
$1 a volume or $10 asset, The margin for

ern men and has a philosophic and states-
manlike dignity which has been generally
absent from both Northern and Southern
discussion of the negro franchise since the
impossible proposition for the repeal of the
XVth Amendment was made

As Governor MacCorKLE points out, the
; ’

Constitutional exercise of the right of fran-

chise is the vitaland underlying principle’

paired without destroying the integrity of |
our popular government The apparent
indifference with which even the Northern
States that united in the ratification of that

States would therefore be a manifestation

question, We hear talk in) these days
about “imperialistic tendencies,’ but ex-

Vital principle of the franchise is received
no such tendency is discernible. The dis-

franchisement of one-third or two-fifths of

the violence by amending the Constitution,
| to legalize it under the fundamental law,
are in direet contradiction of our principle
of government and if they should he toler-
ated by the American people our whole
political system wonld be subverted and
“imperialism "’ would indeed be a danger
| really to be feared

As Governor MACCORKLE says, ' The in-

right of franchise, the

 

citizen to exercise the franchise in South
Carolina or in Alabama provoke the desire
and willingness to commit the same wrong |

Already, under the franchise bestowed on

States, as Governor MacCorRKLE reports

from an observation which cannot be de- |
spised, there has been ‘‘a vast change for
the better in the horde of unlettered and |
ignorant negroes within one generation,” so
that ‘it is the conclusion of every careful

IN SOUTH AFRICA,

Some light is thrown on the situation by the
later despatetes. The evacuation of Kroonstad
was decided on after tuil consideration of the
position by the Boer commanders, and the re-
Urement was carried out with such complete

success that everything in the shape of war

}indterial and railway stock was taken beyond
reach of the British, and what) provisions
feould not be removed were destroyed
The number 0 Boers who were in

feu thousand, a number quite inadequate to

 

hold positions threatened by their
number and largely composed of mounted men

the Transvadiers followed the railway line to Vil-

of some kind, a differential duty in favor of

Charles Tupper bas cleverly availed himself
of the dilernma in which Sir Wilfrid Laurier
has placed himself, and has been going about
the country declaining against the one-sided
imperialism of all-givesand-no-get of his op-
ponent. One of the Liberal organs has been
trying to prove that Sir Willffid Laurier is not
an imperialist, in order to take the styg out of
Sir Charles Tupper’s denunciations, but with
very indifferent success, the “British-to-the-
core” speech on his return from his Jubilee
trip and other utterances of similar character
being household words all over the country
Another thing that has affected Sir Wilfrid's
popularity in his own province is the way
in which he has run counter to the sentiment
of the people in regard to the Boer war, Ninety
per cent., if notmore, of the Prench-Canadians,
as far as they understand the matter, are in
hearty syinpathy with the Boers, and they
resent the application of Canadian taxes

MALARIA AND MOSQUITOES,

Theory That the Insect Causes the Disease Prac-

tically Established Beware the Anopheles!

From the Medical Reeord

Malaria in its several forms constitutes per-
haps the greatest obstacle to a snecessful colon-
ization of the tropies. The malarial fevers are
by far the most deadly of the tropleal maladies
in both white man and native Large parts of
India are devastated and rendered valueless by
this scourge, sand immense tracts of land in
Africa and South America cannot be inhabited
by the white race without almost inevitably
fatal results The problem of the causation of
malaria, Which has been the despair of scien-
tists for generations, would appear to be daily
drawing nearer and neurer to its final solution,
The large majority of seientifie men throughout
the world have virtually accepted as decisive
the theory that it is mainly if not wholly by the
agency of the genus Anopleles, of the mos-
quite family, that malarial fevers originate and
are spread. Infact by many this is no longer
looked upon asa theory, but asa doctrine

A number of investigators have had a share
in the discovery that the mosquito plays an im-
portant part in causing and disseminating ma-
Jaria, but to Manson and Ross is generally con-
ceded the honor of bringing the matter to its
present advanced stage Although Americans
have not specially distinguished themselves in
these investigations, it should not be forgotten,
as was pointed out in the London Lancet, Feb.
11, 1800, that A. F. A. King, at the meeting of
the Philosophical Society of Washington, DC,
held on Feb. 10, 1883, read a paper entitled “The
Prevention of Malarial Fevers," in which he
suewested the likelihood of marsh fevers being
produced by the bites of proboscidian insects,
notably in’ this and some other countries by
mosquito bites. This, we believe, was the first
oceasion upon Which the theory was publicly
mooted ;

Great activity is now being displayed in Fue
rope with the objeet of dee.ding the question
beyond cavil For years the Italian investiga-
tors have been performing splendid service in
the endeavor to probe the malaria mystery,
and probably ther researches have done rmore
toward its elucidation so far than has the work
ofany othersehool Since the establishment of
the two sehools of tropical medicine in Great
Britain a vivid and practical interest has been
taken in that country. in the diseases of the
tropies in general, and of malaria in particular
‘The British Government, in conjunction with
the Royal Socety, first despatched a seientifie
commission to the west coastof Africa for the
port ome oof attempting to find the malaria-
wearing Inosquiio, and to loeate its breeding
places. Shordy after this the Liverpool School
of ‘Tropieal Medicine equipped and sent out
at its ownexpense an expedition under the
leadership oof Major Koss to the enst
coast with asimilar end in view. Major Ross
and fis condjutors sneceeded fn discovering
the mosquito dnophedes cleriger, and ina few
Instanees in determining the situation of its
breeding places ‘The London School of Trop-
ica) Medicine, authorized by the British Colo-
nial OMce. has just senttwo of its members,

 

 

 

 

Drs. Sambon and Lowe, to the Roman Catm-
| paaua, there to conduet certain experiments
which, if terminating favorably, should con-

Vinee the most seeptieal that the mosquito is

the dominating faetor in the causation of
malatin. dt may be said that experiments of a
hk ture have already been prosecuted by

the Italians Celli and Grassi with most satis-
factory results

If, then, it be taken as proved that malaria {s
caused by mos juitoes andthe evidence insup-
portof this contention is so strong as to appear
almost unassailable and when it is further

red that the malady is conveyed by but
pecies of mosquito, it follows as a natural
sequenee that by a wholesale destrnetion of the
sinning insect the ravages of malaria willbe
curtailedand perhaps in time altogether ended

The Liverpool Sehool of Tropical Medicine
hasrecenthly published a book entitled “Ine
structions for the Prevention of Malarial Fever,
for the Use of Residents in Malarious Places,"
Which concludes a: follows

“All speculations about air, abont soil, about
Thalaria belts,'and the like have been rendered
obsalete, There is no reason to believe that the
pers of malaria finds aecess to the human
ody through any other channel than by means
ot the Anopheles huosquito, or that ‘enats’ or
‘mosquitoes’ whieh infest regions free from ma-
‘aria are examples of Anopheles If this par-

eonshe

 

 

justifieation tor the hope that malarious fevers
weuld disappear from the earth: and fortu-
nately the extirpation does not seem likely to
present any insurmountable diMieulty. The
eggs are jaid) in water, and the larvm
when hatehed live in water for about a week
before they assume the mosquito form. As
larva, like those of the common gnat, they rise
tothe surface to breathe, and a filmof oil on
the surface is speedily fatal to them by blocking
uptheirair spiracles. Much may be done by
drying up pools in the vielnity. of houses or by
treating then once a week witha film of kero-
sene of) Much may be done also by killing the
matnureinsect when resting upona wall after its
Meal and itis tobe noted that the trne Anoph-
eles resis with its body almost at right angles
to the surtace of the wall, while the absolutely
orcomparatively harmless enat rests with its
body parallel to the walloreven somewhat in-

elining to it.’
