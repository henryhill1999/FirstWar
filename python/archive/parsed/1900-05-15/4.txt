UMPIRE CONNOLLY'S RESIGNATION,

Said to Be Duc to the Abuse He Received
From Ball Players.

Thomas H. Connolly, one of the National
League umpires, bas resigned and jt is said that
the position has been offered to Frank Lwyer,
formerly a pitcher of the Cincinnati Club,
Connolly's resignation is doubtless due to the
abuse he received at the hands of the ball
players. Whilein New York recently he told
THESUN reporter that he had been subject to

the vilest kind of abuse by the players ever
sloce the season opened,

© was severely criticised by a portion of the
preas for his work on the diamond, but fair-
minded spectators thought his Judgment waa
very fair, considering the difficulties of the
eingle-umpire system, Nearly every manager
an umpire in the League has registered a

 

 

kick pat clngie um ires, and every one h
ondered why Ne magnates voted to ab lish
the double-umpire system, which worked 80

much better during the past few years.
Manager Ewing of the New Yorks is the lat-
est one 9 protest against the single-umpire
system. He says a common trick that was
workedon the umpire in the East was fora
runner to score from second base while the
official was watching first base. The umpire’s
attention being attracted to first base an
back turned to third. the runner proceeds to
slight the third corner about twenty feet and
makes hia way to the plate before the umpire
knows what is happening.

Brooklyn Gets Lave Cross,

Sr. Lovis, May 14.—The Brooklyn club has
secured the services of Third Baseman Lavo
Cross. Manager Hanlon closed the deal with
President Frank De Haas Robison of the Bt.
Louis company to-night. Hanlon has been
after Robison to sell Cross to him ever
since he reached here with the Cham-

pions on Saturday morning, but there was
aastring on the player. President Freedman
of the New York ‘club wanted Robison to
let him have Cross and the St. Louis magnate
promised to hand over the goods yrovided he
could secure the man_he was after to take
Cross’s place. When McGraw reported on
Thursday morning Robison wired a query to
Freedinan asking if he wanted the player
Knowing how much tn need the New York club
{s of a third baseman at this time he resolved to
keep his word, but after four days passed with-
out his receiving aline in response Cross was
sold to the Brooklyn club. The new Superba
will play tis first game with the Champions in
Wednesday's game in Cincinnati

Fastest Time of the Eastern Circalt Made by
The Kentacklan at Morris Park—Indian
Fairy Also Shakes Up the ures in Her
Dash Down the Eclipse Course—Entries,

The absence of stake features at Morris Park
yesterday was more than counterbalanced by
the glorious outing weather anda card that
furnished ample material for speculation, For
an “off day” the attendance was well up tothe
average, but visitors who took chances in the
ring gathered In little more than a free Turkish
bath, as only one favorite pulled through. ‘The
tracks were in record-breaking shape and some
exceptional times were recorded

Fight withdrawals in the first race left ten
good sprinters to try conclusions down the
Felipse course, Of these, Pupil flgured the
best on his two-year-old form, and he was
played down to9to5. There was also @ pro-
nounced plunge on McMeekin, while Indian
Fairy was unaccountably overlooked, despite
the fact that she had been heralded broadcast

as one of the fastest racing machjnes that ever
came out of the West | It was Indian Fairy all
the way after the flag fell to A gece start and
she galloped home a winner by four lengths in
the fastest time made over the course during
the meeting. McMeekin ran 4 fine race for his
firet time out, aud beat Belle of Lexington @

an the jookeysin the third race were appren-

and sent King Bramble to the post favorite.
‘Autumn also had a strong following, who played
him from 6 to1 to7to2, although it was his
first trip as a four-year-old Manitoban was
steadily played throughout and he landed the
noney ina gallop two lengths ahead of Rinal-

Some horses above the average sprinting
class appearedin the big fleld of thirteen for
the fourth race, over the last_seven furlongs
of the Withers mile Kriss Kringle ruled a
steady favorite and when Uliver Mac and The
Corinthian got tired fighting for the lead the
Springbok gelding drew away and won easily
by fourlengths. Sparrow Wing was the same
distance clear of Bon Jour who came from the
rear in tiine to beat fhe Corinthian a head,

The fifth event, whieh was for four-year-olds
and upward, over the Withers mile, dwindled
down to a three-horse race and the plungers
formed two. solid battalions, one of whien

money in on Walt Not. When the speculative
fever subsided the dollars of some wise people
were put up on The Kentuckian, whose price
was promptly cut from 6 tolto4to1 The
outeider led all the wav and not only won {
decisively, but tied the best time ever made
over the course. The official fractional flaures

Chacornac May Never Race Again,

James R. Keene's highly prized three-year-
old Chacornac may have ended his racing
career through an accident in the Withers
Stakes last Saturday at Morris Park. How he
injured himself is a mystery. The gelding
made a gallant struggle with Mesmerist for
about halfa mile when he suddenly stopped as
{if Nit on the head. He struggled on gamely
however, to the end of the race where he | ulled
up sore and strained, Powertul liniinents were
used Saturday might, but Chacornac grew
worse. Dr. Shepherd was called in on Sunday
morning and made a thorough examination
Ke found that the Futurity winner had injured
his spine in some way, and said that the colt
may possibly never race again

the four horses trotted neck and neck at their

With their loads lightened to one person be- | ric

hind each team, another brush was in order
Tins ume Erin G. and Bancroft demonstrated
the fact that they possessed more speed than
the mares, though net their equals in capacity
to pull welaht. Fromatair start up near the
bend the Armour team trotied fast and true,
drawing away (rom their rivals until a gap of
three lengths separated the two teams aa they
dashed past the end of the wail Mr. Dietz kept
up the chase to the bridge, but could not close
tte gap. Mr. Armour says he has driven Erin
GQ. and Bancroftu nile to pole in 2:25 and that
they have trotied in 2.22 with a professional
driver, They areable to show a much faster

road since last season, turned up and tried their
metie in two of the best brushes of the da
Hival is just recovering trom the effects of an
accident which disabled her hearny one year
ago. The litte brown mare jogged as if sore,
bu when started up she displayed much of her
old-time speed = MeMillan rushed off his feet at

the driver of MeMillan, Kept the gelding on his
stride this time, and be rushed rusht away from

John Fo Cockerill’s mare, opening three lengths
of daylight in the first quarter) Dr Moore
found it necessary to drive MeMillan to hold tis
lead, but he did this so suecesstully that Mr
Cockerill gave up the ehase on reaching the
bend

Nathan Straus gave Cobwebs a sharpening
spin by way of preparation for fis coming brush
with Lucille, 200%. The chestnut horse pleased
his owner and the eritices very toueh, and
is as good on the day of the contest as hey
yesterday the Chicago mare will have to wear
wings to beathim. Mr Straus objects to kri-
day as the day for the trial, and as dune totals

NEWS OF THE WHEELMEN,

LONG-DISTANCE RIDING ON IN EARN+
ES? AT VALLEY STREAM.

Hrown Finishes 600 Miles and Feels Good
Is Expected to Complete His Task of
Covering 2,000 Miles and to Break Ree-
ords-Mrs. Boyne Also Making Centuries,
The long-distance road-riding contests for
records is now on in earnest at Valley Stream
Will A. Brown, who started on Saturday to
cover 2,000 miles, is still at it and he has been
Joined by a woman, who wants to surpass the
performance of Mrs, Jane Lindsay, who last
year rode seven continuous centuries within
the limit of eighty-four hours, Her name is
Mrs. E. It. Boyne of New York, a member of
the Century Road Club, with a reeord of many
single, double and triple centuries. Never
before, however, has she started to excel all
other performances by members of her sex
In fact, Mrs. Boyne does not declare that she
: trying to do so, but it is wenerally accepted
that she ts, She started at 12.40 o'clock on
Sunday afternoon to ride over the triangular
course {n company with Brown and his pace-
makers, and at 6:30 o'clock yesterday morn-
ing had finished 200 miles. She then slept for
six hours and set out again. At 4 o'clock yes-
terday afternoon Mrs. Boyne had finished 225
miles. A Mrs Hickey has been stopping at
the hotel which she makes her headquarters
ever since she started and has been exercis-
ing the functions of a trainer. This arrange-
ment led to a suspicion that Mrs. Boyne was
after the women's records and it was sald by
riders at Valley Stream that ahe had confessed
as much. A reporter of THE Sun asked Mrs.
Boyne how many centuries she intended to
do. She answered cheerily: *Oh, I can’t tell
yet; I guess I will go a quint or so.” The fact
accepted by her pacemakers is that she does
not want to declare her intent, so as not to
have the reputation of failing should she de-
cide to quit atany time. Yesterday anumber of
Century Road Club riders appeared on the scene
as distinct pacemakers for Mrs. Boyne, and she
{s never without her own attendants, although
she wheels with Brown and his companions
Mrs. Boyne is a woman of slight build, and is
using a 26-pound wheel with a77 gear, At 3:11
yesterday afternoon Brown finished
hissix hundredth mile. He was then looking
well and was cheerful and spry. He had fully
rallied from his indisposition of Sunday, when

it was feared he would break down. A Brook-
lyn physician who goes out to see Brown every
day, examined him alter the finish of his sixth
century and found that his pulse was 78, and
