AEOLIANS
& PIANOLAS

at Reduced Prices.

We will offer during the next two weeks a large
assortment of Aeoliansand a few Planolas at re-
duced prices

These instruments have all been in use. The
Aeollans have been taken in exchange for
higher priced styles, while most of the Planolas
are instruments which have been loaned to cus-
tomers when watting for special designs of cases,

Roth have been put in thorough order and re-
Polished, 60 that in a majority of instances they
cannot be distingulshed from entirely new tn
struments. They are subject to the same guar-
antee

The cost of the Aeolian and the Planola causes
many of thelr apprectators to deny themselves
the constaht source of pleasure which comes with
thetr possession, It deters others from invest
ga.ing them

This sale affords an excellent opportunity to
obtain elther instrument at @ greatly reduced

rice
” It will continue for two weeks only, the first few
days naturally affording the greatest assortment,
mong she instruments offered

A discount of 10 per cent. for cash will be al-
lowed from the above figures or the Instruments
will be sold on moderate monthly payments.

In the summer home away from musical
entertainment an Aeolian or a Plahola ts
rapidly coming to be considered a necessity.

In many out-of-town residences the in-
troduction of one instrument has led to
the presence of them both.

They are invaluable alllesto the hostess,
and an always available source of pleasure
to the home circle. Symphonies, overtures,
operas or rag-time may be summoned at
will, Dance music ts always accessible, for
the instraments can be played by any one.
