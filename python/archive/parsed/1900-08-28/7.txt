COPPER IN GREAT DEMAND.
eet Leslee tated

 

The Larger Part of the American Ootpat Dar-
ing the First Seven Months of the Present

Year Required for Export Consequaent

Strength of This Metal io the Market,

The pronounced strength of the market
for copper ia attracting renewed attention
to the rather rernarkable career of this metal
While the production of copper in this country
oae on at an tindiminished rate, tne demand
as simultaneously assured such enormous

proportions that it la now suMcient to abaorb

Uae great bulk of the entire worid’s output in
a truly astonishing fashion. As rapidly as it
can he mined and refined it finds ita way with
all possible speed to the consumer's ernetble
A brief suramary of the domestic and foreign
movementa of copper since Jan. 1 will show
the wonderful developmenta which have oc-
curred in this article and which are of inter-
national interest at the present time

The exact returna of United States copper
production for the firat neven months of this
year show an agaremate output of 852,000,800
pounds, against 226,756,800 pounds for the ecar-
reaponding period in 1890, the increase being
equivalent to about & per cent. over last year's
production. Since Jan, 1 to Aug. 1 thie year
the foreign reporting copper ines produced
113,225,040 pounds, compared with 114,282,500
pounde during the firat seven months of last
year. It is thus seen that the combined Ameri-
can and European copper production for the
seven monthes ending July 81, 1900, amounts
to a total output of 466,424,400 pounds fine,
OF 26,316,010 pounda more than for the same
monthe in 188, The increase by the domestic
and foreign mines for the first seven months
of thia vear haa, therefore, been at the average
of only 3,616,434 pounds a month

If we now turn to the foreian demand and
compare it with that of a vear ago it will he
seen that {ft has increased enormously, and
that the erpansion in European consumption
has advanced by leaps and bounds, and that
thia country has been called upon since Jan.
1 to the present time continuously to ship to
Europe 64.6 of the entire home output. During

the firat seven months of this year the exports
of copper from this country to foreign ports
amounted to 228,252,720 pounds, against 142,-
698,800 pounds for the same period in 1899, an
increase of 85,743,920 pounds, These gligantio
copper. shipmenta represent a legitimate de-
mand for consuming purposes in England and
Continental! Europe. and far exceed in volume
all previous records, Notwithstanding the
unprecedented size of the American copper
exporte for the past seven months, the total
Furopean visible supply of copper held in Eng-
land and France on Aug. 15 was only 82.490
tons, including 6200 tonsa afloat on that date
from Chili and Australia. In addition to the
copper shipments above mentioned, the exports
from here from Aug. 1 to Aug. 25 amount to
more than 24,500,000 pounds, or about 1,000,000
oundsaday. Withsuch a tremendous outlet
or the home product ts it any wonder that the
rket exhibles the element of strength which
. characteristic feature of its present attl-
tude?

European deliveries of copper, Jan, 1 to July
$1, amount to 157,756 tons, and the copper busi-
neas has developed to such monster dimensions
at the foreign centres of consumption that con-
Nnued heavy shipments from this country are

ractically assured for the balance of the year
meet the transatiantic demand. Europe is
ining important electrical improvements,
and enterprises are being projected in the Olc
World which will require constant supplies 0!
copper in_very large quantities for many & day
to come. This country has lately been running
oD a narrower margin of stocks than formerly,
and domestic manufacturers will require large
suppiics of copper to keep their mills operating
up an average level the rest of 1900, Once
the home consumers begin to buy on a scale
equal to that of a year ago they will be con-
fronted with the vital problem of obtaining
an adequate supply of copper necessary to
carry on their establishments up to the capacity
at which they are able to operate. When the
Presidential election is settled and a continu-
ance of the present régime becomes an assured
fact the manufacturing interests will feel them-
selves decidedly freer to launch out in extensive
undertakings that will undoubtedly start the
wheels of domestio industry at a high-pressure
rate.

Meanwhile Europe ts taking the lion's share
of our copper product. and America is doing a
sugconetul business {n manufactured lines
sufficiently extensive to give the producers an
opportunity to dispose of all the copper they
do not eepare. The market has recently shown
an n@ tendency and fs At present
on basis of 16% for the Lake Superior
be and 16% to16% for the popular grades
of @ J ned. Ordera have come in

y this month from the home srade
keens in constant touch with thé
market here. English and French burers are
watching F oppo: unity to make favorable
rom this side. and the same may
be nal of Germanconsumers. A higher range
of values for the metal are among the poasl-
bilities in the not very distant future, particu-
larly as 7 statistical position here possesses
eo many features of merit. Several! sources of
supply absolutely unable to negotiate for
early deliveries on account of having already
sold their current product some time ago.

AUNT MYSTERY KEEPS HER CORNER,

Newswoman With # Hlasband and a Baby
Chased Away From the Bridge.

There waa a newcomer yesterday among the
women who aell papers at the Park row entrance
tothe Bridge. In addition to her atock of papers
she hada baby in aecarriage. Her husband was
there, too. Tt waa the presence of the huaband
and the baby that caused the trouble, because
Aunt Myaters, who has sold papers at the Bridge
for two yeara without any one learning her
name, had a notion that the non-producing

mbers of the family were there to arouse
,ublie sympathy Resides, Aunt Mystery,
who {a 60 vears old, is a man-hater, and not
even the Bridge cop who quotes poetry can

win her good graces, The row started at

§ o'clock in the morning
"Git on out of the corner wid that kitehen
truck,” sald Aunt Mystery, talking to the other
woman and shaking her fiat at the hushand.
“Don't yer let her hit me, Maga@ie,” said the
hushand, getting behind the baby carriage
‘Shut up,” sald Magele, “Ye needn't work,

but jist don't talk.’
“Where did ye git it?” asked Aunt Mystery,

agnin referring to the huaband

Maggle put a block of wood under a wheel
of the baby carriage, ao as to relieve her hus-
hand from holding it, brushed some files off
the baby, pleked some obstruction out of the
hole in the rubber top on the milk bottle and then
told Aunt Mystery that she was going to atay
all day and that Mike, the hushand, might stay
till he was tired, and that if Aunt Mystery
didn’t ke it she could chase herself to another
corner. The thermometer on the corner of
the building back of the man-hater registered
© and she seemed willing to compromise

If vouse'll chase the man and the kid over
into the park Ullletvestay an’ give ve a chance
in my corner If they stave here vouse'll do
no business ;

You're an old liar.” said Maggie

The baby had discarded the Inilk bottle and
was chewing the reserve stock of extras that
had been left in its carriage. It's face was
covered with red ink.

‘Youse hit me baby behind me back. Its nose
is bleedin’.” screamed the mother :

“Youse a liar.” sald the other wornar Yer
starve the brat till it eats the heads off the red
paint extras, and there's two cints lost for ye
anyway, and there'll be a good many more if

yer don’t move on
The mother held up the chewed copy with

irregular strenks of red running all over the
first page iid yelled F

‘New clue in the murther! De only paper
what's got de blood stains on de washtubs!
A Brooklvn detective hurrying to wet across
the Bridge to his home precinct bought the
vaper and the first point {o the row was won
by Maggie. By 10 o'clock she had done so
well that she gave Mike five cents and told him
he could go and havea glass of beer. The man
hater took advantage of his absence to kick the
block away from the baby carriage wheel and
the carriage rolled across the sidewalk and
bumped into the stomach of a fat Bridge po-
Heeman, Maggie knocked Aunt Mystery’s
papers from under her arm and said a hoy had
done it, She was told by the cop that she
could get out, keep quiet or be arrested. She
couldn't keep quiet, so with Mike and the baby
she trekked naecross Park row and City Hall
Park to Broadway, where she found a corner
which nobody else claimed

NEW CLUES IN SCHARN CASE.

Discover the Murderer.

Detective Sergeant Weller of the Central
Office worked without much success vesterday
on a clue which he had believed might throw
some light on the murder of Katie Scharn tn
her flat at 674 Second avenue on Ang 18 For
some reason the detectives from the East Thir-
ty-fifth street station who are at work on the
case spent the day in Hoboken. They had
announced several days ago that by to-day
they would have enough evidence to make
out a case against the girl's brother, Fred
Beharn, who will be arrnigned in court. Tt
was said last night that they have not suc-
ceeded in getting this evidence

Yesterday the police questioned Annie Gratz
of 247 East Twentr-eighth street, and her sis-
ter Annie, who used to go to Katie Scharn's
flat every Saturday to deliver her washing

ered they went there at 6 o'clock
on the door. Getting no answer to repeated
raps, they concluded that Katie was outand
they left the washing with a neighbor. Al-
most every Saturday, they said, they saw a
man in the Scharn apartments. They de-
scribed this man as being about 40 yeare old
and having a smooth face and wray hair. He
seemed to be a friend of Fred Scharn.

Julia Lang, a close friend of Katie Seharn,
has been assisting the police in searching for
aman who is believed to know something about
the murder. She went about with two Central
Office detectives yesterday. One of the de-
tectives in the case offered the suggestion yeas-
terday that the murder was the work of an old-
clothes man who was in the habit of visiting
the houses along First avenue and trading pota
and kettles for old clothing. This pedier had
not been seen in the neighborhood since the
day of the crime

A WOMAN ASSAULTED.

She and Her Escort Attacked, It Is Alleged,
by Four Men in Sannyside.

yesterday by Detectives Graham and Sheridan
of the Seventy-fifth precinet, Long Island
City, on a charge of criminal assault alleged
to have been committed upon Mary Eddy of
83 Eighth street, Long Island City. After
his arrest Coleman was placed among a crowd
of men in the police station and the woman
identified him as one of jour men who assaulted
her.

The assault was committed in a vacant lot
in Sunnyside, which is a part of Long Island

City, about 10 o'clock Sunday night. Ac-
cording to the woman's story she was on the
way home, accompanied by John Barnard,
for whom she keeps house. They were taking
a ehort cut through a vacant lot when they

were held up by four men. One of them seized |
the woman while the other three men attacked |

chased for a block @¥ two of the men. They
returned in a minute or 60 10 where the woman
was struggling with their companions

The woman was in an exhatisted condition
when found by the police. Barnard said ves-

terday to the detectives that he ran away for
a policeman, as he was no mateh for the four
men, and that it took him a long time to find
an officer

FINANCIAL AND COMMERCIAL,

Monnay, Aue. 27.

A moderate increase took place in the volume

of business on the Stock Fxchange to-day,

but the narrow and professional character of
the dealings waa not changed, three stocks,
Sugar Refining, Brooklyn Rapid Transit and
American Tobacco contributing one-half of the
total transactions, Commission business waa
extremely light and the course of prices was
almost entirely governed by the operations
of one or two pools that are at the moment
taking advantage of the general apathy to forces
a decline in special stocks, In London an
early condition of virtual stagnation in the se-
ourities marketa was followed by a ripple of
animation, due to the covering of short con-

tracts on the eve of the fortnightly settlement,

which begins to-morrow, and for the same
reason there was a change on a very moderate
scale in the position of the arbitrage dealers
in American railway shares, The purchases
in this market for the account referred to did
not, however, exceed a few thousand shares,
About the only development of interest in the
forelan financial situation was a further alight
advance in discounts in London, which was
reflected here, late in the day, by a decline
in long sterling. Local news included a further
decline of 50 centa per ton in pigiron bringing
the price to $10.50 pe: ton-—-details of further
receipta of gold at Pacific Coast pointa and a

large increase in the car movement of cereals,
The Sub-Treasury to-day paid out over $600,-

000 on account of redemption of the old 2 per

cent. bonds, making the aggregate disburse-
ments in this city on this account $6,285,504,

The slowness in the presentation of these
bonds for redemption, interest on them having
ceased, is explained hy the fact that most of the

outstanding bonds are deposited against cir-
culation and the banks are reluctant to pay the
ruling high prices for interest-bearing securi-
ties with which to replace them. In addition
to these disbursements the cash resources of
the local banks will doubtless be increased to
almost as large an extent in the near future
by the transfer of credits on account of gold
received from Australia, the Klondike and
other sources, Following the large arrivals
of the precious metal late last week, further
consignments were reported to-day of # con-
siderable amount. The financial community
appears to view the local monetary situation
and the outlook with complacency, although
in some circles an attempt is occasionally made
to excite uneasiness regarding the money
market prospecta as the domestic political
campaign progresses and the crop-moving
period arrives. Sugar Refining led the en-
tire list in respect of activity, accounting
for one-fourth of the total transactions and its
course was almost uninterruptedly downward
The atock made an extreme decline of nearly 8
per cent. and closed at a maximum loss, in the
active shares, of over two points. A variety of
rumors obtained circulation to account for the
retrograde movement, but the Street inclined
to the belief that it was simply a continuation
of the reaction from the previous bullish man-
{pulation. There was no news whatever re-
garding the sugar refining industry, but pro-
fessional operators are undoubtedly endeavor-
ing to anticipate {n the stock market, the ex-
pectation thatfthe long continued active and
prosperous refining season is culminating

Brooklyn Rapid Transit, which came next to
Sugar Refining in the extent of trading, was
subjected to considerable pressure at intervals
during the day, but after an early loss of nearly
a point the stock advanced 1', per cent. from
the low figure and was the exception, in the
active list, in closing a shade higher than on Sat-
urday. American Tobacco made a show of
strength in the early dealings, but subsequently
yielded 1% percent. and leftoffatnear the low-
est price of the day.

The iron and steel stocks, with the exception
of Republic Iron and Steel common, which
rose nearly a point on favorable consideration
of the recently published annual report, showed
only slight price changes. Louisville and
Nashville sold off slightly, on very light deal-
ings, on a decrease in the gross earnings for
the third week of the current month. Profit
taking caused a decline of a point in St. Louis
Southwestern preferred. Theanthracite coal
group sustained extreme losses, extending to
over a point in Jersey Central, on the possibili-
ties of labor troubles in the coal regions. Toward
the close slight rallies occurred from the lowest

points, but the market left off dull and in the

main heavy.
