The merry warfare be ween the two Flatbueb

the Jlade and J’reaa, edited by Lawyer Timothy
I! Roberts, continues ‘lo-cay’s Herald will
contain a two-column signed statement by Mr.
Fritz, reviewing the hostilities between the rival
papers, and winding up with @ warning to Mr,
Koberts thus

“in order to start a ‘new’ printing office,
Roberts conceived the idea that there were
tnany second-hand alticles in what he had
terrued ‘an abandoned printing office,’ which
the owner let to us tn) order to secure rent
for the building’ so, in his maieatic and lordly
ecxvie he proceeded to said abandoned

aum up what didn't belong to us

Gately vith er without our approval

“Nir Roberts, did vou take advantage of th
Absence of the editor of the Fiatbush Herat
to aet so majesticall?

“Don't be so self-lrnportant next time or
vou will not be nearly as tall upon leaving
ou office as vou were when enteing it, and
your dignity will also eufier. and it will take
ten more years of law practice on your part
to sum it up

“In fact, it would be unproper to visit us
