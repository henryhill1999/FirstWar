other picture ure published by those very ,
friendly people, Haphael Tuck & Bone The
Princess drives her geese on the front cover
ahe is diatinetl charmuag, notwithstanding
that the wleked maid stole her dreae in the

Pairy Tales It ia oa tittle curious that

the beheaded horse of the Princess, the la-
mented Falada, should have talked Scotch
to her—‘Hride, bride, there thou art wang
ing.” but there are many curious things in
the stories, the autoora themaclves being re
sponsible for a nurnber of them; and, besides,

it is a question whether we have quite vet got!

to the pass where it can be held to be proper
to have stories without some Scotch in them

There is a very fine picture of little Snow

White pouring out milk for the seven dwarfe ,

who were so klnd to her in that eritieal time
when ber life was sought by the envious queen
whose vaulting ambition it was to be the most
beautiful woman in the world; likewise a pleture
of the Sugar House at the wonderful moment
when it was being eaten by the ehiidren who
were in contro! of it; and there is a pleture of
the Frog Prince, showing him both as he looked
when he was a frog and as he looked when he
was a prince, and showing also the King's
youngest daughter, whom he married; though
the Faithful Heinrich, whose joy at the weddl:g
was such that he burat one after another three
fron bands with whitch he had enotreled him-
self in order to regulate his heart aotion, Is
not here represented, we are sorry to aay

But if the Grimm stories are desirable and
imperishable, so also are the stories of Aladdin
and Ali Baba, and here they are, together with
four other “Arabian Nigente” stories, in a little
volume published by J. M. Dent & Co., of London
The enchanted horse, which flew as high as
the tops of the mountains and as far as around
the world when you turned one peg with which
he was provided, and back again when you
turned another, is hera, with both pegs in wark-
ing order, and alt®, ther as good as new. Here,
too, is the story of the King of Persia and the
Princess of the Sea, and the story of Prince
Camaralzaman and the Princess of China,
and the story of the loss of the Talisman; and
though we cannot see that anything more
should be expected in a volume of a size to go
conveniently into the poo'et, there are further,
and very generously, eleven illustrations by
T. H. Robinson, altogether pleasant to look at
and having a genuine Arabian air about them.
The book ts neat and pretty, with clear print
imposed upon thin, etrong and lustreless paper:
on the inside of the cover, in a parallelogram
marked off in green ink, stands a nice young
person with wings,sharpening a pen, andherethe
name of the owner of the book is to be written
just after a bit of print which declares that

|

“This book belongs to ——”"; and a slender red |

book mark has been found by us in our copy,
neatly bestowed where the story of the en-
chanted horse begins, at page 102.

But there are stories of unimpeachable his-
tory as well as stories which are thought to
tontaln some element of imagination, and there
tan be little question that Herodotus Is as
flesirable and as proper at Christmas as are
bome others. Accordingly the Messrs. Harper
have provided “Wonder Stories from Herod-
optus,” a book which tn its contente does not
belie its title, although it 1s a work of a historian.
Here we have the stories of Arion and the Dol-
phin, of Ladronius the Prince of Thieves, of
the Dream of Astyages, of Crassus, of the Con-
spiracy of the Mag!, and of Polycrates of Samos.
These are retold by G. H. Baden and W. Bar-
rington D'Almeida, and decorated with pi-~
tures by Hl. Granville Fell. The pictures are
In color and heighten the charm and wonder
of the tales

Arion ts here, singing in the prow of the
ship, just before jumping overboard in def-
erence to the wicked wishes of the thievish
crew. He is shown again astonishing the
aforesaid crew after their arrival in Corinth,
and one can readin his face in this picture
that tenderness and mercy which spared the
lives of those precious rascals and saved them
from the wrath of King Periander, who had
strong opinions, very different from Arion’s,
concerning rascals and the treatment proper
for them. Here, too, we have Ladronius
eutting off his unhappy brother's head in the
King’s treasure house, and Ladronius again
deceiving the Princesa whom he afterward
married; and we have Atys, doomed son of
Croesus, hunting the Mysian boar, and the
Delphic Oracle propounding that riddle which
cost Croesus his kingdom, and Smerdis bend-
ing the bow of the Etheopian, and a number
of stirring pictures besides. Herodotus wa;
eapable and entirely suited to the holiday
season, and we firmly believe that he would
like very much, if he could see ther, these
handsome and epirited illustrations of his
immortal works

A Curious Story

is being told concerning the facts which caused the publication of one
of the most popular novels of the day. Some months ago a New York
publisher heard that Wr. John U. Llovd, a prominent chemist in Cin-
cinnati, had written a rather remarkable story. He had no idea, how-
ever, of committing it to print. It had been written purely as a solice
and an amusement, and the manuscript was being bound to tuck
away in his library, where it was to remain until his death. The

ublisher, of course. begged permission to see it. On reading i
Ea immediately recognized it as a novel of great force, individu-
ality, and interest.

The author was unknown, and the risk mav at first have seemed
hazardous. The story was called “Stringtown on the Pike.” and “serial-
ized” in a literary paper. So deep was its effect, and so instant, that
before the date of its publication in book form 10,000 copies had been
sold-—a remarkable feat for an author then almost unknown.

A second edition was put on the press and sold within two
weeks of the date of publication; a third edition was sold in the next
week; while the fourth edition is now selling and a fifth in prepara-
tion (all within one month of the date of publication).

And why is all this? Why, amid the mass and ruck of current
fiction, does the public suddenly affect interest in this tale of Northern
Kentucky > Because the characters are absolutely alive, absolutely
American, and truthful to the last degree. In tragic interest the
story has not been found wanting. In perfect portraval of some of
those types of character that make up the South and West—the
parson, the colonel, the slave, the soldier, the negro, (victims-—nearly }
all of them—of feud, pride, war, superstition and adventure )—the
book is quite alone in its class. |

In certain Western cities it immediately leaped into the posi-
tion of the “best selling book” of the day, and its vogue is working
steadily Eastward. Of the hundred or more notices, public and pri-
vate, which the publishers received, but three are adverse, and these
three amounted virtually to praise.
