bia majority of the spectators remained to
the finish. Over the five-foot fenoe all of the

a number of them balked and knocked the top

to clear it in three trials and were sent to the

gate. It looked a mighty jump when the top |

rail was placed at 6 feet 4 inehes.

nings Meeting — Results.
WASHINGTON, Nov 28 —Thare is lable to be
tronble between the Jockey Club and the West
ern Jurf Congress over the latter body’s in-
tention to protect the interest of the Crescent

| City Jockey Club for ite meeting nt New Or-

leans, The congress tried to bluff the manage-
ment here into shutting down the meeting on
Noy, 30, instead of continuing until Dec. s,
as sanctioned by the Jockey Club, and sent
word to tha cffev¢ that all owners, trainers,
jockeys and horses which took part in the
meoting at the Bennings track after Deo, 1
would be considered outlaws in the eyes of
the Western Turf Congress, This statement
was backed up by President Howard of the
Western Turf Congress

Horsemen who have been fn the habit of
Tunning their horees in the West in the summer
and aleo those who had intended to campaign
during the winter at New Orleans were afraid
of the notice and many were about to desert

in order to get a chance to race in New Orl

Bat now things will be. entirely different.
Ang t Belmont, the President of the Jockey
Club, sent a telegrain to Clerk of the Course
Crickmore yesterday, to notify the horsemen
that those who raced to the end of the meetin
would be protected by the Jockey Club at all
hazards. President Howard etated in hie
despatch some time ago that there was an
Agreement between the Jockey Club and the
Western Turf Congress whereby the Jockey
Club agreed to poe racing in the Kast after
Nov 30, but Mr Belmont’s telegram seeme
to contradict this. Now that the Jockey Club
has issued the ubove statement it means that
the Western Turf Congress will either have
to bow down to the Jockey Club or else the
horsemen from the West will have to remain
there instead of coming East in large droves

| during the suinmer as has been the custom

for many vears past
