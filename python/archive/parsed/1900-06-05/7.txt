* BICYOLES AND 17 /PEWRITERS.

The Falling Of tn Sales Abroad of One Offset
by the Gaius of the Other,

There has been a marked diminution dur-
ing the past two years in the value of the ex-
ports of bicycles from the United States to
foreigncountries, It is asoribed to two causes:
First—The extent to which the foreign demand
has been supplied, and second, the reduced cost
of wheels and their complements, whereby
the appraised value of machines is less than
during the period of high selling prices,

During the twelve months ended Jan 1,
1800, American bicycles to the value of $7,002,-
000 were exported, Germany and England be-
ing t'e chief markets for these goods, Dur-
ing the twelve mnths ending Jan, 1, 1900, the
exports were $4,520,000, Germany remaining
at the head of the List; Cuba, the Argentine
Republic and minor South American states
showing an increase, but England showing #
very large failing off, The decline in this

item of American foreign commerce, however
has been made up. in fact, more than made
up, by the increased sales of two other articles

 

0 American manufacture, sewing machines
and typewriters, the foreign retail agents
for the sale of bicycles, sewing machines and
| typewriters being, in mnany cases, the same
pereots

The foreign market for American sewing
machines is, of course, no new thing, The

United States are, and for a long time have
been, at the head of all countries not only in

Third avenue stock and J was called upon for
margin against my Consolidated Exchange ac-
counts, Raynor & Co. took up the securities
and paid over to me $02,000 in cash.”
Reoeatly the suspended firm has done little
business on the exchange. The suspension is
to have been precipitated by a demand
‘om a customer of the firm for a balance of
000 due him. The only transaction made
the rostrum of the exchange for account of
firm wee 6 sale of 400 shares of American
stock. ‘
either of the tners was at the firm's
office yesterday afternoon. J. F. W. Wuerth,
cashier, said that the suspension was but tem-
rary. Simpson & Werner, are the attorneys

SOMETHING LIKE A FREIGHT POOL.

 

Western Kallroad Committee Coming to See
the Rallroad Presidents. )

A special committee of representatives of
Western railroads is expected to report at the
meeting of Presidents in this city this week on
certain propositions for the better mainten-
ance of freight rates. This committees is com-
posed of: President 8. M. Felton of the Chicago
and Alton, chairman; Third Vice-President H
R. McCullough of the Chicago and North-West-
ern; Becond Vice-President George B. Harris
of the Chicago, Burlington and Quincey, Vice-
President Paul Morton of the Atchison; Vice-
President Bird of the St. Paul

Because of the frequent rate disturbances !n
the Weat this committee was appointed to devise
gome means for a better understanding among
competing roads Although the Interstate
Commerce law prohibits any pooling of rail-

road earnings, some of the Western railroad
men have urged that a scheme might he oper-
ted within the terms of the law whieh would |
have the practical effect of a pool, These sux- |
gestions have been wnder consideration by the
committee and a report on them is looked for
with much interest
Some of the executive officers of the Western
are now in New York, and they say that

 

 

the freight rate situation between Chicagwo and

 

 

 

 

 

 

and is largest (a circumstance which is a great
tnibute to the excellence to American man-
ufacture) in those countries in) whieh man-
ulacturing industries have attained the high-
est development. The foreign trade in Amer-
jean typewriting machines is steadily on the
increase ds these figures for the three calendar
years show

1807 ceeee eee $1,566,016
POOR) 606564) crac devenecnsreneen ees seve, 2,077,250
1608 2,776,396

With an increase of $700,000, one-third in
1809 Compared with 1808, the Treasury reports
for this year indicate a still further Increase
for 1900, which will bring the figures for this
year beyond the $3,000,000 line. Enatana is the
chief market for American typewriting ma-
chines, but it is not the only one, nor the one
in which the demand is increastng most rapidly.
France took ty pewriting machines of Amerioun
make in 1899 to an amount 40 per cent, greater
thai the year before, Australia doubled ite

erder, Japan increased in 1899 compared
with jsv8 ite demand for American
machines more than 100) per cent. and
there was a new market for them_ in
the Phillipines and an enlarged market
in Cuba, Mexico, Porte Rieo, China and Brazil.

The exports of American typewriting machines
to Germany are large, but for some reason,
not easily explainable, small to Canada, the
shipments of American typewriting machines
to Canada being less in amount in 1890 than
the vear before, and this was about the only
country of which this is trne
In addition to American typewriting ma-
chines another item of increased foreign com-
merce was in American cash registers, which,
separated as an article of export last vear for
the first time, footed'up to $420,000 in value,
andit showsthis veara still further increase,

only $193,000,

Further, that payments of dividends for many years
have been made outof funds which should have been
properly devoted to the maintenance and extension of

periorl of at least Ave years.

Under these circumstances, and in order to relleve
the stockholders of the Nashville, Chattanooga & St

Monpay, JUNE 4.

As there were no foreign markets to-day do-
mestic operators on the long side were deprived
of an opportunity to work London for effect
upon speculative sentiment here. Another
circumstance that militated against an improve-
ment in prices was the shutting down of sev-
era! of the larger planta of the Illinois Steel
Company, which is owned by the Federal Steel
Company. Explanations that this shutting
down was temporary and was necessary
for the renovation of the plants did not offset
the event, for the Street has become sceptical
of all statements regarding the fron industry,
except those relative to prices. During the
first hourof business more than one-third of
the total transactions were made and the tone
ofthe market was inthe main steady. Except
in the case of Sugar Keflning the first prices
were the highest recorded, That stock enjoyed
a maximum advance of 2 points, but subse-
quently lost it ali and closed a shade lower than
on Saturday. In some quarters it was expected
that the quarterly dividend upon the stock
would be declared to-day and hopes were
entertained that owing to the season-
able improvement in the industry and
the progress made toward minimizing
competition, that the dividend would be
increased. The afternoon decline in the
stock seemed to dispel these views and the
final selling was accompanied by rumors that
the dividend would be reduced to the rate of 4
per cent. per annum. As the day advanced
Mquidation on a moderate scale became appar-
ent. As for some time past, it encountered no
buying on the part of the public and, as the
short interest was materially reduced last
week, there was very little demand from that
quarter. On the contrary, traders who closed
their ventures for short account last week
seemed eager to put them out again as fresh
weakness developed. The dealings though
smal) were fairly well distributed and resulted
in material declines in every stock that received
much attention. These were Atchison pre-
ferred, Brooklyn Rapid Transit, Baltimore and
Ohio, the usually active Granger stocks and
Union Pacific. On comparatively light transac-
tions Metropolitan Street Railway, People’s
Gas, Pennsylvania, Missourt Pacific, Consoll-
dated Gas, Brovklyn Union Gas and Conti-
nental Tobacco sustained net losses ranging
from 1 to 8 points. The only noteworthy
upward movement was in New Jersey Central.
It was accompanied by a revival of rumors that
the control of the company is being acquired

by the Pennsylvania Railroad, This stimulated
alittle buying of the other anthracite coal
shares, but the improvement in them was only

temporary. The closing was weak at about the

lowest prices.

Liverpool and most of the Continental markets were
closed in observance of the Whitsuntide holidays and
will not reopen until Wednesday. wasurely there
was little inclination to trade here and the fluctua-
tions in prices were slight. However, early prices
were a trifle lower owing to further rainsin the North-
west, very bearish crop reports from the Southwest,
large receipts and long liquidation, The Northwest-
ern markets were weak and there was some selling at
Chicago for Northwestern account. Elevator stocks at

against 443,009. But later there was a rally, fol-
lowed by a fractional {mprovement on a rise in corn,
some new buying and covering. Moreovor, there was
a decrease of 3,606,000 bush. on passage, the world's
shipments were moderate at 6,041,000 bush. against
4£,128.0001in the previous week and 7,088,090 last

There was an advance owing to rainsin Texas and
Mississippi and covering of shorts by local and
Southern operators. There was an idea, too, that
Philadelphia was buying August and next crop
months. The opinion of the generality of the trade
is that the increase in acreage is 8 to 10 per cent
though Latham, Alexander & Co. after careful ex-
amination reach the conclusion that it will be about
bia percent The short interest here is believed to be
ulte heavy and many are looking for an advance in
Averpool to-morrow on the strength of the bad
weather, particularly in the Southwest. It is pretty
generally recognized, too, that the tendency now is
2 overael} the market just as recently it was to over-
uy It.
