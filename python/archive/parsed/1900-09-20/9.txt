AUTUMNAL CHANGES.

Sideboards in mahogany, beautifully
grained, very simple in line and with the

correct tints,
have made them more perfect,

An enclosed L’Art Nouveau cabinet
suggests other beauties, The graceful
seepe, the wonderful graining and
shading of the superb inlays, make it
a“ most noticeable bit.

Desks are holding a reception, in ma-
hogany, full-dress, with inlays of box
and satin-wood, pearl and e ‘bony. Nine-
teenth century styles vie in beauty and |
grace with Prene h, Dutch and ¢ ‘olonial |

AT REDUCED PRICES

We offer, for two weeks only,
plete assortment of Bollans at redaced
prices, This should focus the atten-
tion of all intending purchasera — not
because it affords a bargain, but an
op jortunity.

hese instruments are not new—they
have all been in use, having been taken
in exchange for higher priced styles,
but that very fact is significant of the
estimation in which the Holian is held
by those who have had the instrument
in their homes

They have heen put in thorough or-
der,and repolished so that in the major-
ity of instances they cannot be distin-
suished from entirely new instruments,
and are subject to the same guarantee

The cost of the Bolian causes many
of its appreciators to deny themselves
the constant source of pleasure which
comes with its possession, It deters
others from investigating it. This sale
enables one to obtain an Dolian ata
greatly reduced price, There will also
be included a few Pianolas, which have
been loaned to customers while wait-
ing for special designs of cases. Jt will
laat for two weeka only
