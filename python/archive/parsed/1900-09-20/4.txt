Howl for the Return of Their Money— Pitts-
barge Win Handily From the New Yorks |
While the Philadelphias Win a Close Game,

If the Brooklyns could win all of thelr games
ax easily as that of yesterday they would have
a walkover for the pennant. * The Champions
were declared winners from St. Louis by for-
felt, because of disgraceful rowdyiam by
the Missourians, one of whom went so far as
to indulge in a fight with Umpire Gaffney.
Hanlon'’s men, therefore, maintained their
lead of thirty-four points over the Pittaburgs,
even though the latter won handily again from
the New York tail-enders. The Philadelphiae
took a close game from the Cinclonatis and
appear to have @ cinch on third place. The
games wound up the last series of the Western
teams in the East, which, barring Pittsburg,
has been disastrour for them, The Brooklyns
from now to the end of the season will have
a much harder road to travel than the Pitts-
bures, 46 Hanjon’s men must meet Boston,
Philadelphia and New York, while the Smoky
City team must mix it up with St. Louis, Cin-
olonati and Chicago. The results:

Brooklyn, 9; St. Louts, 0.—FPorteited.
Pittsburg, 5; New York, 2
Philadeiphia, 8; Cincinnati, 7,

BROOKLYN, 9, ST. LOUIS—(FORFEITED.

Baseball.as controlled by the NationalLeagu4
has recelved many a hard knock of late, but
nothing so disastrous as the row that wound
up the Brooklyno-St, Louis game at Washing-
ton Park yesterday afternoon in the first half
of the third inning. Farrell opened with a
scratch two-bagger to centre fleld and took
third on MecGinnity’s sacrifice. Jones then

hit to Wallace, who threw low to the plate to
catch Farrell, The ball struck the ground
in front of Catcher Robinson and bounded
away from him. Robinson recovered it and
made a stab at Farrell just as the latter came
rushing home.

“Safe!” said Umptre Gaffney.

Robinson tore off his mask in a rage and
threw the ball at the umpire's legs. Then the
irate catcher made a rush for Gaffney and
pushed him backward Robinson looked so
threateni that Gaffney, with his mask in
the right nd, aimed a blow at Kobinson’s
head By that time several St. Louls players
had Jumped {n between the combatants and
the fight was stopped

You are fined $5 and are out of the game,”
said Gaffney to Robinson

“You are a dirty robber!” yelled Capt.
McGraw, coming up on the run

You are out of the game, too,” retorted
Gaffney, who was backing away from the pu-
willstic players

We have no other catcher.” said McGraw,
‘as Beulow has a bad finger and = ger is suf-
fering from a broken rib Why on't you let
Kobingon go on and catch? Do you want to
disappoint these people who have paid their
money to see a game of ball?”

Gaffney was in a quandary. He wanted to
consult with somebody in authority, but netther
President Ebbets nor Manager Hanlon of the
Brook yn Club was present. So he hurried
to Capt. Kelley of the Champions, who was tn
charge

"Do you want to let Robinson come back
into the game?” asked Gartner.

“I have nothing to do with it,” wag Kelley's
reply. “You have made a ruling and you are
supposed to atiok to it. If St. Louis doesn't
play, you ought to know what your duty is.”

Then Gaffney appealed to McGraw again
and the St, Louis captain insisted that nobody
could catch but Robingon, Gaffney, after a
moment's deliberation, declared the game for-
feited just as Robinson was handing his chest
prover or and mask to Criger, who wag ip uni-

orm. As Ciaffuey walked off the field the St.
Louis players fired a volley of abuse after him,
while the 1,000 spectators led for their
money. The only Brooklyn official who had
any authority to deal with the spectators was
T. C. Simpson, the club’s seo y. He or-
dered rain checks to be issued, but there waa
stil a clamor for money, One man who paid
24 cents to see the game raised a hubbub at the
main entrance, He cried out so that everybody
could hear him:

I have seen all but three games this year
and when | ask for my 28 cents back I am told
that I will be ejected by the police if I don't
take a rain check and go @wa@y peaceibly. I've
plenty of witnesses.”

Just then Ebbets showed up and asked what
was gol on, When he learned the cause of
the row he decided to p@y back money to
atrona as far as it would go. Meanwhile
jaffney was in the dressing room, white av a
sheet, and trving to explain mattere

“I called Farrell safe,” said the umpire,
“because Robineon did not touch him with the
ball. I was right on top of the play and was
therefore in the proper place to ree it. I had
nothing left to do but put Robinson out of the
game and when the St. Louls players would
not go on I had to declare a forfeit. I am
sorry for the beopte who paid to ree a game,
but it could not be helped. MoGraw, the 8
Louls captain, told me on the field that my
decision was just.”

McGraw when asked if he had said to Gaff-
ney that the ruling was fair declared that the
umpire had told an untruth. Robinson said:

“I have never been put out of a ball game
before and I have been playing for fifteen
years. I have always upheld umpires but
in this oase I lost my head. I touched Farrell
yhen he was five feet from the plate and he
newer even got to the plate) When I heard
Gaffney say the man was safe 1 got mad and
did something whieh 1 sincerely regret
would apologize now to Gaffney were he pres-
nt, for he and I have always been good friends

do not believe in kicking at all and deserve
to be scored severely for what I have done ”

President Ebbets, who was chiefly responsible
in having Gaffney reappointed to the League
umpire staff, insinuated that he would prefer
charges against Robinson. E bets said that if
he had been present when the row occurred
there might have been serious trouble for the
St Louis catcher The forfelt was more than
an ordinary blow to the St Louis club, far the
Brooklyn club, under the rules, kept the entire
gross receipts, minus the amount refunded to
those who stayed long enough to get back what
they had pela into the box office

When the game ended the score was 2 to 0 in
favor of the Brooklyns. The pitchers were
Jonea and Medinnity. The latter had been
touched up for five singles in two innings, but
was helped by luck and fast flelding. Jennings
made a clean home run in the first Inning

Before the game the St. Louis club's expected
share of the receipts was attached by Deputy
Sherff?! O'Donnell upon _an order of Supreme
Court Justice Herrick of Brooklyn, w ich was
granted upon motion of counsel in behalf of
Vitcher Gus Wevhing, now of the Brooklyns,
who wants $100 from the St. Louls club. Weh-
bing alleges that he was released from the St.
Louls club on July 26, but under the provis-
ions of his contract he was entitled to pay
for ten days after notice of relense.

 

PITTSRURG, & NEW YORK, 2.

Chashro was a stumbling block for the New
Yorks at the Polo Grounds yesterday afternoon
andasareaialt Pittsburg took the rubber game.
Carrick pitched forthe Harlemites and did fairly

well. The visitors played a fine flelding gare,
not an error being acored against
them. O'Connor carried off the batting honofs

getting in two singles and a two-bagger. Mur-
phy, the new second baseman, is rounding into
first-class shape. The score

NEW LEAGUE AFTBR BROOKLYN.

Anxious to Have the Champloas Jamp—Pres!-
dent Peterson Is Here.

Phil Peterson of Baltimore, the President
of the new baseball league, known as the Na-
tional Association, arrived in thie olty last
night. He refused to discuss the altuation
except to say that Boston, Philadelphia, Balti-
more, Chicago, St. Louis and Milwaukee had
put up $5,000 each as a guarantee to begin next
season with and that the two other cities would
be selected from Greater New York, Provi-
dence, Washington, Pittsburg, Cincinnati and
Detroit, all of which have applications for
franchises filed with him

The Natlonal Association men,
have a echeme in mind that may be a surprise
to the National League magnates. They want
to have the present Brooklyn club owned by
Abell, Von der Horst, Hanlon and Ebbets to-
gether with its great team, jump the League
and join the new aasociation inovernent. They
say Brooklyn has always been a twentyfive-
cent town andthat it would bea big factor inthe
success of the new league. f they can in-
duce the Brooklyn men to make @ move of this
kind and can also locate a new club in Cin-
cinnati, where John T. Brush appears to be in
disfavor just now, it is believed that the Na-
tlonal Association will not only be a go but will
alao come near outbidding the old League for
publie patronage

It is known that the National Association
men are anxious to secure the allegiance of
the Eastern and American leagues and also
the support of the Protective Association of
Professional Baseball Players. If they can
form a combination of this kind the promoters
of the new organization say they will be ready
to fight the League magnates, should the lat-
ter show a combative disposition, Whe
asked last night if the Brooklyn club would
entertain any guch propose from the Na-
tional Association President Ebbets said:

“As far as I am concerned the Brooklyn
club will stick to the National League. The
new League only exista on paper as yet an
therefore cannot expect to receive recog-
nition from anybody.’

President Peterson hunted up McGraw and
Robinson of the St. Louis club, but they re-
fused to talk baseball with him, saying that
it would be a breach of contract to do business
with anybody outside of the Robisons until
after the season

Practice of the Big College Elevens Yesterday.

CamBripcr, Sept. 19.—A full hour's hard
exercise, a bigger bunch of candidates and the
first attacks this season upon Trainer McMas-
ters's dummy were the features of to-day's
practice on Soldiers’ Field. The morning
work was varied by dumb-bell exercise in the

locker building, but was short. The after-
noon's tasks were lengthened out until, when
Capt. Daly headed the men for home, with a
two-lap sprint around the gridiron, they were
puffing and blowing like a school of porpoises,

As a result of the afternoon's work the signs
for good material from which to pick an eleven
are much more hopefulthan yesterday. George
lee, the six-foot guard from Northwestern
Lniversity, who was Ineligible to play last
vear, has returned, He donned the togs und
ufter an hour's vigorous exercise tipped the
beam at 105. He seems in better condition
und more active than lest fall. Hollingsworth
also returned to-duy. Other new mnen were
Page, ‘02, who weighs 120 pounds; Brent Taylor,
‘ol, who has played on ‘Varsity squads for two
years; Taylor, '03, 146 pounds; Locke, '03, 135
pounds; Pier, '03, and Goodhue, ‘04

Princeton, Sept 19 —-Ten more candidates
joined the squad of football players at Prince-
ton this afternoon. The most of them were
members of the entering class and their ad-
vent upon the fleld has been expectantly awaited
by the athletic authorities and undergraduates
for some time. It must be said, however, that
the showing made by the new men was not too
encouraging and falls far short of what many
had been led to expect from the atories that
have been recently going the rounds of the
campus, concerning the abundance of new
material. Judging from appearances, the new
layers who have any possibility whatever of
Bein able to attain ‘Varsity form can be counted
on the fingers of one hand
men was divided into three parts this after-
noon. Balliette drilled the candidates for
centre and guard, Nat Poe, *uperintended the
work of the backs and Arthur Poe showed the
ends and tackles how the trick of boxing is

done.

BRANFORD POINT, Sept 19.— There is great
joy amoug the Columbla football players to-
night. Word was received this evening that
Hennen, the champion swimmer of the New
York A. CC. has consented to join the
Columbia football squad on Sept. 20. Hennen
is an experienced athlete. He played on the
Harvard freshman eleven two years ago, is a
clever weight putter and a fine all-around ath-
lete. He is just the man that Columbia needs
for a guard. He is studying at Columbia, but
had not intended to play football this season,
The Columbia football men, however, appealed
to Hennen to join the squad and he has prom-
ised to do so. He is 6 feet t inch tall and weighs
190 pounds, and is at present in the pink of
condition, ashe has been swimming all sununer
Columbia's boys took an afternoon off this
afternoon and went to the Branford county

fair

ITHACA, Sept. 19 —Coach Houghton increased
the work of the football candidates to-day
by lining them up to give instruction in break-
ing through. The candidates go out mornit
and afternoon now, and at the close of ench
practice the men take a two-mile run. The
work is gradually stiffening and probably to.
morrow the men will get their first signal work
There is a dearth of new heavy material, but
dome promising freshmen are expected toward
the end of the week. Capt. Starbuck's arm
is improving, but it is doubtful if he will be able
to get out in suit for a week

about six miles long in the centre of the island,
forspeeding purposes, Inthe parade yesterday

as visitors from clubs in the vicinity of New

formal speeding on the Boulevard between

JEFFRIES AFTER FITZSIMMONS.

Manager Brady Will Give $3,000 to Bob if He
Fights the Champion.

Billy Brady has decided to alter his recent
offer to Bob Fitzsimmons, on behalf of Jim
Jeffries, and give the former champion until
Dee. 1, instead of Nov. 1, in which to accept
Jeffries’a recent challenge. In issuing a defi to
Fitzsimmons Brady says that the boilermaker
has established a new precedent, as it is not
customary for the holder of a title in pugilism

to challenge prospective opponents. Brady
declares that Jeffries’s Injured arm isinshapeto
stand a vigorous course of training, and adds
that the champion is now prepared to set a date
for a battle with “Lanky Bob,” something he
was Unable to do a few weeks ago. To show
his sincerity Brady states that he will bet $12.000
to $10,000 that Jeffries will beat the Cornishman
and that he will give Bob $1,000 the moment he
signs articles of agreement and $2,000 more
whenhestensintothering tofieht

In regards to Ruhlin,” said Brady yesterday,
“we are perfectly willing to do business wifli
him provided Fitz refuses to entertain a match
with Jeffries If Ruhlin wants a match after
Fitz says he will not fight, he must post $2,500 at
once and $2,500 more when the articles are
signed on Dee 1, the match to take place before
the club offering the best purse on Feb 1 On
that date Ruhlin must post $5,000 more to cover
Jeffriess money He also must agree that the
winner take all the purse, including the picture
privileges, &c. The referee must be named,
too,on Feb 1 If these two men do not care to
fight, let therm stop talking Jeffries is the
crane ion and if they want to gain his honors
they have to beat him first.’

   

News of the Wheelmen,

At the September meeting of the Executive
Committee of the Good Roads Association
there was a full attendance with President
James D Bellin the chair Twelve new mem-
bers were elected. The committee on the com-
pletion of the Harway avenue bridge approach,
reported seeing the Comptroller and that the
work had been The Committee
on Highways reported that there was urgent
need for the asphalting of the few blocks on
Greene avenue between Washington avenue
and Classon, where the cobblestones now com-
vl cyclists to make a detour of half a mile
y his has long been one of the greatest demands
of the driving and wheeling publie as other-
wise there is an unbroken streteh of asphalt
from the beginning of Greene avenue to Lewis
avenue, The reason why it has not been at-
tended to is that the big sewer main of the
city has not yet been « ompleted there and the
asphalt will not be laid until after
the street has been opened and the sewer fin-
ished, The asphalting of Canal street from
fieury street to Prospect Park West is one
of the jobs for which a contract has been
awarded. It is a very desirable piece of work,
but so extensive that there is little prospect
of its being done this fallsoa committee con-
sisting of President Bell and A. Schwalbach
was appointed to call upon Comptroller Coler
and urge him to “register” the contract which
if done will permit the work to be pushed
through early in the spring. The next meet-

Supt. Brackenridge of the Brooklyn Rapid
Transit when interviewed regarding the fre-
quent violation of the city ordinance requiring
trolley cars to stop at certain asphalted crossings
announced to a committee of the A.C. C. that
he heartily approved of the ordinance, as he

He declared that he would discharge any motor-

There came ver¥ near being a serious rupture

in the Associated Cycling Clubs of Long Island
this year over the bowling tournament In
fact there were a few minutes toward midnight
last Monday night when there were shadowy
wasibilities of wholesale resienations and a
Peabiti up of the organization It hegan
when the Box ial Intercourse Committee was
brought to book for changing the rules and pro-
hMibiting the changing of the personnel of the
teams, after the beginning of the tourney, in-
stead of allowing every club to draw upon its
entire membership during the season
An amendment to the new rules
of the Soctal Intercourse Committee
was offered. It was not carried A motion
to reconsider caused a turmoil The amend-
ment was reconsidered and carried The
chairman of the committee tendered his resig-
nation and left the room A fellow commit-
teeman followed suit The situation was
saved by a most manly action on the part of
the committee chairman. He returned to
the room and said that while his attitude on
the main qnestion was unchanged he would
withdraw his resignation

ROCKTON WINS MONARCH;

MEDDLER COLT BEATS A SMART LOT
OF RIVAIS AT GRAVESEND.

Modrine Shows to Advantage in Handicap
Sprint for All Ages—The Long Race Goes
to Favonius—Loerana and Kid Score tn Two
Juvenile Events—Hildreth Still Bidding.

Two woll-framed overnight handicaps and
the Monarch Stakes helped to fillout an at-
tractive card at Gravesend yesterday after-
noon, The attendance was up to the average
and weather and track conditions favored
good racing. Regulars were on hand early
for thelr daily battle with the ring and went
home sadder but possibly not wiser men, They
found a successful favorite in the second race
and came pretty close to the mark in the fourth
for which the winner and fifth horse were
equal choices but the balance of the programme
furnished a harvest for the bookmakers

The Monarch Stakes brought out a good fleld
of three-year-olds; in fact, the list of eight on
the card would have remained intact if 5. C
Hildreth had not withdrawn King Bramble in
favor of Vuleain. W. M. Barrick’s consistent
Fonso colt, McMeekin, figured good enough in
the eyes of the talent to justify a plunge which
cut his odds from 2 to1to@to5. Killashandra
and Vulcain were next in demand, but there
was a steady play on Rockton at4to1, The

Meddler colt Lad been a quiet tip for some
of his followers weakened

 

 

day+, but many

when they looked over the jockey = list.
O'Connor, still nursing a broken
thumb, was slated to ride Sanford «&
Sons’ candidate, and it was feared that

he would not be able to do himself justice with
a lame hand. He got off in front, however,
and after losing his lead for a moment to
Contestor went on again and won easily by
a length and a half from McMeekin, who moved
up from @ bad position in the run through the
stretch and took the place by two lengths from
Killashandra. The Whitney filly ran a qieap-
pointing race and there were no bouquets forth-
coming for Turner when he landed her in third
place after a tedious overland route

Aithough Modrine had all the worst of the
weights in the handicap for all ages he was
selected by the talent to beat La Tosca Il,
Meehanus, Mayor, Gilroy, Hesper, Motley
and half a dozen others The Sir Modred colt
had his racing plates on and after killing off
Smoke in the first furlong he cut out the pace
to the end, winning easily by two lengths from
La Tosca I], who beat Motley three parts of
a length for place honors

An event that rivalled the Monarch Stakes
in attractiveness was the handicap for all ages,
at one mile and a quarter Greenock, Trillo,
Compensation and Princess Evelyn were withe
drawn, leaving the compact fleld of seven to
ao, with Decanter a weak favorite over Douro
and Jack Point Hildreth seratched Trillo
in favor of Gonfalon and for nearly a mile the
unning seemed to justify his judgment. CGon-
aon was travelling along in front at a rare
cup, with little buildog Charentus hot on his
trail The latter led for a moment in the
stretch, but Bullman came along with an irre-
sistible rush on Favonius and won out py a
length and a half from Decanter, who finished
a troublesome trip creditably. Douro and
Charentus were olose up, but Jack Point's
apparent inclination to finish last was spoiled
bv the collapse of Laverock

The Chamberlain won the three-year-old
seiling race and was prom tly annexed by
SK lildreth, who raised his price from $800

to $1,200 Hildreth also fancied Ljerana,
the Kussell filly which captured the two-year-
old selling dash and he bid her up $800 over her
entered price of $1,500 before letting her go to
the owner. Larry W prer wry ¢ Kid won
the dash for maiden fililes,which wound up the
card, Summary

American Tarf Congress tn Session.

Cuicaco, Sept. 19 —The delegates to the
annual meeting of the American Turf Con-
gress, whose rules regulate the racing on the
Western and Southern tracks, are in session
at the Wellington Hotel The clubs repre-
sented are the New Louisville Jockey Club,
the Latonia Jockey Club of Covington, Ky;
the St. souis Jockey Club, the New Memphis
Jockey Club, the Arkansas Jockey Club of
Little Rock, the New Louisiana Jockey Club
of New Orleans, the Queen City Jockey Club
of Newport, Ky; the Washington Park Club
of Chicago, the Chicago Jockey Club, the High-
land Park Club of Detrolt, and the Hartem
Jockey Club of Chicago. The meeting was called
to order behind closed doors as usual. There
is likely to be a bitter fight when the election of
officers comes up, which will probably be to-
morrow some time, as Murphy, Hopper, Price
and others are making every effort to secure
the election of Robert Aull, President of the &t
Louis Jockey Club, to that position. The Lji-
se Committee announced that it stands pre-

ed to defend its action in the Burns case
Wis is apt to lead to a very pny all-around
figlit, as will also the question asto the minimum
size of the purses to he wiven in cities of 500,000
and more in population. The cuty business
transacted at to-day's session was the reading
of reports and the decision to drop Cincinnati
and Lexington tracks

 

 

 

Tarf Notes.

Julla Hanover, Decanter, In Shot, MeMeekin and
Olea proved expensive investments for the talent
yesterday

O'Connor signallzed his reappearance in the saddle
yesterday by winning easily on Rockton and running
third with Douro.

The Russeli—Cheesestraw filly, Luerana, must be
something above the ordinary as 8S. C. Hildreth was
willing to pay $ «) for her after the fourth race at
Gravesend yesterday, but could not make Owner
I Murphy weaken.

Jockey Bullman ts having his own troubles, but
{s winning @ record for nerve. After being flattened
out under & horse the other day he worried Turner
so much in the first race at Gravesend yesterday that
the Intter complained to the stewards They set
Bullman down for the balance of the meeting and
fined him $200, which he promptly proceeded to win
back by scoring with Modrine and Favonius.

Many owners, trainers and fegulars at Graves-
end yesterday questioned the sportsmanship of
S. C. Hildreth in bidding up The Chamberlain, 4
colt belonging to parties that are said to need all they
can get Just now. Hlldreth was perfectly within his
rights, however, as the race carried selling conditions,
and he ran second with Annoy. The winner cooled
out quite lame, and {tts a question whether the buyer
secured @ bargain,

Hammer Thrower Flanagan Retarns to New

Haven.

Word has been received that John Flanagan,
holder of the world’s record for throwing the
16pound hammer, arrived at New Haven
on Monday last. His whereabouts has been
somewhat of a mystery since the international
games in which he represented the New York
A.C. After the games Flanagan went to his
home at Kilmallock, Ireland, but told Trainer

Murphy that he would be on hand for the Amer-
ican championship meeting. He was entered
by his club in both the Metropolitan and A. A. U
events and much surprise was expressed when
he failed to appear to defend his titles, It
was then rumored that the champion hammer
thrower did not intend to return to America
Aman who met him in the old country brought
over the news that in conversation Flanagan
stated that there was nothing in athletics in
this country and that he intended to stay in
Ireland His appearance at New Haven two
days after the national championships com-
plicates matters and athletes are wondering
what induced him to forego competing at Co-
lumbia Field last Saturday It is said that
Flanagan will again give the Yale athletes the
benefit of his experience in heavy weight events
by coaching the candidates for the hammer
throwing and shot putting at the intercollegiate

games

RICHARD CROKER'S TROTTER WINS.

 

Electric Wilkes Takes the First Harsess Race
at Guttenbarg tn Straight Heats.

Jack Curry took Richard Croker's Electric
Wilkes over to the Guttenburg track on Monday
and yesterday in the 2:35 trotting class, the
first harness race on the programme of the
Tri-State Fair, made the initial winning for the
Croker string of trotters. Electric Wilkes has
been showing fast work-out miles, but until
yesterday he never had his nose under the wire
first. He won in straight heats without a ppar-
ent trouble and made a record of 2:17% in the
second heat. In that heat, he left his feet on
the back turn and had to go fast down the
homestretch to head Sandola, B. T. Birney's

elding which forged to the front and had a
fong lead by the time the Croker gelding got
into his stride. Half way down the stretch
Curry overhauled Birney and they made 4 race
of it to the wire, passing under which Electrio
Wilkes made ashort break, which did not beter
his posidon and the judges awarded him the
heat, Amlott made the race to the wire in the
third heat,but was beaten out by a length by
Electric Wilkes in the slowest time of the race.

Between heats the crowd was entertained by
gymnastic performances, sparring bouts an the
exhibition of trained animals on a platform
erected near the judges’ stand. Between 12,000
and 15,000 persons enjoyed the sport,

The second race, 2:20 pacing clase, was also
won by one of the Emplre City track horses,
Flora Melvor, owned by G. H. Koler and driven
by Charley Thompsou She won the money in
three straight heats quite handily Flizabeth
D. gave her a brush down the stretch in the
tirst heat and W. H. Reinecke’s Ostrich took
second place in the second and third heats
