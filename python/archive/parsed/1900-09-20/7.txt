RAILROADS FORM GRAIN POOL,

 

The Trunk Lines in This State Agree to Stop
Competition,

Frank Harriott, recently the general freight
traMo manager of the Erie Railroad, has been
Appointed joint agent of the grain-carry-
ing railroads in this State and chairman
of the New York Grain Committee, which con-
sists of the traffic managers of the New York
Central, the West Shore, Erie, Delaware, Lack~-
awanna and Western, and Lehigh Valley, This
roeans the formation of a railroad combina-
thon to handle all the grain shipped from Buffalo
to New York  Ilnustead of each road Aghtiog
for @ slare of the traffic, all of the roads name
will act folotly through Mr. Harriott, and
thereby they hope to secure better rates from
the initial lines in the Weet and also to pre-
vent the cutting of rates east bound frow
Buffalo

Mr. Harriott will hawe absolute control in
the handling of ex-Lake grain shipped from
Buffalo to New York. He can make such rates
as he pleases with the Western lines and can
rmute the grain over.any road east from Buffalo
The trunk line traffle men say that this is not
a money pool in any sense, but that it ia An arm
rangement formed mainly for the purpose of
securing to the port of New York its share of
the export grain tonnage. The railroads
they sav, can work more effectively in con-
trolling 4 large volume of traffic than by cuttlog
rates and flahting each other

This new scheme, it was explained by one
of the interested raflroad men yesterday, does
not involve the violation of any provisions
of the Interstate Commerce law, as the entire
business is done in New York Rates are not
to be ratsed to exorbitant figures, as rival locali-
ties would profit and such @ course would
amount to a contribution to the Erie Canal
Th: railroads seek resunerative rates for
ser rendered Another point is that
the roads will try to ine ease ths total volume
of grain business for export from New York
wit

rhe eneral impression among, railroad
men ia that this grain pool is a plan of the Van-
derbilt-Morwan fines to indiatain grain rates
in this State Under the arrangement as now
understood the New York Central and West
Shore lines will carry more than one-half the
grain shipped from Buffalo to New York by

WEDNESDAY, Sept. 19.

The stook market moved rather sharply
downward to-day, The professional trading
element was impelled by higher rates for money
and signs of disorder in the anthracite coal re-
gions to turn again to the short side. Very
lite support fur stocks was encountered and
acoordingly the work of putting down prices
was not diMcoult. The public hadno hand inthe
transactions, and participation by it in specula-
tion is not regarded as probable for the present,
The meking and unmaking of values will be
left to the regular traders of Wall Street until
the situation readjusts itself on something
like a permanent basis, At the moment it
contains too many confileting elements to in-
duce general buying or selling.

While a serious pinch in money is not looked
for, there still is uncertainty about the future

of money.

The tendency of rates, as is natural

at this season of the year, is upward, but should
the neceasity not arise for a contraction of
loans, an advance in call money rates to 6 or
6 per cent. would mot be considered as especially

onerous,

An extensive reduction In the volume

of loans would be accompanied not only by a
flight in money rates, but also by discrimination
