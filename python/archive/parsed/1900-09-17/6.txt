THE country's crepir monny.

In spite of the imenaih result of the Maine
ion, and of Mr, McKinley's masterly refuta-
tion of the charges made against him and the Re-
publican party by the Anti-Iinperialista;the stock
market shows no symptoms of recovery from
the paralysis which has affiteted it ever since
operators have been confronted with the poss!-
bility, however slight, of a Bryanite success tn
the coming Presidential election. Not until

item In Mr. MeKinley’s letter has not
d from the publfe the attention It merits,
and that Is the immense increase to which it
@siis attention as having taken place ‘in the
genntry'’s money supply during the past four
The figures given, favorable aa they
fall short of the whole truth, They indleate
merely that the amount of gold, allver and
paper money in the possession of our citizens
and of our financtal institutions, has increased
from $1,508,000,000 on July 1, 1896, to $2,000,-
00,000 on Sept. 1, 1000, but they do not disclose
the fact that of this Increase of $599,000,000
abort £276,000,000 conststs of gold coin and gold
certificates, and, with an increase of $190,000,«
000 1, the gold ow ned by the Government, line
plies an addition to the country's solld wealth
of $476,000,000, OF this ainount about $275,009,-

on this point is finally dispelled will |
dence be restored,and the market resume |

| now, whenever the banks confess their

four agricultural and nalneral producta, and o |

| of 1 16 to 1, If, too, the proposal for unlimited
| bank currency based upon bank assets were
submitted to them, they would reject that
also, Dangerous as expanded bank credits
may be, their expansion is limited by the ne-
cessity which both law and prudence imposes
of keeping an adequate reserve to meet ther.
Checks against therm are apeedily presented
and speedily paid, because every holder of a
check knows that by neglecting to present it
Promptly, he loses, in case of the bank's be-
coming insolvent, bis claim against the maker
of it as well as against its endorsers, if there
are any. Tn [fact, checks are usually
accepted more in reliance upon thetr
makers and endorsers than upon the banks on
whieh they aredrawn, With bank notes the case
{fe diferent, They pass from hand to hand as
money, and eveninthe days when they were not
secured by Oovernment bonds, as they are
how, redemption of them in large amounts was
demanded only in times of panio, and then only
from the bankg and not from those from whom
thelr holders had recelred thom. At present
indeed, the Government euarantees the public
against loas by them, but what would be the
result if It did not, the experience both of this
and of other countries sufficiently proves
Instead of being hoarded like gold as they are
in-
solvency as they frequently do, by refusing
to pay their checks otherwise than through
the Clearing House, they would be eold, as
checks are in similar cases, at a discount and
they might even prove worthless. From this evil

| our present National Bank act protects us and

with this immense Increase in our etock

greater Increase has taken place in the volume |

of our bank deposita, which, equally with coin
and paper money, serve as Instruments for
efecting the archange of commodities. The
reports of the Comptroller of the Currency
giow that on July 1, 1894, the tots ul deposits
fn our national, State and private banks were
$4,400,000,000, those of the banks of this city
$4109,000,000: whereas on July 1, 1890,

fore, the country’s money supply has practically
been increased by $1,880 wmoof bank credits,
as as by €590,000,000 In gold and notea,
mak! lof nearly $2, 600,000,000

A fact il greater inter it of the
§2,006,000,000 of which Mr MeKinley speaks ne
constituting the total volume of our currency,

"Y nent and bank notes and of
ailve Euless and atl catesallof which,
as well as bank deposita, are nothing but erea-
tlona o Government and bank notes
are only promises to pay gold, which are ac-
cepted as eqnalin value to gold because of the
public faith that gold ean be had for them on
ind. Silver d and certificates re
ara, also circulate at par
with) gold Government accepts
them at that ition in payment of taxes
and custerns dues. The eflver dollars would
hea | worth na an t are, for currency
{they were made of nickel or copper,
ond the silver certificates would also be just as
le as they are, if not a single silver dol-
lar was in the Treasury for their redemption

The upshot ef the matter {fs that the country
fe now doing its business with about §8,000,-
000,000 in credits on bank ledgers and tn Gov-
ernment and bank notes, all of which rest upon
a bass of about $1,100,000,000 In gold, against
about $4,000,000.000 of credits and paper in
1806, resting upon a baals of about $00,000,000
of gold. The reault of the increase has bean,
as we ae, to advenoe the prices of all commodi-
tles of which the supply has not increased
proportionately, but it hag also heightened
the sensitivenesa of our entire financial fabric
to attacks like that which the Bryanites are
making upon it, Within two years iron, cop-
lead, wheat, corn, pork, beef, sugar, and,
more recently, cotton, havo risen in price under
the stimulus of the larger volume of m ney,
but they will fall again if that volume should
shrink under the chill of a general
of publlo confidence in the maintenance of the
gold standard which would follow the election
of Mr. Bryan. In 1893, a contraction of only
$9,000,000, or less than 15 per cent. in the bank
loans of thia city, brought ona panic that epread
over the whole country. The loans of the same
banks are now over $800,000,000, against a
maximum of $465,000,000 In 1898, and those of
all the other banks of the country show a simi-
lar degree of expansion.

There is, therefore, room for a much greater
contraction, now, than there was In 1°03, with
a liability to a correspondingly greater dis-
aster. Mr. Bryan and his followers are right
In attributing to the inereased money eupply
of the country the general rise in prices which
has belied the prophectes of disaster aa a con-
nee of maintaining the gold etancard,
which he made in 1904, but they do not see that
the greater part of the increase comes, not from
the additional supply of gold, but from an
expansion of credita due to the confidence
Which our people have had in one another
and in the etability of our financial
trstem. It ts true, that should a reversion
to the silver standard be effected prices would
rise again, and to a higher point than before,
because they would be reckoned in a deprect-
ated currency, but while the measure was merely
Impending there would be a fall in them such
a the country has never before witnessed

there is a rush by borrow ere to sell and pay
