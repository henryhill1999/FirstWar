WITH THE HARNESSHORSES:
BRUSHING enieaDe TARRS A REST OWe
ING TO MUD ON THE SPEEDWAY.

Good Racing Promised at the Hohokas Fair
This Week-—The Kentucky Horse Breeders’
Association Bars Hopples — Stables Pie-
paring for the Fall Driving Season.

The Speedway washeavy with mud yesterday
morning and the breshing brigade had an en-
forced rest, Three or four road riders whose
stables are near the great drive went up in
their bike wagons, but returned in @ very short
time covered with sticky, yellow clay, During

the afternoon the road\ dried out well and by 5

o'clock quite a crowd was driving there, but the

horses were mostly of the short-tall class,
hooked to surreys, runabouts and buggies

F. G. Schinidt, who, while driving his Speed-
way erack Excellence through Central Park
about six weeks ago, was wrecked by a run-
away saddle horse, is now able to attend to
his business. He was more seriously hurt
than was at firat reported. His collarbone was
fractured, two or thitee ribs broken and severe:
wounds on the head nearly caused his death.

‘The North Jersey, Agricultural and Driving

Assoctation’s fair begins to-morrow on the

grounds at Hohokus’ and will continue four

days. Two and three light-harness races are
programmed for each day for purses ranging
from $100 to $260, and the liberal list of entries
in each class guarantees good fields, In the

r ‘oreall pace on Friday Miss Mayins, Blue
Kifksor Merritt Wilkes, Claybourne, Peaches,
Replica, King of Diamonas and Sir Arthur
are entered

Horace Wilson, secretary of the Kentucky
Horse Breeders’ Asaociation, attended the Em-

pire city meeting last week in the interests | Brooklyn

of the ten-day meeting at Lexington, beginning
Oct 2. As the lexington meeting ie practi-
cally the close of the season all the great stables
have entered, The Kentucky Association t6
squarely against the unsightly hopples and
about the only one thatecould afford to bar them,
Mr. \\ilson says that the ‘Indiana pajamas
ig not popular harness in Kentucky. While In
New York he made arrangements with all rail-
roads in the Trunk line Association and the
Central Passenger Association for special rates
to Lexington during the meeting

Several road wagons, carts and sulkies and
harness belonging to the driving outfit of James
Murphy, former owner of the world’s light
harness champion, Star Pointer, 1:60%4, arriv ed
at Capt. C,H McDonald's stables on Saturday
last. The horses are expected in to-day. Mr
Murphy will remain in New York during the
fall driving a

Herbert Gray, panager of Thomas W. Law-
son's trotting stable, who attended the Empire
City meeting last week, has a strong Impression
that his stable has a areat chance to haul down
the $20,000 stallion stake at Keadville with
Jupe, 2:07'4, which Mr. Lawson recently bought
from D A. Snell

Bert Shank, who until recently was con-
nected with the Fast View Farm stable, bas
taken charge of the brown pacing mare Roselet,
by Cleveland, dam Sally Adams, owned by
J. L. Rumbarger, of Sharon Hill, Pa. She was
entered for the 2.30 pace last week, but did not
start

W. F. Steel, one of the Speedway brigade,
bought the roan gelding Paul Revere last Sat-
urday at the Empire City track from Gilehrist
Garth of Cortland. The roan started in th*
2:11 pace on Wednesday and made a good race
He was fourth in the last three heats which
were won by Art Aleo and Gyp Walnut in 208',,
208% and 211. He ts by Brandon, dam May
Day by General Hardee. Mr. Steel will race
him during the remainder of the season and
will then probably drive bim on the Speedway.

C.K. G. Billings has developed a great pen-
chant for record breaking. Now that he holds
the world's amateur pacing record to road
wagon, with his recent purchase, Free Bond,
24%, he hasa “hankering” forthe road wagon
trotting record and has sent his fast mare
Luaille, unofficially timed in 2.98% at Chicago,
to Terre Haute where she will receive a chance
to lower the existing flgures. Mr Billings
now has ten horaes at the McDonald stables
and five or six at the Empire City track. He
and Mr. Tucker, manager of the roadster string
went to Boston yesterday afternoon. They wi
return to Chicago about the middle of the week.

President H. H. Kane of the Road Drivers’
Association haa shipped his string of roadsters
from Long Branch to the McDehald stables
They will put in shape for the autumn drive
ing on the Speedway. Dariel, Hattie 1., Little
Qeam and the others are all looking in good shape
tor fast work

New York road riders were freely criticised
last week for beng 80 poorly represented in
the road wagon races at the Empire City track
In the wagon pacing there was only one New
York contestant, the chestnut gelding owned
by Daniel O'Dell Hontas Crooke, the winner,
ia owned by a Chicago road driver, and Silver-
maker belongs to Mount Vernon. The three
starters in the wagon trotting are all owned
outside of New York, Caridon belongs to
DeWitt C. Flanagan of New Jersey, Franker
toc K.G Billings of Chicago, and Zembia to
A_E. Perren of Buffalo

With Lord Derby, 2:07, Georgena, 2:07%4;
Ray Star, 2:08, and Boralma inthe Transylvania
at Lexington. to say nothing of other flyers,
it should he the “warmest” contest in the history
of that classic event

Bookmakers Hit Hard at Windsor.

DETROIT, Sept! 6.--Vesterday's racing atthe Wind

hard on every race and took over $14,000

English Comments on the Recent International
Matches.

Fnglish comments on the recent international
lawn tennis matches at Longwood and New-
port, are beginning to come in, and are being
read by American players with much Interest
Editorially the English official organ, Lawn
Lennie, has this to say of the defeat

“It is Just as well to look the defeat of the
Englishmen in America squarely in the face.
A team which goes from England to America
is handicapped in many ways-—by the voyage,
the want of practice on strange grounds with
strange balls, which are softer than ours and
require much more bitting; by the climate,
&c, But all this is inseparable from such @
visit, and is known perfectly well beforehand
An Ainerican team which came to England
would be handicapped in the same way, ex-
cept that it would probably take the wise course
of arriving in the country long enough be-
forehand to get used to changed conditions
Nelther Fnwlish nor American players are seen
quite at their beat when playing io each other's
country. It is therefore a cruel surprise for a
visiting team when it is introduced to a service
to which it is unaccustomed, and it explains
with great clearness the reason for defeat.
‘This is quite enough. We know that our meo
did their level best, and that they were not good
enough to win in America. To make excuses
for them is quite unnecessary, for none are
required

But we cannot help thinking that American
lawn tennis players are in some ways very
much behind the tines, Their countrymen who

play cricket would scorn to use anything but
the best materials and to play on wickets,
which a local village in England would despise

and the result is that the art of making wickets
is as much a science as it is in England and
Australia. But American lawn tennis players
still continue

to play on courts which would
not be owned by the «iver of a suburban garden
varty in England; courts which are ‘hatry,’
Badly prepared and altogether poor. They
use nets which are obsolete and which do not
keep the regulation height, and the balls might
be vastly improved. Surely the lawn tennis
players of America will not continue for long
to jag so far behind their brethren who play
cricket

In a report of the
the same authority says

‘To Euglish players the accounts which have
appeared trom Umetotimein American papers
ol the remarkable service of the three American
Whitman, D. Ff. Davis and
must have seemed to be
the lively and pivturesque
Wewere

international matches

Ward,

due entirely to

terrific service which broke away in such an
alarming manner that it was fearfully difficult
for a right-handed player to return it) Whit-
man, without being so violent in his methods,
was said to have a reverse service of an awe-
striking kind, and Ward in a# lesser degree was
also most formidable We all smiled. We
had heard of that sort of thing betore, and
were not to be caught

But now that our men have been most de-
cisively beaten in the international match, and
beaten, on their own admission, chiefly by their
inability to return the service with any. effect
whatever—-when they did return jt a6 all--it is
clear that the information giveo by the Amert-
ean papers has been substantially correct) On
absolutely reliable authority we are able to
state that the service of the Americans, eape-
clally of Davis and Whitman, took our playere
completely by surprise, It was quite unlike
aoyvthing which they bad ever seen or dreamed
of, notwithstanding that they koew well that
Davis, Whitmanand Ward h made a specialty
of the service, and were therefore on thetr guard
The main points about the service are {ta screw,
epin and pace The ball often breaks a yard,
and even when it is reached with the racket
the apin on it is so great that it Is very diffleult
to make a good return. Gore failed even to
touch a great many of Whitman's services
Our players all admit that they would not have
belleved it possible that any service could be
invented whieh they eonld not return with a
certain amount of ease, but that the American
service was impossible They all agree that
before it could be dealt with properly a lot of
practice would he required ”

In the London Sportaman some one signin
himself as “An Onlooker” sends a report o
the international matches, during the course
of which he says about the doubles:

The Atnerican style of play was. totally
different from ours. Davia ia left-handed
and to return his service means standing well
outside the double Iine and playing the ball
back-handed, It is impossible to drive on ae-
count of Ward's position, but more particularly
on account of the screw, the only possible re-
turn being a back-handed lob. Imagine the
feelings of the Englishmen when this further
surprise was spring on them. Where was
Barrett's forehand drive, and where was Black's
aplendid hackhandreturn? Wseleas—abeolutely
useless, both of them.”

Little Likelihood of a Decisive Race Between
Ballyhoo Bey and Tommy Atkins~The
Throe-Year-Olds Have Yet to Fight It Out
—Big List of Entries for Gravesend To-day.

  

 

Public interest in racing seems to grow with
the progress of the season and many debat-
able questions as to the merits of rival thorough-
breds are being keenly discusred without much
possibility of a solution until the meeting at
Morris Park, Even veteran horsemen, race-
goers and form students throw up their hands
when asked to name the champton of any clas#
from the two-year-old stage to the aged divi-
sion. In discussing the young division, the
majority favors Commando, but doubts are
freely expressed as to whether he fr the
king pin in the phenomenal bunch of
two-vear-olds owned by the Keenes and
trained by James Rowe. Those who think
he is not base their opinion on the fact that he
was left in the stable while Tommy Atkins was
sent out to do battle with Ballyhoo Bey tn the
Flatbush Stakes. Unfortunately there {a little
likelihood of having the question of supremacy
between Ballyhoo Bey and Tommy Atkins
settled Hoth owners are willing, as shown
by recent correspondence on the subject, but
Ballyhoo Bey is still in the veterinary's care
and will not be raced until fit, much as his
sportsmaniike owner desires a decisive race
with the best the Keene stable can turn out

Foxhall Keene's final action in the contro-
versy started by himself is highly commended
and there are still hopes that he may defer the
shipment of Tommy Atkins to England if there
is any chance of Ballyhoo Bey being ready
before Morris Park closes, The race, of course,
would have to bea special sweepstakes, as actual
matches are not permissible, and if it cannot
be brought about the ownership of the two-
year-old crown will be in greater doubt than
last year, when Mesmerist and Chacornao re-
tired without meeting

Among the three-year-olds the situation is
just as complicated. Kilmarnock, [ldrim,
Prince of Melbourne and a few others have
succeeded in reaching about the same point
on the ladder, but it is yet to be decided which
is entitled to occupy the top rung. All this
uncertainty tends to inerease interest in racing
if the owners will enter into the spirit of the
game and fight it out to the limit.

Amateur handicappers are completely at
sea as regards the relative merits of the aged
division. Yesterday at the tracks there was
a wide divergence of opinion on the question
of consistency, as applied to the races of Imp,
Ethelbert and Kinley Mack. The records
show that the performances of the Brooklyn
and Suburban winner have been the most
consistent. but when the other two are com-
pared, it is difficult to single out the old mare
as the chief offender, eapecially as she has

handicapped with a game lew ail
season. No such are forth-

coming to explain Ethelbert's form, ex-
cept that he has gone off or heen overindula
In the early summer he had apeed to burn
nd could tiptoe Jean Beraud and Imp. . At
Brighton Beach he outran the black mare after
she had set up a new string of records to the
stretch, but in his last two races he ran very
poorly for a horse of his undoubted class and
only seemed to strike hia gait In the final fur-
lone

TIGERS READY FOR GRIDIRON.

Team Are Brighter.

PRINCETON, Sept. 16.—The football season
at Princeton University will begin in earnest
to-morrow afternoon, when the candidates
report at Osborn Field for the first regular prac-
tice. Nearly all the available veterans and
substitutes of last year’s team have reported
With only a few exceptions Trainer Robinson
finda the players in first-class condition to be-
gin work on the fleld. Most of the candidates
have spent the last week or two toying with the
plgskins which were given to them last June,
and will appear in uniform to-morrow with the
rough edges already well worn off

Several developments during the past week
give a muoh brighter aspect to the outlook for
the season than prevailed a week ago, Word has
been received from Palmer, end on last year’s
team, that he will return to college this fall

| Although a place was not given Paliner on the

All-American team by the authorities, he played
as plucky and consistent @ mame during the en-
tire season as his running mate, Poe, and his
return will be a tower of strength to the Tigers’
weakened line, With the left end cared for
there is little doubt that a suitable man can be
found for Arthur Poe's old place, Roper
earned a place as substitute end in the sale
ane last year after a hard season's work on
the serub, but he was continually handicapped
by poor health. He is in good condition this
fall, however, and, if he is able to follow the
play as closely asx he did last season, he will
be entitled to the call for the vacant end, al-
though Gresham Poe and Little will always
be within hailing distance, should their services
be needed

The uneasiness which has been felt here for
the last few days on account of the report that
Quarter Back Hutchinson was liable not to re-
turn was dispelled when it was learned that
Charlie Young, who captained the Cornell

eleven for several years, would be out for the |

Young was a student at the Theological
here last vear, and although he waa

team
Seminary

not eligible to play onthe teamonac countof the |

one-year residence rule, his efforts on the serub
were untiring, Should Hutchinson return or
Dunean show any marked ability in passin
the ball, it is not improbable that Young will
be tried behind the line, He is atrifie light,
but his ability to hug his interference and gain
in a broken fleld offsets this objection, He is
also a clever drop-kicker, and if he plays will
be Princeton's mainstay in this respect
Another encouraging piece of news is that
“Riffy” Lea, the coach of last year's team, who
has slened with the University of Michigan
this fall, will spend some time here before en-
tering upon his duties in the West Lea was

one of the best tackles that ever represented |
and is considered to be |

the Orange and Black
a very able coach in line tactics. For this rea-
son his services are especially desirable, and it
is expected that his stay will do wonders in help-
ing to build up the new line Balliett, the old
centre, will also have charge of the line men,
and Bannard, who played half back on the ‘98
eleven, will inatruct the candidates
back field positions

The problem regarding the centre position
has been simplified by the appearance of two
bie fellows. Monroe of New York, who tips
the ecales at 28) pounds, comes to college well
recommended from his preparatory school,
and may be fitted {nto Booth's old position
The other new candidate is Butkiewlez, who
has had two years’ experience at centre on the
Andover eleven. He weighs 19 pounds and
{s regarded as the most promising man that
has siirnified his intention of trying for the piv-
otal position. Besides Dewitt, ho fe almost
sure of a guard, Lawrenceville will send over
a likely youngster in the person of Humbird,
anend. Hels rather licht, but those who have
seen him play say that he is fast in getting down
the fleld on punts.

FOOTBALL AT COLUMBIAs

A STRONG ELEVEN BEING DEVELOPED
TO WEAR THE BLUE AND WHITE,

 

Oarsman Daly, Tryiog for a Place on the
Team, Is a Good Punter—Interscholastio
Player Boehm a Promising Quarter Back
New Material for Other Positions,

One week of preliminary practice has shown
promise of a strong football eleven at Columbia
University this year. At the beginning of the
week Coach Sanford, after inspecting the green
material, remarked that he was afraid that he
would have to rely almost entirely on the vet-
erans of last year to build up the 1900 team,
but already two or three exceptional candidates
have appeared, and there is promise of a new
lot of men joining the squad this week. Of
the new men Edwards, Daly, Boehm, Rogers
and Ashley have shown the beat form. Boehm
seems to be the needed manat quarter back, as
he has been playing the position like a
veteran. Boehm has bad some experience
on the interscholastic gridiron and passes and
turns with dexterity and accuracy. That so
trained an athlete as Cornelius Daly has ap-
peared as a candidate for full back is aleo re-
warded as a plece of good fortune for the local
team. Daly showed last week that he is good
for a forty-five yards straightaway punt, His
four years’ experience on the Worcester High
School team is an advantage to him, as was
shown by his dodging and line bucking against
the first scrubs with Sanford himself in their
line, Powerful physique and some speed

) will serve him well in changing his play from

tackle, his former position, to full back, Daly
was a member of the Wachusetts four, cap-

tained by FE. Hl. Ten Eyck. It ts intended to
make him useful at half back also if a substitu.
tion should become necessary. FE. J. Edwards
seems to fitin the place left vacant by the grad-
uation of Longacre

The end positions are still open to competi-
tion, though Ashley seems to be corralling one.
Rowers, the new half back from “Poly” will be
@ Valuable man, but cannot push Morley and
Weekes for their positions

A 2%-pounder by the name of Murphy, who
will enter the university law school this year,
surprised the squad on Saturday by announe.
ing his intention to try for centre mish. He
will have bard work to displace Jack Wright,
but as a guard may have things his own way.
Austin and Irving, both heavy men, are also
looking for centre, which seems to point toa
heefy Columbia line with Capt. Simons, Morley,
Weekes, Boehm, Denman and Daly to take
care of the back fleld

Other promising men are Boyesen, formerly
quarter back on the St. Paul team: Hardenbergh,
late captain of the Collegiate School eleven,
and Van Hoevenberg, substitute on the ‘pe
‘Varsity. No definite predictions as to the
final make-up of the line can be hazarded as yet,
as all the veterans have not returned, and
ome promising material is yet to be heard from,
Marcus, the 1% +pound ‘Varaity pitcher, will
come out on Oct. 1, as will Mills, the erack full
back of the Horace Mann School team

Practice so far has been Hight) Squada
have heen formed for punting, putting the ball
into play, falling and passing, but no tackling
or plunging has vet been attempted. Running
of the backs and kicking between the posta
from the tf-yard line have received #pectal
notice

All the candidates are well with the exce
tions of Van Hoevenberge and _ Austin, who
have heen troubled by the heat, Rogera, whos
ankle was turned and English, whose aprain
finger is still bothering him

To-day, Sanford will rig up a tackling dummy
and ‘ee peraee of dally practice will be in-

THE KICKERS OF YALE.

 

 

Uniforms Ordered for Thirty Players—Strong
Coaching Brigade,

New Haven, Sept. 16.—The Yale football
managers have been busy making big prepara-
tions for the training of the team which will
begin to-morrow. Manager Iixonand Assistant
Manager Francis have ordered uniforms and
arranged for quarters for thirty players,
These will all be veterans of last year's
team and men who have had more
or less experience on the gridiron. The grees
materia! will not arrive until later.

last spring (t was expected that by the opentng
of the football season the new dining quarters
of the Yale athletic teams in an annex to the
University Club would be ready for use, but it
is doubtful whether it will be possible for the
football team to use them this season. Train-
ing quarters have been engaged in a private
house in York stree® At the gymnasinm about
$1,500 has been spent during the summer tn
making improvements for the benefit of the
football team. Six needle baths have been
added to the quarters of the football men and
fourteen artesian wells have been eunk in order
to furnish water for thase baths.

lt has been announced in regard to
the coaching that Vance McCormick, ‘93 8,
the captain of the ‘92 eleven, will be hera
to begin the season with M_L,. McBride, las
year's captain, as a coach. McCormick layed
at quarter and at full back McCormick was
a clever player during his college days, but
has not kept very closely in touch with foot-
ball since he graduated. It is also announced
that Wo W. Heffelfinger, ‘918, Yale's moet
famous guard, will give considerable time to
the coaching this fall. Heffelfinger fe one of
the most effective rush-line coaches that Yala
has. He is especially effective because he al-
ways puts on his old uniform and goes {nto the
rush-line and does his teaching by action and
not by words. Although he has been out of
college almost ten years, Heffelfinger is still
as much of an athlete as he was when at the
bean’ of his fame at Yale

1e Statement that Frank Hinkey will not
have time to do any coaching this fall doaa not
ake Yale men believe that Hinkey l not be

ere. Hinkey alwars has bean busy and alwars
feels ton busy to devote any time to foothall
until the season begins. Then hie foothall blood
begins to tingle and sooner or later he comes to
New Haven, takes off hia coat and works harder
than any other man to make Yale win. Hinkey
can't keep away from the Yale football fle!d,
and Yale men are gladof it. He knows as much
football as any man, and aa a coach is a wonder
He has little to say, but he has a personal mag
netiam that makes the clever foothall players
out of even poor material. If ever the genius
of a coach waa tested it waa last season whan
Hinkey braced up the ends of the Yale line fn a
way that waa truly marvellous
The first member of the Yale foothall team

to return to New Haven was A. H. Sharpa
who played at half back last season. Sharpe
has heen at Chautauqua all summer, where

he acted as djrector o core, or the Chau-
taugua Aasoctation. Sharpe as practically
heen in training all summer and has returned
to New Haven tn fine physical condition. Dur-
ing the past week he has been assiating George
fianford in teaching the Columbia hoya, who
are at Branford Point, drop kickir Sharpe
certainly looka as though he would make a
dangerous man for one of the back-of-line
positions this yenr.

Columbia and Princeton have literally cleaned
out Yale's department of foothall rubbers
and trainers. F.very man In this department
of football at Yale has left to serve for a larger
salary this fall, and Mike Murphy will need
about four assistant rubbers and trainers.

Swimming.

A awimming tournament was held at the Yorkville
Raths yesterday under the auspices of the New West
Side A. C. Three clubs competed in the relay race,
and the New West Side A. C., which had the strong
swimmer, J. F. Mumford, to Anish up for it, won by
five yards from the Grace A. ©. After the compet!
tions Arthur C, Holden made a dive from a platform
into the East River, about seventy feet below, He
executed the feat iy neater style than @ week ago, and
was loudly applaud by the big crowd. Summaries
