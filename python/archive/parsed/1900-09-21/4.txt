head coach of the Alarvard ‘Varsity in ‘97 and
‘08, and W. A. Lewis, 1. 8., '86, who has as
sisted to develop the vital polnts of Harvard's
@ame for the last five years, witnessed the
practice on Soldiers’ Field tu-day. Both looked
satisfied, but were reticent. The practice
to-day, as yesterday, lasted just one hour
The rudimentary warming up was shortened

Tackling the dummy under Diblee's guidance
and punting ocoupled most of the time. For
practice in breaking through,Capt Daly snapped
he ball for Whitwell, whom he had placed
opposite Lee, Carroll opposite Barnard Bolons
opposite Grew, Lewis opposite J. Lawrence,
Graydon opposite McGrew and Blagden and
Knowlton facing. The breaking through prac-
tise was sharp and extended, being both de-
fensive and offensive. Ellis was not out and
Dave Campbell has not yet appeared. Ellis
is work ihg to take off 4 condition next week
Campbell also has examinations. Four new
men appeared, Blagden, ‘02, who played on
the scrub eleven last fall, and tipped the beam
at 181; Hurd, ‘04, 4445 pounds; Cunningham,
Ol, M4 pounds; aud White, 127 pounds

At Berkeley Oval yesterday the candidates
for the New York University football team
commenced regular practice under the guld-

yee of Capt oche and Coach Hatch o8e
who put in appearance were all upper class menu
and it was noted that among the number were
nearly ali of the members of the team who
represented N. Y. U. last year. The men in-
dulged in only light exercise, after which they
prayed & practico game with the advantage
al in favor of the ‘Varsity. The teains lined
up as follows

"Varsity ~Roche, quarter
back; Young and Weidener, half backs
centre; Fernald aud De La Mater, guards;
and Lane, tackies; Craig and Cornell, ends

Serubs—Twedy, quarter back; Allen, centre;
Loosen, Simpson aod Wilcoz, guards; Banning,
Moore and Lyon, tackles; Griffen, Wilding and Hy-
att, ends; Reese and McClinchie, ball backs; Bren-
nD full back

Capt. Roche was quite enthuslastio over the
showing made YY the candidates. Next Wedneg-
day the final calf will be issued and a large cel-
egstion of freshmen is expected to be added to
thesquad, The law and medical schools will
also be canvassed for material

“MY DEAR Sin: At various times during this

COL; PADDEN SHOWS SPEED

HE WINS THE ALGERIA STAKES AT
GRAVESEND IN GOOD STYLE.
Plato Takes the Hitchcock Steeplechase After
@ Brash With Westown—Elizabeth M. Runs
an Unasaally Fast Race-Bangor Beats The
Amason in a Drive--Benefit Meeting To-day.

The attendance at Gravesend yesterday
showed a considerable falling off. Only two
successful favorites icomed up and most of
the intended comtributions to the Galvestun
fund remained in the ring,

The first stake reached was the Hitchoock
Steeplechase Handicap, with $1,000 added,
for three-year-olds and upward, at about two
iniles and w half. It brought out hal’ a dozen
“leppers,” so well matched at the Weights,
according to the talent, that four of the alx
found backers at practically the same price
Plato ruled a@ slight favorite over Charagrace
with Old Tank and George Keene equal third
choloes, Westowa, the imported jumper, has
developed «a world of speed since last
season and also the knowledge that he
can use it with safety over the nominal obstacles
at Gravesend. He went clean away from his

field for two miles, but when he reached the flat
Riato easily outran him and won by six lengths,

19 rest of the race waea farce,

Ten two-year-olds of average merit made upa
presentable fleldfor theAlgeria Stakes with $1,000
added, at fivefurlongs. When the plungers «vt
through pounding Telamon from 8 to 5 to 6 to 64
jot of wise money poured in on Col, Padden, aud
his odds dropped from 8 to lto$tol. Screech
went off in the lead, but Col. Padden outran
her in the first furlong and wou easily by two
lengths from Kimberly, who moved up fo the
stretch and beat Screech a length and a half
for the place. W. H. Sands'‘s filly lasted long

pnough to take the short end of the purse from

ix Shooter by ahead. When the winner was
offered for sale at $1,500 R. coud yaised him to

2,000 before resting, him go to Frank Brown
or an % a $5 he time was remarkably
fast for the course.

The handicap ved two-year-olds which
opened the ball looked so well balanced that
eleven of the dozen nominated overnight
stayed in with the exception of 8. ©, Hildreth's
Maximus. Servilla closed a strong favorite
and started the talent on what threatened
to be a long toboggan alide. Sinfl made run-
ning for a quarter, but then gave way to Ellza-
beth M, Henry managed to keep the Water-
cress filly straight and she won easily
by two lengths at the profitable odds
© 10 «to 1 There We a hot
drive for place honors between King Pepper,
Sinfl and Chuctanunda, the trio finishing aa
named at one-length intervals. The winner
barely missed the track record of 1:07, made
by Dr. Hasbrouck, as a@ four-year-old, with
122 pounds up, tn 1892. R. T. Wilson, Jr., won
& good race tn the second event, with Bangor
but lost his horse to F. D. Weir who securec
hitn at $1,800, a ralse of $800 over his entered
selling price. The Amazon, at prohibitive
odds, finished a fair second

Brigadier ran up to his best form in the fifth
race and after outfooting Kamara and Cyrano
won easily in time which almost equalled the
one mile and 70 yard record made by
Merito last May. The Belmont gelding wasa
well-backed favorite

Kitchener won the closing scramble ina
drive from the favorite Sadducee with Pupil
third) The Himyar colt was entered to be sold
for $500, and A L. Aste ratsed him to $1,200
Owner Hayman let him go at that. Summar
