MISSIONARIES STILL HOPEFUL.

See No Reason fora General Recall of Workers
in China,

Eight Presbyterian missionaries, home from
China on furlough and representative of every
part of that Empire, yesterday told the Pres-
byterian Board of Foreign Missions that it is
their conviction that there is no ground what-
ever for discouragement about Christian ef-
fort in China. They agreed tu the opinion
that there should be no geueral recall of mis-
sionaries from that fleld, but that in anticipa-
tion of an early and vigorous resumption of
Christian activity missionaries now away
from their stations because of the uprising
should remnain in Japan, Korea and other near-
by countries, ready at any time t reéuter

BRITISH COVERNMENT LEADERS AP-
PEAL TO THE VOTERS.

South Africa to Be the Issue ta the Coming
Election—Chamberlain aod Balfour De-
fend the War and Ask That Their
Party Be Allowed to Complete the Work.

Special Cade Despatch to THE SUN

LONDON, Sept. 20.—The Right fon. Arthur J.
Balfour, First Lord of the Treasury and Govern-
ment leader in the House of Commons, has
fasued an address to his constituenta which is
virtually the battle ery of the coming election
flo declares that the essential question the
electors have to decide is how and by whom the
problem awaiting solution in South Africa shall
be settled) He contends that a lesson had been
indelibly impressed on the South African mind
by the British dealings with the Transvaal,
which ended ingloriously at Majuba
Hill, and that from a Radical = ad-
ministration neither firmness of purpose
nor consistency in policy can be expected.
Adinitting that individual members of the op-
position have expressed opinions on the war
with which the Uniontsts agree, Mr. Balfour
declares that among the leaders of the opposition
there is nosymptom of that unity which alone
gives strength in counct), while some of thelr
followers display an attitude that is hardly
distinguishable from treasonable sympathy
with the enemy. He adds:

“It is not to the party so led and so composed
that we can look for any consistent effort to
grapple with one of the most dificult questions
British statesmanship has ever bad to face,
Every citizen, therefore, who desires that the
blood which men of our race from every quarter
of the world have freely shed in defence of the
Empire shall not have been shed in vain ts
bound to dismiss all smaller issues and to re-
solve, so far as with him lies, that there shall
be no break tn the continuity of the national
policy and no diminution tn the strength of the
parliamentary forces by which that policy can
alone be successfully maintained,”

Mr, Balfour alludes to the situation in the Far
Fast as being one of the questions of first-rate
importance, but he says that the verdict of
the oountry cannot depend on this because the
eeneral principles which should guide the
British policy in China afford little matter for
dispute,

Colonial Secretary Chamberlain has also is-
sued an address to his constituents, fn which
he declares that the war policy is the main
fssue. He saya:

“You are asked to say whether the war was
jnetan inevitable or whether it was only another
instance of a policy of greed and oppression,
of which our ene:mnles accuse us, Above all
you are asked to decide whether the glorious
valar of our soldiers, the ungrudging support
of our fellow subjects throughout the world,
and the sacrifices we have sustained shall be
thrown away, or the objects with which the
war was tindertaken be fully secured.”

Mr. Chamberlain thus states the Government's
proposals for dealing withthe South African re-
publics

“It is the policy of the present Government,
are asked to approve, that these
yoverniments, which have

which you

been a constant menace to her Majesty’ a Bue
premacy in South Africa, ehould never
again be restored, bit that after
. period of administration, backed

by military force, the length of which period
willdepend on the readiness with which the
Boer populations accept the British flag, the
people of the two States shall be received Into
the Empire on the footing of self-woverning
colonies, Inwhich position they will enjoy more
than they ever had before, and the
rights and privileges which they
dented to the British in their

Hherty

midat.

Mr. Chamberlain adds that this policy has
been apppoved by all the autonomous Colonies
that participated in the war.

Special Cabie Despatch to THE SUN.

Pants, Sept. 20.—President Loubet's reply
to a toast to the foreign officers who witnessed
the French Amny mauwuvres at Chartres,
which were brought to a close to-day, is re-
garded as @ very happy effort, His speech
wis made at » luncheon to these officers and
the Chief kaxecutive expressed the hope that they
would carry away @ good impression of thelr
reception and that they would toform thetr
governments that they found in France, like
thelr comrades did in China, the syimpathetie
and cardial feeling of the French Army.

“Last year,” the President said, “I felt the
liveliest regret at the suppression of the ma-
n@uvres in the interest of health and with patri-
otie joy I assisted in the manceuvres of 1900,
I directed Gen, Brugére, whose science, de-
votion and activity fs well known to the army,
to permit you to watch the progress lately
made and shown by all the chiefs In the matter
of setenee and discipline and the remarkable
endurance of all arms

“For thirty years fhe
licitous about the army

showed that the country could rely on it. There
the nation learns of the abnegation, devotion
and patriotism ef the army, and its respect
for the Inetitutions and laws proves that at-
tempts agalnst democracy are vain. The
golicitude of the chiefs for the troops and the
soldiers’ eonfidence In thetr superiora assure
power and forae® and guarantee that the honor
and interests of Prance and peace are more

‘ure than ever. In the name of the Repub-

NEWS OF THE WHEELMEN.

Automobile Racing on a Track Considered
Dangerous Sport,

After the automobile races at Guttenburg
last Tuesday both A. C. Bostwick and D, Wolfe
Bishop declared that they would not contest
any more on a track because of the risk, but ft
is to be noted that both are entered for the
races at Trenton. The bellef prevails that
they will not “scratch” when it comes to meeting
Alex Winton of Cleveland, who has issued an
open challenge to all America, The danwer inthe
sport was made very plain at Guttenburg when
the vehicles, weighing a ton, “skidded” from
four to seven fect to the side in turning corners,
The marks on the dirt showed this, and it is @
wonder the racers were notrackedapart, After
all was over it was noticed that a big tire on
one of the French “autos” was badly cut, and
the discovery naturally suggested the thought:
“Suppose that tire had burst when the vehicle
was going at full speed.” Mr. Bostwick said
that in his opinion he undoubtedly travelled
as fast as a mile a minute in the straights during
his mile in 1.27 4-4, because he had to slacken
speed so much when he made the turns,
