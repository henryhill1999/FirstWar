Presidents of the Big Compantes tn Town, bat
Not Ready to Talk -Ratlroad Meo Expect

FRetwoen 621 and 2% for Steel Rails,
It ia believed that there was a meeting in this
city veaterday of representatives of the com-
panies engaged in the manufacture of steel
raila to consider a radical reduction in the price
of ralis, which, notwithstanding the read) ust-
ment of values io other branches of the ateel
and iron busineas, has been maintained by the
manufacturers at $85 @ ton In view of the

 

change in fron market conditions this fleure |

is looked upon by the railroads as altogether
too high, and pressure has been brought to

hear upon the steel rail pool to reduce the price

It has, in fact, been reported that the schedule
yrice was really only nominal and that there
fad been some transactions in rails at as low
a figure as $22 @ ton

The utmost secrecy about the supposed meet
jug was maintained at the offices of the various
steel companies yesterday The presidents
of the leading companies were in town, among
them President C. M. Schwab of the Carnegle
company, President BF H. Gary of the Federal
Steel Company, President Powell Stackhouse
of the Cambria Steel Company and President
Walter Scranton of the Lackawanna Irop and
Steel Company At the offices of all these pres-
dents it was reported that they were “out
Just before 6 o'clock in the afternoon President
Gary came to the Federal Steel office, which
fe on the seventeenth floor of 71 Hroadway.,
having, it is said, just left the eleventh floor,

 

on which floor is the office of the Carnegie Com- |

to

pany, He declined absolutely even BAY
whether there had been a meeting or not

“Not a word to-night Not a word,” he
aaid

Prior to this Chairman H. H. Porter of the
Federal Steel Company had visited the oMee
of that company and had admitted that he
had heard that there was to be a meeting of
the steel rail men to consider the price of rauls
far the ensuing year. He said, however, that
he did not know where it would be held or what
would be done. Archer Brown of Rogers,
Krown & Co, was quoted in Wall Street as
having said that he believed the price ot
would he fixed at about Hehoped, however

    

 

 

that it would turn out be a dollar or two

FINANCIAL AND COMMERCIAL.

 

Tuvnsvay, Sept, 20.

In the early dealings in stocks to-day there
Wes an improvement in prices, but this was
succeeded by a decline and final faures were
with few exceptions below those of yesterday
The trading was wholly professional and the
conducted
with little reference to present or prosy ective

Speculatora made experimental
and finding it emier to extract gains
long side of the

conditions
ventures,
from the short than from the
market, applied themselves the work of
lowering values Wall Street has been
customed to witness a recession in stocks at this
seaxon of the year and therefore an advance
at this time might be looked upon as unnatural

Ihe dominant factors in the situation at
present tiay be said to be conducive to a depreci-

to
ace

ation in stocks A great strike is in progress,
the consequences of which are not yet detertut-
nable, and the tendency of money rates 1s

plainly upward fhe matter of chief impor-
tance, asa fact, has been and will continug for
many days to be money The ruling rate for
call money is now 2 per cent., and it is presumed
that the rate will advance in a ratio correspond-
ing with the decrease in the available supply
of funds. Money will flow to the South and
West for several weeks, but probably not in
as heavy volume as last year The resources
of the banks are far larger than they were in
1899, and it is believed that they will not be
reduced by Federal Treasury operations here-
after. On the contrary, the Treasury is in a
position to furnish help to the money market,
and doubtless will do so if such a step is found
necessary or desirable

Inasmuch asthe Sub-Treasury has been @ con-
siderable debtor at the Clearing House this
week, it is likely that the bank statement on
Saturday will show not nearly as large a loss
the statement of last Saturday.
4 material reduction in the surplus reserve
is probable, however, as the result of an in-
crease in the loans and therefore in the de-
the flotation of the German and

in cash as

posits, fron

Swedish loans hese loans will take no
actual money from this centre, as payment for
the securities is to be made with exchange

and not by shipments of gold to Europe. In-
they will bring money hither, as many
subseriptions are from outside of New York,
so that the loans may be of advantage, rather
than disadvantage, to the local money situa-
tion. These loans are being handled by exe
perienced financiers who realize the necessity
of avoiding a disturbance in money, and there
is assurance that they will do so

The interest of the speculative community
converged on Coal and,
Iron. There was extensive liquidation infthis
stock and it sustained a bad fall tn price. In
some quarters it was thought that the state-
ment of the company for August rendered
doubtful the eontinuanee of dividends, at
least at the rate of & per cent A dividend
was paid in May and another
of the same amount {mn August The other
and iron stocks were very weak, the
heaviest deelinea being in American Steel
and Wire, Colorado Fuel and [ron and Fed-
era) Steel While the sales of Brooklyn Rapid
Transit were extensive, the net loss in the
price of this stock was less than a point. The
report filed at Albany by the Brooklyn Heights
Ratlroad Compiny, which oper-
ates the Brooklyn Rapid Transit system, while
made up differently from the preliminary
rapid traneit report recently issned, seemed
to concur with the latter. The recessions in
Manhattan Railway and Metropolitan Street
Railway were fractional. There was a re-
newal of the effort\to break down People's
Gas and it waa fairly successful. There was a
slump, also, in Consolidated Gas Sugar
Refining was traded in on a liberal scale and a
lower quotation was secured for it

The declines in the anthracite stocks were not
especially large. Indeed, there were advances
in Delaware and Hudson and Delaware and
Lackawanna. The issues which suffered matt
in price were Reading first preferred and second
preferred. The belief in financial circles was
that the strike would become a failure from the
disinelination of the men to keep it up. Mis
aourt Paciflo was freely offered and sank fn
priee. It was said that a pool in the stock was
selling out. Kansas and Texas preferred
dropped abruptly on forced sales. A good deal
of Union Pacifie came on the market, but it waa
absorbed with comparative readiness. Northern
Pacifie resisted the pressure on the market, and
the losses in the Granger shares were not {m-
portant. The Atehison ylelded only
moderately The total busines@ on the Stock
Exchange was the largest {n weeks, and it was
distributed over a wide range of stocks. The
closing was irregular
