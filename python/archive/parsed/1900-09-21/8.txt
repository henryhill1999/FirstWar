HOW TO HIRE AN APARTMENT
OR A PRIVATE HOUSE
AT THE LOWEST RENTAL.

There never was a time in the history of New
York when there was sach a large and aban-
dant sapp!y of housing to let in proportion to
the demand as this year, The result ts that
hundreds of owners are offering reduced
rents, while others, though nominally main-
taining the old rents, make concessions tn the
way of free occapaacy, No tenant can be sure
that he is obtaining the terms he is entitled to
according to the actual condition of the mar-
ket without an extended tour of Investigation
and of diplomatio negotiations with agents,
Save yourself the necessity of a personal search
and of useless debates by inserting an adv, in
THE SUN stating the kind of accommodation
you want and the approximate location, This
will secure for you the best terms the market
has to offer.
