CURRENT SPORTING TALK,

THE BASEBALL SITUATION IS) AP-
PROACHING A CRISIS,

 

Association to Moet at Vhiladelphia Soon
~Outlook for New Organisation Ie
Dubious League ¢ irenit Committee Also

Convene ~ Rowing at Princeton,

Unless arrangements are changed at the
last moment the new American Assoctation
wil! hold a special meeting to consider the elr-
uit question at Philadelphia within forty-eight
hours, President Quin left here late on Mon-
day night for that city, fully intending to eall
the promoters together with the idea ot elther
aeclartog the movement a go oF deciding not
to proceed

Quin has not met with a great deal of en-
couragemont in the East. He visited Boston
and found that Tom McCarthy had prepared
everything on a sound basis, Then he went to
Providence, but he did not find matters so
favorable, It is understood that he conferred
with the owners of the Providence Eastern
League Club and also with other in-
dividuals who would like to buck a rival or-
ganization tn that city but whohave no money.
The Eastern League men could not see the
point of Quin's remarks and told him that they
are satisfied with their present berth,

Reaching this city Quin held @ long confer-
ence with the men who are anxious to locate a
club here, They showed him that it would be
impossible to secure grounds south of the Har-
lem River, and also advised him of the fact
that they had secured options on two sites in
the annexed district. Quin, it Is belleved,
turned down all propositions regarding
grounds north of the Harlem River and wound
up by saying that for the present New York
was out of it, According to the best informa-
tion obtainable arrangements have been made
to puta new club into Philadelphia, but the
assoviation cannot proceed without Balti-
more and possibly Washington, the latter
city to take the place of Providence.
The Western ond of the association, consisting
of Chicago, St. Louis, Milwaukee and Detroit,
isrenorted to be solid, Fach club te said to
have posted a forfeit of $10,000 to go on, but
unless the Eastern end of the proposed circult

is bolstered up the association will be unable
to begin the season, Even though they hav
Phila substantial coOperation in Boston fas

*hiladelphia, the association promoters wil
locked unless they can establish themselves
in two other cities, which at present appears to
bean impossibility.

 

The National League men are preparing to
make a move that will effectually kill off the
new Association movement. Indications point
toameeting of the Circuit Committee to be
held before the week is out. It was learned yes-
terday that Hart had left Chicago suddenly and
that Rogers of Philadelphia was in. this elty on
Monday night Both are meoibers of the
committee and have been waiting for orders
from Chairman Brush. It was also said yee-
terday that F, A, Abell, ope of the principal
owners of the Brooklyn and Baltimore, clubs,
had been called out of town and that Edward
{anion had taken an early train out of Balti-
pore for parts unknown, Just what move the
ague Will make is unknown, but the sharps
prediet an announcement that the circuit will
ye of twelve clubs, including  Indfanapolis
instead of Cleveland. Such & move
would settle the situation in Baltimore, for
Meuraw would be satisfied to continue as
manager of 4 League ciub there in preference
to jumping to an Association team, which
would probably have a fight on its hande from
the start. Whether such an announcement
on the part of the League would be lased
upon real intentions or upon a bluffis a matter
for conjecture, From a@ reliable source comes
the news that Von der Horst, one of the own-
ers of the Baltimore Club, has decided to
block all attempts at eircuit reduction, with
the idea of forcing Freedman to buy enough
good players toform a winning team or goon
another season with +mpty benches. Thatthe
Cireuit Committee knows something definite
relative to the intentions of the Brooklyn-Bal-
timore syndicate there can be no doubt, It
Von der Horst hus adhered to the origina! plan
of action the League is tied up, and no eight-
club circuit will be established, Hanlon has
given out an official statement that he is pre-
paring a southern trip for both the Brooklyn
and Baltimore teams, which is taken to mean
that the Circuit Committee has been unable to
do business, or that the magnates have decided
to atop the Association movement before it
becomes more formidable,

Hughey Jennings, the well known Brooklyn
player, gives a line on the new Association's
nancial strength. Jennings says he was ap-

proached by President Quin to manage the |

Milwaukee club and that he named terins that
were not exorbitant. According to Jennings,
Quin was unable to give @ substantial guar-
antee of good faith, whereupon the noted
player informed the President of the Associa-
tion that he would stick to the Brooklyn ciub
Jennings’s action is liable to carry much
weight with players of the League.

 

If championships are to be decided in aceord-
ance with weight limits, thereisa fine tangle
among the lightweights. It is conceded by
every boxing authority that the limit in this
class is 133 pounds and that all contests for
the championship must be fought at this
weight. When Erne and Lavigne met lagt
year at Buffalo their weight was notl133 pounds
ut 135, consequently in strict accordance with
the rules they did not fight forthe champion-
ship. Erne got 4 well-earned decision over
Lavigne and has since been called the cham-
pion, but Lavigne did not really lose his titie
until he was knocked out by George McFadden
at the Broadway Club. In that con-
test both men weighed in at 133 pounds,
which made it strictly achamplionship contest,
Later McFadden was easily beaten by Joe
Gans of Baltimore, also at 133 pounds, so that
technically Gans is the lightweight champion.
Jack O'Brien fought Erne for the title recently
at 133 pounds and the decision was a draw
Spike Sullivan is soon to meet Gangand the
winner will probably be matched against the
winner of the coming O Brien-Erne contest, in
which event the question of champion in this
class may be more definitely sett ed

At Princeton thev_are discussing the advis-
ability of putting a'Varsity crewonthe water
in the spring, The Tigers have shown
proficiency in all branches 6f sport except
aquatics, There was atime when they could
support an elght with only 500 undergrad.
uates, but that wasa long while ago. Thera
were many reasons, however, why they could
not turn out a first-clasa crew. First,
there was no river within pine miles
of the town, the only facillty being the
Raritan Canal. This waa principally why
rowing wus abandoned in the early ‘70's,
During the years when the crew practised
on the canal it suffered all sorts of ineon-

veniences on a body of water only thirty feet |
wide, together with unlocked bridges and |

passing boats. Lack of funds was another
cnuse for the loss of interes}. Recently, how-
ever, the question of aquatic inconveniences
has been solved. The new trolley road from
Princeton to Trenton has agreed to furnish
rapid transitse that crew candidates can go
there and rowon the Delaware River. This is
expected to boom rowing among the Tigers,
as the ride to Trenton will not consume more
than thirty-flve minutos,

Racquets,

PHILADELPHIA, Jan. 23.—The well-equipped
sourt of the Racquet Club, 023 Walnut street,
was the scene this afternoon of an exhibition
of racquets the like of which has never before
been equalled in this city. The conditions in
both events called for a double rubber of best

 

A $95,000 SALE OF TROTTERS.

 

Russian Horsemen Buy Eleven Flyers
From James Butler,

One of the most notable sales of trotting

horses ever made to European breeders and

turfmen has just been closed by James Butler

ofthis city, Eleven high-bred young flyers |

from his East View Farm near Tarrytown
changed hands for something like $25,000,
according to report, and were sent abroad yes-
terday by the North German Lloyd steamer,
Lahn. Their destination is St. Petersburg,
The buyers were two Rusalan horsemen, Con-
stantin and Franz Blenkle, who came to this
country recently {In search of promising young
trotters for racing and breeding purposes,
They were in this city only three days, moat
of which time was spent at Butler's country
place in Westchester county,

In point of breeding it would be hard to find
a lot of higher-class harness horses than the
ones that are on their way to the land of the
Cear. The collection included one stallion and
ten mares. Ludwig, the stallion, Is a half-
brother to Butler's noted horse Directum

Kelley. 2:08%, winner of the $10,000 Mer-

BICYCLES AND MOTORS.

THE JOINT SHOW AT THE GARDEN
GROWS IN FAVOR.

 

 

Many Illastrative Points on How New Proe-
esses and Machinery Have Refined Con-
atruction—A Missing-Link Auto Device
Adaptable to Any Four-Wheeled Vehicle,

It was another gala night in the cycle settle-
ment at Madison Square Garden last night.
The attendance, instead of falling away after
the first rush, is showing adally increase. Dur-
ing the afternoon of yesterday what the at-
tendants at the spaces call ‘study hours,”
there were 50 per cent. more persons present
than on Monday. Souvenire are not distrib-
uted in tho afternoons asa rule, and those who
are present at that time are of the pur-
poseful kind, Not always, though, are they
of the thoroughly expert class who can
handle the jargon of the wheel without a slip.
Illustrative of this was the incident of a woman
who had concluded to buy a certain make of
wheel and was in the stand talking over the
details of what she would want. The salesman
asked her how high a gear she would want and
the reply was:

"Oh, I don't want a high one atall; I like
the low gear, because I like to keep near to
the ground,”

The salesman tried to keep a straight face,
and failed miserably, but the woman forgave
him when he explained what the gear is.

The show has always been the occasion of a
sort of reunion on the part of the old-time
riders, racing men and others who have drifted
apart and this feature still is found. Harry
Wheeler, Arthur Zimmerman, Henri Fournier
and other lesser lights of the track were present
yesterday, Asany of the veterans moves about
the aisles he encounters many interruptions
for a hand-shake, for many of the veteran
cracks are now in the trade,

In discussing the improvements of bicycles
the word “refinement” has been so often em-
ployed to characterize what is going on, with-
out any further specifications that more than
a few have begun to regard it as meaningless,
ora kind of general glossing over. An illus-
tration of how improved processes mean re-
finement was furnished by two dealers at
separate times yesterday, The first was show-
ing the points of his wheel and called atten-
tion to some outside reénforcements on the
lower tube, the seat-post strut and the rear
forks. They were neat and substantial. With.
out pointing any moral he remarked
that until the process of cleaning brazed joints
by electrical immersion such reénforcements
were impoasible because a man could not get
at the brazed seama with a file in the place
where they were, The new process that re-
placed the file in this instance and in many
others, ia that of putting the joints into an
alkati bath and then turning on acurrent of
electricity, Under this treatment the particles
of brasa adhering to the outside of the joint
leave the frame and cling to anodes at the
sides of the bath, This process eliminates the
dangers of unskilful filing and makes better
and cheaper work possible.

In the second instance a reporter was talking
with a maker who shows an eighteen-poun
racing wheel and a twenty-one-pound machine
Cae is guaranteed for road work at $40, He
sald:

“Look at that road wheel. A few years ago
no one could have produced jtfor any such
money. There was toolmuch handwork neces-
Bary to pare Wheels down then and that was
expensive. It is only the great prog-
ress and refinement in  cycla making
machtpery that renders such prices possible,
and they are better wheels at that.”

For the most part handle bars are the same as
last year, the upturned still having most favor.
There is nota wooden handle bar at the show,
and three adjustable varieties almost monopol-
ize that fleld. There is, though, a new idea in
bars that commends itself to every one as the
solution ot many grip troubles. It is made of
even diameter and finished without grips.
Over the ends is placed a cap that forms a
small head atthe tin ofthe bar, Over this can
be stretched any form of the spongy rubber
grips and they can then be slipped about toany
position from the ends tothe middle. The lit-
tle ridge at the tip keeps them from working
off.

The combination of an automobile exhibit
with the cycle show is proving a good thing
for both. The wheelmen get interested in the

 

| automobiles and those who go to scoff at

bicycles remain to buy, The cousinship or
close relation of these two classes of vehicles is

as apparent at the Garden as it {sin the factory |

and on the road. The same love of sport and
pleasure in the open imbues the enthusiasts of

| both classes and as road waytarera they have a

community of interests. There are twenty-
nine motor vehicles at the show. Of these
nineteen are run by electricity, aix by gasolene
and four by steam, The character of the ve-
hicles is ag follows: Ten runabouts, four de-
livery wagons, three brakes, two phaetons, two
dos-a-dos,two quadricyeles.one dam iscoach,one
theatre bus, one stanhope, one bicycle, one
combination or transformable from delivery
wagon to runabout and one cab with automo-

bile fore-carriage. Of them all, the greatest |

ovelt ef vith ¢ 0 Me i “e
novelty is the cab with & motor fore. carriage | gelking, 148; Loebr, 156; Meyer, 180, To

This was a iate arrival and is attracting great
interest because of its being entirely new and
promising revolutionary th ngs. It is designed
with the idea of making possible the conver-
sion of any carriage, cab or track into an auto-
mobile. [tis like the fore track of any four-
wheeled vehicle, having two wheels,surmounted
by gasolene storage tanks, carburetor, driving
and steering gear complete in itself, sv
that by removing the front wheels from
a vehicle it conld be set in place
after holes had been eut in the floor
tolet through the controlling rods. The ex-
hibit at the Garden is an ordinary London cab
with a fore-carriage under it. The latter is of
German invention, Iris regarded asa sort of

missing link between the eraof horses and of |

motors. The fore-carriage shown weighs about

five hundred pounds. With a four-horse-

power motoriit costs $500 andiwith a six-horse-

power $400. Although built originally asa
asolene! motor, electricity or other power can
e substituted.
