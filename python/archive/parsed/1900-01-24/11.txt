Manufacturers Ask Us to Buy Less

USLIN UNDERWEAR is costing more. So much more that the
makers hope we will not compel them to ship in all we bar-

ned for.
- Garments that we bought for $4.50 a dozen are not to be had under

 

$5.50 today, and in many cases prices have risen a third, or even as much |

as half—so that $10 goods are costing about $15.
How do you think the real smart makers are getting around the ad-

vance? They are skimping sizes—night gowns shorter or narrower, Or |

both, saving maybe ten yards of muslin in a dozen gowns; flounces are
skimped, saving as much as a yard of embroidery on a petticoat. And,
maybe worst of all, garments are being made of print cloth, which can

scarcely be classed as muslin,

As to the higher prices, we must pay them with the rest as a rule.
‘As to skimped garments, we will not have them at any price, But with higher prices already
established; with some delay in even forced delivery of our long-ago purchases, we shall sell, today
and for the little while the lots hold out—

Muslin Underwear at Least Prices Known

Ana this includes as well, the sacques and wrappers and waists, counted
with the underwear, though of other fabrics than muslin and linen.

An Upheaval of Upholstery

There's been a turning-over of the stocks, Odd lots, small quantities, some goods that were
fondled too dearly by contemplating purchasers, are all brought to the front. Reductions in prices
are made all along the line. Most of the offering is of wholly good, desirable stu‘fs—particularly
trne of the lace curtains, the shades and the canopies, They're without a single fault—except, in-
sufficient in quantity. And that fault creates opportunities for savings such as these—

Lace Curtains— Window Shades—

! In Irish Point Curtains there is good picking Opaque shades, in various good colors, made
; among 2 and 3-pair lots—many of these at up of remnant pieces, at 35c each. They're
p about half original prices. Reductions, too, easily worth double.

Prices throughout these stocks of shades are
particularly moderate, and should interest
builders as well as housekeepers. We want
builders and owners of large office buildings
to learn the savings offered here, on large
orders, for strictly best materials,

Cosey Corner Canopies—

Putting these up now at greatly reduced charges.
Canopies comprise the frames, hangings,
draperies, tassels, spears and lantern. One
style at $25 that formerly cost $35. An-
other at $40, instead of $50, Still another
at $53, for which the previous moderate
charge was $62. Specimens of these vari-
ous styles are on view in the Oriental Room,
Third floor, Fourth ave.

Down Cushions—-

There’s a group of pillows with coverings of
East India prints, that are selling at 1.15
each. Formerly $1.75. Another group
with Bagdad and Damascus coverings, in
various striped patterns, at $1.35 each,
They are worth at least $2.25.

Men’s Shirts to Order

We believe our workers have the knack and skill to make perfect-fitting shirts for any normally
l shaped man. If there is the least short-coming, consider the loss ours,

That's half the battle.

Then the materials, As to them, we know that we bring over more exclusive and elegant fab-
rics than come to any other one shirt maker, Five hundred and forty-four styles are shown this
“Opening Day.’’ Charvet of Paris leads the Old World in the charm of the fabrics he has
woven. We have his weaver working for us as well.

Beal & Inman of Old Bond Street, London, are probably the next in shirt fame, but they have
close seconds in dear old Lonnon town, and we have their combined findings-out.

White Shirts, $1.50 to $12—the latter made of batiste-chiffon, of threads so fine that the loom-
room air is kept moist and the shuttles work under water. After the web is woven it is
strong enough—and luxurious,

Percale Shirts, $3 Linen Batiste Shirts, $10 Madras Shirts, $3.50

Cheviot Shirts, $3.50 Thread-and-Silk Shirts, $12 Silk-and-Linen Shirts, $12

The more particular you are, the more you'll appreciate the things we have gathered.
