that he was an old friend of Mr. Huntington

Charles H Tweed, general counsel and Rec-
ond Vice-President of the Southern — Pacific
Company, who was known as the confidential
Adviser of Mr. Huntington, said yesterday,
when asked about the existence of a will: ‘Is
therea will? Leannot talk about that matter
until after the funeral, but you would be safe
in assuming that there is a will.”

Mr. | weed declined to discuss the question as
t: who might become the successer of Mr.

untington as President of the Southern
Yacifie “HE. Huntington, his nephew, is the
First Vice-President of the company,” said Mr
Tweed. “Heis now the chief officer of the
road Any question as to a permanent succés-
sor is a matter for future arrangement.’”

There is a chance that Mr. Tweed himself may
become Pre ident of the road, it being under-
stood that Gen. Thomas H. Hubbard, repre-
sentative of the Searles-Hopking interest, and
Speyer & Co, together, have the naming of
Mr. Huntington's successor.: Mr. Tweed n

UNION LABOR FIGHTING A WOMAN.

 

Fffert to Keep Mrs. Cashing From Earning a
Living as a Barber, ;
SpPRinorienD, Mass, Aug. 15.--Beoause the
National Journeymen Barbers’ Association
does not make provision in Its conatitution
for women members the local journeymen
barbers’ union and also the walking delegates

; of the other labor unions are persecuting Mra.

M. A. Cashing, the only woman conducting

a barber shop in this eity. The constitution
of the National Barbers’ Association specifies
that only males who can comply with the re-
quirements can become members of the branches
of that body, but «ome of the broader minded
leaders of labor organizations here say that
this diserimination is unjust

Mrs. Cashing came to Springfield about a
year ago and opened a barber shop, but the
agitation made it necessary for her_to drop
outof business foratime. Last May she began
business at her home on Main street and was
doing well when the labor union people began
to get after her at the instigation of the regular
menibers of the local barbers’ union, who be-
Q7idaed her what trade she had. Many of

irs, Cashing's customers, who were members
of various unions, told her that they had been
warned that they would he fined $5 if they con-
tinued to patronize a non-union anon.

Mrs. Cashing consulted the President of the
Barbers’ Union, and also the officials of the
Central Labor Union, but they told her that
they could do nothing for her and her request
for membhrisisip in the local union would not
be enterta ied for a moment. She says she
complies with all the requirements of the bar-
bers’ uffion here, opening at. 7 o'clock in the
morning. closing at 6:30 on Monday avenings
And at & other evenings, except Saturdays.
She has two chairs, at one of which her daugh-
ter, 18 veara old, doea some business on Wednes-
days and Saturdays. She charges the regular
seala of prices and conforms {n every other
Way to union requirements.

It is agreed by Central Labor Union men
in this city that to discriminate against this
shop simply because it is run by a woman Is
unjust, inasmuch as the whole object of union-
ism is to protect the laborer, aud Mrs. Cashing
is one of them. The argument is made by
walking delegates that union men have no
right to patronize a shop that does not havea
union card, but it is pointed ont that they are
not consistent in this and call attention to the
many large stores that do not employ union
help. A year ago the Central Labor Union
refused to grant the request of the Journey.
men Barbers’ Union for war on Mrs. Cashing's
place, and it is believed that when the matter
comes up for discussion again that the barbers
will get soma wholesome advice as to the rights
of a woman to earn her living without inter-
ference.

EMPLOYER AT A UNION MEETING.

Shirt-Waist Girls Settle One Strike and
Threaten Another.

A meeting of the Shirt Waist Makers’ Union,
which is composed principally of girls, was
held last night at the University Settlement
at Rivington and Eldridge streets. Thirty
girls who struck against « reduction of wages
in Frank & Schloss'a factory, 199 Greene street,
came to the meeting in a body, along with
200 of the girls employed in the factory of J.
& M, Cohen at 189 Greene street. Mrs. Frank
head of the firm of Frank and Schloss, attended
the meeting and settled the strike after see
ma 6 committee of her employees,

A committee was uppointed to see the firm
of J. & M. Cohen, who employ 1,000 hands,
and ask that some alleged grievances be reme-
died. A atrike is to be the alternative. It
wus also decided to see a lawyer, with « view
to prosecuting the firm for the arrest of two
members of the union on Tuesday evening
for distributing circulars about the meeting
to the workers as they were leaving the factory,
The two members of the union were discharged
by Magistrate Hogan in Jefferson Market
court yesterday morning. .

 

 

HAUGHTY BAKERS OF THE BRONX,

They Make Cake, but the Bakers of Bread
Wont Look Up to Them,

The Bakers’ Union of The Bronx is kicking

against an alleged class feeling among bakers,

which it wants to have suppressed. It says

| that the cake bakers, since they formed a union

of their own, have hela themselves aloof from
the bread bakers, and that they act as if they
were of a superior calling and were entitled to
more consideration than the bread bakers
The latter deciced yesterday to carry their
complaint to the Journeyman Bakers and
Confectioners’ National Union, with which both
unions are affiliated, and ask that the cake
bakers be compelled to join the bread bakers’
organization, which is known simply as the
Bakers’ Union. They will say that as bread
is the staff of life there is more dignity in mak-
ing bread than in making cake

Parsons May Not Head the Letter Carriers.

John N, Parsons, General Master Workman
of the Knights of Labor, who is also General
President of the National Association of J etter
Carriers, it was announced yesterday, has de-
cided to decline a renomination for the latter
office. The reason he gives for this is that ha
wants to devote all of his time to the order
of the Knights of Labor. Jt was learned yes-
terday. however, that the National Association
is likely to vote for affiliation with the American
Federation of labor. A ee to that effect
has been made by Samuel iompers, President
of the latter organization If the [atter
Carriers’ Association joins the A. F. of 1. the
head of the Knights of Labor could not be its
President.

More Hatters Strike.

Orance, N. J., Aug. 15%—The hatmakers
in Brennan & Carr's factory went on strike
to-day because the firm would not agree to
ahew schedule of wages. An increase in wages
was asked for and refused. The loca! officers
of the Hatters’ Union have now placed the
matter in the hands of the executive officers
of the nationa) association. They will take
the case upto-morrow. The union hatters
in the Berg factory also quit to-day because
of a misunderstanding. t is expected that
the national officers will settle the matter.

 

Labor Trouble at William C. Whitney’s Home.

At yesterday's meeting of the Building
Trades section of the Central Federated Union,
Delegate Kelly of the Electra! Workers’ Union
reported that the electrical workers at William
C. Whitney's new residence at Westbury, I. I,
received $2.50 a day instead of the union wages
of $4 a day. ‘They were emploved by the
Metropolitan Construction Company, which
was also paying non-union wages to electrical
workers at Mr. Whitney's New York residence,
the delegate said. ‘The Secretary of the section
was instructed to write to Mr. Whitney, asking
him to see that the contractors paid union
wages.

“ ANTIS” IN FAVOR OF BRYAN

THIRD TICKET MEN NOW REDUCED TO
NINE IN NUMBER.

They Are Still Hopetal of Getting Up a Na-
tional Ticket-To Play a Waiting Game
~The Anti-Impertalist Teague Has 250
Delegates All Are for Indorsing Bryan.
INDIANAPOLIS, Avg. 15.--The contingent of

antl-imperialista, headed by T. M. Osborne of

New York, who inet here yesterday and held

the first seasion of their national convention,

have practically given up the ghost and are |

how ready to confess that the “Antis” of the
country, as represented in the American anti-
Impertalistio League, are firmly wedded to
Bryan's course,

The delegates to the Liberty Congress to-day
did heroic work among the third party men
from the moment of their arrival. Late last
night under the persuasive eloquence of Bout-
well, Smith, Mize, and others, the advocates
of a third ticket began to desert their stand-
ards and early thia morning it was found that
the majority of them had moved bodily into
the Teague camp and were opposed to nomi-
nating a ticket, Mr. Ehrioh called a confer-
ence and only nine members of the new na-
tional party responded

When the suggestion was made to go on with
the convention, the idea was so Indicrous that
even Mr. Osborne was foread to smile It
was then confessed that the meeting had
proved a failure and the nine entered upona
discussion of the expediency of calling another
convention to meet in Boston or New York
where the invironment would be more con-

genial

The opening session of the “TAberty Congress”
emphasives the belief that the body will in-
dorse Bryan and Stevenson. That the thought
of the delegates is centered upon the Demo-
eratic national candidate was shown by the
enthusiasm that his name evoked in the meeting,
The sentiment that MeKinley must be defeated
at any cost, uttered by F. Burritt Smith, was
received with prolonged applause,
and when the sane speaker
veutioned the possible indorsement of
Bryan, there were shouts of approval from
all parts of the hall, ending in great applause,
All the leaditw spirits in the Congress are out-
spoken in their advocacy of aresoluition indors-
ing Bryan. The make-up of the Committees
on Resolutions seems to foreshadow a pledge
on the part of the league to support Bryan
and Stevenson

The initial meeting of the “Liberty Con-
gress” was held to-aay with some 260 dele.
gates present The meeting was called to
oraer by George G. Marcus of Philacelphia
and the Rev. Dr. Bigelow prayed. Fawin
Burritt Smith was nominated for temporary
chairman and made a brief apeech in which
he outlined the various steps that have been
taken by “a sordid commercialism to fasten
imperialism upon the country as a permanent
policy.

The Committees on Resolutions and Cre-
dentials were then appointed and the meeting
adjourned and a second session was held this
afternoon to hear reports, The personnel
of many delegations, especially the Indiana
delegation, has suggest that it was made
up for the purpose of helping along the Bryan
indoresment, as only Silver Republicans and
Democrats are popresented {2 if. Republican
leaders declared that three-fourths of the men
in the convention were for Bryan four years
ago, and that they had no right to be called
non-partisan.

The National party men at one time con-
cluded to leave the city to-night, but at a con-
sultation this afternoon a change was made
in their plans and they determined to see the
thing through. One of them said to-night that
a number of telegrams were sent out as a result
of the late meeting and they were waiting for
answers, When asked ff they had sounded
Thomas B. Reed, Senator Caffery and others
as to whether they would accept an anti-im-
rerlalistic nomination, they refused to answer,

here is little doubt but the secret conference
determined to learn whether a nomination
would be accepted and if favorable replies are
received the nine may yet nominate a ticket

4 meeting of the Congress given up entirely
to speechnaking was held to-night, at which
Fx-Sovernor Boutwell, President, presided
owing to the failure of Carl Schurzto atten
his place on the programme was filled by Sig-
mound Zeister of Chicago who presented the
German enti-imperiallst view’

A letter was read from Bourke Cockran de-
finiog his situation. fle believes that a crisis
threatens the country and that Brvan should
receive the euflrage of all who oppose the
foreign policy of the administration.

 

WHARTON BARKER INELIGIBLE?
Assertion That the Acceptance of a Title of
Nobility From the Czar Hars Him From Office.

LAIncotn, Neb., Aug. 15-—-A new phase of
the Nebraska political situation is the raising
of a question as to the eligibility of Wharton
Barker, candidate of the Mid-road Populists
for the Presidency. It is alleged that Harker
while acting in an official capacity for the
United States Government, accepted a title
of nobility from the Czar of Russia. This, it is
asserted, makes Barker ineligible for any office

Judge Wilbur F. Bryant, court reporter for
the Nebraska Supreme Court, has issued a
public statement on the question. He con-
cludes by saying: “Barker, even if elected,
could not legally take the office A tile of
nobility received from any foreign Prince or
ruler is incompatible with American citizen-
ship. Barker received such a title from the
Czar of Russia as a reward for services ren-
dered that Goveroment The title was ‘The
Order of St. Wencelas.’

“An alien when naturalized, is required to
renounce any auch title he may hold at the time.
Section E.2165, United States Statutes, 1878: ‘No
Minister or diplomatic agent can receive such
a title for himself or any one else’ ‘The Con-
clitution forbids the granting of any title of
nobility by the United Stites, and forbids any
person holding any office of trust or profit under
the United States to accept any title. Constitu-
tion, Article 1, section 9, sub. section 9. Barker
was the agent of the United States Govern-
ment at thetime he accepted this title, The
United States also recognizes the right of expa-
triation. Statutes of 1878, section 19. Barker's
act was clearly an act of patriation *

LINEMAN SHOCKED IN

—_—-

When He Feil From the Pole to the Ground
Several Women Fainted,

John McGraw, 32 yeara old, a lineman living
at Smith and Pacific streets, Brooklyn, was
shocked by a live wire and thrown from a fifty-
foot telegraph pole at Bay Seventeenth street
and Cropsey avenue, Bath Beach, yesterday
afternoon. He had climbed the pole to repair
a cable box and was about tocut a telegraph
wire when a small sheet of flame shot up from
an electric light wire, rendering him uncon-
scious. He afterward toppled on the branches
ofa tree beneath and landed on his back on the
ground. Several women who were sing
when his body fell before them fainted. McGraw
was attended by Dr. John De Mund and re-
moved to the Norwegian Hospital. His skull
and back were fractured and his arm was badly
burned. It is thought that he will die.
