WIN AND DRAW|

Will the League Discipitne McGann and Wol-
vertom for Their Fist Fight.

In view of the vontinued blindness of the
National League magiates as to the cause of
the poor attendance all over the country, it may
be well to call their attention to the rough-and-
tumble fight indulged in at St. Louis on Tues-
day between McGann of St. Louls and Wolver-

The Brooklyns attempted to play a double } ton of Philadelphia; also, to the fact that Haw-

peader in Cincinnati yesterday, The Cham-
pions won the first contest, but darkness ended
the second, when the score was tied. As the
Pittsburgs took their third straight game from
the New York tallenders, Hanlon's men have
a lead of 76 polntsan advantage that is not
qxactly safe in view of Brooklyn's coming
geries in the Smoky City, St. Louis won handily
from the Philadelphias, who fell further away
from second place. The Quakers are now
yi points behind Pittsburg. Rain prevented
the Boston-Chicago game in the Windy City.

The results
Brook!ya, 3; Cincinnatl, 2 (first game).
Brooklyn, 4; Cincinnati, 4 (second game).

ley of New York threatened a spectator in
Pittsburg with a rock, which was hastily picked
up to resent an alleged ineult. Not long ago
Doyle of the New Yorks slugged Umpire Emalie
in Cincinnati, Both were arrested and Doyle
pleaded guilty to the charge of aseau)t. With
4 flourish of trumpets the magnates had it an-
nounced that the row would be “investigated,”
and furthwith President Young and Inspecteur
John B. Day were seemingly put to work on the
case. Then followed a letter to President
Young from the head and front of the New
York club, in which it was stated that Doyle,
if guilty, should be punished, but that there
were other players who would have to be dealt
with to @ similar manner. Somebody buazed
a few words of wisdom into President Young's
ears after that and both he and Inspector Day

took in their horns. ult: Doyle has not

But McGann and Wolverton do not belong
to the New York club. They indulged in a
disgraceful fight, something on the gs of
the encounter between Joyce and »kley
at the Polo Grounds in i808, when the former
hit the latter in the head with the ball. The
ease's President now has a chance to offend

oth John I. Rogers of Philadelphia and Frank
De Hass obison of St. |oula by suspend-
ing Razors for disorderly conduct. Will
he do it? Well, it's a good 2 to | bet that he will
not take the chance, especially in view of the
talk relative to hie probable remova! from
otige after this season.

he case of Hawley can be disposed of oreny.
He did not commit so grave an offence as Doyle
of the same team, and as Doyle escaped, so must
fawiey. In striking contrast to the_policy of
ident Young is that of Ban Johnson, Pree-
ident of the progressive Amerioan League Re-
cen’ly, one of the Detroit players, Elberfield,
was guilty of such flagrant rowdyism that John-
son suepended him. — There was a howl of dis-
approval from the Detroit club owners but
Johnson's word was law. President Young
ould exercise the same authority if he dares.
ut he is dominated by several men in the
councila of the League who are too narrow
seraced to see the real reason for baseball's
slump.

The rumor, by the way, that Young may
be suoceeded by C. H. Ebbets of the Brooklyn
club is etill in circulation. Supposing that
the rumor is based upon truth, how much
more authority would Ebbeta have’? If he
gc the place it would be solely through the

fluence of te. men who at present control
the Lengue. Fbbete would be a uluried offt-
cela! just the sane as Young. If ha took any
radical uction on his own responsibility, there
would be some hot old times unless the mug-
nates in the meantime conchided to uliow
\oung’s successor to ride over them rough
shod. No president of the ‘National lencue
will ever be u success unless he can have power
enough to dictate to the men who own the
clubs aad pay the chiet executive's salary,
And just at present the magnates ure not built
that way.

ANOTHER BASEBALL YARN.

 

Improbable Stery That the New Yorks and
Brooklyns Will Consolidate.

Somebody has sprung a yarn to the effect
that the latest baseball shakeup in the National
League will be the consolidation of the New
York and Brooklyn teams, the new aggregation
to play alternately at the Polo Grounds and at
Washington Park. In that way this city would
be represented by one team, in which event
Washington or Baltimore would be taken into
the ciroutt as the eighth city. According to
the yarn, Abell and Ebbets, who are friendly
disposed toward the President of the New York
club, will try to win over their partners, Von-
der Horst and Hanlon, who are particulariv

bitter toward Freedman. If they su id a
grand consolidation will be effected, with Han-
as manager of the New Yorks and a champion
team to represent tne Greater City without

opnoeit n.
he scheme reads well, but, as a matter of
fact, there is a wide breach between all of the
prockiyn owners and the New York club's

ident. It is also true that before any such
oo i nm could ne effected the New York
club wou) De porperied to os! ite stock in two
with the Brook t men, and Would aleo have to
put up a big cas nus for the services of the

players. As it is not the policy of the NewYork
ely to put out money for players it ix hard to
believe that there is any ground for the circula-

tion of such a report. As Tae SUN haa re-
peatediy stated, no deal can be consummated
hat will revive the interest in baseball until the
magnates have ot purizes the game of the
evils that bave emptied the grandstands and
bleachers. Palpable moves to get gate reoript«
out of ihe public pocket are useless under the
present conditions,

A Kueck-Out That Caused Wild Laughter.

There was aa unusual ecens at theSeaSide
Bporting Club of Coney Island on Tuesday
night when Tim Callahan of Philadelphia
was in the act of knocking out the overrated
“Itsy” Ryan of Brooklyn. Usually when a
knock-out {a in progress a crowd, though ex-
cited in the extreme, does not indulge in acts
of wild hilarity. But in this instance as Ryan
was vigorously beaten to the bourds,the spec-
tators burst into roars of laughter and finally
held their sides in pain. This merriment was
due to the booming Ryan had received from
his manager, John P. Dunn, The latter had
often declared that Ryan was a phenomenon

and would be the man to beat Terry McGovern.
Sull in of his previous matches Ryan was
pitted marks, who were

showed any marked degree of Sighting abi

Ryan look like a fifth-rate a:nateur the crowd
could not control its feelings and when the
knock-out came the air was filled with shrieks
that betokened unmistakable joy.

A Pointer for Referee Charley White.

Attention is once more called to the viola-
tion of the rule which prohibits a pugilist's
seconds from offering advice of any kind dur-
ing the rounds, During the recent Fitzsimmons-
Ruhlin battle no less a personage than Jim
Corbett constantly broke the rules without
so much as a remonstrance from the referee.
Charley White.

Before the fight it. was well understo
that Corbett would offer advice during the
rounds and Ruhlin, a8 a result, was constantly
on the lookout for it. Corbett kept up a run-
ning fire of advice and comments, and at one
period he became so boisterous that a police-
man was forced to suppress him.

feree White, who is presiding nowadays
at all of the big fights, is rea as A clove
student of the rules. If he will devote a little
attention to the seconds who, like Corbett,
are incessantly fracturing the Queensberry
code he will met with the approval of those
who go to fights to see men put up their hands
in a fair, stand-up contest, and not to hear the
bawling of those whose ooly duty is to handle
the contestants when they reach their chairs,

Test of New Motor Bicycle—Jimmy Michael

An interesting test of a new motor bicycle
was made on the Merrick road near Valley
Stream yesterday aftesno 1, The inventor,
who {4 a young men not long out of his teens,
had the machine conveyed to Valley Stream
and was accompanied by several friends, The
young man rode the machine over the twenty-
mile course used so much by the ¢ontinuous
century riders. Will fl. Brown followed on a
bioyole of the regular sort. The authorities
of the several villages on the route are strict on
speeding just now, and no effort was made to
@0 at any speed except when they had a clear
bit of level road. Then the motor bieycle
was sent along at a lively clip, the little machine
fairly eating up space, The twenty miles was
made in one hour and fifteen minutes. The
application of power aa applied to a bicycle
is new as regards the size and weight of the

motor, The entire machine weighs about

REPAIRING S1-FOOTERS.

Altair and Shark Severely Twisted in the
Astor Cup Race.

BrisTou, R. I., Aug. 15.—The two new sloops
of the S1-foot racing class—Altair, owned by
Cord Meyer of New York, and Shark, owned by
F. Lothrop Ames of Boston—have arrived here
from Newport in pretty bad condition from
the knocking about they experienced in the
Astor oup race off Newport on Monday. The
yachts are, if anything, in a worse condition
than were the 70-footers after the last of the
races in the series for the Newport cup. Both
the racers had bows twisted very badly and
lifted upward to a greater angle at the forefoot
than were the 70-/ooters a short time ago. The

tems, from a point just abaft of where the
foreatay leads to the deck, bend downward,
po the twist somewhat suggestive of the

tter 5.

“The Shark haa been hauled out on the marine

{lway at the boat shops to be repaired and
fave extra bracing. The frames were twisted
and there were signs of the rudder t neving
started, One of the planks was broken an
the underbody enewe indjcations of the
planks working violently. The white wood
of 9 edges could be seen and um hung
out of the seams forward.

The Altair has been hauled out on the
Walker's Cove marine railway. She was
probably a trifle worse off on her underbody
than the Shark, as the latter had meial braces
placed on each aside of her forefoot two weeks
ago, which bably made her a trifle stiffer
forward. r. Meyer's racer had her stem
scarf pulled away from the fastening by the
sirain forward so much that there was a seam
open nearly its whole length a quarter of an
inch in width. The ocakum bung out in strings
under the forefoot, while water trickled out
of the seams toward the botton: of the lead.

The absence of metal keels in the construc-
tion of the boats naturally makes them weak
when in a seaway, working the frames out of
sha and making the planks seesaw with
each other when carrying sail, The Mineola,
Mr. Belmont's 70-footer, arrived this morning
for anew boom.

The 7@-Foet Sicops Ready fer the Second
Series of Races for the Newport Cup.

Nrwpont, Aug. 15.-The second five races
in the series between the 70-foot sloops sailed
of Newport for the $1,000 cup offered by the
Newport Yacht Racing Association will begin
to-morrow and @ill continue on Ang. 18, 20, 22
and 24. The only change made in the pro-
gramme is that the start will be made at 11:20
instead of noon. The rachts are all ready to

ace and with the exception of the Mineola

ave not left their moort since the Astor
Cup race on Monday. The Mineole was towed
to rated this morning to, have some minor
repairs made, but will on hand for the race
to-morrow. The Mineola thus far has most

inte for the cup. She has elght to her credit,
he Yankee six and the Rainbow one point.
A new provision has heen made that the yachts
must finish before 7 o'clock in the evening.
After that hour no time will be taken, but the
race will be resalled the following day.

Sanatoca, Aug. 16.—The Saratoga race-
track was in much better condition to-day
than yesterday, and the management decided
to run the Kensington hurdle race. Dr. Fich-
berg, was, of course, an odds-on favorite, with
Ben Eder and Mr. Stoffel, both from the stable
of J. W. Colt, quoted at 13 to 10. The books
took liberties with Mr Stoffel and they laid
as good a4 2 tol that he would not finish seo-
ond, But Ben Fader fell, and the bookmakers
who went out of line lost quite asum of money.
Ben Fder went right to the front and led Dr.
Eichberg for a mile and three-quarters. Then
he hit a hurdle, leaving Dr. Kichberg to win,
pulled up to a walk, by « sixteenth of a mile.
Mr. Stoffel, who had been trailing all the way,
finished in second place, while Ben Eder, who
had been remounted by Finnegan, went the
course and took third money. Callahan, who
rode Mr. Stoffel, was called to the stand by
the stewards, who asked him why he Iay so
far out of the race. He said the horse had
no speed, and this ended the matter.

Fourteen maiden two-year-olds raeponded to
the bugle call in the first race and, as usual in
such races, there were many good things. Bran-
dy Smash closed a alight favorite over Annu
and The Jade, with Cogswell backed from 10 to6
to 1 and Quite Right from 10toStoi. Thestart
was a very bad one, with Cogswell several lengths
in front. He maintained his advantage to the
stretch, where Brandy Smash took the lead and

won, ridden out, by half a length from the 20 to
b chance, Jils Greenwood ermless was well
acked tq win the second race but McAddie took
the track at the end of a quarter and won by a
length and a half 5

Queen of Bong had nothing to beat in the
third race and won without any trouble The
fourth was a good betting race. Gibraitar and
Meehanus opene’ equal favorites at 7 to 4 but
both went up in the betting when Sparrow Wing
had been backed from 12 to 7 to 1 and John
Yerkesfrom3tol tolltoS Meehanus led all
the way and won easily from John Yerkes.

Cuicaco, Aug. 1h. --More ratn fell during the nigh

finished strageiing across the track. Fortunately,
the entries were made when there was prom ot
rain, and the events were for the most part run in
accordance with the public form of the horses which
competed, four favorites winnin The best race of
the day was the handicap in which John Baker, Hand-

ON THE GRAND CIRCUIT.

 

Favorites Agaim Beaten at the Giens Falls
Meet.

GLENS FALis4, Aug. 18.—The second day of
the Grand Circuit Meeting here gave excellent
raciug in three events, leaving a fourth un-
finished. The attendance was good. Two
out of three of the favorites again went down
before the flelds, the feature being the failure
of Coney's driver, McHenry, in the first heat
of the 2:07 pace, to properly measure his dis-
tance and get inside the flag. Connor and
Sheldon made a hot race down the stretch,
both under the whip, which was called a dead
heat. The last quarter was in 30%, and that
was too fast a clip for McHenry to close up any
distance. » Coney had sold a three-to-one favor-
ite in the pools, and with Coney barred, Sheldon
was even money against the reat of them.

Sheldon, closely pushed by Connor, led off
thé second heat, but the latter broke badly on
the first stretch. He was laid up for the next
heat, easily taken by Sheldon, and in the fourth
was out for business, Eyelet carrying Sheldon
for the first half, then Connor drove him out,
winning in a whipping finish. The two next

heats were won cently. The talent falled as
well to pick a winner in the 2:12 class trottin
as the two heat winnings were left in a $5 fle
with $100 in the box. Little Dick was sold
favorite in the first heat, Dollade Wilkes sur-
rised every one except the very knowing ones
y coming upon the outside and beating Flfrida
outat the wire,she having headed bunch for
three-quarters of the way around. Then she
did {t again in the seoond heat after making
a bad break before the second turn. She won
the race after the gaimest spurts of the day,
but it used her up. Golden then engineered
Temple Wilkes through the bunch and won the
next two handily. ollade made a good at-
tempt in the fifth, leading off to the stretch,
when Golden again brought Temple to the fore.
Maggie Anderson sold a 2 to | favorite against

The
most important new business waa the selection
of judges and timers for the matinée. Under
the new rules of the association no member
can oMciate in the judges’ stand.
leis of the judging which followed the last
matinée made such a rule imperative, The
committee selected H. N. Bain of Poughkeepsie
and Arthur H. Benson of Brooklyn as two of
the judges. Mayor Alexander T. Harbison
of Hartford, Conn., was named as starting
judge. A. J. Keating New York; George
Roeckel, L. I., and E. V. Willis, East Wil iston,
will look after the timing.

Designs were submitted for the souvenir
programme, which is going to be a very elabor-
ate affair. On the front cover will be a very
striking cut, in six colors, of the great finish
between Joe Patohen, John R. Gentry and
Star Pointer at the Empire track lest fall.
The back cover will show a scene on the Speed-
way, and half-tone outs of prominent road
riders and their horses will be scattered pro-
fusely through the book

Secretary 8. C. Reeves says that entries to the
various classes are already coming in, fifteen
now being on the fiat, and there is no doubt
that every class will be well represented beiore
the day for closing arrives. .

They have recovered from the attack of rheu-

The amateur ra scheduled for the New

ti promise to be a great feature. Theodore
wleman, manager of the racing depart-
ment, writes that it is the aim of the manage.
ment to encourage amateur rening, and with
that end in view they have offered four cups,
voqued at from $200 to $300 each, which pro-
vides for one amateur wagon race each day.
These events will be at mule heats, two in three,

the wagon races, and no horse will be eligible

which has started in a race for money after

Aug. 1 except in an amateur race to four-
wheeled wagon. The entries closed Monday
night with a Hist. Besides the amateu

races there wil] be 2:18, 2:90, 2:1), 2:22, 2:15, an
2:25 clase trots; 2:24, 2:15, 2:12, 2:10, 2:00 and
free-for-all classes for the pacers, for purses
ranging from $500 to $2,000.

There was a good og of conversation amon
local horsemen yesterday over the report tha
the trotter Musqueton, 2:17, had not Been

vurchased by “Del” Whitehead, owner of the
‘ast mare Bergenia, 2.18%, as had heen gener-
ally understood. Gossip bad {t that the horse
is still in the Mowers stable at the Fmpire Cit
track and that Mr. Mowers was far from plea
ver the fact thata record of 2:14 bad been given
usqueton in his race with DeWitt C. Flana-
@an'a Ivandorf, 7:16'{, at the last matinée of
the Road Riders’ Association, where the horse
was certainly entered in Mr. Whitehead’s name.
While the record has been reported to Secre-
tary Gocher of the National Trotting Associa-
tion, there are grave doubts as to the correct-
ness of it. In the second heat of the race Ivan-
dorf broke when nearing the wire, but was the
first under. The judges set Mr. Flanagan's
horse back for the break and gave the heat to
Musqueton, but announced the time of the

From Sumner Wardy of Callfornta,
Newrponr, Aug. 15.—The second day's play
In the national championship lawn tennis

at the Casino here to-day fur-
nished better tennis and tore of it than was
seen yesterday, The challenge match for
the national championship in doubles was,
of course, the foature of the morning, and the
big grand stand, opposite the exhibition court,
was well filed when Davie and Ward went out
to defend their title against Little and Alex-
ander, the Princeton challengers, who wonse
cleverly yesterday from fAlackett and Allen.
Before the matoh it was the general imprea-
sion that Davia and Ward could not lose. Odds
of & to 2 were offered that the
championship would not change hands, and
even money that the challengers
would not get ai set. The  Prinoeton
palr, however, showed up stronger than
was expected, and while the straight set pro
diction wus finally fulfilled, those who hed
backed Little and Alexander to get a set had
# good run for thelr money. Hud it not been
for the puzzling twist services of the kind
which played havoe with the Englishmen last
week ut Longwood, the champions might
have bad a much more diMcult task on their
hands. Alexander's low ground strokes were
not nearly 80 effective uy aguiost the struight
services of Huckett und Allen, while Litue
ulso found It very difficult to control bis returns
from the twisting bulls that his antagonists
served. Even ut this disadvantage the chal-
lengers made a good showing in each of the
sets, and cume very close to winning the third.
Throughout the match it was a servers’
battle, very few of the forty-eight games played
ing wou by the opponents of the server.
Iu the first set Ward and Davis captured the
second game against Little's service and this
decided the set, each of the other servers win-
ninginturn. In the second set the champions
also broke through their opponents’ serylee,
but this temporary advantage was evened up
in the next game when Little and Alexander
scored on the champions’ service. Again the
eerver continued to win. Many of the games
were imarked by long deuce-and-yantage
struggles, until the fifteenth game, when the
champions again stopped their opponents
service and took the set with the next game.
The last set was the longest and closest of
all. Again Davis and Ward captured one of
their opponents’ service games and took a lea
at %-1, only to lose it again when Little an
Alexander won the eighth game against Da-
vis's service, The games alternat regularly
until 10—all had been reached when the cham-
pions again broke through and on the next
game took the set by 12-10 and the mateh in
Seralaht gta, giving om the American cham-
jonship for a second season.
, There were many exciting matches im ie
first of the championship singles round which
was completed sonsey, obably the heat was
that between E. D. Black, the English expert
who made bis first appearance at Newport, an
Sumner Hardy, the Californian who has n
laying for several weeks in the Eastern
Journament. The visitor waa thought to be
an easy winner, but he found the aggressive
volleying tactics of the American surprisingly
troublesome. Black made many beautiful passes,
and seomed confident that he could ye out
the match at any time he chose. @ took
the first set easily but in the second made a
emall bet with ore, hie fellow visitor from
“ngland, that he would win the set after Hardy
ad a lead of 4.0. He failed, however, as
the Weaterner took the eet by 43. Complaints
were made of Hardy's method, of serving and
a number of foot failts were called ag inst him
which considerably bothered the Californian
ll through the third and fourth gets. The
American, however, captured the fourth set
with a margin to spare, aod etill the visitor
cid not seem to fear defeat, although Ce score
the match stood at two sets all. In the last
set Black crowded on a little more steam, and
although Hardy was within a single stroke
ot many of the games the Englishman won
by 6-2
There were three other important matches
during the day. Chace at Fischer in an
exciting five-set match, ree Wrenn beat
Hackett in a clever four-set match, and Wright
showed splendid form against Ware, beating
him in straight sets without any of m reach-
ing deuce. owed m better stamina
than last season, when Paret beat him {in the
firat round here, and hung on 60 well that Fischer
was finally beaten down. Hackett found
George Wrenn too steady for him, and although
every one of the four sets was close, Wrenn
finally took the match by keeping the ball
coming back over the net at the most critical
points until Hackett broke down. Wright
showed chempronship form, and Ware never
a chance to win
ae nee Davis plays Allen, Collins meets
Wright, Alexander plays Chace, Samuel Hardy
seets Larved, Gore goes against Ward, Bud-
ong has Black nst him, George Wrenn
meets Little and b” Wrenn plays Stevens.
Gore and Ward will play on the champion-
shipcourt and will probably be followed by Bob
Wrenn and Stevens. Brilliant tennis is looked
for, as all of the weaker players have now been
wea out. The scores of to-day’s matches

*‘Rabe’’ Ferns, New Welterweight Champioa.
“Rube” Ferns, the eccentric Kansas pugilist,

is now the welterweight champion. The
title has changed hands quite rapidiy in the
Jast six mouths. “Mysterious Billy” Smith

was welterweight champion for a long time
until he was knocked out by Matry Matthews
at the Broadway A.C. last spring. A few weeks
later Matthews surrendered the tine to Eddie
Connoly of New Brunswick, who won in the
most impressive manner, though he did nor
score 4 knock-out. Connolly was beaten to @
standstill at Buffalo on Monday night br Porna,
who is now open to meet any man in the « orld
at ie2 pounds. Ferns has the credit of being a
terrific puucher of the hurricane style, but
so for has not shown any fnished sctence.,
file rise has been rapic and those who have

m in charge say that he will be unbeatable
