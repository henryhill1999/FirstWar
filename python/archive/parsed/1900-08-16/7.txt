REPORT AS TO INTENDED PURCHASE
OF BROOKLYN RAPID TRANSIT,

Also Said That the Company Would Acquire
Control of the Thirty Ninth Street Ferry
~Both of These Kamors Are Denied
by Offictals ta the Vroperttes Involved.

A flurry occurred in Brooklyn Rapid Transit |

stock on the Stock Pxchange yesterday, with
the price advancing sharply to 69% although
moet of this improvement was lost later, the
closing quotations being 50%, or only
point above Tuesday's final feures
the reports current was one that experts of the
Pennsylvania Ratiroad Company had
plete! an exhaustive examin ition of the lines of
the company last saturday with a view of pur-
chasing part of the system. This report was
accompanied by the statement that the Penn-
sylvania Company had acquired by a stock
purchase control of the Thirty-ninth street
ferry, running from the Battery to Sonth Brook-
typ, and had also bought a large block of the
bonds of the bankrupt Brooklyn Wharf and
Warehouse Company, which covers much of the
Brooklyn water front and which would as @ re-
sult be reorganized in the interest of the Penn-
sylvania

CHANGING PORTO RICAN COINS.

Large Amoant of the Spanish Stlvew Received
at the Philadelphia Mint.

PRILADELPHIA, Aug 15 Millions of dollars’
worth of Porto Rican coins, which are being
exchanged by the people of the new island
possession for American dollars, have arrived
at the mint in this city Heavy truck-loads
of pesos and centavos are being wheeled into
the corridors of the money-making institution
and a force of twelve persons is kept busy
counting the coin as it arrives The rapid
exchange shows an eagerness of the islanders
to bave their money all American, and at the
present rate the standard coins of this country
will soon be in use everywhere there and the
native meney will become only a curiosity. By
this means the Americanizing of the country is
expected to make decided advances

With the 1,722,000 pesos which arrived this
week, the total received amounts to 4,862,798,30,

The Porto Ricans exchange their money at
the rate of 60 centa in Ainerican money for each
The latter is well coined and of almost
exactly the same fineness as the dollar of thia
country, the silver in it nang 30.8 per cent. of
that in the American coin. The receipts here
indicate a brisk transfer business in dollars and
pesos at San Juan and Ponce
The coins turned into this country so far
are the pesos, the 5, 10, 20 and 40 centavos in
ailver, and the 1 and 2 centavos in bronze
The 20 centavos is sometimes termed peseta
and is equivalent to the French france. The
ta, which ia worth .193, as compared with
peso, isthe unit of value. The centavo
fs one-hundredth of a peso and the use of the
decimal! system gives the Porto Ricans a ready
idea of the method of this country. The bronze
leces are often chipped and mutilated, many
aving holes through the centre, as if used
for keepsakes. The silver ia in fair condi-
tion, the coins, except the pesos, having milled
edges. The peso has stars on the rim. All
the coins bear the image of Alfonso XIIT,
The foroe of counters employed upon the
Porto Rican work ts now counting more than
8,000,000 pesos and smaller silver coin. The
money comes to the mint unassorted_in canvas
bags and the count is tedious. The money
ia not weighed, as is that of this country, and
the single count is relied upon
Supt. Boyer said to-day that. no decision
had yet been made us to the disposition of
the money, as far a® Governmental socounts
ure concerned. It has not been settled whether
it shall go into the “recoinage” account, or be
charged up us the purchase of so much bullion
mage would give the Government an
apparent profit, but this would be consumed
in exchange, transportation, counting und
cotnuge expenses, None of the gold coin,
which is 25 pesetas, or nearly $5, in value, has
been received

RUMOR ABOUT JERSEY CENTRAL,

The B. & O. Said to Be Negotiating for Con-
trol of the Road.

Coincident with an advance of 5'¢ points In
the stock of the Central Railroad of New Jersey
Wall Street heard rumors yesterday that the
company was about to pass under the control of
the Baltimore and Ohio through the purchase
of the stock held by the interests identified with
the First National Bank. A representative of
the controlling interests denied positively that
any deal with the B. & 0. or any other interest

had as yet been arranged which would meana
change in the control, He added:

“That the control may some time change
hands, is quite possible, in fagt, quite likely
in view of the tendency toward concentration
that existe in the railroad business as elsewhere

The Jersey Central has never been in better
condition th physically and financially, and
ite prospects now am better than ever befora

fn its history. It has in its treasury a total,

told, of $12,000,000 of good securities, for which

¢ has been no use and which are unpledged.

Included among the securities are $4,500,000 of

the company’s own 5 per cent. bonds that

Athy ne at 122 and about $6,000,000 of

h and Wilkes-Barre 4338. The company

has aleo waterfront property at Jersey City
the value of which {s very great.

 

LAST OF THE BROOKLYN ELEVATED,

The New Company Acquires Certain Proper-
tes of the Old for $174,637.03.

Gen. George W. Wingate, representing the
Brooklyn Union Elevated Railroad Company,
purchased yesterday at public auction in the
Real Estate Exchange in Brooklyn the Brook-
lyn Elevated Railroad Company for $174,837.08.

he sale was conducted by Whitiam Willa, .
ceiver of the Brooklyn Elevated Railroad Com-
pany. The old company was merged into
the Brooklyn Union company through reor-
gy proceedings, but {it was alleged

y the reoeiver that certain properties had not
been acquired by the new company at the
time of the sale in foreclosure proceedings
of the firet and second mortgages. This prop-
erty was valued at $174,857.03, the amount
bid by Gen. Wingate. As soon ns the certifi-
cate of sale is filed the old Brooklyn Elevated
Eerese Company will be wiped out of ex-
stence.

CLEAR WAY TO RACETRACK

Grade Crossing at Sheepshead Bay to ne
Abolished.
The State Board of Rall-
road Commissioners to-day, after an animated
hearing, granted an application of the Muni-
cipal Assembly and interested property owners
of Brooklwn for the abolition of a grade crossing
of the Long Island Railroad at Avenue U and

 

ALBANY, Aug 16,

Eighteenth street, Brooklyn This ts the high
way which connects the Coney Island and
Brooklyn racetracks and the finest bouleward

in the Sheepshead Bay neighborlioed. For years
the crossing has been barrica led by a fence
erected by the railroad company, and the ef-
forts of the property owners and city authori-
ties to get rid of it have been unavailing. The
effect of the barricade also has been to obstruct
the improvement of that section of Brooklyn

The plans approved by the Railroad Com-
mission to-day are for a crossing involving an
elevation of the Long Island Railread tracks
four anda half feet and the depression of the
highway eight feet, thereby obviating any
further crossing atarade William C. Whitney
was among the property owners interested in
favor of the application, on account of his
ownership of the old Garretaon mansion. A
vetition, signed by 600 property owners, was put
nin favor of the application

W. H Page. Jr., appearei before the com-
mission for Mr. Whitney and the Coney Island
Jockay Club. Assistant Corporation Counsel
Luke D. Stapleton represented the ity and
Col Alexander Bacon and Mirabeau L. Towns
interested property owners, all favoring the
improvement. William H. Kelly, for the
Long Island Railroad, opposed a crossing at
grate, but consented to the elevation o the
tracks 4'; feet The cost of the ch ea will
be borne half by the city and half by the rail-
road

 

AFTER THE KING WIRE-TAPPER.

Mr. Cohn Dropped 85,000, Ile Says, Helping
“Chapple Moran to Beat the Poolrooms.
Samuel H. Cohn of 72 Second avenue yester-

day tried to seize the furniture of a “Mr. Moran”

which is stored in the Manhattan Storage Ware-
house in West Fifty-third street. Moran,

Cohn sald, had swindled him out of $5,000 which

he had been assured would be increased to

20,000 in a week, He was “Chappie" Moran

king of the wire-tappers, the man who got Cohn’s

money told him, so Cohn says. He knew opera-
tors employed by the Western Union who could

 

 

intercept messages to poolrooms announcing
the results of races and it was a “sure thing.

I gave him $2,000 the first time,” Cohn told
reporters; “that was about two weeks ago
There wasn't going to be any sfapping
game in it H® said he knew ¢ itors who
understood the code in which race results were
sent to the poolrooros and that he could win
by playing ahead After 1 had wiven him the
$2,000 he came to me and said that the operator
had got the code mixed so that he had played
the wrong horse and my money was gone. We

tried to get it back by keeping at the game, I
dropped $5,000 and then T got tired. One day
I went to call on him at his address in

wher
Fifteenth street he was gone. His sister, to
whom he bad introduced me, and who was a
very pretty girl, was gonetoo, They had taken
a lot of my clothes, but those they sent back
from Saratoga the other day. They didn't

send me any money.”

Cohn told his tale in the Yorkville police court
and tried to get a warrant there ior Moran’s
arrest, Magistrate Brann said there was not
enough evidence and refused to issue the war-
rant. Cohn, nothing daunted, went then to
another court and made the same request, He
got a warrant there, made returnable to York-
ville court

JAIL FOR FOUL TALK.

Magistrate Kramer Warns Women and Makes
an Example of One.

Magistrate Kramer of Williamsburg has
started a movement to stop indecent language
among women within the boundaries of his court,
Two weeks ago he expressed a determination
to do this. He had before him ten cases where
women who said they were respectable were
accused by others of having reviled them
The Magistrate said then that he was satisfled
the imposition of a peace bond had no effect
on offenders and in future he would impose

upon women just as he did on men, imprisons
ment in jail if they were proved guilty of the
offence

Mrs. Annie Moore of 108 Spencer street wus
arraigned before him yesterday charged with
calling Mra. Rose Aikens, who lives at 100
Wallabout street, foul and indecent names,
Mrs. Moore denied the allegation, but the weight
of evidence was against her,and in judging her
guilty of the offence the Magistrate referred
to the warning he had given. Mrs. Moore
had not heurd of it and begged for her release
She was committed to jail for three days and
the announcement was made by Magistrate
Kramer that in the future no woman who is
charged with a similar offence in his court
and {s proven guilty will receive clemency

Mre. Moore became hysterical when she was
led to the prisoners’ pen.

 

STEEL FOR THE SUBWAY.
The First Consignment Now on Its Way Here

From Pittsburg.

The firat consignment of steel from the Key-
stone Bridge Works for the Rapid Transit
subway has been syipped and is now on the
way from Pittsburg. There are ninety-seven
wall columns weighing thirty tons,in the firet
lot. They are to be used on section 13 at 157th
street and Broadway

All of the subcontracts have now been signed
with the exception of the one for the Harlem
River tunnel, which was awarded toJohn (
todgers last April. The delay in the final
execution of that contract is the result of some
uncertainty about the route. In the first place
Chiet Engineer Deyo of the Rapid Transit
Construction Company thought that a viaduct
over the river would be better than a tunnel
under it. It was finally agreed, however,
to stick to the origina! plan to dig a tunnel
But just where the tunnel would do the most
good has not been definitely decided. Two
points farther west than the one originally
selected were ouperetes. but it was said yea-
terday by one of the engineers that there will
probably be go change from the place already
approved by the Rapid Transit Commission,

TO FLOAT INDIAN R. R. BONDS HERE.

 

The Attempt Not Well Recelved Because of
the Low Rate of Interest,

It was learned from foreign banking inter-
eats yesterday that since the floating in this
country of a large proportion of the recent
British Exchequer bond loan of  £10,000,000
there has been a quiet attempt made to also

float here about £1 ,000,000 of 3% per cent. seven-
year Indian railway bonds, payment guaran-
teed by the Indian Government, The attempt
to float this new loan with local banking inter-
ests have not, however, so far as could he
learned, met with much encouragement, the
rate not belng looked upon as tempting enough
for a railway bond, even though it may have
a Government guarantee.

It wae reported yesterday that the Bank of
Enaland had withdrawn the concessions,
based upon the allowance of interest while
in transit, that it has been making in order
to induce gald exports from America. The

ank's attitude was construed as indicating

that the recent heavy gold engagements had
supplied all the immediate gold needs of the
British market.

 

EPILEPTIC LEFT IN A HOSPITAL.

The Intention Was to Get Rid of the Invalid,
so the Authorities Think.

A twelve-year-old epileptic named William
Ruff was taken to St. Vincent's Hospital a few
day« ago by a weman named Powers, who
eald she was his guardian. She said she lived
in Fort Lee and that the mother of the boy was
dead and the father a drunkard who abused
him. ‘The hospital authorities noticed that no
one was coming to see the child and they noti-
fied Supt. Blair of the Outdoor Poor Depart-
ment. Aninvestigator sent to Fort Lee found
that the Powers woman did not live there and
that the father of the child was a sober, in-
dustrious man living in Englewood, N. J. He
had recently been married again. ‘esterday
the child wassent tothe Charity Commissioner
at Leona Heights, N 4, who will take the case
up Supt. Blair says that somebody evidently
wanted to get rid of the invalid
