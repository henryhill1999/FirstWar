the Senate committees to report out their local
bills.

HESS AND GODDARD AT WAR.

Both Want to Go to National Convention
From the 12th Congress District.

The friends of Capt, F. Norton Goddard,
Republican leader in the Twentieth Assembly
district, said last night that he had made up
his mind to go to the Republican National
Convention as a delegate from the Twelfth
Congressional district, and that in order
tocarry out his ambition he was going to
knock ont the Hon, Charles A, Hess, Repubil-
can leader of the Twenty-ffth Assembly dis-
trict. The Tweuty-fifth district and the Eigh-
teenth district send enough delegates to the
Congressional Convention to control it, Ae-
cording to Capt. Goddard's friends, Mr. Hess
and United States Marshal Henkle, the leader
of the Eighteenth, had a conference several
days agoand (xed up what they thought was
4 very pleasant programme for the convention
without consulting Capt. Goddard, whom, it ls
said, they vousidered to bea political gosling
According to this programme the Hon, Cor-
nelius N. Bliss and Mr, Hess are to represent

the Congress district atthe National Conven-

tion, and Mr. Henkle fs to become a member of
the Republican State Committee. This is the
plan which Capt, Goddard has undertaken to
upset. Itissaid that he has the support of
Appraiser Wilbur F. Wakeman, who lives in
he Twenty-fAfth, Mr Heas has the eetive sup

port of the Hon, “Lightuing Jim”. Stewart,
who was the leaderofthe Twentieth district
untillaat September, when Capt. Goddard beat
him atthe primaries, Both factions have in-
vaded the Eighteenth, where they are hard at
work trying tocapture Mr. Henkle's followera,

Mr, Hess made a statement last night in
which he said he enjoyed a good political fight
when it d.dno harm to the party. Then he
added: “Idonot know of any opposition to
me in the Republican organization of the
YS wonty-fifth, except that made by two Ten-
derloin gamblers, one of whom is opposing me
because [deemed it for the best. interests of
the Republican party.to procure hia removal
from a position which he was unable to fill.
The other fellow naturally sympathizea with
him because of their. business relations,
Strange tosay, neither of them ie a resident ot
that portion of the Twenty-(ifth district: which
isa part ofthe Twelth Congress district,”

The Hon. Frederick W. Grosse, who recently
lost his job as Denouty Collector of Internal
Revenue forthe Third district because of his
opposition to Mr. Hess's leadership, telephoped

te.
publican voters of the Twenty-fifth diatrict,
held at the Park Avenue Hotel, resolutions
were adopt) urging the election of a resident
ofthe Tweaty-fifth asa delegate tothe National
Convention. Mr. Grosse added that he had
stroug reasons to believe that Mr, Hess was
not a resident of the Twenty-ffth.

SENATOR COFFEY DEFIANT,

BY THK BIG
HIS HONOR,

 

HE 18 RRACED UP
DEMONSTRATION IN
A New Organization Antagonistic to the
Machine to Be Organized in Brooklyn
Some of Its Prospective Leadera-tn-
terest in the Coffey Heresy Trial Wanes,

Undismayed by the big demonstration at
Prospect Hall, Brooklyn, on Thursday night, at
which Senator Michael J, Coffey was hatled by
3.000 Democrate as the past, present and
future leader of the Ninth Assembly district,
the Willoughby street managers, lust night, re-
sumed bis trial for alleged treason to the party
in the Iast campaign. There were not more
than a score of persons on hand, and three-
fourths of them were stalwart friends of the
accused Senator,

John Gillespie of 111 Wolcott street testified
that on the wight before election Alderman
Hennessey, ove of Coffey’s adherents, spoke to
him to this effect: “Down Gray and vote
against tho ticket. Vote against Gray and thus
down the old man in Willoughby street, Coffey
will then be the leader and we'll get the patron-
age.”

John A. Buckley of 121 Wolcott street testt-
fled that James W. MeMahon, a delegate to the
County Committee and also a Coffey lieuten-
ant, shortly after the nominations had been
made, said in answer to witness's inquiry:
“Well, what's the game?” “We're golig to
down Gray,”

The hearing was then a!journed to to-night
with the understanding that the prosecution
would then be wound up. ;

The hearing for the defence is likely to
abound tn interest. Senator Coffey, Assembly-
man Cain, Assemblyman Hennessey and all
the other alleged political heretics from the
Red Hook distriet are to go on the stand and
boldly explain the causes, which Induced them
to work against not only the election, but the
nomination of John Morrissey Gray

Whatever the result of the trial may be, there
is every prospect that before the close of the
summer a brand-new Democratic organization
with Senator Coffey at his head, will be formed
in Kingscounty, Already the plans for such
ap organization are being matured and the
Drospective ieaders in the various Asseinbly
districts chosen, Among these are Counci!-
man John J. MeGarry, Councilman. Martin
Conly, Assistant Corporation Counsel Luke }D).
Stapleton, Under Sherif? James Dunne, Pat-
rick Hayes, former Assemblyman Thomas
Byrnes, former Senator PH, MeNulty,
J. Grattan, W. C. Mahon, Eugene R. Judge,
James FF. Qui ley and Col. Hague It
has been decided not start active hos-
tilities until after the March primaries

The flgnt is not really directed so much
against ex-Register Mugh Mclaughlin, the
veteran leader, asthe three orfour trusted
Heutenants who, as contended, have usurped
the power of the aged chie'tain, In fact, Sen-
ator Coffey and his friends assert that Mr. Me-
Laughlin has been virtually out of the political

ame for the past two orthree years and that

to

name to suit thenselyes, regardlass of the
wishes of the rank and file of the organization
Mr. MeLaughiin himself gave force to this con-
tention by astatement he made on the eve of
month ago,
in which he begged to be allowed to pass his
remaining days in peace and to be relieved
from political turmoil

In the coming clash it is contended that the
influence of Rienard Croker and Tammany is

| very likely to be thrown on the side of Senator

Coffey and his supporters. Senator Coffey's
closing remarkaat the Prospect Hall demon-
stration, in which he referred to Mr. Croker as
“the real leader of our party in the city of New
York,” are regarded as significant,

Before passing sentence Judge Moore asked

oath, “I can show that that detective,” point-
ing to Kelly, “committed amurder. I can take
you to where the man is buried. This is true.”

Judge Moore stopped the prisoner's speech
and passed sentence. No sooner had the Jude

Burke, who stood at his side, a stunning blow
full in the face, Ae Burke reeled over Under
