GRANT'S

RECEIVER'S
OVER

 

CERTIFICATES TO TIDE
PRESSING NEEDS, ‘

Kuhn, Loeb & Co, Sald to Stand Ready to
Takeo These Certificates up to $10,000,000
and Underwrite the Reorganization
Plan=Slight Fall in the Stock Yesterday,

Third Avenue Railroad stock fell off still fur-
ther yesterday, opening weak at 47, three
poluts below Thursday's closing price, It went
down in the first hour to 454, recovering
slightly and touching 40 as the highest
price of the day and closed at 47's. The
only explanation advanced of the fur-
ther deciing was tho general expectation
ofan assessment onthe stock in the plan of re-
organization which has not yet been promul-
gated and probably cannot be for some time,
With total sales of 40,070 shares, the stock lost
its place as achief contre of interest under the
heavy trading in Sugar) The slight improves
ment from the lowest figures in Third avenue
was caid to be due to the report of the seheme
for Mnancing the company partly through ree
celver’s certificates,

The plan to issue receiver's certificates for
the immediate needs of the road and to
furnish money for the completion of the pro
jecte! improvements and extensions has
been sufficiently advanced so that it became
known yesterday that Kuhn, Loeb & Co
fre prepared to take the certifleates
and to underwrite the — reorganization
plan. Kuhn, Loeb & Co. have formed @
syndicate t> carry out the  seheme
and stand ready, it is said, to take the re-
ceiver's certificates up to $10,000,000, The
amount likely to mako up the first issue has
not been definitely announced, but it is said

 

that it will probably be $4,000,000, The cer
tifleates will be a lien prior to the un-
funded debt, taking rank next to the
bonds, which sold yesterday at 118 and
1184, and will be taken by the syndicate at
par. It was said sterday that the
large total of the mechanics’ liens
which have been filed against the
company does not represent an immediate

cash liability, as in some instances at least the
nmounts of the Hens stand for the total prices
of joba not yet completed, and payment for
which in total! is not yet due, so that if the re-
ceivers’ certificates are used in making pay-
moentsof the lens, no such sum 4s the aggre-
gate ol the liens will be required forthe pur-
pose at once, ;

It was said that it had been definitely
determined by those in charge of the plan con-
templating the issue of the receiver's certin-
entes that immediate payments of the liens
should bo made. ‘The plans are being matured
by the Creditors Protective Cominittee, No
application to the court. for carrying
them out would be made before tha
appointment. of & permanent recetver
Mr. Grant’s task to master the situation of
affairs now, which is a very much involved one,

is likely tooecuny him for some time. Just
what kind of @ revort the court may require
of him at the hearing on March 14 is not

known, It is understood that Mr. Grant will
be made the permanent receiver, and in that
event he is credited withthe intention to bring
outif he ean every thing that has contributed
to bring the company to ruin

It was remarked in the Street yesterday that
with the passing of the affairs of the Third
Avenue Company largely into the control of
} P. Olcott, as chairman of the creditors’ eom-
mittee, and his associates, the Huckleberry
road waa returning to nen interested in it
before its sale to the Third Avenue Com-
pany and returning, apparently, @s one man
put it, “with the Third avenue road an-

nexed”’ A. N. Brady is known as a friend
and business associate oof Mr. Oleott
Prior to the sale of the Huekleberry

or Union Railway Company tothe Third Ave-

nue in January, Ios. Mr. Brady bad been
prominently identified with the former eom-
many, and others who had been reported
o be interested in it were Mr, Olcott,
Hugh J. Grant and Wiijham F. Shee-
han. A story was published yesterday that

$5,000,000 was paid by the Third Avenue for
the Huckleberry road, whereas the road had
costand was worth only $4,000,000, Atthe
time the announcement was inade of the pur-
chase of the Huckleberry the price was not
stated. A man closely identified with the Third
Avenue Company atthe time said yesterday
that the price paid was about $4,250,000,

Stories as to Where a@ part at least ofthe
Third Avenue Company's funds have gone con.
tinue to circulate as they have for months past,
and favoritism, extravagance and yielding to

olitical pressure are among the milder items
nthe general criticisms which they embody,
These have kept so persistently afloat that it
wns said yesterday by a friend of the director.
ate that the directors may see fit to issue a
statement denying them

The National Conduit
pany began suit in the Supreme Court
yesterday to foreclose the jien for $144.

The suit is against the Third Avenue |
Company, the Forty-second Street, st. Nicholas ;

jen for $44,762 was filed yesterday against the

David Lamar settled his puts on Third Ave-
nue stock yesterday, some of them with notes
at six, twelve and eighteen months. M. Bb
Mendham, to whom he gave notes, said that
Mr. Lamar had fixed things up satisfactorily
“Ho settled with me,” he said, “and, T under.

ATLANTA, Ga, March 2.—President T. Jeffer-
son Coolidge, Jr, of the Old Colony Trust Com-

any of Boston. who has been in this city sinee

Vednesday, left this evening for Tifton, Ga,
Before his departure he Was asked where ha
naced the blame for the present condition of
the Third Avenue Railroad Company, His re-
py wast s

“Lattribute the present condition of the com-
pany to poor financiering, to the creation of an
unwieldy debt and an unwillingness to meet
the adiMeculties frankly and promptly when they
first arose, Itis impossible at this time to say
at whose door the blame should be laid,

"New England bought largo amounts of the
Third Avenue Railroad Compauy's notes, be-
Heving that the read was worth more than its
debta and, in spite of the present unfor-
tunate situation, we still believe the notes
Will receive full value in final settlement.”

and that he hal spent this,

The detectives took Carr to Police Head-
quarters and there locked him up.

Ithad been thought that the pouch eon-
Mained about $7,000. Carr was employed to

SUGAR BELOW PAR,
Bold Down to 05 5-8 Yesterday on Heavy
Dealing— Dividend to Be Cut?

For the first time since 1806 the stock of the
American Sugar Refining Company sold below
par on the New York Btock Exchange yesters
doy, Tho stock was by far the most active In
the dealings, the total sales for the day
amounting to 145,450 shares, It opened at
1034, which wasthe highest price of the day,
and under heavy selling broke to {i's with
the closing sale at 97’, representing a net
loss compared with the closing price of Thurs-
day of 6) points, The heaving selling ofthe
stock was in anticipation of a reduction in the
regulardividend rate at the meeting of the
directors, Which is expected to take place next
We inesday. Ever since President Henry 0.
Havemeyer at the stockholders’ annua! meet-
Ing iutimated that, in view of the existing war
withthe independent refiners, it. might be
found advisable to cut the regulae 12 per cent,
annual dividend rate, Wall Street has been
bearish regarding the stock, and it. is now
generally antic!pated thata cutin the dividend
willbe made. The prevailing belief is that
the cut will beone of 50 per cent., and that
the new rate will baS percent. On this theory
the bear operators have vigorously attacked
the stock,

 

FALL RIVER COTTON SYNDICATE,
Another Effort to Buy Up the Mills—Stock-
holders Holding Off.

Fatt River, Mass., March 2,—Col, Nelson G,
Green of New York was in the city to-day in
the interest of the syndicate that is endeavor.
ing ouce more to consolidate the Fall River
Cotton Mills. This scheme was tried early last
fall, but for various reasons fellthrough, This
time the syndicate will make more determined
efforts, The valuations placed upon the stock
several months ago have been increased, and it
is said that the offers for the best mills will be
liberal, Still, there is now a stronger senti-
ment than ever against selling toa trust. The
belief is general among stockholders that no
deal can be made, They see no reason why
they should be party to one.

The Fall River cotton mills are enjoying a
season of prosperity that surpasses the records
of years and the outlook is encouraging. To-
day cloth went upto 3% cents a yard, and at
the present rate of profit miils are paying about
Sper cent, with chances favoring an increase,
Business is booming along all lines as a result,
and as most of the stockholders are engaged
in other lines, they believe that it would be
detrimental to theirinterestato let go when
everything is intheir favor, Itis a long time
since prosperity was experienced by them as it
is now, and they are nut eager to sell at a good
quotation even.

WILLIS ROSSEL'S ESCAVE,

 

It Inspires President York to Send Out
some Advice to the Police Foree,

Asa result of an investigation ofthe dis-
charge from custody of Willis Rosser, the
medical student who shot Frederick Slater
at the bieyele races in Madison Square
Garden, on Dee, 1, last year, President
York of the Police Board has issued a

statement defining the duties of policemen
when they are required to make affdavits in

court, When Rosser shot Slater a number of

ersons witnessed the shooting, Policeman
Rapp jtarrested Rosser, but when he was ar-
raigued ineourt the policeman made alidavit
thathe hbadne evidence that Rosser did) the
shooting. After Kosser was set free the Grand
Jury took upthe case and indicted him, but he
had disappeared by that time

President York's remarks were issued yes-
terday by Chief Devery in the form of a special
order. In part the President said

“It will not do to premit a poliee officer on
his own motion in a court, to state that he has
no evidenes to show that the defendant did not
commit the offence and to ask for his discharge
and toswearto such statement. ltis bis duty
to submit to the Court such evidence and such
information ashe may have, andit is for the
Court to determine whetherthe information
so submitted by him is sufficient avidence to
charge the accused with the commission of an
offence.”

FINANCIAL AND COMMERCIAL.

 

Fnipay, March 2.

Although Third Avenue stock sold to-day at
the lowest price yet recorded for it, 45%, the
fluctuations in it were the smallest on any day
since It sold below par, The maximum fluctu-
ation was only 3% per cent. and the net loss
24 pointe, The dealings in the stock
wore fairly large, aggregating nearly a third
of the outstanding capital. Still the market
for it reflected a quieting down of the recent
speculative excitement, Few operators have
the temer'ty to sell a stock for short account
after it has declined 75 or 0 points, At the
same time the street has not yet made up tts
mind whether Third Avenue is cheap at leas
than half ite par value, being kept in doubt by
the incomplete yet distressing disclosures re-
garding the financial condition of the com-
pany. The chances ara that the trading in
the stock willsoon shrink to normal propor-
uiona pending an Official investigation by the
receiver and the formulating of a plan of re-
organization.

The speculation in it to-day was over-
shadowed by that in Sugar Refining. As ap-
proach {s made to the dividend period of the
company the conviction of the Street is
atrenathened that the dividend paid hereto-
fore will becutintwo. This clreumstance was
responsible fora break of nearly 8 points in
the price of the stock and a net decline of 6%
points, The transactions in {it were nearly
150,000 shares, The effect of com-
petition upon the securities of the Amer-
{ean Sugar Refining Company and fears that
Congress may enact some wholesome legisia-
tion governing industrial combinations in-
fluenced selling of all industrial issues. Peo-
ple’s Gas waa attacked on advices from Chicago
that an attempt {fs to be made to have the
consolidation of various concerns which was
effected through the organization of the com-
pany declared illegal and void. In view of
the legislation that was enacted at the time
the consolidation was bronght about, it is not
likely that the threatened speculative litigation
will amount to much, Chicago, or at least that
part of It which Wall Street knows best, ape
pears to have embarked on a bear campaign in
the stock market, and until its local operators
change their position, Wall Street must be pre-
pared for all sorts of unpropitious blasts from
the Windy City.

Weak features of the market otherthan those
already noted were Consolidated Gas, American
Tobacco, Metropolitan Railway, ederal Steel,
Tennessee Coal and Iron, Steel and Wire and
St. Paul. The selling of the last was on tha
theory that the semi-annual dividend will not ba
increased. The certainty of a poor showing by
the Clearing House banks to-morrow was made
much of by the advocates of lower prices. The
only active stock that did not participate in the
general movement was Brooklyn Rapid Tran-
ait. On moderate transactions it closed frac.
tionally higher than vesterday, The closing
was inthe main steady at a recovery from the
lowest prices.
