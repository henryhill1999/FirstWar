“While the ‘Dies [re was echoing
the land,” continues Father Movnihan, “a «
was raised that Teo had weakened and was
about to surrender the principle for which he
had stood with unflinching fortitude for two-
and-twenty years. In cther countries
there were not wanting those who said Uiat at
last the Pope was Learing his captivity with,
complacency and that a new era would begu
with a new reign,

“The time for silence was past. On Aug
18 there appeared in the Osservetore Romo
@ coninunicato which explicitly defined the
attitude of the Holy See
ity was accorded the funeral services of
the King as a protest ‘asainst the execrable
crime’ of which he had been a vietini, and as
@ tribute to ‘the unquestionable tokens of
religious feeling’ which he had evinced, e
pecially during the months which preceded
his tragic death. This conimminicato was
at once understuod; indeed, there was no pos-
sibility of misunderstanding its intent: it sig-

against thespocts

nified that there had been no yielding of princi- |
ple, and that there would be no truce so long |

as the richts of the Papaey were withheld

thus, at the dramatic moment when the gaze ;

of the nations was fixed on Rome, did the
effectually protest once more against +

THE CHURCH MUST BE FREE

“And, in fact, the Roman question will not

that the Pope cannot sacrifice his freedom in

The late Senator Cusiman K. Davis of
Minnesota was a man of literary tastes and
acquirements as well as a distinguished
and anecessful lawyer. tHe was particularly
interested in the Shakesnearian drama,
and in 18838 he published a small volume en-
tided “ The Law in Shakespeare,” a second
edition of which haa recently come from
the press of the Weet Publishing Company
at St. Paul. In this the lawyer will find
collected 912 extracts from the plays and
poems of Shakespeare, each containing
legal phrase indicative
of Shakespeare's accurate familiarity with
the law of the land and the procedure of the
courts of justice in his day and generation.
rhe quotations are accompanied by defini.
tions of even the commonest legal terms
which occur in them, so that the work is
instructive and entertaining to the layman
as well as the lawrer: and there is an ex.
cellent index which enables the reader readily
to find the principal passages in which any
given word or phrase occurs. Thus, re
ferring to “ Bond,” we discover light ex-
tracta in which that word is used taken
from “Midsummer Night's Dream,” * The
Merchant of Venice,” “ Macbeth,” “ Richard
IL." and the 134th Sonnet.

A predecessor of Senator Cushman K. Davia
{n the study of Shakespeare's relations to the
law is Lord Chief Justioe Campbell, who, in 1859,
in the form of a letter to Mr. J. Payne Collier,
considered Shakespeare's legal acquirementa.
This letter was eulsequentiy published in a
thin volume by Murray. The arrangement
presents a separate discussion of the law in
each play under ite own title and the method
of treatment is more discursive than that
adopted by Senator Davis. Both authors

consider the conjecture that Shakespeare must |

have been emplored in an attorney's office at
some thine in order to acquire the wide and
acenrate knowledge of the law which Is so
manifest in his writings. Mr. Davis concludes
that “what the truth is inthis respect will prob-
ably never certainly be known.” Lord Camp-
hell thus atates his view of the question: “Were
an issue tried before me at the Warwick asaizes
‘whether William Shakespeare, late of Strate
ford-upon-Avon, gentleman, ever waa clerk
in an attorney's office in Stratford-upon-Avon
aforesaid,’ 1 should hold that there is evidence
to gotothe jurvinenpport of the affirmative,
but I should add that the evidence is very far
from being conclusive, and 1 ehould tell the
twelve gentlemen in the box that It Is a case
entirely for their decision —without venturing
even to hint to them, for their guidance,
any opinion of my own.” And he adds that
whichever way the verdict might be, the Judges,
sitting altogether in review, could not properly
set it aside and grant a new trial
