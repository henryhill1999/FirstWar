Recent developments in

Book Making,

Revolutionary, indeed, have been the de-
velopments in book making during the past 10
years. Previous to this the possession of o
library of well printed and richly bound books
was attainable only by those of liberal means,
To-day It Is easily within the reach of people
of even molcrate circums:ances. A_ well.
selected litray has become an essential feat.
ure in every home where any aspirations exist
toward cul.ure and refinement,

Even more notable have been the develop.
ments in the direction of artistic quality and
beauty. Book making has ceased to be merely
aproblem of mechanical skill. It has becomes
a fine art. The modern book is a picture for
the eye as well as a feast for the mind. How
Gelightful the typography. What taste and
care in the perfect proportion of margin. What
richness in decorative and illustrative work,
and how unique and beautiful the bindings.

The finest attainments of all publishers
are exhibited in our Book Store. A visit
of inspection will prove of rare interest
and material instruction to every lover of
good books.

Book bayers are pecaltarly

alert in discerning and taking
advantage of valuable price
opportunities. Can they recall
when leading publications were
offered at such prices as these ?
