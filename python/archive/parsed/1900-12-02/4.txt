ANGRY AT THE RBV. DR. CROWE.

Labor Unions Put Oat Over His Remarks About
Foreign-Born Citizens.

The labor unions which have foreign-born
citizens among their members, espcially those
on the East Side, are displeased with the re
marks of the Rev. Dr. W. 8. Crowe, made last
Sunday {n his sermon at the Universalist Church
of Eternal Hope, 142 East Eighty-tirst street,
The part of the sermon which has provoked
the most adverse criticism {ts the following:

“Steam worked the revolution. The ocean
steamer flooded us with the superstitious and

unwashed of all Europe, poured in a mighty
volume of tainted blood which has sadly de-

 

| teriorated the stock, Steam has caused the

wonderful exodus from city to city, where
the lower elements become quite trresponsible
because they can hide their vice from sight °
The miscellaneous section of the Central
Federated Union, which ts largely composed

| of unions of foreign-born people, adopted reso

lutions at {ts regular meeting in which the mem-
hers “emphatically protest against this clereye
man's in-inuation that vice {a rampant among
the poor and strongly advise him, if he dare,
to interest himself in that part of society which
is commonly Known as the ‘upper crust,” who
by the exploitation of the labor of others live
fn luxury, roll in wealth, and are, according
to his ideas, the selected Americans.”
