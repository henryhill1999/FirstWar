NIGHT OF TERROR IN CARACAS. ”

Story of the Recent Larthquake Which Did
Much Damage in the City.

Some interesting details of the recent earth-
quake at Caracas, Venezuela, are given in the
following from the Veneevelan Herald;

“On Sunday, the 28th of October, the town
of Caracas celehrated the Saint's Day of Simon
Rovar. The festivities were somewhat damp-
ened by rain, which fell in torrents during the
day, but toward evening the weather again
became serene, the stars came out, and all re-
tired without the slightest suspicion that the
night was to be otlier than tranquil, At 1
o'clock in the morning of tie 2th the ther-
mometer marked 21 degrees centigrade, the
eky was cloudiess and the air cool and still
At 445 a terrible crackling awoke the town
the crackling waa succeeded I'v a succession
of sharp socks of short duration but excep
tional violence, while from the interior of the

earth arose a dull, strance, tndefinably mys |

terious noise, the character of which it is im-
possible to annlyze
“As described by an eyewitness, the scene
at this moment was one of extreme terror and

Spring of 1901 than ever before, So we have gathered. The most noted
makers in the world have been busy with our orde’s for months that this
earl est showing of the new styles should not lack in brilliance. [hat they
have succeeded the Silks show Never was there such variety in one and
two and three tone colorings, never so much of baauty., Such fabrics do
not lend themselves easi!y to description —co ne ant see them — Each of
the styles is exclusive, too—will not be found elsewhere in Brooklyn,
Prices are moderate—from 49c. to $125 a yard. Ready to-morrow with
this bargain to add incentive to your coming:

9,000 Yards of Standard 98c. Printed Foulards at 69c.

9,000 yards of rich satin finished printed Foulards, in twelve beautiful
