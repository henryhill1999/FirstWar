t the

 

Kent county and Sussex county that vear |

had sent Republican delegations te the Leg.s-
ature, mich to the surprise of everybody and
there was a lively contest for the United States
Senatorship There was some trouble in the

 

 

Renubliean caucus and one of the members
soited, but in the end Anthony Higgins was ,
elected to succeed Eli Saulsbury, whose term

gad expired

As the months and vears werltoa Mr
secaume better known and he made it his ob-
fect ta become acquainted with the people of

the lower counties He went evervwhere and
rn { on evervbods He soon built up a
{tt oomachine of his own, There had always
pen o hostile feeling in Kent ond Suseex coun-

ties for the people of New Castle county, in
which Wilmington ts situated. Both parties
oad always split on the two lower counties
tnd New Castle, and Mr. Addickswas quick to
take advantage of the fact.
plaved an important part in the election for
Governor in 1890 and it has been charged that
ne assisted in a financial way to ald the
Democrats in ele ting Gov. Reynolds. The
Democrats carried the General Assembly in
180), but there was no Senator to be elected
At thet time each county elected seven repre
eentativea to the lower house om a general

ticket and three Senators from each county in | sations making up a State ticket containing

the same way, making the membership of the
General Assembly thirty. At the election in
inv? the Democrats again had a majority, and
Senator Gray, who bad filled out the unexpired
term of Mr. Bavard from 1885 and was revlected
in 1887, was again chosen. Mr. Addicks de-
shared that the Republicans who were by that
time opposing him were responsible fer the
election of Mr. Gray. He then set about with
more determination than ever to capture the
General Assembly to be elected in 1804

When the resuit was known it was found
that the Republicans had elected a m Uority,
pit that Mr. Addicks had at the most only six
followers out of a total of nineteer Never-
theless he at once declared that he had heaten
Mr. Higgins, who was to come up for reclection,
and that he would have the ploc> or clse create
avacancy. When the caucus %
docks men declined to take part and the others
decided upon Mr. Higgina as their choice.
The fight went on from that time during the
entire session, which began on the first Tues-
day of January and ended on May @

the Republicana had pineteen members tn

 
 

 

 

the joint session, and it required sixteen toelect, |

the membership being thirty. Addicks started
with aix men and the cther Republican votes
cere divided, although Mr. Higgin
with ten. On April § Gov. Marvil died and
Senator Watson, Speaker of the Sencte, became
acting Governor and retired from the Senate,
taking no further part in its deliberations,
Watson was a Democrat, The anti-Addicks
Republicans tried several candidates, but Mr
Addicks held his six men solid, oceasionally
creating a diversion by voting for some other
candidate who could not be chosen

On May 8 Henry A. Dupont appeared as a
candidate and remained in the field to the
end, Mr. Higgins and Mr. Massey withdrawing.
Many ballots were taken and at last one of the
Addicks followers left him and went to Dupont,
leaving Addicks with but five votes
day, May ©, the firht was resumed and after
six ballots had been taken another one of the
Addicks men gave signs of leaving him

Then a recess was called and during the
interval Senator Watson, then acting as Gov.

 

ernor, was prevailed upon, it is asserted by

Mr. Addicks personally, to take his seat in
the joint assem! ly Addicks knew that he
was to lose one of his five men and that would
give Dupont fifteen votes, or enough to
elect. But when Watson took his seat and
voted it required siateen votes to elect. The
second Addicks man did go to Dupont
The Republicans made no protest then, evi-
dently not seeing their advantage, and Wat-
son voted thirty-five times, the ballot result-
ing, Dupont, 1%, Addicks, 4

The hour of adjournment came and no elec-
* was announced. Then it was that thr

blicans declared, as they ought to have

done at first after Watson took his seat, that
the acting Governor had no right to vote for
Senator, not having exercised any of the fur
tions of a Senator since the death or Gov. Mar-
vil. But it was too late, and although there
Was a vacancy created by th, four Addicks
men, the United States .enate refused
to seat Dupont and practicaliy declared
that Watson had a right, according to the
Ad:icks and Deinceratic contention, to vote
for Senator. During that contest Mr. Addicks
and hs four men, e from Sussex counts
and one from New Castile county, took as their
or’ dicks or nobedy,” an echo of “Me or

of the General Assen bly to prevent Mr. Ad-

stay out against him, even to the extent of
two vacant seats, vary from #ix to eleven. It
would reguice only three membera to prevent
Mr. Addicks from winning, unless he should
again persuade some Democrats to come to
nla support. The only Derroeratic payer in
Wiirington favora a union of the Democrats
and the Regular Republicans to elect two
Recular Republicans to the Senate, but the
Regulars will not listen to that, fearing that
such a project would drive Democrats to Ad-
kicks, who je sald to have intimated that there
were Addicks Democrats

It was a curious old-world life that the boy
led at this time The choristers had duties
regularly jaid out for them, in addition to their
regulir partiipation in the services at the
chapels. They were expected to sing every
Sunday in the royal chapels at lh A. Mo and 4

o'clock on Easter morning: to sing the Latin

Various services they reeeived tees varying
from a shilling to a guinea On the Queen's
birthday they got five guineas anlece, a glass
of wine and a piece of plum cake. On Faster
morning they received ten shillings and a eup

by the nobility during the winter season, when
they sang glees and madrigals All their earn
ings went to the master, who at the end of the
term of their indenture gave them a fixed sum
or the aceumulation of their fees after a cere

The first half crown
was before this period an! he sot it for sing-
ing at Fulham Palace “With Verdure Clad.”

| He added to this a sixpeace that a boy owed |
him, and bought Handel's “Samson.” At this |
early age he had developed the business in- |

‘tinet which stood him later in good stead
His large fortune was ina measure due to the
eare with which he made his investments, and
for many years of hia life he had the benefit
of association with W. 8. Gilbert and D’Orles
Carte. Those two were his equals in business,
and Gilbert's econom’ in such matters after-
ward developed until it eatsed his quarre! with
the two other partners in his vastly succesful
enterprises and resulted in a loss of thousands

that ths American woman to whom Sir Arthur

valuable in directing the attention of her

And there were other schemes in which she was
of equal help to the composer in his capacity
of man of business.

Once while in the choir of the Chanel Roval
young Sullivan sang a solo and he wrote to Ha
father that he should not fail te
papers. “And most likely sou will see about

it,” he wrote, “for there was a reporter and he |

took down m- name and a good deal more.”
He sang at the onening of the Crvstal Palace

membership in the Chapel Roval cho ten
shillings for an anthem he composed. During

feeling heavy-headed, with
pale face, haggard looks,
dull and heavy, ringed eyes,
and go about their daily em-
ployment with tired limbs,
exhausted energies, nerveless
and ambitionless.

There is one sure way to
cure sleeplessness, and that is
by the use of Dr. Greene's
Nervura, the great brain and
nerve invigorator. This won-
derful remedy is Nature’s owa
sleep producer, and is perfectly
harmless, being made from
pure vegetable medicines
fresh from the lap of Nature.
It may be given to infants,
children, or the most delicate
invalids without fear. It
soothes, calms, and quiets the
weakened, irritable and over-wrought
nerves, producing perfect repose, and
refreshing, natural sleep; at the same
time it builds up and tones up the
shattered nerves and gives renewed

life, strength, vitality and vigor to the system.
