RBAL FATATR NEWS.

Interest in the brokerage business was an.

livened this week by the publication of reporte
fncerming several bie dean in necotuatuor
Bit the transactions aetoaily commuinmated

= up to the weekly avera@e sines the eler
n, were somewliat of a disappointment, in
riat thee failed to reflect the mimulative activ.
ty whieh wae egnected to develop during the
month  Rueneas meaeored by normal stand-
ards remare unimpertant in volime and oon-
fined to speculative channels Ae compared
with the recent past, however, current reporta
show 47 increase in sales of lote to builders
and boiiding loan operaters, and this clroum-
eftance may perhaps be taken to foreshadow
Aome @xpension in the speculative branch of
the marhet

A large proportion of the buildings currently
projected are elevator apartinent how ses. which
at first glance may seem aurprisirgin view of
the oversupply p pularly supposed to exist ip
this lassofhousing However, as a matter of
fact, the eondition of overmmpply applies par-
ticularly, If not exclusively, to medium-priced
apartment's, especially apartmentsof seven aad
eigit rooins andit will be found thatin curren®
projection buildera are aiming to produce
@ither comparatively expensive suites Of ap-
proximately a doven rooma or small suites,
which can be let at less than the prevailing
acaleof rents To lower rents high-priced lote
inexclusive localities are avoided anda frankly
unpretantions interior Minish adopted, while the
num ber and sizeof the roomelin each autte are re
duced to a minimum, so that the accommodations
will vome within the means of a class of ten-
antry which haa not hitherto been appealed

| to Houses of this kind are generally seven

6torias, the full height permitted in the case
of semi-freproof construction, and every par-
ticle of the site available under the Building
lawiscovered

Large apartments and high rents are almed
at more espectally by constructing six-story
bulldings preferably in established private
house neiehborhoods, a generous part of the
alie being reserved for Iicht and air The
story lessin height has the advantace of mater-
laliv modifying the cost of construction, per
mit‘ting oneinstead of twofreproof floors, while,
as the Building law ealls for disproportionately
thicker walls in a seven-story buliding, 45 per
cent is saved on the cost for brick work In
the lower elevation. Wirth fewer passengers to
carry in a six-story building the elevator ser-
vice will permit of houses of wider dimension.
Thero are few private dwellings of less than ten
rooms, and still fewer apartments that contain
But the apartinent house thes

the averace dwelling will present a distinct
advantage in economy over the latter

So far as uptown elevator apartment houses
are concerned, therefore, the slight increase
of constructional work foreshadowed in the
ourrent brokerage reports is amply justified
The only other class of projections which are
on the increase are tenements and common
flata, chiefly on the Fast Side below Twentieth
street. But as rents here have either risen
or remained for some years stauionary, and as
the present tendency is to substitute fate for
antiquated tenements, the moderate degree
of building activity which has so far developed
is distinctly reassuring, whether viewed from
a technical or a sociological standpoint.

Apart from the usval quota of private houses
and flate and tenements the dealing in im
comprised three elevator
apartment houses and one mercantile build-
ing, which served to maintain the recent weekly
average, though far from approaching @ nore
mai November budget.
