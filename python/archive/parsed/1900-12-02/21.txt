A recent feature, showing the possibilities of SPARKLET'S, has been the invention ef the Aerostat, or phy-
ticiane’ rubber bag with Sparklet attachment, which promises to open yp an entirely new field to the practitioner.
The Medical Journals have commented most favorably on the action of Carbonic Acid and this method of application.
Besides this, several valuable patents and improvemenrs have lately been perfected for developing the further applica-

tion of the SPARKLET system to such gases as Oxygen, Chlorine, etc.

THE PCSSIBILITIES OF SPARKLETS

According to commercial agency ratings there is at present invested in the manufacture of carbonated bev-

erages in the United States alone over $125,000,000.00.

Every syphon sold begins at once to produce a revenue by creating a demand for capsules, experience teaching that
each syphon earns at least $10.00 a year, and a conservative estimate of 300,000 syphons sold duriag 1g01
will produce a profit of over $3,000,000. In the present year, without any factory, without goods to supply
the increasing demand and with imported goods which were mostly defective, the sales Rave been sufficient to pay
an 8 per cent. dividend on every share of the Preferred stock issued—had the goods been manufactured at our factory
—and these sales have been merely local to the East, without considering the West, South and export trades,
which are now demanding the goods.

A NEWLY EQUIPPED FACTORY

The new factory, located ap Bridgeport, Conn., is now complete and equipped under the direct supervision
of the inventor of SPARKLETS, Mr. Emile Sterne, C. L., of Paris, France.

It consists of a brick building 200 feet long by 60 feet wide and two stories high, where anything pertaining
to the business, except glass bottles, is made. The building is equipped with a complete gas plant and manu-
factures its gas from the burning of coke, which is passed through lime water, rendering it abselutely pure. The
purity of this gas alone makes drinks aerated by means of SPARKLETS superior to every carbonated drink on the
market, as the carbonic acid gas in the latter is made from sulphuric acid and marble dust.

Automatic machines convert sheet stee) through various operations into SPARKLETS, The cheapness and
superiority of our steel and the diminution of operations enab® us to manufacture at about one-half the cost of
foreign companies, al] of whom have been very successful dividend payers.

o Dr. Martin £ Valdstein, New York, ove of the foremost chemisis ia this country, aad we quote below the result of his

“T have carefully gone over the patents and reports of your consulting engineer, as alan the various data, such as reports,

liquids therein described.

“My conclusions, after carefully going over all the features of this case, ave the following:

“ £irst —1 consider these patents to be very broad, thereby covering the feld effectually and making ft 4ificult to circum
