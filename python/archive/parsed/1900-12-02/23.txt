Only Heard in the Other—A Comedy From |
Lendon and Some Koariesqucs in @ Farce |

—Hiustrations of Helasco Stagecraft.

The production here of Edmond Rostard’s
*L'Aigion” in French, with Sarah Bernhardt
as tho Bonaparte boy, made the fact clear
that Louls N. Parker In the English trane-
lating and Maude A-lams in the acting had
changed some of the drama’s purport. Probably
the boldness of the alteration had beer, Charies
Frohman’s, and eich observer of the two per-
formances ia quite free to hold a personal
opinion about it. But the object of the astute
American manager is plain. He desired that
bis actress should have a sympathenc role
The departures which he very likely ordered
from the Rostand text and the Bernhardt in-
terpretation are all in ti \t direction In the
French depiction of The Aaylet he ts wilful in
Aisposition, assertive in ambition, and in-
dependent in action. In the English variant
he is of a gentler nature, the creavire of cire
cumstances, and at nearly ali times submissive
to them. In the one case his appeal is to the
brains of the audience only, and in the other
to the hearts as well) This aveidance of in.ila-
tion by Miss Adams saves her from the ordeal
of comparison with Mies Bernhardt, and enables
her to cive a delineation winsomely peculiar
to herself. Who knows but it is also one which
would command the entire approval of the
guthor? His language is not perverted, and

forms of wounded and writhing wretches
appear in the gloom of the background, and
make a ghostly spectacle as they fling their
arms and cry out. No such things are shown
at the Knickerbocker. The reason fer their

Daniel Frohman's admirable company is
doing a great deal for the London comedy
with which the regular season at Daly's was
begun last week. The play is an intellectunl
composition, with faults for ita producer to
contend with Evidently when Walter Frith
set out te write “The Man of Forty” he had
a surplus ef geed ideas, and liked them all
so well that he weuld net diseard ene. If he

this fault clearly The curtain rises on a
ecene between a coming young man and 4
woran journalist Their conversation brings
elous and the supporter of a woman whom
he intends to marry. That the coming chap
has @ twin brother, his exact image, who has
sone quite to the bad, is also disclavsed Then
a second part of the plot unfolds itself
In a scene between the two-scom-man and
the woman he loves it is shown that he desires
to marry her, tnt that she is doubtful whether
her husband is dead. He left her in South
Africa, and she came to London, where she
opened a tea room ta aupport her two children,

ie for the better in the seene on the Wagram
battlefield The vouth at the Garden Theatre,
being frustrated in his political plot by the
Austrian police, shocked hy the suicide of his
only remaining comrade and seared by the
imacinary phantoms of soldiers who have
died there, is relieved of the terror of hia de-

A third motive comes out when the daughter

of this situation is interrupted simply to intro.

Apropos of dramatic art, there were some
ohiect lessons last week at the Cirand Orera
House. It will be recalied that “Naughty
Anthony” had a sickly infancy in Rroadway,
and careful nurture barely carried it through
alive. The trouble with it was that although
born to be a farce or nothing, it tried to be a
comedy. It almost diedin the effort to change
ite nature, But It became robust when the
mistaken treatment was abandoned, and this
week it 1@ alive and kicking in Fle). h avenue.
David Relaseo has never told where he got the

seemingly foret@n origin haa not been located
by anyoneelse. There are suggestions in it that
a French plece and a German were blended.
A certainty inthe work done on i! by Mr. Belaaco
is that he meant to make its wickedness polite

young woman who uses her legs to display the
wares of a hosiery merchant is restored to
what she probably was in the original French
play —a brazen hussy, who does not wait for
a business demand to raise her skirts, but does
it sooner because she likes to, and extends it
far beyond the top reach of her stockings.
That is highly reprehensible, of course, but
just what the case calls for, Similarly full
exploitation is given to all the other characters,
and the upshot is hiarioue diversion.

There was the same pride and shame for
Mr. Belasco in the bill at the Grand Opera
House that there had been when “Naughty
Anthony” and “Madame Butterfly® were oou-
pled incongruously at the Herald Square.
‘The manner in which he put Mr. Long’s plain-
tive Japanese story on the stage was extremely
artful. He brought out the author's pointe
with combined delicacy and positiveness.
To appreciative people the hit of the tragedy
and the miss of the farce nearly squared the
account. The good of the one almost atoned
for the bad of the other. But the gallery at
the Grand is as assertive as the parquet, and
while the lower part of the house weeps over
poor little Madame Butterfly the upper part
laughs, The disagreement does not arise
from the inferiority of the present actress to
her predecessor. It {s not because charming
naturalness has given way to obvious mimicry
in the representation of the deserted young

peculiar merit of his condensation of hours
into minutes where the trustful Japanese girl
watched for her American lover's return. The
whole night of her vigil at the window was
indicated with perfect clearness by the twi-
light of nightfall, the darkness of night, the
lampe that slowly burned out, and the dawn of
morning, all without other sounds than an
accompaniment of soft music. Nothing in

less portion. But it seems that the right kind
of people were requisiteon the other sid« of the
footlights. The parquet at the Grand was
alert to the significance of the pantomine,
tut the gallery, falling to see the meaning,
made fun of it Thus the limitations and re-
strictions iinposed upon the playwright when
he writes for the general] public were once more
iustrated. |

} APOLLO

will a new glory to your piano
You will be surprised at the amount of
genuine delight it will bring into the
family life.

The Apollo is simply a_self-playing
attachment for the piano. There is not
a piano attachment on the market that in
any way compares with it. The proof
of this statement is easily demonstrated.
Its fone for public patronage are sev-
eral,

It is moderate in price.

It is more compactly and therefore
more strongly built.

It is easier to play, as it requires less
expenditure of physical force,

ts tone is superior, richer and mofe
brilliant.

Its mouthptece enables the performer
to transpose the music to any key de-
Sired, a device that no other attachment
possesses,

It can play coloratura music in a more
artistic manner than any other attach-
mnt.

Its delicacy and responsiveness appeal
to the musician. On account of its sim-
plicity it is easily mastered by those
who have no knowledge whatever of
piano technique.

Informal Apollo recitals every after-
noon and evening. A pleasant half hour
may be spent in the Apollo parlors.
