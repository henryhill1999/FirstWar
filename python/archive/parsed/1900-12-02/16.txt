houses is the one given to the children of the

his travels, so said the soft-spoken, gentlefaced
Oriental, nothing else moved him and ap-
pealed to him as did that pathetlo crowd of
whitewfaced, suffering children; so he went
back to London and took counsel with English
friends. As a result of this consultation a five-

SOUTH CAROLINA GAME BIRDS.

E@orts to Prevent the Extermination of Quaile
and Partridges.

Cuan eston, 8. C., Nov. 80.—In order to
protect game birds, which were threatened
with extermination in this State, the Legis-
lature of South Carolina at its last session
passed a law prohibiting dealers from selling
or offering for sale partridges or quails killed
within the State for a period of five years.
The law does not attempt to stop the sale of
| birds brought in from other States, and the
act has Just gone into effect.

It has caused many complications, and among
other things has opened a blind tiger market
for birds which {n a measure will equal the
blind tigers where liquor {s eold. The hunt-
ing associations and game preserve clubs re-
cently organized have undertaken to see that
the law !s enforced. The dealers in Charies-
ton and the managers of restaurants will be
watched, but partridges are still being served
and sold. Denlers who are asked about the
| working of the new law say it does not inter-
fere with their business, as the birds are in
' constant demand and for that reason they
have to keep on hand large supplies, which
are ordered from Georgia, It is evident that
| the law is not giving the greatest protection
to the birds, but that ther are being killed as
usual and the blind tiger market {s thriving.

In recent vears the frequent storms aiong
the coast have thinned out the partridges to
a remarkable extent. Floods caught the young
birds and drowned them. and instances are |
known where two broods in one season have |
been entirely destroved. Higher up in the
State the eame cause of destruction did not
operate, although from one reason or another
the birds were being killed off.

The greatest enemy to game birds in this
State is the man with the trap. Negroes in.
the coast country who knew that good prices
were paid for birds found it rather a poor plan
to go out and shoot them, so they revived the
old plan of trapping For a long distance |
lending to the trap a lineof corn would Ne care-
fully put down, and this would run right up

nnder the cage The birds would go under
the cage without hesitation, eat the corn and
then find that they could not escape because
they never tried to sneak under the edges
of the tran, trying instead to climb or flv ont
Another form of trap would spring and fall
when the covey was under With Little or no
le the negroes could catch an entire covey,
and the profits were large
Hunters who find these trans demolish them
with the greatest) satisfaction Not long
ne» a Charleston hunter while out one day
f Jlowed his dow when the latter had pointed,
bur the cover was not flushed Going up
eantionsiy he saw the cage He kicked over
the tran and allowed the birds to flv for their
lives With the two barrele he caught four
hirda, which waa a good record considering
the faet that the eoves seattered in a dozen
diraettons The same hunter while ont on a
three davs’ hunt smashed fourteen traps in
very small territory
There is another clacs of huntera who try
to find a cover all huddled un ina heap Fre.
Honently the birds run together hefora being |
flushed, and a man with a good eve ean find |
the eovev and kill almost every bird tn ft with
asingle barrel This unsporteamanilile business
has helned to decrease the stock |
This season the hiunterea anv there ia a good
stock of birds notwithstanding the onslaught

was propitious, and the voung ones were pot

WINDOW CLEANING.

 

Some Views on the Dangers of a Pecullariy
Modern Occupation,

“Tanppose,” said ashopkeeper, as the window
cleaner who had been washing his windows
shouldered hia ladders, picked up his bucket
and walked awar, “that the accident insurance
people would tell us that the causes of death
by accident are almost numberless, they are
so various, but there la one canse that is cer-
tainly peculiarly modern, that has been added
within recent vears, and that is, by fall while
cleaning windows Cleaning windows, aa {t
fs done now, is a trade, with men constantly
employed at it, as In any other occupation
men who are daily and constantly climbing
around on the outside of buildings, standing
on window sills high in the air, washing win-
dows, for a tiving, as a blacksmith shoes horses,
or, for instance, as a sailor follows the sea
Vvery now and then we read of some window

cleaner's falling from such and such a build-
ing, to be killed or injured in this or that man-
ner’ and the only wonder to me is that there
are not more such neccidents And, really,
washing windows Itself, av a trade, iust going
around all day, and day atter dac, washing
windows for acbving. in houses and etoree and
banks and tall buildings and all that sert of
thine’, seems to ome, sirorle as it is, one of the
mnnet enete f the mane ode aeoumations

“But Twas saving TI wondered that more
window cl s didn't fall from the front
of buildings it's 9 wreater wonder to me that
more of them don't fall through windows they
are cleaning on the street level. Take my
place here, for example. It's cheaper and
more convent in every wav for me to have
my windows aned than itis to clean therm
j myself the clearer does it better and quicker
than IT eould, and onee a week ata fixed hour
jhe comes and polishes off the windows, and
then goes on to the next place on his reyte
Now, vou saw him just now, when he had his
ladder up against the corner of the window,
with that padded, bollowed-out block at the
top of it, against the corner bar And no
doubt you've seen window cleaners a thousand
) times standing on a ladder that is jointed in
the middle, werking at the front of a window
with that narrow top part of the ladder acainst
the building or the casing over the window

“Tt is an constant wonder to me that that
ladder doesn't slip off the corner bar when
the cleaner'’s go’ it there, as he leans one way
and the other out over the glasses and it's
ierenter wonder to me that the ladder doesn't
break in two in the middle, or the foot of it
slide out oon the sidewalk, when he's in front
of the glass, and drop him and the ladder
through it. Of eourse cleaning windows is
his business and he knows how to handle the
ladders and himself: but oll the same I wonder
how he escapes as he does, Maybe there have
been just such aecidents and I have never
happened to hear of them, but I don't want to
see one myself. I om always glad when the
man gets through wilt my windows and picks
up the ladders and bucket and goes on to the
next place.”
