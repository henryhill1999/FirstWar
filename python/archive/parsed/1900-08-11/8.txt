shown by the character of the bids opened by
the Navy Tepartment to-day for furnishing
armor for the battleships and protected cruls-
era quthorized by Congress In 1809 and 1900. The
hides covered armor for seventeen vessels,
etght battleships, six armored cruisers
and three protected cruisers, and the total
armor required is 85,050 tons,
with a7) fons of bolts and nuts to affix it In
place on the ships. There was a gratifying de-
oreaaa in (ve amount of the proposals from the
prices fixed when the previous attempt was
rhade to get armor face-hardened by the Krupp
process Then the @rmor companies insisted on

Aneweompetitor in the armor-making fleld,
the Midvale Steel Company, submitted a pro-
posal to furnish 81,000 tons of heavy Krupp
armor, the total amount required of that claas,
at gos8a ton without any charge for royalty,
put the delivery of the first armor was not to
take place until twenty-six months after the
date of the contract, this long period being re-
quired, presumably, by the Midvale Company
to construct an armor-making plant. Accord-
ing to opinions expressed by naval offictals after
tha pid opening the Midvale bids could be ac-
cepted {f an arrangement could be made by
which the other two concerna would modify
identical proposala so as to take
the contract for furnishing armor for the
three armorelads now under construction
for which no armor has been provided, and
thus give the Midvale company time to estab
fshaplant capable of turning out plates for
the rest of the battleships and armored cruisers
authorized, which will not be ready for their
protection for acouple of years. But the Car-
negie and Bethlehem companies propose to take
eontracta for not leas than 15,000 tons each of
heavy armor and not less than 18,500 tons each
of all classesof armor. An attempt to adjust
thematier insuch a way as to reduce the total
price from the figures proposed by tne Carne-
gieand Bethiehem companies will probably be
made when Secretary Long returns to Wash-
ington Such an adjustment contemplates
awarding contracts tothe Midvale Company

The ng. were opened inthe presence of the
acting Secretary of the Navy, the Chief of the
Ordnance Bureau, the Chief Constructor, other
naval oticials and representatives of the armor
maki g concerns.

The bid opening was of. unusual interest
because jf Waa to tast the effect on the armor
makers of the practical ultimatum delivered
to them by Congress in the last Naval act, that
{f the Secretary of the Navy believed the price
he was asked to pay for armor was excessive
he should. in his discretion, make arrange-
mente for the erection of an armor plant. The
act authorized the Secretary of the Navy to
buy the best armor at $445 @ ton, but to pay
$545 a ton, unless he considered this price ex-
cessive, in which event he was to arrange for
the manufacture of armor by the Government.

There were three bidders on the armor and
other bidders on the bolta and nuta required
to affix it to the shi The bidders on or
were the Carnegie Steel Company, the Bethle
hem Steel Company, and the Midvale Steel
Company, all Pennsylvania concerns. The
Midvale company. which has neyer made
armor for the Government, submitted the
lowest bids. Those of the Carnegie and Beth-
lehem companies were identicsl.

The bids were divided into three classes, and
edch of these was subdivided. (Class A in-
eluded armor for ape and armored
crulsers, improved and face-hardened, of five
{nchea or more in thickness, in lots rangi
from 31,000 tons, the total amount r wired,
to 2,500 tons, with the requisite quantity of
bolts and nuts Under this class the bids were
as follows

hirty-one thousand tons: Midvale company
$438 A ton, aggregate, $13,578,000; 25,000 tona:

their

Midvale company, $440 a ton, agaregate
$11,000,00;  20,000 tons; Midvale company,
442 a ton, aggregate $8,840,000; 15,000 tons:

Carnegie and Bethlehem companies, $445 a
ton, aggregate $6,675,000; Midvale company,
‘4a ton, aggregate $6,910,000; 10,000 tons;
Midvale company, $406 a ton, aggregate $4,-
600,000; 5,000 tons; Midvale company, $500 a
ton, aggregate $2,500,000; 2,500 tons, Midvale
company, $535 & ton, Aggregate $1,325,000.

Under this class the Carnegie and Beth-
lehem companies agreed to begin deliveries
in six months and to continue at the rate of
8) tons a month thereafter. To their bid
must be added $45 a ton for royalty on the
Krupp process of face-hardening armor, bring-
ing the bid of these two sompantes on 15,000
tons. the only lot proposed to furnished by
them, to $440 a ton on armor hardened by the

rupp process. The Midvale company, Low:
Kt: agreed not to make any charge for rovalty.
It fixed the time for beginning deliveries at
twenty-six months from the date of con-
tract and offered to deliver armor at the rate
of 500 tons a month thereafter.

Class Bb included armor for battleships and
armored cruisers, face hardened, of lesa than
five inches in thickness, aggregating 3,800
tons. The bids follow: Carnegie and Beth-
Iehom, $400 a ton, aggregate $1,520,000: charge
for rovalty, $11.20 a ton, or $411.20 for each ton
of armor furnished, with the royalty included
The Midvale company did not bid on this clnss,
but did bid on the fifty tons of bolts and nuts
included at $827 a ton

me cruisers and protected crutgers, not
ace hardened. Only 1,150 tons of this ordinary

Bids for furnishing bolts and nuts were re-
celved also from the Carnenter Steel Company

The three firma that submitted bids on armor
eachenclosed a letter withits bid containing al-

ehem alternative proposals, practically identi-
cal, were that if contracts for an aggregate of

AN OLD SWINDLER NABDED.

Second Member of a Notorious Gold Brick
Gang Arrested Within a Week.

James Blackwell, alias Stanley, alias Cam-
eron, alias Fisher, a member of «a notorious
gold brick gang, was arraigned before Mag-
{strate Mayo in the Centre street police court
yesterduy morning, charged with being a fugt-
tive from justice from Springfield, Mass., where
he, with two other members of the gang, suc-
cessfully worked the gold brick swindle. He
was committed to the Tomba without bail to
await requisition papers. The prisoner was
arrested at 3 o'clock Thursday afternoon at 70
Fast 105th street by Central Office Deteotive
Foye, Supt. Holmes of the Thiel Detective Ser-
vice and three assistants

Police Inspector Boyle of Springfield, tdenti-
fled Blackwell as one of the gang of sharpers,
others of whom are known to the police as
Frank Smith, alias Frank Lockwood, 51 years
old, and Cameron Bostetter, alias White, alias
Red Adams, alias Big Charlie, 56 years old
Black well is 58 years old. They have worked
the gold brick game all through this country
and Canada, Smith's profits alone in seven
years amounted to $110,500, He was arrested
in Hogansville, N. ¥., about a week ago for his
connection in the Springfield deal. He waived
his requisition rights and is now in Springflel
awaiting trial,

David Leonard a farmer, about 60 years old,
living near Feeding Meadows, a hamlet. near
Springfleld, was the vietimn of the swindle of
which Blackwell is aceused. Early in April
Leonard was coming out of church on Sunday
morning when he was approached by Smith,
who shook hands with him and addressed him
as Mr. Leonard. Smith appeared at Leonard's
home a few days later and told him of an Indian
who lived about four miles away, who had
some wold bricks, the value of which he did not
know. Jeonard took the bait. and the two
men drove out to see the Indian, who pro-
duced two bricks. In Leonard's presence
Smith bored both bricks and did the borings
up carefully in a paper. Leonard wanted, the
borings assayed, so he and Smith drove to
Springfield Smith stopped the horse in front
of a jewelry store and went in to have the bor-
ings tested. He returned and said that, while
the jeweller could not make the test himself, he
had recommended a Government assayer who
lived in the hotel acroas the street. The al-
leged assayer, it is charged, was Black well
He announced that the borings were pure gold

Leonard and Sinith drove back to the Indian
After Léonard had succeeded in inducing the
Indian to come down from $5.000 to $4,000 for
the bricks, he paid him $4,000 that he had drawn
from three different banks and took his pur-
chase home. The next morning, after wait-
ing several hours for Smith, who had promised
to see him and pring one of the bricks, he be-
came suspicious and broke them open with an
axe When he saw that they were spurious
he drove to Springfield and offered $500 reward
for the arrest of the swindlers

The gang was next heard from in Dallas,
Tex. Then they turned up near Montreal,
Canada, whence they were shadowed to this
country. Smith was followed to Hogansburg,
and Blackwell to this city, where he went to
live with his wife in East 105th street.

Repeated calls failed to bring any one to the
door at the 105th street address, and Detective

THINKS THE NEW CRUISERS TOO BIG.

Chief Constructor Hichbora Opposes the
Plans of His Colleagues.
WASHINGTON, Aug. 10. At a meeting of the
Naval Board on Construction to-day Chief
Constructor Hichborn presented a report dis-
senting from the recommendation of his four
colleagues that the three protected cruisers au-

 

 

 

9,500 tous displacement. Admiral Hichborn
contended that as the law provided for varsels
of “about &,000 tons each’ and for protected
cruisers, the majority of the board had gone
contrary tothe law in expanding the displace-

ment to such a marked degree and in providing |

side armor, thus contemplating armored crui-
sers. He held also that the weights provided
were too excessive for the size of the type and
that the vessels could not be built within the
limit of the appropriation.
proposed an alternative plan for vessels of
about 8,500 tons each without armor and witha
apeed of twenty-three knots an hour, instead of
twenty-two knots as contemplated by the board
for the 9,500 ton cruisers.

The in mority report will be submitted to the
Secretary of the Navy with @ response by the
mavorisy The board maintains that it had the
Tight to recommend 0,500-ton ships as the best
vessels that could be constructed within the
limitof the appropriation. It holds also that
the weights arranged can be provided for within
the displacement fixed. When the plans for the

DEFENCE ALL IN,
HIS TRIAL FOR THB MURDER OF
GOEBEL NEARLY FINISHED.

More Testimony Reflecting on the Witness
Youtsey—Prosecation’s Testimony Contra-
dicted on Important Potnt—Powers’s Con-
dact When He Heard of Goebel's Death.

Georogtown, Ky., Aug. 10.--The defence in
the Powers trial closed its testimony at 1:45
o'clock this afternoon and rested its case. The
Commonwealth began its rebuttal{testimony at
once and hopes to conclude by to-morrow night.
The jury may go to Frankfort on Monday,
view the scene of the tragedy and the speeches
may begin on Tuesday, unless the day {s con-
sumed in arguing the instructions sought to be
given the jury.

The star witness to-day was Walter R. Day,the
State Treasurer, while Taylor was Governor.
He gave some damaging testimony against
Henry Youtsey, Solomon Wilder, Police Judge
of Corbin, said he had a conversation with
Robert Noaks in which Noakes said he knew
nothing of a conspiracy to kill Goebel and
further said he thought Caleb Powers was
innocent of any connection with the conspiracy.
Wilder was asked concerning the general repu-
tation of the members of Noaks’s military com-
pany and said some of them did not have good
reputations. (n cross-examination he said
that one of the officersof the company had
recently killeda man ina barn over a game of
eraps When the peaceful petitioners returned
to Corbin on the night of Jan. 25 he hearda
great deal of shooting and had several trials in
bis court resulting from the shooting.

Harvey Chambers, manager of the Western
Union Telegraph Company at Cieorgetown,
produced under subpena the following tele-
gram seat by Robert Noaks at 4:05 P. M., July
26, the day he testified:

“Miss EMe Blankenship, Crawfordsville, Ind:

“Send me by express all my letters since my
arrest. Rush. Important. R. Noags."

The defence introduced and had read to the
Jury the legislative act appropriating $100,000
to apprehend the murderers of Senator Gobel.

Walter R. Day, the Republican State Treas-
urer at the time Goebel was shot, said:

“At Lagrange Golden came into our car and
told Powers and me that Goebel hid been shot
since weleft Frankford. Powers sald: ‘That isa
damned shame and ruins our chances to win
our contests’ TIT concurred in what he said
Powers talked like he was in earnest.”

Tn answer to questions by Col. Campbell, the
witness said

“I never talked or consulted with any one
about the murder of Senator Ginebel. Henry
Youtsey sent me a message on Monday a week
or two before the shooting that he wanted to
see me. I went to his office in the Executive

Bullding. He was seated at the typewriter,
and when I went in he got upand closed the
door. He did not say he lacked $800 of having

     
  

 

| a fund big enough to have Goebel killed, but he

did say he could settle the contest for $300. I
asked him several times how he would settle it,
but all he ever sald was, ‘I can settle the con-
test for $300.’

“IT inferred that he was after no good pur-
pose and left, telling him thatIl was not that
kind ofa man. On theday of the Vanmeter-
Berry contest Laaw Youtsey in the reception
room next to Powers's office, sitting by the
middle window with a gun in his lap. The
window was raised tour or five inches I spoke
to Mae Todd about it and asked him what
Youtsey was doing with the gun. Todd went
over toward Youtsey, and the latier got up
and walked out,"’

‘Two letters to Breck Hill, Democratio Secre-
tary of State, were shown and the witness was
He said yes, and both

tion the Commonwealth began {ts rebuttal tes-
timony and putthe Rev. Mr. Stamper on the
stand. When asked if in going to Frankfort

Chief Lusby, Harry Stough and
Policeman McCarty, he told them he wanted
them to protect Golden, as he was afraid he
would be harmed if the other side got hold of
him, he answered that he did not and continu-
ing said:

“I did not tell therm I believed everythin
Golden had told was true, but I may have sai
the greater parto it was true. I did not say
then I was in avmpathy with the prosecution.’
Zach Lusby, Chief of Police of George! own, said
Stamper did tel! himon the way to Frankfort
that he did believe that Golden had told the
truth about everything and that Stamper said
he was in full sympathy with the prosecution

Henry Hazelwood, attorney of London, Ky,
said James Sparks did say in his presence in
Tondon that Goebel wou'd never be Governor
as he would be killed and Taylor would pardon
the men who would do {'; that th» pardons were
already made out and only lacked the insertion
of the names of the men who would do the
killing

John Watkins, a London merchant, said
Sparks told him Goebel was to be killed.

Judge \\. L, Jett of Frankfort avid he was in
the State House yard right after the shooting
and that he made no sort of threats; that there
wasno mob and no one trying to harm the
building or its occupants; that all that was
done was to summon several deputy sheriffs
who were ordered to keep anybody from leav-
ing the Executive Building until it was searched
for the assassin.

TROUBLE FOR THE NEW MINISTER.

 

 

Woman Who Acts as His Secretary Caagses It
Her Hasband After Her.

Riveraead, 1. 1, Aug. 10. The Rev John
Edward Nichols, the pastor of the Cook Me-
morial Colored Methodist Church in this village,

| came here from Newark, N. J., about a month

ago. Yesterday a colored woman arrived and
Mr. Nichols announcéd she was Rena Johnson
and would hereafter act as his secretary, the

ehurch organist, Sunday school teacher and
general helper. The woman had not been in
town long when a colored man who said he was
William Brown of 164 York street, Jersey
City, came in search of her Brown said the
woman Was his wife and that she had left her
boarding place that morning, telling her land-
lady that she was going to Atlantic City. The
woran admitted that she was Brown's wife
The husband told several persons that the
worman had acted as the minister's secretary in
Newark. Brown said the minister had caused
his arrest for shooting at him. He consulted
a lawyer here and wants to have some one
locked up

The Rev. Mr. Nichols states that Brown

FOR TRIAL,

  

DUNLAP HELD

Examination on the Usury Charge in Joffer-
son Market Court.

The final hearing (n the case of John L. Dun-
lap, the brother of Evangelist Wilson W. Dun-
lap, who is charged with usury tn connection
with the conduct of the Home Loan Asso-
elation and the Local Credit Association at
73 West Eleventh street, took place in the Jef-
ferson Market court yesterday. The de-
fendant’s counsel sought to prove by him that
he had never been anything but the salaried
employee of two regularly incorporated stock
companies. The defendant said he did not
know the names of any director in either con-
cern, his employment by them having been
managed by their attorney, Paul M. Turner.
When asked where he got the money to carry
on the business, he said that it came from Tur-

ner. He reported to Turner and he turned
over the profits to Turner

Turner was present during the hearing and
held repeated conferences with the counsel.

“Did you ever use the name of Chapin?”
asked Assistant District Attorney Keith.

“Never.”

Q. Did you receive mall in response to ad-
vertisements published over that name? A,
The Local Credit Company did.

Q. Does the Local Credit Company occupy
an office in the Mail and Erpreaa building!
where a loan business was carried on in the
name of one Chester Kirk? A. They do.

Q. Does the Local Credit Company conduct
a similar business under the name of Emmet
Garretson in an office in the Park Row building?
A. They do

Q. Do vou know of the City Loan Associa-
tion? A. T do.

Q. Was that eonducted by
Wilson W. Dunlap? A. It was.

Q. How did you come to know Mr. Turner?
A. He was appearing against the City Loan
Association when I was connected with It. I
went to see him and we had several talks. He
became so interested in the loan business that
he offered me employment by the Home Loan
Association, into which some of his wealthy
clients were going to put their money.

Magistrate Pool held Dunlap for trial and
raised his bail to $1,000, at the request of Assis-
tant District Attorney Keith. Dunlap was sent
back to the court prison, his counsel having
ped, to find a bondsman before the court
closed.

Boarding House Keeper Charges Him With
Assaulting His Wife and Daughter.

Fritz Miller, who keeps a boarding house
at 1321 Tremont avenue, charged Policeman
Perkins of The Bronx Park squad inthe Morri-
sania police court yesterday with assaulting
his wife and ten-year-old daughter Agnes
last Thursday night Miller was under arrest.
Miller told Magistrate Meade that he waa
sweeping the front atepa of his house when
Perkins came along and without any apparent
reason grabbed him and said: “I think T can
run you fn without much trouble.”

Miller thought the cop was joking and play-
fully pushed him aside. He said that the po
Heeman then drew his club and atrick him on

the head. Mrs. Miller came out to remonstrate
nd was knocked down twice by the officer
for interfering, Miller sald, adding that his
ten-vear-old Zanghor came out and was alao
assaulted by the policeman. According to
Miller's story Policeman Ravmon came along
and tried to pacify Perkins. Raymon went
to ring for the patrol wagon and left Perkins
in charge of Miller. When the patrol wagon
arrived Miller had escaped and gone to Weat
Chester to spend the night with his brother
in-law. where he was arrested yesterday morn

ing.

“finen the patrol returned to the station with-
out the prisoner Acting Captain Smith of The
Bronx Park station preferred charges against
Perkina and Raymon for aliowing their prisoner
to escape. Mrs. Miller's injurtes were so se-
rious that she was removed toFordham Hospital.
The physicians said that her left side was badly
bruised and awollen and that she was suffering
from internal injuries. She is there a prisoner
chan ed with interfering with an officer in
the discharge of his duty

Acting Captain Smith ald that Miller was
creating a disturbance. Miller was held in
$300 ball for examination next Monday on the
Hb of disorderly conduct, with Acti Cap-
tain Smith as complainent. Hesald that hi
will make charges against Perkins before the

 

 

Police Commissioners. Perkins was not in
court.

SING SCHOOL FIGHT.
Tae Rev. Pr. Barris Had Tweaty Votes,

Robert Danwiddie Four—Latter Elected.

SING SING, N. ¥., Aug. 10.- There is a lively
fight in school matters in the Fourth distrtet
of thie town, known as the Scarborough dis-
trict. At the annual meeting last evening the
friends of the Rev. Thomas R. Harris, D. 1,
rector of St. Mary's Church, placed him in nom-
ination for re@lection. He had held the office
for three years. After Mr. Harris had been
placed in nomination, the chairman of the meet-
ing, A. Coleman Smith, a New York lawyer,
who is also a school trustee of the district, said

that Dr. Harris was not eligible for reélection
and showed a letter from State Superintendent
of Public Instruction Skinner, saying that a
clergyman occupying chureh property exempt
from taxation as a part of his salary was in-
eligible and could not hold the office

obert Dunwiddie was placed in nomination
as an opponent of the Rev. Mr. Harris. The
ballot showed that Dr. Harris had 20 votes,
his opponent 4, but Dunwiddie was declar
by Chairman Smith to be the duly elected
Trustee. Dr. Harris was absent on hig va-
cation, but his friends became indignant at
the ruling of the Chair. The friends of Dr,
Harris refused to regard the letter of the su-
perintendent, inasmuch as it was not an official
decision an a formal appeal.

This episode is the outcome of a fight over
the question of consolidating this district and
District No. 2. The Scarborough = district
includes the property of Mrs. Elliott F. Shepard,
William H. Rockefeller, W. M. Kingsland,
Mrs. fi. Walter Webb and other New Yorkers
and they are opposed to the consolidation
wroject. Mr. Smith favors it and Dr. Harris
fast year opposed the movement while in the

Each for Them--To Be Decided Next Month.

Henry Beyer, agent for the Bottling Brewers’
Protective Association of New York, was in the
Myrtle avenue polics courtin Brooklyn yester-
day as complainant against the Long Island

willing to surrender the property upon the pay-
ment of locent for eacn bottle, the price the
Long Island Bottlers’ Union has been receiving
from its members for the return of bottles.
Counsel for the Bottling Brewers’ Protective
Association declined to listen to the proposi-
tion, He said that under the bottle law, the
defendant, | convicted, would have to pay a
fine of 5) cents tor each bottle. This would
amoun tyo $22,500

Magistrate Teale adjourned the hearing unti
Sept. 12. when Magistrate Worth, who issue:

REAL ESTATE NEWS,

A general rule which, in the absence of au-
thentle information, has been followed by
professional operators in buying improved
real estate is to deduct 10 per aent. from the
gross annual rent roll, to offaet probable losses
arising from delinquency or defection of ten-
ants, This rule is modified somewhat ac-
cording to the location of property, as much
as 20 per cent. being deducted in the newer
sections by some operators The 10
cent. average of deduction ts, of course, based
upon actual expertence of ownership. It is,
however, closely borne out by the Health
Board's census, according to which the aver-
age of vacancy in flat, apartment and tene-
ment houses throughout the city is 9.12
cent. The following schedule will be use-
ful to investors in that it shows the percen-
tages of vacancies in the several wards. Tha
Health Board's census merely gives the num-
ber of families and the number of vacant apart-
ments or suites But the two together will
give approximately the combined total of
occupied and vacant apartinents, as, under
the law, enforced by frequent inspections,
more than one family will rarely be found
in one apartment. The overcrowding on
the East Side often heard of usually consiata
of an excess of single boarders taken in by
the family keeping house in the apartment.
Occasionally in hard times two small fam-
ilies will “double up" in a flat, where possible
overcrowding is less likely to be discovered
than in the downtown barracks, On the
