Lawser Johnson says the assessments are
erronerous, because Of overvaluations and that
the assessments are unequal as they are made
ata higher proportionate valuation than other
real estate in the same wards. He contends
that the Standard Oil Company has been as-
sesaed on its property unjuetiy and excessively,
$520.00. He alsosaid that the assessment on
the Fourteenth ward property was $164,000
more In 1900 than in 1899, or 70 per cent. of the
aotual increase in value of the real estate in the
entire ward, while the increase of $156,000 jn the
assessments on the property in the Seventeenth
ward was more thand J cent. of the actual
increase of values in the entire ward. The
Standard Oi} Company also alleges that its
property {8 asse 20 per cent. higher than
other property of a similar character, and that
there isno justification inthe variation. The
writ is made returnable on the second Monday
in September.

Produce Classification Controversy,

The Missouri, Kansas and Texas Railroad has
refused to be bound by the mixed-car produce
classification agreed upon by certain railroads
and large shippers in the Southwest. Inasmuch
as independent action on the part of the M,, K.
and I’. would mean thejfailure of the new classi-
fication a large number of St. Louis and Texas
merchants and shippers have filed protests
against the action of that road with the South-

THE SUN, SATURDAY, AUGUST 11, 1900.

FINANCIAL AND COMMERCIAL.

 

FaripaY, Aug. 10.

There was a little more doing in stocks to-
day, chiefly in Sugar Refining. That stock was
taken in hand by a speculative interest that has
been active in it for along time past, and as
comparatively few offerings were encountered,
the price was advanced 2% per cent, The final
transaction was at the highest of the day.
There was nonews regarding the sugar refining
industry, but it is well known that the present
season has been an exceedingly profitable one,
and all of the refiners have orders booked for
their entire product for several weeks ahead.
Whether the management of the American
company will take advantage of this condition
of affairs to increase the dividend upon its
common stock remains to be seen. The
transactions in Sugar Refining were very nearly
one-third of the total. In no other stock did
the sales foot up 10,000 shares and in only a few
did they exceed one-half of thatamount. The
issues that received the most attention, in the
order named, were Atchison preferred, Brooklyn
Rapid Transit, St. Paul, C. B. and Q. and
Union Pacifio. The only one of them, however,
that fluctuated widely was Brooklyn Rapid
Transit, which was exceptionally strong and
scored a net ecdvance of nearly 14 per cent.
The movement was accompanied by favorable
forecasts of the forthooming annual report of
the company. Besides, rumors were revived of
a change in the executive management of the
property.

London took a little interest in the specula-
tion and bought a few stocks on balance.
Speculative sentiment abroad appeared to be
favorably influenced by the more encouraging
news from China this morning and by the
success of the British Exchequer loan, which
has resulted in the transfer of over $8,-
600,000 {n gold from this country to
Europe, the greater part to London.
The shipments of specie to-morrow foot up
$3,250,000. A member of the British war loan
syndicate states that none of the gold going
out to-morrow is for syndicate account, though
several millions of the exports earlier in the
week were directly attributable to the large al-
lotment of the new bonds to this country. Itis
poasible that some of the gold is shipped to pay
for bonds that were allotted to American
bankers independently of the syndicate here,
on their direct subscriptions through the Bank
of England. As foreshadowed in this column
when the announcement regarding the loan
was rade, the transfer of gold from this centre
to Europe has not disturbed the domestic
money market in the least. Further amounts
of gold will unquestionably be shipped during
the next few weeks, but will obviously be offset
by the heavy receipts at San Francisco from
Australia and at other Pacific Coast points,
from the Klondike and from Cape Nome, It
would not be surprising if by the time the ship-
ments to Europe are completed it were found
that the United States had received on the
Pacifie Coast fully as much gold as had been
shipped from this centre.

It became generally known to-day that the
Bank of England is supplementing the action of
the British Treasury in endeavoring to attract
gold from this country by increasing its
price both for fine bars and American eagles,
and also making allowance of interest on
gold {n transit from New York to London,
The indications are that the Associated Banks
will sustain a loss of two or three millions in
lawful money to-morrow, because of the heavy
exports of specie and the smaller receipts of
currency from the interior. Still the surplus
reserve is large enough to stand a reduction of
several million dollars without causing any
anxiety.

Considering that business generally {is re-
stricted by the vacation season, which isempha-
sized by the extremely hot weather, the weekly
trade reports make an unusually interesting
showing. The average of the prices of com-
modities has ceased to decline, and at the same
time orders for fall delivery of various products
are coming to hand in gratifying volume. The
lower prices for both pig {ron and manufactured
products, together with the restriction of the
output of raw material, is beginning to have an
effect upon the iron industry, New orders are
being received and in some branches of the in-
dustry, notably {n the manufacture of struct-
ural steel, it has been found unnecessary to
make further concessions in prices. Bank clear-
ings for the week are the smallest reported
since November, 1808, They are 4 per cent.
smaller than last week and 16 per cent. smaller
than in the corresponding week a year ago.
The decreases outside of New York are much
smaller than at thiscentre. Railway traffic re-
turns for July as far as compiled show the
heaviest increases in gross of any month this
year, the increase being nearly 6 per cent. upon
the figures of the same month last year, which
was unusually large. The closing of the stock
market, though dull, was in the main strong.

The actual results show that the earnings of
the company equalled 685 per cent. on the
capital stock,

The local movemants of money this week are
described by the New York News Bureau as
follows; “The exports of gold this week, in-
cidental] to the operations of the syndicate that
is handling the American subscriptions to the
British Exchequer Joan, naturally complicate
the money movements of the week, so that the
preliminary cash estinates are of leas than
usual significance. The Sub-Treasury_ state-
ment jor the week ending at the close of bust-
ness yesterday shows that the loss of the New
York banks on account of the engagement of
$5,330,000 in gold bars, for export, was reduced
through Sub-Treasury disbursements on ac-
count of gold deposited at Pacific Coast

oints, and on other accounts, to $2,160,000,

he banks gained from the direct express ine
terior movement $1,315,347 and th» net result of
the known movements of cash is an apparent
loss by the New York banks of $844,653. Itisa
matter of pure conjecture how mucus of the boss
through the gold exports will figure in to-mor-
row’s statement of bank averages. The ship-
ments of gold that have been arranged for to-
morn w will obviously figure all of next
week. But for this week’s gold exports the
banks would have gained in cash from
the New York Sub-Treasury nearly $3,000,000.
The banks shipped this week direct by express
$1,104,132 and received $2,509.479, a gain on the
move nent of $1,815,347. The shipments to the
interior were on about the recent average, but
this week's movement was swelled by a large
payment thatis regul arly made once a month

y one of the New Yorkhanks, In the previous
week the banks received direct by express §$3,-
467,820 and shipped $746,750, a gain on the
movement of $2,721,070. The receipts b direct
express from the interior this week wera
smaller than in the week preceding by $958,341."

Bradastreet's reports the numberof failures
for the week ending to-night a8 172, against 170
Jast week and 156 the corresponding week last
year. R.G Dun &Co. compute the liabilities
of the concerns failing forthe first week of
August at $1,580,997.

The receipts of the Government to-day were:
Customs, $627;333 Internal revenue, $790,222, and
miscellaneous. $13,046, a total of $1,431,922. The
disbursements were $1,896,000, an excess of ex-
penditures over receipts of $463,077, The re-
celpts of the fiscal year to date have been
$67,025,609 and the disbursements $73,319,653

Cotton was active, strong and higher, influenced by
the Bureau report, which was decidedly less favor-
able than expected, the condition for Aug. | being
stated at 76 per cent., whereas the generality of the
trade had expected a condition of atleast 80 per cent,
A month ago the condition was 75.8 and the August
average for ten years is 85.3 percent Early in the
day prices were slightly lower owing to dull and lower
Liverpool! cables, some foreign selling and local sell-
ing for both sides of the account. On the announce-
ment of the Bureau report, however, prices advanced
rapidly. Furthermore, the weather {n eastern Texas
and southern Loulstana was still wet, further rains
were predicted for Texas, receipts of new cotton were
comparatively light, spot markets were strong,
and shorts scrambled to cover, Reallein
toward the close and some short selling for lo
