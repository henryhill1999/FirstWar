Klondyke Proves to B» Easily the Best
Over Hurdies—O'Connor Lands Hesper ond
Cherished in Succession~To-day's Entries,

SansToaa, Aug. 10.—The feature of Wie card
at (he track this afternoon was the Pepper Stakes
for two-year-olds with a guaranteed value of
$5,000. The race was at five and a half furlongs
and ten of the beat two-year-olds in training
wore named, but only seven ran. The Pepper
stable ecratohed KingPepper and added Princess
Popper, the Fleischmanns scratched Irritable
and trusted to the winner of the Fleischmann
Stakes, Bonntbert, while J. F. Schorr sent Alard
Soheck, the winner of the Congress Hall and the
arat part of the Grand Union, to sport his colors.
R. T. Wilson had two in the race, Tuscarosa and
fhe Parader, and for some reason they were
made odds-on favorites. To make matters
worse the stable declared to win with Tusca-
rosa who was beaten over @ furlong in his last
start, He and Alard Scleck were the leaders
when the flag went down, but Princess Pepper
shot by them and with a clear lead she made
the running until well into the stretch. Then
Bonnibert and Alard Scheck moved to the front,
aud while they were fighting it ous The Parader,
who had been last away, jolzfed them. But
Bounibert always had the foot of them and he
rernained tn front to the fintsh.

Fourteen horses that had not won a race
since July 1 were named to go in the first race,
but the presence of Hesper cut the field down
to elght starters. The 60 to 1 chance Tartar
led to the last furlong where Hesjper shot to
the front and won by alenuthandahalf. The
victory was @ coatly one for Assemblyman T.
Pp. Sultvan or Tom Sharkey, which ever one
{s his owner, for Hesper was bid up. He was
entered to be sold for 8500 and the trainer of
the Hawthorne Stable. owners of Tartar, bid
him up to $2,000, The colt was saved with
another $5. bid, O'Connor rode his second
winner on Cherished in the second race, She
was the favorite for the race and after Luck
had made the running to the stretch went to
the front and won by a length and a half from

Guess Work.
"The fourth race found Tye Whip the favorite

with ping. ramble and MacLeod of Dare well
layed, But after the 80 to 1 chance had led
bo the far turn Peaceful, at to 1, took the lead
and won by_a@ nose from Anthracite. Einer
was backed from 2 to 1 to 8 to 5 to the
hurdle race, but the stro second choice
Klondyke went to the front on. the back-
stretch and beat him out easily by three lengths.

GOLF.

Second Round and Semi-Finals ia the Open
Tournament at Otsego.

RICHFIELD SPRINGS, Aug. 10.—The play
to-dayin the third annual open tournament of
the Otsego Golf Club consisted of the second
round and the semi-finals for the Otseg ando cup
a mixed foursome competition for the Coopers-
towncups. From sixteen to twenty couples took
partin the mixed foursomes, the first eight to
qualify, As many ofthe men who formed the
pairs competing for the Cooperstown cups were
also playing for the Otsego oup, there
was more or less delay in getting
both events divided. The most important event
of the morning round was the match between
Deveraux Emmett of Garden City and A.
Holmes, Tuxedo, To the surprise of the large
“gallery” following the contest the Tuxedo
schoolboy held his own in a most stubborn man-
nerduring the greater portion of the match.
They were alleven at the eleventh hole and
again atthe thirteenth. Infact, the game was
in doubt until the last four holes, when Emmett
made a spurt and won each hole by asingle
stroke. The scores follow;

The defeat of W, Festus Morgan by Steven C

even at the seventeenth hole, but in piaying
the eighteenth Mr. Morgan half topped his
drive and went into the ore*k. A heavy
thunderstorm had just burst upon the
players, and as Clark got within a mashie-
shot of the green on his drive Morgan

aveup the hole. G. Hyde Clarke won handily

rom A. Coppell. In the afternoon the gallery
selected the Emmett-Compton match as the
leading \entand pinned their faith on Emmett,
The watch was aterooting throughout, but to
the surprice of the golf enthusiasts Enmett was
beaten by 8 up and 2 to play. The cards were;

DISQUALIFIED.

VIRGINIA

LEADS THE NEW YORK YACHT CLUB'S
FLEET IN RUNTO VINEYARD HAVEN

But Leses the Race for Passing Middle Buoy
in Vineyard Sound in Wrong Direction
-—Other Boats Make Same Mistake—Min-
eola Beats Rainbow by Fifteen Seconds.

Cortaae City, Mass., Aug. 10.—W. K. Van-
derbilt, Jr., on the Virginia finished first in to-
day's ruo of the New York Yacht Club
fleet. He had handled the yacht su-
perbly and shown rare good judgment
in picking out his course. In the excite-
ment of the race he forgot the justructions
of the committee that the middle buoy in Vine-
yard Sound shouid be left to starboard coming
infrom the Vineyard Sound lightship. The
Virginia had sailed wellin under the Martha's
Vineyard shore and by so doing gotout of the
full force of the tide. She only went about 100
yards to the southward of the buoy, which in
no way affected the race because she had
plenty of time to go on the other side, For this
error, however, she was disqual. fied, Mr.
Vanderbilt took the disqualification so good na-
turediy that many hope he will win to-morrow,
If the Virginia had won she would have had two
legs for the Lippitt cup. The Rainbow finished
second and Mineola third, but the latter, allow-
ing for the difference at the start, won the race.’
After passing the Vineyard Sound lightship:
where the four boats were very close together
the Yannkee, with a splpnaker, went to the
Cuttyhunk shore and by g0 doing lost
considerably. The Virginia wenton the south
side and the Mineola and Rainbow in the mid-
die of the Sound. The finish was very close
and in the end the Mineola beat the Rainbow
by 15 seconds,

Mr. Vanderbilt was not the only one to make
amistake, The Wasp, Petrel, Latona and In-
gomar were also disqualified for the same
error. Hester led the Class I boats
and won, Sayonara, on acount of
the disqualification of the Wasp, was a winner.
Shark won in Class K. Sistae lost her toy mast
just at the finishing line, In the schooners’
classes the winners were Constellation, Corona,
Quissetta and Wayward.

The run from New London to Newport was a
most unsatisfactory one. Out of thirty-three
yachts that started only ten fluished before the
time Iimit exptred. The Regatta Committee
remained at the lightship until a late hour and
took the times of the boats as they went over
the line. This was done just to show the vacht»-
men how they had sailed compared with other
yachts, In the 70-foot class the Rainbow beat
the Mineola, 49 minutes 28 seconds: Yankee, 1
hour!9 minutes 30 seconds, and Virginia, 1 hour
34 minutes 61 seconds. The Hester won in
Clase I sloops. The Wasp was the only boat
to finish in time tn class J. In Class K the Syce
won. The Shark finished at8:22:00and Altair at
8:35:23, both after the time limit. The Corona
and Quissetta were the only ones to finish in
time, and they won fn their classes, The Quis-
setta also won the day's run for the Vice-Com-
modore’s cup, which makes two runs to her
credit and one for the Corona. The big Con-
stellation did not finish until after 2 o'clock this
morning.

The run to-day was to Vineyard Haven,
thirty-seven miles, and the outlook early in
the morning was very poor. The sun had
come up above the horizon like a big red ball
There was not a cloud in the sky, and not a
breath of air ruffed the placid surface of the
water about the Brenton’s Reef Lightship.
A few yachts that had been belated on the pre-
vious day’a run were drifting aimlessly about.
Inside the harbor the big fleet of yachts was
at anchor and owners felt rather discouraged
at the gloomy outlook. For three days they

had been fighting against fickle breezes
and dead calms, The racing had been unsatis-
factory even to the owners of the winning boats,
Yachtamen are all good sportsmen an

 

honor an empty one,
As the morning wore on, and there was still
no sign of a breeze, Commodore Ledyard sig-
aaifed for the yachtsmen to meet him in tho
clubhouse, {n order to find out what their wishes
were, There was guite a large gathoring, and
it was soon agreed that unless it breezed up
within a reasonable time the run scheduled
‘or to-day thould be abandoned — The meeting
ad hardly been adjourned and the yachtsmen
one back to their yachts in their gigs and
farinctes when a faint breeze wafted over the
narbor from the southwest This zephyr was
only the advance guard of @ good sailing breeze,
ad the yachtsmen got up their maineails,
ove port on thelr anchor chains, and were
ready to get out as soon as the signal should
be given “Get under way for Vinevard
Haven,” spoken in three small code flags,
fluttered from the halliards on the flags)ip
Corona, and the sharp bark of a gun called
attention to the welcome signal. Anchors
were hoisted, jibs broken out, and for over an
hour there was 4@ continuous procession of
achts of all descriptions and sizes sweeping
by the grim walla of Fort Adams,and on past
Castle Point, out to the lightehip.
(ol, John Jacob Astor's big steam yacht
Nourmahal was prominent and another one
that attracted the attention of those who
watched the scene from the shore was Jolin
P. Duncan's Kanawha, the fastest yacht in the
fleet. Ex-Commedore J. Pierpont Morgan's
stately Corsair was another boat greatly ad-
mired, Of the sailing craft the old Maytiower,
noted for having defeated I.Jeut, Henn's Galatea
for the America’s Cup in 1884, was soon pointed
out, Of course, the 70-footers, the Corona and
the English boats came in for their share of
attention, The vachts that were not going to
take part in the race, with the exception of the
stenmers, started off at once forVinevard Haven
The steamers hung around the lightship and
waited to watch the manq@uvring forthe start
and then followed the races over the course
The breeze had freshened so that it was blow-
ing with good strength from the sou'-sou' west
Tt was a nice club topsail breeze, the sea was
smooth, the sun's raya were reflected on the
tiny dancing waves, and the rejection «n the
water made the seene a dazzling one, ‘The
committee bout took up its position south of
the lightship and signalled the course “West
op, Vineyardhaven.” The course was
seventeen miles S.S_E. to the Sow and Pigs
lizhtshin, now called Vineyard Sound leht-
ship, which was to be left on the port hand. then
enst-northeast to the middle ground buoy,
leaving it on the starboard hand: then east to
the fni-hing line off Weet Chop !uoy, which
was twenty miles from the lichtship, making
thirty-seven miles altogether.
The preparatory signal was fired at 11:40
o'clock, and ten minutes later the signals for
the sloop classes were given. The yachts came
down for the committee boat end of the line
on he starboard tack, The Heste., Rear
Commodore Robinson's yacht, was the first
boat across, her time. taken as she went by
being 11:60:13. Clifford B. Hendricks, who was
handling the Savonara. held a position to wind-
ward of the Hester and was two minutes later.
Lathrop Ames. handling the tiller ou the Shark,
sent that ovat over next, close at the windward
end of the line, her time being 11:50:39. The
Syoce was five seconds later and under the
Shark's lee. The Fsfort was the next boat at
11:51:03, and the Kiowa followed a half min-
ute later, The yawl Petrel was to wind-
ward of these two boats and to leeward
of her, at 11.61:37, was the Wasp The
Sistae crossed at 11:51:51. She was carrying
balloon jib topsail which thoae on board soon
ound to be a mistake. She took itin and sent
Ww a big jib topsail. The Isolde, steered by

M. Hoyt, was coming close jammed on the
wind for the windward end of the line, but
the Hanan boys, on the Astrild, shoved that
acht in between the comuinittee boat and the
solde and forced the latter to give room. The
times taken of these two boats were: Isolde,
11:52:17: Astrild, 11:52:23. The Awa was the
last of this division and she was timed at
11:49:28. @ Isolde soon drew ahead of the As-
rild and after a short luffing match the Isolde
orereached and the Astrild, paying off, went
under her stern.

Then came the schooners at 11:55. H. F.
Lippitt was a little too soon with the Quissetta
and had to give up the weather position in
order not to get over the line ahead of the gun
The Latena, with J. Fred Tams at the whe: |,
oro the ling at 11:55:15 close up at the wind-
ward end. The Quissetta was two seconds
later, about midway between the lightship
and the committee boat, and then came the
Corona, at 11:55:38. Midway between these
two boats Capt. Watson was brinving the bi
Constellation down for the windward enc
of the tine jammed close on the wind, and the
Hildegarde, with the wind aft of tha beam,
was heading for the same spot trying to push
in between. the committee boat and the Con-
stellation, The two boats were travelling
at 4 mreat rate of speed and fast drawing to-
wether

A collision seemed inevitable unless the
Conatellation should give way he mate on
that boat was standing forward taking in the
situation, Capt. Watson held on his course
The Hildegarde had no chance to get ont of
the way, If her helm was changed «he would
have run into the committee boat. When
the two big schooners were barely six feet
apart, the mate on the Coustellation waved his
hand to leeward. Capt. Watson put bis helm
up and the Conatellation paid off, giving the
coveted position to the Hlldegarde. That
vessel was timed at 11:56:01 and the Constella-
tion three seconds later. Francis Skinner,
the owner of the Constellation, seemed very

it, was run up on her star-
board main spreader. Tle Constellation bor
off to Jet the Hildegarde get clear of her
then luffed out under her stern to windward.
The wind just suited the two biy schooners
dthey trayelled through the water like
witches, rapidly overhauling the boats which
had gone before them. The Indra was the
next schooner to cross at 11:56:53. Then came
the Wayw at 11:57:38; Mayflower, 11:57:56
and Katrina at 11:58:18,
After the schooners had gone the 70-footers
had five minytes in which to get ready. When
that time had nearly expired all were reaching
for the line from the westward, The Yankee
was the first boat over, oSeeae © 12:08:12.
The Mineola, evidently not be & position
to suit Capt, Wringe, wore around in front of the
Rainbow and forced that vessel to off,
The latter crossed at 12:06:16 to windward of
the Yankee. Mineola, after straighten out
on her course, ag came for the windwar
end of the line, and W. K. Vanderobilt, F. who
was steering the Virginia, was heading for the
same point. Capt. Wringe wanted to force
Virginia under his stern. Mr. Vanderbilt was
too fast for him, however, and as the two boats
approached the line, he shouted out to the Mine-
ola: “Give me room!" Capt. Wringe was forced
to bear off a bit. The two boats went over the
line side by side, the Mineola being timed at
12:05:54 and Virginia at 12:05:56, to windward
of the Mineola. They carried big jiptopaalla
and went through the water at @ great rate o!

speed,

The Mineola drew clear of the Virginia and
they reached toward the lightehip in the order
{n which they went over the line, The Yankee
pether improved her position in this reach and
ier time, taken as she passed the Iightship,
was 1:34:00. She had travelled seventeen miles
in 1 hour and 29 minutes, remarkably fast work
under the conditions. The Rainbow was timed
at 1:45:45, the Mineola at 1:86:43, and Virginia
ati:27:06. On this reach the Yankee had beaten
the Rainbow 41 seconds, the Mineola 2 minutes
and 1 second and the Virginia 2 minutes and 21
seconds. The red clay cliffs of Gay Head
shone brightly In the sun as the yachts went
by. They had started sheets after passing the
lightship and sent up balloon jib topsails, The
schoonera used thelr main topmast staysails
also, After getting in under Cuttyhunk some
of the boats set spinnakers to starboard. The
run to the finish was an exceedingly fast one,
and the race was the best of the crulse. Sum-

FOR INTERNATIONAL ATHLETIC UNION
Steps Taken at Paris to Organize an Associa-
tion of National Bodles,

J. KE. Sullivan, Secretary of the AA. U., in a
letter from Paris written on July 28, states that
a meeting was held on July 27 at the office of
tho A. A. U. for the purpose of organizing an
international athletic association. Repre-
sentatives trom the different countries were
present and the matter was fully discussed.
Nothing definite was done beyond the selec
tion of aname for the organization,which will be
known as the Unton Athioti sue Internationale.

The aim of the association will be to have
world's champlonship games every year in one
of the different countries. The representa-
tives practically agreed to return to their ree
spective homes and work wth their associa-
tions for the formation of this union. One of
the objects of the union will be to have a unl-
form set of rules governing events so that all
will know them in advance and not to have
international competitions conducted under
the rules of any one national organization.
Secretary Sullivan is very much in favor of
this move and writes that upon his arrival in
this Country he will bring the matter before the
A A.V S. de Garmendia, Assistant Director
of Sports at the Paris Exposition, who has
worked with A. G. Spalding and Mr. Sullivan
at the world’s championships at Paris, is a resi-
dent of Paris and could very nicely represent
the Amateur Athletic Union on the board during
the formation of the Union Athlétique Inter-
nationale, Theadvantages of such an inter
national body are many, and the numerous little
troubles that cropped up during the Exposition
gimes would never have occurred if an inter-
nationul association had controlled the meeting.

American Player in the Lead When a Than-
| @erstorm Ends the Game.

Boston, Aug, 10.—The International Lawn
Tennis Tournament at Longwood was brought
to an abrupt end in the middle of the third
match in singles this afternoon by a terrific
thunderstorm. As H. Roper Barrett sails for
England to-morrow and A, W. Gors and E. D,
Black have promised to go to South-
ampton wo playin the tournament in prog-
ress there {t 1s now impossible to have the
Whitman-Black match pla) ed or complete the
Davis-Gore match. The elements interfered
with a fine tennis match. Gore and Davis were
both piaying cleverly, and as the games played , =
up to the Ume the rain began to descend had [eta
been very close, the contest promised to de-
Velopinto @ test of endurance and 5.¢. diness.
The Whitman-Black match had not been
started, but the two men were on the courts
limbering up, and the spectators had begun to
move over {nto seats commanding a better |
view when the storm broke. |

The two matches interfered with were the |
final ones of the tournament, The Englishmen
had many weil wishers, for itis felt that if the
visitors go home without taking a single one of
the five it will rather discourage them from
coining after the Davis trophy another year

The Davis-Gore maton was started shortly
before 3 o'clock and sixteen games had to be
payed to decide the first set. Davis finally

ok @ game on Gore's service and then fol-
lowed It up witha victory from his own. Davis
took nine of the games p aed and Gore seven.
The second set waseven closer than the firet
and when the ran bevan to fallthe men were
con mopeing the nineteenth game with Davis in
the lead wiih ten guines to his credit and Gore
The service of both men was an impor-

won twelve games out of the thirty-four ia
which he served. ‘The Amerjuan won five games
Gore's service and the latter took four on
Davis. At times Davis cut the ball so cleverly
that Gore was unable to meet it for the return
on account of the baffling way it broke on
bh ne she ground, In the seventeen times
e served the American scored seven aces,
while the Englishman only had two placed to
his credit.
The piacing of the American was another !m-

occasion ‘he ball was so delicately touched that

ut on the rebound came back under the net to
Davis's side where, of course, Gore could not
touch it. Many experts said that it was the
fir-t time they ever saw a play of the kind.
Gore tried a few lobs, but he soon gave un
that style of play and went back to his hard
ground drives, as the American smashed all
the lobs out of his rival's reach. Gore al<o

preme Court in an opinion declaring sunday
baseball in that State proper and legal.
“Baseball,” the Judge said, ‘‘does not belong
to the same class, kind, species or genus as
horse-racing, cock-fighting or card-playing., It
{4 a game of chance only to the same extent
that chance or luck may enter into anything
man may do, but when chance or luck ts

pitted against skill and science it is as fair an
llusiration of what will result as any test that
could be applied

“Until the lawmakers expressly provide for
such sweeping changes in the livesand custo!
and habits of our people, it ts not proper for
the courts by construction to impaltr thetr nat-
uralrighis to enjoy sports or amusements that
are neither immoral nor hurtful to body or
soul. We, therefore, conolude that there{s no
law in this State which prevents playing a game
of baseball on Suntay, and therefore the de-
fendant (one Joe Neet) is imprisoned for
dving of an act which is not unlawful, an
therefore the imprisonment is unlawful.”

There May Be Boxing at New Orleans Again,

The boxing game is likely to flourish again
during the winter at New Orleans. Denny
Duffy, son of the late Col, Pat Duffy, who was
well known among the sports all over the coune
try, who cameto town yesterday toattend the
Fitzsimmmons-Rulilin battie, wis interviewed
by areporter ol Tue SUN regarding the pros-
pect of pugilisma at New Orleans, He said:

“A bill wil be ii troduced in the Legislature
next winter to make pugilism legalin the State
of Louisiana, The eit zens of New Orleans are
anxious to hive ths game flourish for it brings
a good deal of money to the town and apes
business. About two months aco everytiing
looked rosy for boxing at New Orleans. A lew of
my friends and mysell rented the old Tulane A.
