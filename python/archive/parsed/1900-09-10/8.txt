Hiack Hille—Boise Basia Not Worked Out.

Duvers, Sept. 8-—-The J. J. Hill railway
iuteresta are putting out prospectors and ex-
plorers in the region northeast of their rail-
way terminals onthe Mesaba iron range and
expect to extend the road along the Mesaba
and on toward the Vermillion range. The
Duluth and Iron Range road is preparing to
extend {ta line westerly along the Mesaba range
to a few miles from Hibbing, where it has new
mines that will be shippers next year. Con-
tracta for this extension will be let shortly
The Duluth, Missabe and Northern road has
made traffic arrangements that will result in
the extension of its line easterly on the Mesaba
{nto Town 50-14 All this work will probably
be carried on during the coming year. The
fifty mile cut-off of the Eastern Minnesota road
from mines at Virginia to Duluth ts ready for
the rails

The $300,000 improvements of the Chicago,
Milwaukee and St Paul, to enable it to reach
ore nines of the Menominee and Marquette
ranges and become a factor in ore traffle, are
completed, and ore hauling will beign at once
The road has completed a wharf at Wells,
modelled after the wharves of the Duluth roads,
that has consumed 6,000,000 feet of timber
and will hold 80,000 tons of ore It will give
an annual shipping capacity for 1,000,000 tons

Ore shipmenta from Jan. 1 to date from all
Lake Superior mines by rail and water have
been close to 13,000,000 gross tons. This is
within 6,000,000 tona of the total for 189@ =Ore

  

 

is now moving at the rate of 2,800,000 tons a |

month. Of the total shipments 10,000,000
tons have gone by water from the porta of
Duluth, Two Harbors, Marquette and Ash-
land, in the order named. Duluth this year
will be the largest ore shipping port in the
world

The American Steel Hoop and Republic
Iron and Steel companies have sunk a shaft
260 feet at the new Union mine in remarkably

short time and are preparing to mine a large |

amount of ore there this winter. The mine
contains about 5,900,000 tons of high rade
rich bessemer ore and is said to he one of the
finest properties of its size in the Lake region,
Large stock pile grounds are now being graded
at the mine

A few more men have been discharged at
the Carnegie mines of the Gogebic range, and
in all the mines of the three Michigan ranges
about one thotsand two hundred fewer man are

emplored than sixty days ago, There haa |

been a slight decrease on the Mesaba, but the
men taken from mining have found ready em-
ployment in developing new mines,

The Republic Iron and Steel Company's
mines of the Mesaba range are shipping their
stockpiles and expect to mine underground
more extensively this winter. The company’s
mines on the Marquette range are cleaning
up their stocked ore and preparing for a large
business

The water has not been pumped out of th
Fayal mine, though it is nearly a month since
it was flooded

The Federal Steel Company has decided to
sink A permanent shaft and make 4a mine at
ite option near Iron River, and has began work
lhe shaft will have two compartinents

The Appleton mine has been pumped out and
mining will begin at once A large force will
be put to work

large amounta of ore of good quality are
being discovered near Mesaba station, Mesaha
range. Much of this territory was explored
unsuccessfully in 1892-5

Horantron, Mich., Sept. 7.-The Masa mine
in Ontonagon county has largely curtatied
its forces. This step waa taken after a careful
examination of the mine, because in the opinion
of the management ample opening work had

haen done to furnish the 500 tons of rock that |

will soon be required daily to feed the stamp
mill now brilding

The foundations are now belng laid for the |

addition to the new mill of the Osceola = This
addition will be practically a new mill, con-
taining four stamps, each capable of crush-
ing more than 50) tons of amygdaloid rock
dail’ It has been decided by the man-
agement that the Wilfley table, which has been

 

used experimentally in the Osceola mill, is no |

particular improvement on the old style jigs
and slime tables for saving copper from Osceola
rock The Wilfley tables are valuable in the
saving of the vere fine copper found freely in
certain mines, but are too slow in their work to
be of much advantage on coarser metal

The Mohawk people have practically com-
pleted grading @ new readbed from the mine
to a junction with the quarry and lumber line
bought of Hebard & Sons A steel bridge must
be built over the Trap Rock Kiverand rails laid
on theextension of the line, after which the road
will be in running order) The railroad will
have aconnection at thermine withthe Mineral
Range braach of the Duluth, South Shore and
Atlantic and will have its lake terminus on
Traverse Bay at the mouth of the Tobacco
River, which will furnish water for the stampa
at the mill te be built The fissure vein of
mohawkite holds out well and is destined to
become a valuable feature of the mine The
vein runs as wide as eight feet in places, but
the rich streak rarely exceeds two feet in width
Sinking isin progress at four shalts

The Trimountain mine, south of Houghton,
fs the scene of great activity, The showing
of copper is all that could be desired and the
lode ts very wide, being unquestionably the
southern exteusion of the great Baltic amyg¢-
david.

The Baltic fa installing A complete outfit
of Stirling water-tube boilers, the eMciency
of which is much greater than that of boilers
of theordinary type. The August production
of mineral was nearly 125 tons and with two
stamps running the Haltie should average
25 to 185 tons of mineral @ month until the
new mill is completed, when an increase can
be made.

 

MONTANA.

Nevena, Sept. 4. Edward Blake and Floyd
Cannon have made a rich strike of free gold
on the Big Blackfoot near the mouth of Poorman

Guich. They found it at a depth of 150 feet,

and it averages $60 a ton In free milling gold’
The vein is from eighteen to twenty inches
wide and has a known length from surface

Treasurer, will clear $15,000 The outlook is
regarded as most Promising Extensive {m-
provements are contemplated to increase the
output of the mine

The strike in the Bald Butte mine was mado
on the 400-foot drift and some very rich
ore was encountered, one selected specimen
assaying $13,000 in gold to the ton, while the
whole chute averages over 860. In addition

{to the high grade ore there is a total) width

of the vein of about five feet which averages
$12 a ton, or the same value as that which has
enabled the company to pay dividends aggre-
gating $1,500,000 In the last few years

Kent tussell, who have heen operating
a claim just beyond Fort Harrison, in Grass
Vallev, shipped a carload of ore produced by

The mine has been developed scarcely at all,

which is being worked by business men of that
place. This mine was, discovered by two con
boys, who found ore that went as high as $60,000
to the ton gold

A shipment of stream tin or cassiterite, has
been made from the Bear Gulch mining dis-
trict, the first consignment for many yeara
There are several hundred tons of this stream
tin piled up at the miners’ cabins in the gulch,
which has been saved by them while. placer
mining. Vietor Chapman has shipped three
tons of the tin ore to Bristol, England, where
it will be thoroughly tested. It runs about
65 per cent. tin. There are a great many per-
yma in the Black Hills who firmly believe that
there is a future in the mining of tin. ‘The
American Tin Mining Company of Philadelphia
and New York will develop a big Un ledge on
Bear Gulch Creek in a short time. The = com-
pany has several veins that will give an average
of 8 per cent. tin at the surface, Some of the
veins will assay as high as 40 per cent This
company will spend $200,000 [n purchasing
mining ground and mill sites

three miles alone the creek and a mile on Flk

Saturday This pronerty, embracing seven
mining claims, was discovered three vears ago
hy some trappers, who disposed of their find-
ings to a wealthy tur dealer of Victoria for
$20,000. He spent considerable money in de-
velopment, and in December last sold a con-
trolling interest to an American svndicate for
35.0% cash, The new owners incorporated for
280,000, with 400 shares, which were readily
taken, and in two months doubled in value by
reason of the magnificent showing of the mine
In June the property was examined by London
and American experts and they estimated the
amount of ore tn sight at from $6,000,000 to
$10,000,000, pronouncing It the largest deposit
of copper gold on the continent. It is the pur-
pose of the new owners fo reorganize with a
