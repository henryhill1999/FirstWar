WORSE THAN IN SEPTEMBER, 1875

Galveston Woe Haif Sabmerged tn That Year
and Indianola Wiped Oat.

On Wednesday, Sept. 15, 1875, a storm broke
over Galveston, which submerged half of
Galveston isiand and left the city cut off from
the rest of the world until late on Sunday night
Several hundred tenements were destroy ed,
churches were unroofed, and the streeta were
littered deep with débris. Some score of lives
were lost In the city and ita environs in this gale
and the damage done reached nearly a quarter
ofa million de'lars, The shipping in the harbor
suffered severely, one schooner being hurled
forty feet inland. in the Strand Market the
water driven In from the Gulf by the aale was
three feet deep. No railroad trains were run
and the telegraph wires were down for three
dars. Other towns on the Texas suf-
fered in proportion. In thiy gale the town of
Indianola, in Calhoun county, with a popula-
tion of 1,150, was entirely swallowed up by the

coast

fer. ‘Two hundred lives were lost and the
Gaiiage done to property reached a miilion
dollars, Bodies were strewn along the beach
for twonty nilles after the gale

In October, 1886, Sabine Pass, Tex., was prac
theally troyed by a storm on the Gull in
which 247 lives were lost. The Loulsiana coast
buffered severely at this time

It Was a siinilar storm that on Aug

as Mr. Hill. He has been the undisputed leader

ofs Tammany Hall for nearly twenty years,
and (this reign has not been beaten in length of
time by any leader of Tammany since its or-

Mr. Murphy, and after a desuitory chat, Mr
Croker said

“I ain here to aid tn bringing about the nom-
ination of any Democrat Mr. Murphy, the
Democrats of the State andthe Brooklyn Dem-

Mr. Croker reiterated his

made by Mr. Murphy and the Brooklyn De:no-

DENVER, Sept. @- For the first time in ite
history Pike's Peak was ascended yesterday
by an automobile. John Brisben Walker of
New York did the feat. He did not go clear

to the top, but made an ascent of 11,000 feet,
the highest that an automobile has travelled

anywhere in the world. His companion was
his son Justus
“The road was the worst [ ever saw,” said

Mr. Walker to-day, “and got worse and worke
“ua we proceeded, and when 11,000 feet wa
met we fell in with certain people who told

us

it was much worse beyond and advised ua to |

turn back, and this I proceeded to do. Going
back, however, was like coming down a tobog-
gau chute. It was fearfully rapid work.’

I upholds the wold standard and tndorsea the

 

 

legislation of the present Congress by which
that sfandard hus been effectively strengthened
The stability of our national curreney is theres
fore secure so long as (hose who adhere to this
| Platlore: are Keptin control of the Government
In the first battle, that of 1896, the friends of

the gold standard and of sound curreney were

trintophant, and the country is enjoying the
fruits of that vietory. Our antagonists, howe
ever, are not satisfied They compel ua to @
secoiud battle upon the same lines on which

the first was foughtand won. While regretting
the reopening of this question, whieh can only
disturhs the prosent satisfactory Anancial cone
dition of the Government and visit uncertainty
upon our great business enterprises, we accept
the and again money
forces to join in winning another and we hope,
& permanent triumph for an honest financial
system, which will continue inviolable the pub-
Ihe faith
| As in 1896 the three silver parties are united
under the same leader, who, immediately after
the election of that year, in an addresa to the
bimnetailists, said
“The friends of bimetallism have not been
vanqui y have simply been overcome
They believe that the gold standard ts a con-
| Splracy of the money changers against the wel-
fare of the human race, and they will continue
| the warfare against it

Issue invite the sound

ied; |

  

   

The policy thus proclaimed has been ac-
| cepted and conlirmed by these parties, The
; Silver Der ratio platform of 1900 continu:
| the warfare against the so-called gold con-

splracy when it expressly says “we reiterate
the demand of that (the Chicago) platform of
1896 for an American financial system made
) by the American people for themselvea, which
shall restore and maintain a bimetallic price
level, and as part of such system the immediate
restoration of the free and unlimited coinage
of silver and gold at the present ratio of 16
to 1, without waiting for the aid or consent
of any other nation,”

So the Issue ts presented

Tt will be noted
that the demand {ts for the immediate reator-
ation of the free colnage of ailver at 16 to 1.
If another issue is paramount, this is immedi-
ate It will admit of no delay and will suffer no
postponement,
