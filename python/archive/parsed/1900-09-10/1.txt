Congress authorized the Government to make
a war joan of $400 008000 at the beginning of
the war with Spain, only $200,000,000 of bonds
were issued, bearing 3 ner cent. interest, whieh
were promptly and patriotienlly taken by our
citiverns

Unless something unforeseen ocours to re-
dice our revennes or increase our expenditures,
the Congress at its next session should reduos
taxation very materially

Five years ago we were selling Government
bonds bearing as high as 5 per cent. interest
Now we are redeeming them with a bond af
par, bearing 2 ‘t.intereet, Weare selling
our surplus produets and lending our surplus
money to Kurope. One result of our selling
to other nations so much more than we have
bought from them during the past three vears
{4 a radical improvement of our financial rela-
tions. The great amounts of capital which
have been borrowed of Europe for our rapid,
material development have remained aconstant
drain upon our resources for interest and divi-
dends, and made our money. markets liable
to constant disturbances by calls for payment
or heavy sales of our securities whenever money-
ed stringency or panie occurred abroad Wea
have now been paying these debts and bringing
home many of our securities and establishing
countervailing eredits abroad by our loans,
and placing ourselves ipon a sure foundation
of financial independence

In the unfortunate contest between Great
Britain and the Boer States of South Africa,
the United States has maintained an attitude
of neutrality in accordance with its well-known
traditional policy It did not hesitate, how-
ever, when requested by the Governments of
the South African Republics, to execise its good
offives fo ria cessation of hostilities, It Is to
be observed that while the South African Re-

mblics made like requests of other Powers

Our own citizens should receive the transpor-

oalled the attention of Congress to this subject
fn my several annual messages. In that of
December 6, 1807, I said

“Moat desirable from every standpoint of
national Interest and patriotism Is the effort to
extend our foreign commerce. To this end
our merchant marine should be improved and
enlarged. We should do our full share of the
farry ng trade ofthe world. Wedo not do it
now. Weshould ba the laggard no longer.”

In my message of Dec 5, 1800, Peald

‘Our national development will be one
sided and unsatisfactory so long as the remark-
able growth of our inland industries remains
unaccompanied bv progress onthe seas) There
t no Jack of constitutional authority for legis-
ation which shal! cive to the country maritim

achievements and with tts rank among the na-

“The past vear haa recorded exceptional
activity in our shipvards, and the promises
of continual proaperity {n shipbuilding are
abundant. Advanced legislation for the pro-
tection of our seamen has been enacted. Our
const trade, wider regylations wisely framed
at the beginning of the coc ernment and since
shows results for the past fisoal year uneoualled

We shall fail to realize our onportunities, how-
ever, if we comnlacently regard only matters
at home and blind ourselves to the necessity
of securing our share in the valuable carrying
trade of the world

1 now rejterate these views

A aublect of immediate importance to our
country is the completion of a great waterway
of = commer: between the Atlantic and
Pacific, The constriction of a maritime
eanal is now more than ever indlanensable to
that intimate and ready communication between
our Eastern and Western seaports, demanded
hy the annexation of the Hawalian Islands and
the expansion of our influence and trade in the
Pacific

Our national policy, more {mperatively then
ever, calls for its completion and control by this
Government, and it is beliewed that the next
session of Congress, after receiving the full re.
port of the commission appointed under the act
approved March 3, 1800, will make provisions
for the sure accomplishment ofthis great work

Until Congress shall take action! directed that

“Upon every division and branch of the
government of the Philippines must be im-
posed these inviolable rules

“That no person shall be deprived of life,

“It will be the duty of the commission to
promote and extend, and, as they find occasion
to improve, the aystem of education already
inaugurated by the military authorities In
doing this they should regard as of first import-
ance the axtension of a ayatem of primary @ {n-

‘The articles of capitulation of the city of
Manila on the 18th of August, 1898, concluded
with these words
This city, its inhabttante, its churches and

mente and jts private property of all deserip-
tions are placed under the special safeguard

“T helieve that this pledge has heen faithfully

charge this commission to labor for the full
performance of this obligation, which concerns
the honor and conscience of their country, in
the firm hope that through their labors all the
inhabitants of the Philippine Islands may come
to look back with @ratitude to the day when God
gave victory to American arms at Manila and
set their land under the soverejanty and the |
protection of the people of the United States.”
That all might share in the regeneration of the
islands and participate in thetr_ government,
I directed Gen. MacArthur, the Military Gov-
ernor of the Philippines, to issue a proe lamation
famnesty, which contained among other state-
ments the following
“Vianna, P. 1, dune 21, 1900.- By
tion of the President of the 1 !
States, the undersigned announces amnesty
with complete immunity for the past and a
or the future, to alt

Feb. 4, 1890, have been in insurrection aga

the United States in either a military or a eivil
capacity, and who shall, withina per diof ninety
davs from the date hereof, for Viv renounce
all connection with such insur tion and sub

 

scribe to a declaration acknowledging and
cepting the sovereignty and authority. of 1
l'nited States in and over the Philippine Islands
The privilege herewith publishec is extended
to all concerned without any reservation what-
ever, excepting that persons ho have violated
the laws of war during the period of active
hostilities are not embraced within the scope
of this amnesty. * * *

“In order to mitigate as much as possible
consequences resulting from the various dis-
turbances which, since 1898, have suceceeded
each other so rapidly, and to provide in some
measure for destitute Filipino soldiers during
the transitory period which must inevitably
ayceee da general peace, the military authorities
of the UnitedStates will pay thirty pesos to each
man who presents arifte in good condition. *

Under their instrnetions the commission,
composed of representative Americans, of dif-
ferent sections of the country and from different
political parties, whose character and ability
guaranteed the most faithful intelligent and
patriotic services, are now laboring to establish
stable government, under efvil control, in which
the inhabitants shall participate, giving them
opportunity to demonstrate how far they are pre-
pared for self-government.

This commission, under date of Aug. 21, 1900,
makes an interesting report, from which |
quote the following extract
