PITTSBURG, July 2.—Pttcher Leever, who shut out

last Thursday, was in excellent form against Boston |
today. The one hit charged against him wasa fluke,
an easy bounder striking a pebble that sent it over
Ritehey's head. Stahl, who made it, reached second
on Leach's muff of Zimmer's good throw and scored
Boston's only run on twoouts. Ely was disabled at

ANOTHER VICTORY FOR OLD PENN.

 

Wine Four-Oared Race at Poughkeepsie Easily
~Cornell Drops Out.

Povomxgspeis, July 2.—The four oared in-
tercoliegiate boat race, postponed from Satur-
day, was rowed this morning under favorable
conditions of wind and water. It was won by
the University of Pennsylvania, with Columbia
second. Cornell was out of itatthe finish.
The Ithacans were dead at one mile and a half
and finally ended up inthe eel grass on the
beach on the west side. Brinckerhoff, at bow,
had only strength enough to put his oar in the
water and pull it out, and when the four
stopped rowing to avoid a collision with a row-
boat he completely coliapsed. Beyer, at 3, who
had been struggling alone for over half a mile
to keep the port side from pulling the star-
board side around, was exhausted,

With their victory this morning the Quakers
have a record of two firsts and one second out
of three events. Out of compliment to their
"Varsity eight and as a recognition of their
gameness and the brilliant manner in which
they outrowed Wisconsin at the finish of Satur-
day's race, the Graduate Committee in charge
of the rowing interests of the institution has
offered to give the members of the crew a trip
to the Paris Exposition this summer. All their
expenses will be paid. 1t was first pro to
have the crew enter the international rowing
r at Paris, but Ellis Ward advised against
it. The wip will bedevoted exclusively to sight
seeing and having a good tine.

half the order was: Old Penn ve Cornell

y two lengths of Cornell, pres ere
o the bridge, which marked the first mile, the
race petweep the Quakers and Cornell was fast
and close. The former drew ahead of the Itha-
cans slowly, and Columbia dropped still further
until seven or eight lengths of open wat
showed between the blue and white four an
the leaders.

As the orews passed under the bridge the
Quakers still had aelight vantage over Cor-
pe . Brinokerhoff, the Ithacans’ bow oar, was

inning to weaken under the strain and the
shell was swerving off to the eastward. Just
beyond the bridge the Quakers spurted and in-
creased their lead, and Columbia began to gain
on the Ithacans. The Quakers repeatedly
spurted, but the Cornell crew clung to them
eaperaesy. Although the latter could not gain
an inch and the starboard side of their boat was
swinging steadily toward the shore, the Red and
White oarsmen refused to give up.

Bradley, the bow our in Columbia's shell,
turned around and looked ahead at Old Penn
and Cornel!. He saw that the latter was weak-
ening, and at one mile and a half the New
Yorkers hit their stroke up to thirty-nine and
began to pull down the lead of the Red and
White. After passing the one mile and a balf
mark the Ithacans got so far to the westward
that they gradually worked over in front of

Columbia’s shell and finally swerved
around into the dead water near
shore, several hundred feet out of

their course, Columbia rapidly pieked up and
assed Cornell and started to out down the
Quakers’ big lead of seven or eight lengths.
ut the latter were too far ahead to be over
taken. They ed the finish line four lengths
ahead of clumbia. “Penpnsy's’’ time was
10:31 1-5: Columbia's, 10:38,

The three crews left for home this afternoon.

 

 

MASS MEETING FOR OARSMEN.

National Regatta Committee Will Strive Hard
to Send Crews to Paris,

A meeting of the Harlem Regatta Association
was held last night at the Hotel Minot, 126th
street and Eighth avenue, with James Pilking-
tonin the chair. The Treasurer reported that
with ali the expenses of the regatta deducted
there remained a balance of $70 on hand, The
meeting resolved into one of local affairs
of the National Regatta Committee and
adiscussion of ways and means for send-
ing crews to Paris to participate” in
the world’s championship ensued. It was
reported that there had been raised between
$2,100 and $2,200 of the Po.pee necessary to send
twenty men over early in August t was de-
cided to call a mass meeting to arouse interest
next Monday night at Arcade Hail, 207
East 124th street, and to send invitations to all
members of the rowing olubs in the district
The Letter Carriers’ Band volunteered its sere
vices for the mass meeting

it was decided that no boats would be al-
lowed on the Speedway course during the
afternoons of the regatta, July 10, 20, 21, and
that the presidents of all clubs along the course
shoulda be notified not to allow members
to take boats out of the houses on those
afternoons. ‘There were some emphatic re-
marks made over this, [to the effect that
inasmuch as the proceeds of the regatta
are to. go to the fund for ending
crews abroad, every self-respecting mem-
ber who wants to see_ the races should
pay for a seaton the grand stand. lansof the
stands were submitted and seats and boxes
offered on sale. During the regatta days there
willbe telephonesat the half-mile and one-
mile marks to facilitate the display of signals
at the stands to tell who are leading.

Canadian Amateur Rowing Regatta.

Toronto, July 3.—The feature of the twenty-
first annual regatta of the Canadian Amateur
Oarsmen’s Association to-day was the series of
wins by the junior four of the Argonaut Row-
ing Club of Toronto. The water was compara-
tively smooth when the races began, but
in the final race of the — senior
fours, won by the Detroit Boat
Club’s crew after an exoiting contest, the course
was rough. Inthe junior fours the Argonaut

junior crew, composed of R. F. Blain, bow; J,
Bunting, 2; P. perciety, 3, T. P. Birchall,
stroke, won easily by two lengt'\s from Detroit
juniors and five other crews. Time, 9 minutes
28 seconds. ‘

The next race was the intermediate four.
In this the Argonaut juniors again won, de-
feating the Grand Trunk (Montreal) crew, a
crack lot of rowers, in 9 minutes 22 2-5 seconds.
The big event of the eay was the senior fours,
In this race only_ four crews contested.
The Detroit Boat Club’s crew was com-
posed of F. Lyon, w; W. _ Mower,
2 D. B. Duffeld, 3; H, N.~« Leonard,
stroke. The Detroits were fouled by an ex-
cursion steamer, aud the Argonaut juniors won
by talf a length. The Dons, Toronto, were
second; the Detroits, third, and the Argonaut
senior crew, fourth. The Argonaut seniors in-
cluded Goldman and Wright, the two crack
men sent to Henley last year. The Detroit
men entered a protest, and the committee or-
dered that the race be rowed over again, By
the time the race was started the water was
very choppy, which accounts for the slow time.
The Detroita won by 10 feet. Time, 9 minutes
45 2-5 seconds. The Detroits won this race lust

ear.
. Inthe senior singles, L. Marsh of the Don
Rowing Club defeated by five lengths Goldman
of the Argonauts, who rowed at Henley last
year and was regarded as the best amateur
oarsman in Canada. Time for senior singles, 10
minutes 16 2-5 seconds, The course was1%
miles with a turn. sie

The Rainbow May Be Handled by an Amert-
can Skipper.

Newport, July 2.—It is reported here that
there is likely to be a change in the skipper of
the 70-footer Rainbow, owned by Cornelius
Vanderbilt, and that Capt. Jack Parker will be
replaced byan American. A yachtsman stated
to-day that Nat Herreshoff says that there Is
nothing the matter with the boat and that she
is as good as the rest of the class. He further
gays all the yacht wantsis anew skipper, ar
it is stated that Mr. Vanderbiit will act on this
suggestion. Capt, Parker and his Engilsh crew
are not familiar with cro-s-cut sails, they being
quite different from the English, and, in con-
sequence, the first suit was spoiled in stretch-
ing. Capt. Wringe of the Mineola received
valuable fotormation in relation to the handling
of cross-cut sall and has profitedgby it.

The Rainbow js still at Bristol. The Yankee
and Virginia went outside to-day, going as far
as Point Judith, There was no attempt at rac-
ing. The steamer C. B. Lowndes arrived to-day
to act as tender for the Yankee.

 

Maris Wins the Intercity Cup.

The sloop yacht Maris, built last winter by
Lawley for a syndicate of Charleston yachtsmen
to try and win back the Intercity cup from the
Savannah yachtamen, was successful. She beat
the Dragoon easily in two races, The Dragoon
was purchased for Savannah parties last year
and won the cupfrom Charleston, After that
the Charleston men had several yachts designed
and finally selected one from the board of
Clinton H. Crane. The series was the best two
out of three races. The Maris won the first two,
beating the Dragoon about ten minutes each
time. The Maris is to be sold at auction.

GOLDFINCH FILLY TAKES THE PLUM
AT SHEEPSHEAD BAY.

Demurrer and Brigadier Put the Plungers on
Velvet, but Procession Breaks the Sequence
~- Favorites First and Second Over Her-
dles—Towraine Springs a Surprise—Eantries.

The fact that the enjoyable June meeting

of the Coney Island Jockey Club is nearing its

close and that yesterday's card was well up
to the average in quantity and quality, at-
tracted about six thousand visitors to Sheeps-
head Bay. It was a sort of “ladies’ day”
among the equines as the only stake feature
scheduled was the Vernal for two-year-old
fillies, Seven smart young misses answered
the call to the post, A. H, & D. H. Morris's Add

being bulletined as a starter after Petra II.,

Connie, Welsh Girl and Queen Pepper had been

withdrawn from the overnight list of ten. The

hitherto unbeaten Watercress filly, Elizabeth

M, looked a certainty on her last two races and

the short price of 7 to 10 was so freely accepted

that late plungers considered themselves lucky
to get aboard at 1 to 2. Sweet Lavender and

All Saints alternated in second favoritism with

Lady of the Valley in mild demand.

The favorite dashed away at flagfall and

ziz-zagged down the Futurity hill interfering

with almost everything else in the race, Lady
of the Valley joined issue at the elbow and drew
away a clear length but Littlefield then came
along with Sweet Lavender and brought her
home by three parts of a length. Elizabeth

M. wound up very tired, a couple of lengths

behind the St. Saviour filly and only a head

in front of Add, who was closing strongly after
being almost bumped off the course. Jockeys

Shaw and Clawson ed some questions

by the stewards the cause and effect
of the crowding, but the numbers were not

The card looked invitingly easy to the regu-
lars ani for 6 to

ey cheerfully i
against Demurrer when the bookmakers grew
tired of laying 8 to §. A side plunge on Brown-
dale, Creason Tom Kenny enabled ad-
mirers of Luke Ward, the logical second choice
to back the Whitney colt for place at as good
as 8 to 1. The Madden cast-off signualized his
first appearance in the white and red of “Tony
Aste by nning eyey from his fleld as easily
as ae St last Friday, with Luke Ward again
second.
The one-mile race for three-year-olds on the
turf oat some of {its general interest through
the withdrawal of The Amazon and Lord Balti-
more, but the talent found no fault. Brig-
adier, Montanic and Vesuvian figured in the
order named as best of the seven left in, and
they finished as played, Brigadier outstaying
Montanic and beating him four lengths, while
the Whitney gelding took the place by three
lengths from Vesuvian, In scratching The
Amazon Walter Keyes showed rare judgment,
9 Brigadier won on the bit in 1:30 4-5, threes
fths of a second better than the course record
made by Blue Devil on June 25.
With rolls of ring money to burn, the plungers
saw a royal chance of doubling their winnings
on Procession in the third race, as 4 to § seemed
Iiberal odds against the Canadian horse after
the blue pencil had disposed of Prince of Mel-
bourne and Lady Massey. A wise minority
paved Favonius from 9 to 2 to 18 to 5 and King-
ike's sturdy son won at his leisure by a length
in slow time for the regular Suburban distance
Lituefield and Latson went to sleep for over a
mile, but then sprinted into the place two lengths
in front of Knight of the Garter with the favorite
al the wrong end of the procession.

Dr. Eichberg and Mr. Stoffel failed to accept
for the hurdle handicap, leaving Hardy C. and
Hardy Pardee joint favorites at 8 to 6. Des-
perado and Mouroe Doctrine were played down
some points, but Klondyke and Draughtsman
were ignored. The race resolved into a duel
between the rival favorites and ae raced in
close company to the last obstacle where Hardy
C. drew away and won handily by a length.
There were suggestions of crossing and foul
riding, but after a long investigation the stew-
ards sustained the judges’ placing

The surprise of the day was reserved for the |
closing event, in which Touraine, at 30 to 1, got
home by a neck from Olea, Ore Buffoon and
Ben Hadad who were all well bunched at the fin-
ish. Summary:

Penalties Against Losers Damaging to Thele | of some pent-up opinions concerning the doings

Chances—Forbes Carries Of the Honors
for Fine Play—Big Crowd Watches Contest
Before a crowd of nearly 10,000 persons at
the Prospect Park Parade Grounds yester-
day, the Vedham team of Massachusetts de-
feated the crack Meadow Brook quartet in
the semi-final round of the Polo Association

The discrepancy was in a large measure due
to penalties for crossing and safety incurred

|

of the Street Sprinkling Association under the
present administration, He said that the method
of sprinkling the streets was a great public
grievance that appealed to every class of citi-
zens, The streets are being flooded and not
sprinkled, he said, and in a way that was a

| menace to public health as well as dangerous
championship by a score of 5 goals te 2%. |

| 8treet, from Washington Park to Broadway, |

by the Meadow Brook players, as the latter ,

only scored one goal less than their rivals.
It was a fluctuation contest from the start,
and in the first period the play indicated that

thing of it. Though their ponies were not
quite as speedy as the Dedham's mounts, they
responded to the rein in much readier style,
and throughout the afternoon were thoroughly
under the control of the clever horsemen.
On the other hand, the Dedham ponies ap-
peared too fresh and hard to manage, until
the rapid work of the first period toned them
down.

The palm for individual play was easily taken
by Allen Forbes of the Dedhams, who

to the cycling and automobile traffic. He called
particular attention to the condition of Fourth

which he declared to be an avenue of mud,
slime and filth, thanks to the intemperance of
the water carts, Because of the way Fifth

| avenue is flooded, he said that cyclists are driven
the Meadow Brook men would have an easy |

|

|

was | avenies,

into violation of the rules of the road through
seeking the smallest streams and pools of water
on the asphalt. No language, said Mr. Belding,
is too strong in which to condemn the practices
now in vogue by the sprinkling cart men, He
was emphatic in declaring that it was not simply
@ grievance to tens of thousands of cyclists,
but one that offended thousands of drivers,
chaffeurs, pedestrians and residents. Last
year the recklessness of the water cart drivers
Was put under check. They were forced to use
judgment, their own or that of their superiors
and they left dry strips on the main asphalted
the officials

This year, however,

invincible after the second period, Superbly | seem tohave been too busy wtih politics or some-

mounted, he used his mallet witha dash and
effectiveness that produced a strong case of
raitles in his opponents, and no more brilliar,
play has ever been seen on the Prospect Park
fleld than marked the closing work of the
young New Englander.

Referee Seward Carey of Buffalo placed the
ball in play at 4:35 o’clock. George Eustis got
it out of*the scrimmage and the play was at
once transferred to the goal defended by the
Dedhamna at the southern end of the fleld. A
smart rally by the visitors sent the ball back
to the centre, where Harry Payne Whitney
took possession and cleverly carried it along.
driving it through the goal posts after 1 minute
and 50 seconds, The Dedhams now set a

merry pace, and after circling the field Weld
came out of the bunch and scored in ten seconds
less time than it took the Meadow Brooks to
mane a oe

The third goal was well fought out an
the play lucluded a pretty race down the Ang

twen Weld and Whitney, which ended AR
favor of the former, He returned the ball
with a back stroke just in time to rave a score.
Then Nicoll came with a whirlwind rush along

he western border and passed over to W. (.

nustis, Who scored again for Meadow Brook in a
trifle over three minutes, A couple of minutes
later the same player scored again, by carry-
ing the ball from midfield unassisted. With
the score 3 to 1 against them the Dedham play-
ers braced up and Forbes made two grand
rushes that just missed scoriffg,

Nicoll, fouled Goodwin shortly after the
second fleriod opened and the Meadow Brook
hard luck began at once, Goodwin got a clear
lead of twenty yards on the fleld and cantered
through the goal posts after the ball without
being approached. Whitney recovered some
of the lost vantage by scoring a dashing point
for Meadow Brook in forty seconds, The play,
which was mostly in the Dedham half of the fleld
was spirited until the end of the period, and
three mallets were broken in quick succession.
Whitney crossed Crane near the Dedham goal
and the Meadow Brooks lost another half point
The ponies were changed then and the Massa-
chusetts players had the best of it, aone-fourth
safety being marked down against Nicoll

Steady work marked the opening of the
third period, but Forbes improved in accuracy,
After three minutes he drove the ball down
from centre field close to the rail in two strokes,
close to the Meadow Brook boundary line,
then missed. Goodwin, however, picked it
up and passed to Forbes, who scored and placed
Dedham ahead for the first tine. The Meadow
Brooks plaved a desperate defensive game
and prevented any further score in the period,
in which the men were in action 1 minute and
18 seconds after the gong sounded,

In the fourth period Forbes was very con-
spicuous, He kept the Meadow Brook players
chasing him throughout. The lead was broken
after about four and a half minutes play.
Then Forbes took it down to the goal from
midfield in two shots. He supplemented this
by another goal made in the fast time of
28 seconds. Ponies were changed again.
with a little more than a minute to play, the
Massachusetts players contenting themselves
with playing out time without any serious
attempt at acoring,

The winners will piay the Westchester team
in the final game of the championship series
on Thursday. The lineup and summary yes-
terday follow:

Meadow Brook~—1, W. C. Fustis: 2.G. P. Eusids; 8,

discomfort. For cyclists and automobilists, it has
been sugely remarked that Fifth avenue

There were happenings on the road yester-
day witnessed by f reporter of Tam SUN that
were suggestive of a t ch

go on with regard to the pie Sethe
ae ce and automobilists, who

Ww
at first regarded one another as natura) ene-
les. One was the sight of a emall automo-
bile standing at the roadside while ita driver

was — out to the wheelmen who passed,
Got any tre tape?” A couple of cyclists rode
past after calling back “No!” in tones of evi-
dent honesty. A third, who was on a tande!
carrying a woman in front, stopped, produ
a huge roll of tire tape and asked: “How much
do you want?” The chaffeur did not want
the tape for the tire, but to make fast a tem-
porary repair in the metal part, and he took
about three yards. He offered to pay for it
and was laughed at, with a “That's all right
old ian; sane to you some day.” The secon
incident wasstillmoreinteresting, as it brought
the traditional enemy of wheelmen, a driver,
out in the light of a rescuer, A wheelman
was at the side of the ropd, trying to inflate
his tire with a «mall hand pump after having
lugged it. He was working hard and perspir-
ng. A man driving a road wagon fitted with
heumatic tires relned up beside him, and,

clist: “Hey, ury this; it’s easier,” and followed
it up with the query: “Got ail the cement and

At the polo game on the Prospect Park Parade
Ground yesterday a great many wheels were
stacked in pairs. Many stacks fell down be-
cause the riders had not done the trick prop-
erly. The best way, learned through experi-
ence, to lean two wheels together and make
them stand up is to turn them “fore and aft,”
with the head of one against the saddle of the
other. The handle-bars then lock with the
saddles and do not interfere. The front wheel
of each machine should be swung inward to-
ward the other.

DEATH OF WILLIAM B.

The Veteran Athlete Killed While on a Tour
at Mount Washington.

A telegram was received at the New York
A. C. last night from H. P. Parker of Fabyana,
stating that William B. Curtis, one of the found-
ers of that'club, was killedat Mount Wasbing-
ton, N. H., yesterday, and requesting
that Harry E. Buermeyer, W. F. Freudenstein,
and Mortimer Bishop be notified Supt.
James J. Duffy said that he feared the intet-
ligence contained in the despatch was true,
as the veteran left New York for Mount
Washington according to his usual custom
to select a route for the Fourth of
July excursion of the Fresh Air Club,
of which he was the patiifinder. He was an in-
trepid mountain climber and has spent nearly
every holiday and every Sunday during the
spring and fall for years past, exploring the
different ranges in the East and his daring has
led to many hairbreadth escapes.

W. B. Curtis, who was familiarly known as
“Father Bill,” was born at Saulsbury, Vt., Jan.
17, 1837. He was a unique figure in amateur ath-
letics, and from a prominent participant in all-
around sports during the early days of amateur-
ism in this country developed into an authority
on all branches of sport whose opinions were
quoted and respected all over the world. As
an official at the principal meets his services
were in great demand and it was only last
spri that the Intercollegiate A. A. A. A. paid
a high tribute to his works by presenting a
silver loving cup to him in recognition of ‘his
services as referee atthe annual games of the
association for nearly twenty vears.

During the Civii War Mr. Curtis served in the
Union Army. As @ youth be was sickly and
went into athens: a ferlorn hope,
having been considered by doctors as a hope-
less consumptive. After the war he came
to New. York, and in 1867 in company
with H. E. Buermeyer and J, C, Baboock set up
asmall gymnasium at 200 Sixth avenue, where
the formation of the New York A. C. was dis-
eussed and the club finally organized on Sept.
6, 1868. Atthattime ‘bather Bill’ was a fast
short-dietance runner and defeated nearly
every man of note inthe country {n match races,

After a few years spent here he went to Chi-
cago, where he was a member of the Board of
Trade. He frequently made trips East to de-
fend challenge cups on the river or track
At this time he was wealthy, but the Chicago
fire resulted in the loss of his property and after
afew years he came back to New York to take
a place as managing editor of the Spirit of
the Timea, a post which) he held for twenty-
one years, A change of policy of the

aper led to his resignation, Mr. Curtis waa the
ret man to own a pair of spiked shoes and at
the first @ames of the New York A.C., heldin
Madison Square Garden, the novel pumps were
loaned to a competitor in every race, being
even worn by one of the contestants in the one-
mile walk.

Though noted for his performances on the
running path, it wasas a heavyweigit thrower
and lifter that he was best known. He accom-
plished a hand lift of 1.230 pounds, and on Dec
20, 1868, lifted 3,239 pounds with harness,
a feat that never has been, eclipsed At
throwin the 16-pound hammer, from
a stand he won th» American champion-
ship in the following vears: 1876, with
76 fept 4 inches; 1878, with 80 feet 2 inches,
and” 1880 with 87 feet 4) inches
1878 he also won the national championship at
throwing the 56-pound weight, with 21 feet, and
was a member of the New York A. C. tug-of-war
team that won the championship in 1879 and

1880,

As an oarsman Mr. Curtis was equally
prominent, He won many races as a sculler
aid rowed on some of the best crews in the
seventies, winning the senior double sculis at
the national regatta of 1874, under the colors
of the New York A. C., with F. FE. Yates in the

other seat. .

“Father Bill” served as President of the New
Yoru A: C., but let the organization for a while
and joined the American A.(, He atterward

came a member again, and received a

'e bership by subscription of fifty

rs. He was a prominent factor
organization of the Amateur Athletic

, served several terms as treasurer, and

then became its president. He was an enthusi-
astic skater and hasfor years been president: f
the National Skating Association. One of his
latest, appointments was as delegate from the

CURTIS.

 

, to the L. A. and in that
capacity he influenced the League in its decision
to abandon racing. Hig active interest in
athletics never has age He devoted all his
spare time to swimming in the summer
mountain climbing in the spring and fall and
long trips on skates inthe winter, He wosa
great lover of music and a regular attendant
at the opera.

Samuel J Montgomery, & member of the N
Y. A.C. and a personal friend of Mr. Curtis,
wrote last night to John R. Van Wormer, presi-
dent of the club, easing shal the funeral service
be conducted in the olubhiouse on Bunday after-
noon. This programme will doubtless be carried

LAWN TENNIS.

Middle States Championship Opens With as
All-Star Entry List.

The Middle States championship lawn tennis
tournament opeved yesterday afternoon at the
Orange Lawn Tennis Club with an all-star
entry list. Qut of the twenty-five players
entered there are fifteen of national
reputation, including no less than
seven of the first ten players of the
| country, Champion Whitman will defend the

challenge cup, while Larned and Davis, his two

most dangerous rivals for national supremacy,
are among those who will try for the right to

challenge him. Itis also expected that the U,

8.N.L.T. A. International Committee will de-

pend largely upon the results of this tourna-
ment in selecting the American team for the
coming international matches,

There was plenty of excitement in the first
day’s play, no less than five of the eight prelim-
inary matches requiring the full three sets to
decide. Young E. P, Larned sprung the first
surprise by beating J, A. Allen of Yale and
earned his first spurs. Then E. L. Hall, the
veteran who recently won the New Jersey
State championship, beat H. A, Aackett,
the Yale champion, taking the deciding set
by 6-4, alter Hackett had ledat 4-2. An-
other surprise was caused when B. (. Wright o!
Harvard lost his first aet toG. H. Miles oO
Orange, but he was equal to theemergency and
won the next two rather easily.

Perhaps the most unexpected of all, however,
was the close Fischer-Davidson match. The
Metropolitan champion was expected to win
easily, but David-on ran away with the first
eet in rapid fashion. In the deciding bet,
Davidson won the odd game all the way from
6—4 up to 6-4, only to finally lose the set by
11-9. He could do little with Fischer's
servioe, but hit the balla so well on the other
games that he kept the lead up to the nineteenth

game.
This afternoon W. A. Larned will play Hall,
Fischer will meet Ward and Davis will piav the
younger Larned, among other matc'es.
doubles will also be etarted. Yesterday's

Sloop Yacht Duchess Going te Bermuda.

The sloop yacht Duchess, recently purchased
by Lieut. Cecis H. Dean of the Royal Artillery,
stationed at Georgias, Bermuda, ia to be takea
there on the steamer Trinidad, which sails on
Friday. The Duchess was built in 1897 by
Charles D. Mower from his own designs. She
was raced sucecssfully in Fastern waters
and in 1808 won the champlonship of the 16-foot
class of sloops. Her dimensions are: ‘Twenty-
nine feet over all, 18 feet on the water line, 8

 

feet beam and 6 inches draught. With her
centreboard down she draws six feet,
She has two rigs. When racing in the

18-foot class, in which there was no fe
striction as to sails, she carried 660 square
feet of canvas, but in the .0-foot class, in which
the sail spread was limited, she carried 600
square feet, The boat was brought ereuad
from Boston on a flat car and was put on
the Trinidad yesterday

Liv ut. Dean will race the yacht against some
of the flyers that are sailed in Bermuda waters.
These boats are very fast and carry a
spreads of canvas, The yachtsmen there
on all the sail they can and hold on until they
earry away or capsize. The yachts there
of the scow type, and when they capsize one
the men on board cuts the lashing that hel
the ballast in place and then the yacht floats
safely until towed into port.

 

The Mineola May Be Disqualified,

The Regatta Committee of the New York
Yacht Club has been considering the action of
the 70-footers Mineola and Rainbow at the
start of the Glen Cove cup race on June 10, and
it is expected that a decision will be rendered
shortly, It appears that the Mineole, o@ the
port tack, tried to force the Rainbow, on the
starbeard tack, about. The two yachts were
coming together, both heading for the commit-
tee boat end of the starting line, and under the
rules the Rainbow received the right of way.
Atone tine it looked as though the Mineola
would becut down by the Rainbow, but just
when itseemed impossible to avert a collision
Cornelius Vanderbilt ordered Capt. Parker to
give way, The Mineola was able to cross at the
windward end, but the Rainbow was forced to
go over the line and then to tack and crose
again, going over at the leeward end,

The owners of the two yachts, Vice-Commo-
dore August Belmont and Cornelius Vander-
bilt. left the rnatter in the hands of the Regatta
Commitiee, believing that the committee re-
ceived the power lo take any action {t saw fit
under the rules. Mr. Vanderbilt declined to
make a protest. The committee hae taken tes-
timony from those who were on the yeehts
and from others who saw the whole scene. It
ix expected that the Mineola will be diequaiificd
and the cup given to the Rainbow.
