PENEDICT'S ZINC STOCK.

@UIT UP TO-DAY ACCUSING GUAR-
DIAN TRUST OF FRAUD.

Answer Demurred To as Frivolous- Plaintiffs
Bay They Were Induced by Misrepresenta-
tien and Unearned Dividends Paid to Bay
Into a Worked-Ont Mine That Was in Debt.

The euit of E. ©. Benedict, the well-known
banker of this city, and others against the
Guardian Trust Company, in which serious
charges are made against the defendant com-
pany because of its methods in assisting in the
flotation of the stock of the Chicago Zinc Mining
Company comes up for argument before Jus-
thee O'Gorman in the Supreme Court, Special
Term, to-day. Inthe complaint fraud is directly
@arged. The trust company was formerly
known as the Missouri, Kansas and Texas Trust
Company, but assumed its present name in July,
1900. A. F. Stillwell, formerly President of the
Ransas City, Pittsburg and Gulf Railroad, is
ite President and John W. Gates of the Ameri-
can Steel and Wire Company one of the trus-
tees of the trust company. The company was
organized in Missouri and originally had its
chief office in Kansas City, but its principal
office is now said to be in Chicago and it has a
branch office in this city at 63 Wall street. Ed-
win T. Rice, Jr., of Cary & Whitridge, who ts one
of the plaintiffs, his law firin being their attor-
neys, made this statement yesterday afternoon:

“The suit was began about six weeks ago by
E. 0. Benedict and others who were purchasers
of the stook of the company known as the Chi-
cago Zinc Mining Company on a prospectus is-
eued by the Guardian Trust Company. The
mining company is capttalized at $50,000,
divided into 500 shares of $100 par value. When
the suit was begun an attachment was granted
by Justice Andrews on which the property of
the company bere was seized. Subsequently
the trust company arranged to have a bond of |
indgmnity given by a surety company tn order
to discharge the attachment and then demurred |
to the complaint on jurisdictional grounds.
The plaintiffs are about applying for judgment*
on the demurrer as frivolous and the motion

went representations made by the trust com-
in connection with the sale of the stoc«
Chicago Zinc Mining Company and ts

AS a matter of fact, we allege,

tense w - the stock was being sold by rae
any. A% soon as the stock ha
bean sold. ‘the payment of dividends ceased,

te the era knew waa that the trust com-

 

pany issued a statement to the effect that the
ainc compan by was in debt and would be sold

then made and it was ascertained, as we
mt, that the property at the time of the

CHEAPER BESSEMFER PIG?

Price Agreement, It Is Said, Will Be Removed
~—Lead and Tin Lower,

Advices from Pittsburg, received in Wall
Street yesterday, said that the Bessemer Pig
Iron Association has decided to remove the
price agreement and make the market open.
Itf& expected now that Bessemer pig iron will
@0 down to $16 per ton, and billets to $22. Itis
not believed by Pittsburg steel men that prices

go lower than that, and they may not go
quite so low

he American Smelting and Refining Com-
pany, made a reduction of one-eighth of a cent
Be price of lead yesterday, | which put the
back to 4%, cents. The reduction was in
nature of a surprise, a ueaer vance hav-
ing been expected by the trade. Yn the local
mene yesterday tin was quoted one-half of a
ower, in sympathy with a heavy break in

the price of the me metal in the London market.

Control of the Fitchburg Passed.

The control of the Fitchburg Railroad has

WALL PAPER TRUST TO QUIT.
Reason: It Doesn't Pay—Indebtedness Nominal
Plants to Revert to Old Owners.

At the annual meeting of the directors of |
the National Wall Paper Company, to be |
held on July 17 in the general offices of the
company, 127 Crosby street, the advisability of
a dissolution of the company will be discussed, |
Henry Burn, President of the company, made
this statement yesterday:

‘From time to time rumors of an Impending
dissolution of the National Wall Paper Company
have appeared in the press, Although thesubject
may have been informally discussed among the
various stockholders, there wasno basis for an
announcement that such dissolution would take
place. During the past few weeks, however,
the subject has recived serious consideration
on the part of the directors and of the large

stockholders, and at the annual meeting, which
is to be held on the 17th inst., the matter wiil
fully considered and definite action will proba-
bly be taken. The reasons which have been
urged in support of favorable action on auch a
prappeiti on are in brief
hat although the company has now been
n existence for eight_years and has done a
arge business, its profits have not been com-
mensiirate with the expectations of the stock-
holders,'due to the fact that its existence has
tosuch an extent e\imulated competition that
the number of plants engaged tn the'manufaot-
ure of wall paper has in that period practically
doubled
“It has also been demonstrated that the
manufacture of wall paper involves eremente
of so peculiar a nature that it cannot be as suc-
cessfully conducted through the medium of @
combination as it can through indenen ans
isolated plants. Individyal taste and the per-
sonal ty of the manufacturer play animportant
part, which in a combination consisting of
numerous plants is apt to be overlooked.
‘For these and other reasons the entire Board
of Directors, who themselves constituye a
majority of the stockholders, and who’ are
acting from a sincere convio'ion that they are
thereby promoting the interests of con-
cerned, favor a dissolution of the corporation,
The indebtedness of the company is nominal
j and will be paid fn full before ny —., wwe -
ing toward Gesoytion is t
being matured which will in ‘ali A tabtiite
r-sultin the acquisition of the various plants
by those who were idenufied with tham prior to
their sale to the National Wall Paper Com-
ny. The essential feature s the pian will
be that the present Board of Directors will
ave sole charge of closing the affairs of th
company, thereby avoiding the expense an
shrinkage in values ordinarily ingident to the
seat on of an important industrial under-
aking.’

 

 

 

BOGUS ORDERS TO BUY 0., B. & Q.

Donkey Who Sent the Postal Cards Signed
Keene's Name to One,

Postal cards, purporting to give orders for
the purchase of stocks, reached anumber of New
York Stock Exchange firms through the mail
yesterday morning. The signatures on the
cards were forgeries. H. 1. Horton & Co. got
a card which read as follows:

New YORK, June $0, 1900,
@Buy 500 Quincy R. R. stock at market on Monday.
Send mem. to office. Yours JAMEB R. KBENE.
Mr. Keene is now in Europe and his son-in-
law, Talbot J. Taylor, received a cable despatoh
from him yesterday, announcing his arrival] in
London from Paris. Mr. Taylor, to whom
Horton & Co. showed their postal card, said
“No attempt was apparently made to imitate
Mr. Keene's actual signature. It must have
been either some crank who prepared the card |
or it ts a ridiculous attempt to bull the market
by some one who had a few shares of Chicago,
Burlington and Quincy. Mr. Keene does not
distribute his orders by means of postal cards.
He distributes them through his brokers.”
Flower & Co, also @ot a postal card with a
forged order. It was to buy 800 shares of Quincy
at 124, and purported, to he signed by one of the
members of the Stock Exchange who, when it

 

 

was shown to him, pronounced it a forgery
The matter was brought to the attention of the
Committee of Arrangements of the Exch
who caused this warning to be sent over the
stock tickers:

“A for
Was rane

order for the purchase of stock

ved by Flower & Co, oy mall this
mornin, It was not acted on. Members ve
advised to exercise care in executing orders by
mall inasmuch as the presence of some forger
is known. By decision, PCommities of Arrange-
ments.”

A somewhat similar instance of forged orders
for stock transactions occurred last November,
when Washington F. Connor's name was for,
to orders to sell certain stocks, the forger at
that time also using postal cards.

JERSEY CENTRAL GOES HIGHER.

Advances 4 Points on Light Trading and
Rumors of a Deal.

In consequence of a revival of rumors that |

the Centra! Ratlroad of New Jersey {s to change |
hands and become part of a greattrunk line |
combination, the price of that stock made a net |

advance of 2\in the Stock Exchange yester- |
day. Although the aggregate sales barely ex-
oeeded 8,000 shares Jersey Central was exceed-
ingly active fora few minutes, and buyers of |
100-share sots quickly bid the price upfrom 124% |
to 129.

A broker with an imperative order to bu
1,000 shares a apparently started the <a
movement, and his b gave ao
report that an attempt co eing made to
chase and concentrate as much as ble of
the outstanding stock. The brisk bidding of a
few minutes was not sustained, however. The
price went Sram, 127 to 129 on two sales of 100
shares each and Jamediately receded to 126,
Subsequently it advanced to 127 and remained
at that figure

There is excellent authority for the statement
that the persons who now control the oreey
Central Railroad have not sold any of thelr
stock. Some of the men Interested in the pres-
ent management creditthe theory that astrong |
financial interest has been buying a verge
amount of the floating stock of the company i
order to be ina position to negoilate with the
controlling powers fora voicein the manage: |
ment of the roads. There {sa strong bellef that |

the welfare of the Baltimore and Ohio is being
looked after in these outside purchases of Jer-
sey Central shares,

New Oil Rates to Canada,

The Grand Trunk Railway has announced a
material reductionin the freight rates on pe-
troleum en route from Pennsylvania to Canada
via Buffalo and Suspension Bridge. For nearly
two years there has been practically a suspen-
sion of this traffic in consequence of the Grand
Trunk advancing rates to a polnt that shut
out the independent ofl producers. The Stands
ard Oil Company was accused at the time of
using ite influence with the Grand = Trunk
aguinst the jocependens shippers. The new
rates are designed to restore facilities to all

parties; the reductions range from 30 to 40 per
cent. a8 compared with the old tariff,

Orders to Stop Rate Cutting.

Freight traffic officers of the Eastern lines
have received official notice that by order of
the Presidents of the Western railroads all cut-
ting of rates on freight in Western territory

was to have ceased yesterday. This order ap-
plies to East-bound and West-bound shipments,
and traffic officers who disobey the Presidenta’
mandate are to be severely dealt with. Eastern
railroad men have an idea that there are many
reduced-rate contracts tn the hands of Western |
shit pers which will not expire until latein the
fall or toward the close of the year. The West-
ern executives say that there are only afew of |
such contracts outstanding.

FINANCIAL AND COMMERCIAL,

 

Monpay, July 2.
The transactions in stocks to-day were not
large, aggregating less than 300,000 shares,
but the magnitude of the net changes in prices

resulting from the comparatively small volume |

of business is worthy of careful consideration,
The tone of the market was strong though-
out, and even the usual reaction at the close
of a day when prices have advanced materi-
ally did not prevent nearly the entire list froin
enjoying net gains, many of which were im-
portant. The purely local influences affect-
ing the speculative side of the market were the
cessation of liquidation by marginal holders
and also of aggressive selling by professional
operators who favor the short side of the mar-
ket. These last, for reasons best known to
themselves, were constrained to reduce the
volume of their contracts. That they did not
do 80 very extensively is shown by the small-
ness of the total dealings. The changes in
speculative conditions that have been noted
gave the market an opportunity to respond to
an extent to legitimate buying and selling.
Of the last there was practically none, for {n-
vestors who have not been frightened in
selling during the last ten or twelve months
of reaction are not likely to do so now when
the general business situation is more likely
to show improvement than to become less sat-
isfactory. Of buying through oommission
houses there was, as for some time past, &
moderate amount, and in view of the unpre-
cedentedly large disbursements for interest
and dividends to-day and during the month, the
demand from actual buyers of securities is
likely to increase.

A comparison between the ruling rates for
money and the yield that oan be secured from
many stocks and bonds, particularly the firat
named, shows that many of the issues of both
railway and industrial corporations are cheap,
that is, if the buyer is satisfied with the seour-
ity he can get a larger return upon his money
if carefully invested in securities than he oan
by leaving it on deposit in an institution that
pays interest. Of course timid investors may
be deterred from pursuing this course by the
exaggerated reports of crop damage that specu-
lators in grain and in ootton are utilizing in
connection with their various ventures. They
may also become perturbed by the concerted
efforts of the Powers, including the United
@tates, to restore order in China, @ condition
that is certain to be accomplished and which is
certain to be followed by the further opening
up of the Chinese Empire to the merchants
and manufacturers of all civilized nations,
That the United States will hold its own in
the competition for development and trade in
the Far Bast is plainly foreshadowed by the
statistios of our foreign trade, especially dur-
ing the last few years when > of a

‘actured products have tn
Another factor that no one terest ain

ness, investment or speculation can afford >
overlook or underestimate is the apparent
beginning of a recover y in commodity prices
A possible shortage in the wheat and cotton
crops of this country has already caused an
advance in the prices of those staples. The
markets for others show a tendency toward
firmness, particularly in Furope. A foreign
demand for American ooal is steadily develop-
ing and experts are figuring upon a resumption
of an active Furopean demand for our fron.
Domestic advices from various points are of a
careful sounding of the fron market by the
agents of larue consumers. Buyers of manu-
factured produocte are aleo watching the markets
closely with the view of placing their orders
at bottom prices. In the meantime the delay
in adjusting wages with a large proportion
of iron workera and the closing down of many
furnaces and mills for repairs help consump-
tion to catch up with production. It would not
be surprising, therefore, in view of the world’s
great industrial activity and the developments
in Sonth Africa, In China, in the West Indies
and in the Philippines, if the prices of tron
and steel should begin to show a tendency to
harden before the Presidential campaign was
concluded

The advices from Kansas City to-day doubt-
less had a good deal of effect upon sentiment
both in and out of Wall Street. It appears
from them that the candidate who will beyond
doubt head the Demooratio ticket will dominate
the entire programme, that an unequivocal
ailver and Populistio platform has been agreed
upon in advance by Mr. Bryan and his asso-
ciates and that a candidate with sound money
views has no chance for second place upon the
ticket. This programme ignores the fact that
many sections in the West are ashamed of the
allver iasue and consider it dead and that the
West, owing to its having come into existence
through the adoption of a policy of expansion,
fs, In the present situation, heartily {n favor
of the continuation of that policy.

Of the stock market in detail little can be sald
as there were few specific considerations af-
fecting values. More favorable crop weather
in the West was reflected in higher prices for
the shares of all the railways west of Chicago
and St. Touis. The trading was well distrib-
uted and included a fair degree of activity in
Bugar Refining, American Tobacoo, Brooklyn
Rapid Transit and Reading first preferred. The
list of ordinarily inactive shares, notably those,
that have attained a standing with investors
that made decided progress toward a higher
level, was a long one. Conspicuous among
them were Consolidated Gas, Great Northern
preferred, Tiinois Central, Delaware & Hudson
and Wells-Fargo Express. The closing was
firm at a fractional reaction from the best
prices.
