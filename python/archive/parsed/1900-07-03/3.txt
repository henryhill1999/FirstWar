Kansas Ctry, July 2.—The biggest splurge
that was made in town to-day was made by Mr.
William A. Clark, who is described by the Mon-
tana people as the miser who has gone mad for
political honors. Mr. Clark's contest for recog-
nition by this Democratic convention is told
about elsewhere. It is just Mr. Clark's arrival
and the incidents attending it that 1s the
subject of this paragraph, The Hon. William
‘a. Clark has whiskers of the same hue as those
possesssed by the Hon. Jim Ham Lewis of the
neighboring State of Washington. Clark got
here to-day on a Burlington train and it had
been all arranged by his managers to provide
a reception that would attract attention and
that they hoped would have some influence.
Jt did attract attention. The reception was
given by the representatives of @ lot of labor
organizations because they said Clark was @
great friend of the laboring men and pays
42.50 a day for eight hours’ work. They
didn't say anything about the dollars or
two dollars a day for ten hours’ work that he
pays in arizona, where 03 per cent. of
his copper is mined, but it was this $2.50
in the State where 7 per cent. of his copper
{s mined that provided them the excuse for
recelving him. They went down to the west
bottoms where the train came in and as Clark
got off his car with his band of twenty-five
ininers dressed in white duck they cheered him
and roared ut him.

It was a bit incongruous that the most fash-
fonable drag in the city should have accompan-
ied these hardy sons of toil on their trip to do
homage to the man witha hundred million dol-

 

 

r. Clark climbed u p in the , mar-
larvite his band of white miners front
of him and started a PiacaDa ch thro’

the main streets of the city, while the people

the course of time the drag reached the
Midland Hotel, where the  wantane Clark
delegation had quarters. The band drew a
great crowd and to this mbled multitude
the millionaire addre: binpel’, standing
on the seat of the drag Fe. ° PP ople
“Fellow citizens,” ana said that he Re ighly
honored at such a tribute paid to him by or-
ganized labor of the city on an occasion like
this,
“T know what it {s to labor,” he said. “I used
to do it myself. I know what it mponne to have
to work for your living, I used to do that
nyself and you have my hearty sympathy. So
{ong as lam an. employer of labor I shall
never forget the hardships that the laborer is
forced toendure. I want to thank you, gentle-
men, for what you have done for me, thank you

or. then, the que atarted to howl and
whoop for Clark 18 moment the noise h
died out a little and before C Tark had descended
from his perch a colored man, James A. Kors,
whose card said that he was chairmen of the
National. Association of Negro Democratio
Clubs, and who said he came from the Hon,
Norman Mack's district in Buffalo, leaped
high tn the air and shouted:

“and before we close I want to, in the pame
of the great State of New York nominate W Wil-
liam A. Clark for Vige-President of the United
States of America,”

There were mingled cheers and laughter
ang ] a Clark got down from his perch.

Make way for the millionaire! Make way
for the millionaire.” shouted four or five and
the path was made, The moment Clark was
Inal¢ e of the hotel a big voice roared:

Come on now. Everybody Let's
have a drink with Senator Clark.” And there
Was @ great rush made for the ° atted-or er one
cooled” barroom. It wasn't y rks
who headed for the drug store on the groun
floor of the hotel and drank aglass of sarsa-
parilla alone. Those who went to the bar-
room were disappointed.

The white duck band that came in town
to boom Clark used to be known as the Boston
and Montana Band, The members of it were
employees of the Bonton and Montana mine
whieh is not one of Clark's mines but Clark
wanted the band aud went over and bought

 

it. He hired all the miners to work in his mine
and play music for him when he went out on
political trips

The whiskers possessed by \. A. Clark so

closely resemble those that are the boast of tho
Ho}. Jim Hav Lewis that the two men have
been mistaken for each other several times
oe: It would be almostimpossible to
distinguish them apart were it not for the fact
that the Hon. Jim Ham had his whiskers freshly
trimmed this morning. This is what he threat-
ened to do when he came here. They stick
out now like the facial adornment of Carl
Schurz and they are parted in the middle in
bewitching style. Clark's whiskers are not
trimmed. Jim Ham considered the trimming
of his whiskers a good political move. It was
one on Sulzer and shortly after the Hon. Jim
Ham appeared with the trimming, some
of Sulzer’s strength began to disappear and
word came from Sulzer's headquarters that
if the New York statesman couldn't have th:
Vice-Presidency there was one man absolutely
who shouldn't have it and that was the Hon.
Jim Ham. This was regarded aa a great poine
by Jim Ham’ 8 followers and they were delighted
They declared that they had Sulzer on the go,
All that wa. needed wa. one more push to
finish him. And they -ad that they would
give him that mighty quick. The fight bee
tween Sulzer and the Hon. Jim Ham threatens
to become a feud.
, Ryery body believes that it was William
Bryaa’s speech at the Chicago Convention
hat hb him the nominee for the Presidency
1896. This illusion has been dispelled lately
a story which goes to show that Bryan was
yi for the nomination for many months
eceding the convention. tle wrote Urey
precatin of Kentucky a month or two before
the convention asking bim for the names of
Kentucky delegates, Woodson did not re-
spond promptly and Bryan prodded him with
asecond letter. When the Kentucky delegation
met it was found that Bryan had four of the
belpgatos. It was also ascertained that he
done missionary = work in nearly
prary other delegetion. About the time Chair-
man Harrity led the convention to wras
Bryan sat on the pyatform by the side of Wood-

son. Woodson ask ae who was goi
to be nominated for Pree do dent and Bryan sai
he did not know, Woodson said he thought

y @ man.

“No,” 7 sald, “Bland will poll his Stata
on the first ballot. After that he will lose.”

Woodson disagreed with him, but finally

Bryan said;
foodson, I'll tell you who is going to be
nominated”
“Who is that?” queried Woodson
“Well,” says Bryan, “it’s me,” and he slapped
trimself on the chest.

Bim, the button man, nan, had the worst scare
to-day that he ever had in his life. It will
be recalled that when Bim visited Kansas City
immediately after this town was selected for
a@ convention city he made certain observa-
tions which he afterward detailed to reporters
in New York. Among them was one regard-
ing the absence of drinkeries in the city. Bim
got here yesterday morning and he was met
here by his friends, who assured him that the
people of this town were very sore about what

ad said and that a committee had called
at the hotel to see him, Bim didn't know
whether he was being jollied or not, He was
assured that it was a fact and that the commit-
jee was headed Py a@ prominent citizen who a
few years ago led a party of lynchers, Bim
was advised to stay around the hotel, where
he was sure of pemee protection,

Bim followed the advice very well and along
in the afternoon he was standing in the Mid-
land over one of the cyclone afters, cooling
himself off, when a tall man, wearing a som-
brero and a fierce expression, accompanied
by a shorter man with a still flercer expression
approached. The tall man laid a heavy hand
on Bim’ 8 ave r,

“Say,” said he, “you Bim, the button
from New York?’ —

Bim looked around helplessly, but there
was no Way of escape and he thought he would

bluff it out,

‘hat’s me,” said he.

The tall stranger whipped his hand around
to ie a bip 4D pocket and drew a gun that looked

four feet long and to carry cart-
Hd ‘ stwo inches in diameter.

mL said he, “i'm from Texas, and here's

olny ores edentials,”

im's teeth chattered. His ruddy face
naled, His tongue refused to speak. His
legs refused to respond to the order to run.

“Glad to meet you,” said the Texan

And then Birn wiped the perspiration from
his brow and sank down into the nearest chair
Tt was a close ©. all and he hadn't recovered from
it taenight.

There were three parades in town to-day,

One was a litte one gotten up by the Monetary
‘

 

Convention. It consisted chiefly of a brass

    

band, which marched around town trying to
drum up a crowd to go and hear people spout
about money. The band had a huge banner,
carried by carriers, on which was the inscrip-
tion:

“Down with Imperialism and Down with the
Trusts—-W. J. Bryan, 16 to 1.”

The second parade was a combination of
firemen and Wild West show. 1t was made up
of numerous bands, numerous firemen, numer-
ous veterans and Wild West exhibits. It was
led by Chief Hale and his assistants and by
Mack and Dan, the famous white fire horses

that took first prize at a world's pew in 1892.
Next came the veterans of 1888 in red shirts,
and then carriages full of. Indians, cowboys
on horseback, with varied colored shirts. After
them came prairie schooners and a echooner
with a ihe reading “X I T from Texas on the
fall te to National Democratic Convention,

This wae ‘the opportunity that the artists for
the Easter wspapers and weekly publica-
tions were tooxing tor. The artists Med the
and real cowboys, which will be seen later in
Eastern papers, labelled so as to create the im-
pression probably that the scene is an ordinary
one in Kansas City.

The ues proceasion was that of William 4.
Clark, and already been told about.

The barroom fad of Kansas City just at
present is cut glass displays. In many of the
most popular and prosperous of these places
there is a most elaborate selection of beauti-
ful cut glass, consisting of punch bowls, vases,
flower dishes, &¢., piled up in the middle of
the shelf behind the bar. In one of the places
where i exhibit of cut glass is made it is

Attractive * a At as it spines and sparkles in
the rays of the electric lig! d is duplicated
in the many mirrors at - es ¥ the room.
In the smaller places ao lass exhibit is sta-
tionary and not so expensive, but the general
idea seems to prevail all ¢ over the town.

One of the picturesque figures in the hotel
lobbies is a man with somewhat of a national
reputation, and known perhaps better
in Washington and in Montana than anywhere
else. This is Martin Maginnis of Montana,
generally known as the handsome Major.
He says there are thousands and thousands
of good people in Montana who don’t care
anything about either Clark or Daly, that

pany of them are Democrats. Major Maginnis
olds a nen as United States Senator
ust as does and it is slaned | not by the
utenant-Governor, but by the Governo my
gf the copper State. The sight of the genie
Major recalls an mnctdons of the Democratic
convention of 1802 Chicago. During a
somewhat stormy en nt in the oavesien

demanding recognition of the presiding offi =f

Finally he got that official's eye and was about
to say what he had eay when the presiding

“What ts the gentleman's name?”

“Maginnis,” shrieked the Major and he was lost
sight of in a roar of laughter that went up
from the delegates.

 

The man in this town that everybody wants
to see is the Hon, Richard Croker. Mr. Croker
has been kept busy in his room almost con-
tinuously since he came here receiving dele-
gations from various States who want to know
just what sort ofa manheis. They have read
about him, they have heard him praised and
damned, and they are all anxious to shake
hands with him. At one time to-day there were
five delegations in his room. Said one man
to-day

“Do you know, untill met and heard him
talk I had no idea that he was such a ereat
man, @ truly great man, sir.”

Mr. Croker’s picture has been printed in
this part of the country many, many times,
so that whenever he is seen he is recognized

and wherever he goes he is followed, He
took a ride yesterday aféernoon and every-
pede who saw his carriage turned and stared
at him.

Mr. Croker doesn't talk politics to the average
cluipen., and the folks who went carriage riding
with him were more or less surprised at tho
things he asked questions about. One of his
questions was:

“How many negro voters have you got in

Kensas City?

hen he wanted to know whether Kansas
City was Democratic or Republican, whether
the city paid for paving the streets or paid
only p He asked questions about the
price 0} jroyenty in Kansas City and about
a multitude of other things, He asked ques-
tions about the poiltics of Missouri, but his
remarks were all questions, and when some-
body tried to draw him out on politics gener-
ally be turned the subject by asking: “Say
can you tell me anything about the price of
mules?”

Coin Harvey of Chicago has been bere for a
week now looking over the situation, And he is
growing frantic every time that any suggestion
is made to him about omitting 16 to 1 from the
platform. He declared to-day:

“The only thing for the Democratic party to
do is to write a platform which will be as clear
avd explicit in its declaration for the free coin-
age of silver at the ratio of 16 to 1 as the Chi-
cago platform ever was, It can be made even
clearer. The mass of the voters would prefer
that it should be and they will not consent to an
evasion that will give an excuse for saying
they bave weakened in their position.”

Coin was ed who he wanted to be Vice-

resident. e said he didn't have any choice.

ut he ad “threatening “E

“If the Democratic party shal) ape nything
but show a warm feeling toward its Free Silver
allies that are assisting to promote the prin-
ciples upon which pe party stands it will be
an unw exhibition of Hrog gance and not
stateamanship, The allies have a right to be
consulted yashington would have consulted
Lafayette in the War of Independence.”

Coln referred to the Pops and the Silver Re-
publicans,

Sulzer was asked to-day what he thought
of Judge Augustus Van Wyck’'s statement
that Tammany had pledged no votes to any
one. He replied:

“You may say for me that the chances of my
being nominated are stronger at this moment
than ever. It makes no difference what Judge
Van Wyck or any other man may say, I know
what I am talking about. I have the individ-
ucl pledges of a great number of delegates
from New York that they will vote for me in
the convention, There ts not the peradven-
ture of a doubt but that I shall win in the Vice-
Presidential! race.”

Things were rather quiet around the Sulzer
hendquarters during the evenin He was
yates by alot of boys who calle themselves
the Young Democrats of Kansas City. They
ranged from 15 to 19 years,

ire you fellows going into the convention?”
he asked the boys. One of the young fellows
replied that they were not certain they could
get in

“Well you oan in all fight,” he replied,
“if you come ea enough.

There is going to be a considerable variety
{n the badges now. Eacd delegation that comes
in has a fresh one and there are some new ideas
in badges. One is a badge on which
hangs a miniature of the liberty bell with the
crack showing and over it is the insoription
‘Liberty Forever.”’ Another padge is called

“Democracy Shamrock.” It is a metal sham-
rock. On one leaf are the words “The People,
not Trusts.” On the middle leaf are the words
eametaliom. not Monomentallism.” On _ the
vire, leaf are the words" Republic not Em-
pire Over the shamrock are the words

Democracy Stands For.”

There are a lot of mighty sore people in town
to-day, who don’t like the way that Kansas
City runs her railroads. It is the custom in
this town to start the last car from each ter.
minus at 12 o'clock midnight. That this was
the custom was not generally known, and
when at half past 11 o'clock last night, when
it was atill hotter than mustard and growing
hotter, the people who didn’t have Anything
elsa to do but search for mye to ©oo

they shot should go to the end of the line ape come

THE ‘THE SILVER REPUBLICANS, re rms fr the

 

TWELVE THOUSAND DELEGATES AND
SHOUTERS ARE EXPECTED.

The Convention Will Be Called to Order at
Noom oa Wednesday—Charies A. Towne Is
Their Candidate for Vice-President, and
They Are Urging the Democrats to Name
Mim for the Tail of Their Bryan Ticket.

Kansas City, Mo., July 2.—Ex-Congress-
man Charles A. Towne, the candidate of the
Populists for Vioe-President, candidate to be
of the Silves Republicans and a strong hustler
for the Democratic nomination, went over to
Topeka, Kan., this afternoon to address a meet-
ing there to-night. Before he left this State
he declared that the developments of the last
twenty-four hours had been very encourag-
ing to him and his friends. Delegates to the
Silver Republican Convention, which will be
held on Wednesday, are arriving on every
train, and it is expected by the National Com-
mittee, of which Mr. Towno 1s the head, that
the total attendance will be at least 12,000,
Before Mr. Towne went into Kansas he held
a number of conferences in his headquarters
in the Coates, at which the situation was gone
over thoroughly. Mr. Towne’s friends de-
clare that they feel the utmost confidence that
he will be nominated for Vice-President on
the Democratic ticket. The belief of Mr.
Towne’s friends is that Mr. Bryan intends
that the platform to be adopted by the Demo-
cratic party shall contain a specific 16 to 1 decla-
ration, and that it is his personal desire
that Mr. Towne shall be the nominee of the
convention, To-day they sald that they had
no doubt that Mr. Towne would be nominated.
Their feeling is that Col. Bryan has absolute
control of the situation, and that the conven-
tion will do as he directs in everything. Feel-
ing this, they are open in their declarations that
Mr. Towne will be the Democratic nominee,

Among the men interested in Mr. Towne’s
candidacy whom he saw to-day were Senator
Teller and ex-Senator Dubois, Nathan Cole,
Jr., of California; Col. Chrisholm of Montana
Judge Brown of Ohio, ex-chairman of the;
State Central Committee, and H. A. McCraney
of San Francisco, the Secretary of the National
Committee of the Silver Republicans. These
and a dozen other men spent two hours in
Mr. Towne's~ headquarters this afternoon.
They talked about the plans for the National
Silver Republican Convention, and it was
decided that the National Committee should

be called together to meet to-morrow (Tues-
a afternoon for the purpose of laying
out @ programme. The main points of the
convention have been agreed upon already.
Mr. Towne, the chairman of the National Com-
mittee, will call it together at noon on the Fourth
in the Auditorium Theatre, while Cliairman
Jones of the Democratic National Commitee
is calling the Democratic delegates together
in the big Convention Hall, After Mr. Towne
has finished his opening speech, prayer will
be offered by the Rev. Dr. Bigelow of Cin-
cinnati. Then the call will be read and the
Declaration of Independence will follow. Mr.
Towne will then introduce Senator Henry
M. Teller, who will be the temporary chair-
man, Senator Teller will make a speech and
the convention will then elect Judge W. L.
Brown of Ohio as its permanent presiding
officer, and Judge Brown will preserve order
with the aid of a gavel, the head of which is
made of elm from a tree planted by Abraham
Lincoln, The handle is a piece from a joist
in the floor of the Lincoln dining room. After
this the convention will adjourn until the after-
noon, when Bryan will be nominated for Presi-
dent and Towne for Vice-President.

The convention will not last more than one
day, if the present plan is carried out. The
size of the delegations which are going to at-
tend it, it was sald by Secretary MeCranny
to-day, has been a great surprise to the mem-
bers of the National Committee. Ohio prom-
ises to send a hundred delegates and shouters.
California's contingent will count at least
thirty. lowa is guing to send 128 any way
and possibly more. The representatives of
the States along the northern border of the
country from the Great Lakes to the Pacific

will be particularly strong.

Senator Dubois of Idaho, in speaking of the
situation, said; “We want 16 to 1, but if the
Democrats will put Towne on the ticket with
Col, Bryan, we will be willing to make some
concessions On the money plauk, Li, however,
such @ man as Hill or one like him is to be the
nominee we Want an iron-clad platform. Thus |
vou can see that the personality of the Vice- |
Presidential candidate may have a very de-
cided influence ov the character of the finan-
cial plank to be adopted by the Democratic
Convention. Bryan and Towne would be a

latform in themselves and every one would

now What they stood for,”

Senator Pettigrew, who carries about with
him a letter from Mr, Towne in which that

gentieman declares that he will not withdraw
fom the Populist ticket without consulting
the Senator, arrived in town fo-tey and at
once began a conference with Mr. Towne and
the other Silver Kepublicans. Senator Petti-
grew represents the Populists here. He wants
Mr. Towne to get the Vice-Presidential nom-
ination and he wants to have the convention
adopt a financial plank in which the free and
unlimited coinage of silver at 16 to 1 shall be
demanded in specific terms. Senator Petti-
arew is also convinced that the convention
will do what he wants it to,

“This convention,” he said to-day, “will
write its own platform, The simple reaftir-
mation of the Chicago platform will not be

enough to satisfy the demands of the people,
They want to have a perfect out-and-out dec-
laration of principles. sney have had enough
of the backing§and filling. This is not tobe the
convention of 1896 any more than it is to be
the convention of 1892, Fvery National Con-
vention must write its own platform, This
convention will do so, Of course the plate
form is, so far as it relates to the currency ques-
tion, written already. It will repeat Col.
ory an’s views. I emphatically think that

a specific declaration for ae free coinage of
silver at 16 to 1 will be inserted in the platform.
Mr. Bryan has stated his views on that ques-
tion distinctly in his recent utterances and
writings, and it is known to all that he is abso-
lutely in favor of such a declaration. His
desires will undoubtedly be respected by the
convention in this matter as in others

Senator Pettigrew laughed at ex-Senator
HLL and his visit to Col. Bryan. “Hill,” he
said, “went to Lineoln to get a bone, He
hadn't ac hip with which to get into the game,
and he had to have some or else they wouldn’ t
let him play. But after this convention,"
continued Senator Pettigrew sertously, “the
Democratic party will stand on the Kansas
Mty platform and not on the Chicago platform
or on any other, Therefore, there should he
no possibility of any misconstruction of the

latform or any of its planks, and I believe
hat it will be distinct, manly, straightforward
and honest,

 

JUDGE VAN WYCK’'S PLATFORM,

Unremitting War Against Trusts and Impe-
rialism—Tarif? Reform,

Kansas City, July 2.-The New York State
delegation will caucus at their headquarters to-
morrow night in the Hotel Midland. It has
already beer practically decided to make the
Hon. Norman E. Mack of Buffalo Democratic
National Committeeman for the State, to siuc-
ceed the Hon. Frank Campbell of Bath. There
has been no decision as to who should represent
the State on the Committee on Resolutions. It
has been said that ex-Gov. Hill is to be the man,

and then again it has been declared that ex-
Supreme Court Justice Van Wyck is to be the
man. Mr. Van Wyck handed out to-night a
prepared statement of his views as to just what
the platform should contain, Here it is:

“In reaffirming the principles declared in the
platform adopted four years ago, we recognize
the new questions that have arisen in the mean-
time and are not to be understood as turning
our faces from the problems that now most
urgently confront the country to those which,
though rightly emphasized by the Chicago Con-
vention, have been for the present somewhat
shorn of the urgency by the course of recent
events. When the very life of free institutions
is at stake, wo think it incumbent upon all
patriots to waive their lesser differences to the

end that the united strength may be exerted
against the common enem 'o thechecking,
sub ue and uprooting of the plutocratic re-
viv. 5 fevealiom, by which individual enter-
priae an iberty alike are peing stricken down
in every side throughout the land, we unquali-
edly pledge the Pemocratic party. In the
nation, inthe several States and in every munici-
pality, the Democracy, through all its organiza-
fons, will wage unremitting war for the stamp-
ing out of these conspiracies to reéstablish, un-
der the forme of trade, the power of the few to
rule and rob the many. If the laws already
on the statute books be found inadequate to the

work before us, we shall enact laws that will
itof no excuse for official inactivity, though

n . meantime it is manifest that th here has
nm @ much greater desire er by our

 

hey 8 th which to strike
hem tee. Se aoe and honest labor

ve & common i 1B this relation and the

mocra as it always che
remember Se uty “to both, ve le He prossowns
with unsparing severity the acon pluto-
cracy which has reared itse! y, Upo!
the spoils of industry and the st jon ol
government.

“We make a clear distinction between ex-
pansion and Supe rialism. By the former we
mean that just demand of a rapidly growing
people, distinguished in the highest degree
or skill in mantfactures, euterprise in corn-
merce and unrivalled capacity in agriculture,
for access to ever enlarging markets, while
oy te latter we mean that un-American spirit
which would identify our flag with ore ranny,
repudiate the principles upon which the Re nub
lic was founded, and commit us to the abhor-
rent task of stifling with the bayonet the nat-
ural aspirations of weaker communities for
liberty. There are necessary measures to
taken, alike in the Philippines and China, for
the maintenance of the commercial interests
of this Republic, as well as for the effective
exercise of our naval and military authority
in the Pacific Ocean, and there the Democratic
party, without violating any _ principle,
either of our own Declaration of Independence
or the rights of other peuple, will not hesitate to
take a stand; but we protest against the mons-
trous pretence that in order to secure the ob-
jects here indicated we must invalidate our
own claim to culepenes as a nation.

“Tariff reform is called for over the entire
circle of our aosoalled protected industries,
With the spectacle presented of our iron and
other specially favored barons successfully
competing in foreign fields against all comers,
while exacting here at home, under cover of
the monopoly secured to them by the tariff,
much larger prices than the same goods are
offered for in distant lands, it cannot be neees-
sary to argue at length against, the fallacy of
the protectionism which has enabled its special
beneficiaries to amass more than princely
fortunes, without any advantage to the laborer,
The fleld of American enterprise is now world
wide. W here the farmer and the plantee
have long had to go with their products, therr
the manufacturers are also going, and it is a
mere mockery of reason to pretend in one
breath that we need access to the general mar-
kets of the globe, and in the next that without

srohibitive tariff our manufacturers would |

fail before the competition here at home of
‘arivess who cannot withstand them abroad.”

The New York delegation is controlled by
Richard. Croker, ex-Senator Murphy, Hug
MeLaughlin's lieutenants and the Erie county
dolegates, and they can refuse to make Mr.
Hill a member of the Committee on Resolutions

they so desire, The Rensselear county
Democrats, the borough of Manhattan Indians
and the Kings county men have grappled to
themselves with hooks of steel the Erie county
aoe ites by making Mr. Mack the National
Committeeman for the State, and this com-
bination controls the delegation here, It was
said to-night that Mr. Hill had been selected
to represent the Committee on Resolutions,
Mr, Croker said that there was no truth in this
report and that nothing definite would be de-
cided until the delegation meets to-morrow
night.

THE NATIONAL CHAIRMANSHIP,

Senator Jones Says He Is Not a Candidate,
but Would Accept if Re-elected,

Kansas Crry, July 2.—Candidates for the
chairmanship of the Democratic National Com-
mittee, which will be chosen at the convention
this week, are nearly as numerous as are the
aspirants for the Vice-Presidential nomina-
tion, Senator James K. Jones of Arkansas, the
present head of the committee, is anxious to
hold on tothe place. His friends urge that he
should be kept in the place because of his ex-
perience gained in the management of the cam-
paign of 1896, and also because of the fact agg
he is very jutimato with Col, Bryan and is in |
thorough sympathy with all of the Nebraskan's
ideas about politics and statesmanship. Sena-
tor Jones says himself that he is merely a recep-
tive candidate and that he does not want to
make a fight for the place. In fact, he says he
doesn’t want {t unlegs there is a unanimous call
from the committee to take it. Speaking of
this he said:

‘If the National Committee should see fit to
offer me the post again, Lshould not refuse it,
1 do not believe that any loyal Democrat should
refuse to assume the responsibility which the
post entails. Iam not a candidate for it, but if
the National Committee should reélect me I
will serve and be glad to lend whatever efforts
I can toward bringing about the success of the
ticket throughout the campaign.”

Senator Jones's friends declare that Col.
Bryan is in favor of the reelection of the
Arkaneas statesman. Johnson, the Ohio
millionaire and single taxer, is another
candidate. Mr. Johnson takes a erm

jeasure in managing political campaigns m™
ast -xperienoe in that line was in the New Yor

Mayoralty campaign of 1897, when he had entire
charge of the canvass of the late Henry George,
whose intimate friend he was. Mr. Johnson
has the backing of the Ohio delegates, and the
fact that he has a large bundle of money which
he is willing to use in furthering the cause has

| attracted the favorable attenGon of a nuinber
| of delegates from other States. Then Thomas
id. Taggart of Indiana is generally charged with |

an auibition to succeed Senator Mr.

Taggart says that this isn’t 60, but ex-Gov.

Altgeld of Illinois, in speaking to-day of the
with jrawal of Shiveley from the Vice-Presi-
dential race, declared that in hie opinion Mr.
‘Taggart was anxious to get the place, and was
willing to sacrifice any other Judiana ambition
in order to gratify his own,

ALTGELD ON THE VICE-PRESIDENCY.

He Doesn't Think Salzer Will Get the Nomi-
nation—Speaks Highly of Towne,

Kansas City Mo., July 2,—Ex-Gov. John P,
Altgeld of Illinois, who arrived here to-day
in advance of the State delegation, said this
afternoon that he and all his friends in Illinois
were in favor of nominating for Vice-Presi-
dent the man who would bring to the ticket
the greatest strength, regardless of what seo-
tion of the country he came from.

“We have no candidate,” sald Mr. Altgeld,
“All we want to do ia to figd out who the strong-
est man will be and nominate him. I hardl
think that Sulzer will get. the nomination y
am told that he is very confident, but I think
that the question depends on the action of the
New York State delegation.”

“Is his Dame to be presented by the New
York delegation?”

“ft am told that it is not. If New York's
delegates, united and firm, should go before
the eonvention and demand his nomination
he would probably get it, because the State
has a right to demand something and its re-
queats would be received and treated with
respect. But if itetandsaside and says of his
candidacy, ‘Yes, we will vote for him if the

convention demands t,’ do not think that he
fas a very good chance. Whoever is the
strongest man, he should be nominated, 4s
to Senator Hill’s name being mentioned,
not think that he wants it. Hl is not the tn
of a map who would take it. No, Hill would
not take it.”

“How about Towne?” was asked,

“Towne w hg us among a great

\GOLF AMATEURS AT WORK.

SCORE DAY IN THE CHAMPIONSHIP
OVER THE GARDEN CITY LINKS.

Travis Leads the Field With 166—Second
Place fer Watson With 160 and Stillman
Next in Lime at 195—Sterling Play by
Younger Set of Homebreds—Cards in Full

Walter J. Travis led the field in the
qualifying round of the U. 8. G. A. ama-
teur championship yesterday at Garden
City with 166. A. C. Watson, Jr., followed
him with 169 and then came James A. Stillman,
dJr., with 175, All have learned their game in
this country. Findlay Douglas, the St. An-
drews trained player and an amateur
champion of 1898, made 181 and A. G.
Lockwood, the f£nglishman, scored 179.
Friends of the homebred players were naturally
well pleased, for the leaders had shown very
good golfing for the 6,134-yard course, which,
with every tee back to the limit and turf very
hard through parts of the fair green, was by na |
means easy to negotiate. The amateur record |
of 81 was established by Travis for the single
round and his total was also a record.

Another feature of the round was tne promi-
nence of the younger set. The Metropolitan
interscholastic winner, Harry Hollins, Jr., and
the runner-up to him, C. H. Seeley. forced their
way into the chosen division, while of the col-
lege boys the year's champion, Percy Pyne,
end, G. G. Hubbard, FE. M. Byers, T. M. Robert-
son, John Stuart, Stuart Stickney, C. Tiffany
Richardson and Charles Hitchcock, Jr., earned
a place in the ranks. Louis Livingston
gained his firat honors in a national event.
Allan Kenneday, who first showed a strong
game at Nassau, wes another to qualify. The
others were of the older set, who are always in
the running at a tournament of any sort.
Many of the old guard, alus! were missing at
the end of the fray, but there were also a score
of youngsters hopelessly lost, including G. Owen
Winston, of whem much had been hoped. Some
of the short drivers of the old school were in-
clined to be revereon the long carries de-
manced from many of tho tees, but the lusty

whackers of the ball received their medicine in
silence,

The U. officials who managed the
‘eurhenenk Bod Thomas, Chatfleld-Taylor,
Heebner and Kerr, made a record, too. Thanks
to th ir zeal the 103 players, the lnrgoet fleld to
sturt in an amateur event, wereall off by 11:1
o'clock, and the last afternoon card was poste:
up by Go'cock. All the details were pensece
on the part of the Garden ay Golf Club in quite
as clever a way. For the first time the
scores were promptly on the bulletin board
which was rai to prevent the crowdin of
those who had to copy them. For the comfort
of the players there were baths ene lockers
galore, hot or cold luncheons at al hows, and
plenty of seats and chairs for the on lookers
near the starting tee and the home green.

Medal play. lacks the fascination that attracts

a gallery’ like the match game, yet there waa
sered turnout of golfing enthusiasts, women
and men. The weather was charming, the
breeze only tempering the heat, and quite a
number of anivals from town swelled the
crowd in the afternoon

“City? Where isthe city?’ eald one of the
late visitors, as he stepped from the train.
“Garden City seems an incongruous name for
such a pretty place. The distant links, the lake
and pleasant groves, the cluster of villas In the
shadow of the cathedral, al] this deserves a
more apprenries name In Eng eland, aa 4 ca-
thedral town, we would call it arden Min-
ster.’

Rut this is of only incidental interest. What
golfers the world over will be better pleased to
foad, was thefact that Willle Campbell, Scot-

nd's noted match player, was on the Inks aa
caddie for Lockwood, and in white flannels he
looked aa young and omens as when
he was the player most to be feared on
the links, _ Alex Findlay caddied for Watson,

Good-natured rivalry was the spirit that
governed the players as they stood on the first
tee, After the morning some were sorrel, gad
others Leer yet hope was supreme. Altge
