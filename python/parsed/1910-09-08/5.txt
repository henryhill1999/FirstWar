The Reduced Republican Pluratity
in Vermont.

Contizuity inclines beth parties in
Vermont to reciprocity with Canada
The business line dividing the State
from the Dominion is impalpable. Ca-
nadian «iver is almost as abundant in
Vermont as United States coins, and
everywhere it passes current. In the
national sense there is no Republican
insurgency in Vermont. But there was
insurgency against Dr. Jonn A. Mrap
of Rutland, a gentleman with a well

filled purse and an inordinate ambition —

to become Governor.

Months ago Dr. Meap served notice
that he wanted the Republican nomina-
tion, and it was so well understood that
he was prepared to be liberal in realiz-
ing his ambition that, to the credit of the
Vermont Republicans, there was spir- |
ited criticism of his plans) Dr. Mean,
Was pot the only aspirant. but he pre- |
vyaied handsomely. His personal tri-|
umph rankled, and a survey of the vote
east on Tuesday shows that many Re-!
publicans refused to go to the polis. |
In Vermont as a rule Republicans avoid |
voting for a Democrat. When they in- |
surge it is in the direction of the woods. |
Democrats have voted tn great numbers |
for « Republican, as in 1906, when the
party indorsed General CLEMENT, the)
dashing reformer who affected “dress
suits’ and parlor cars as 4 campaigner
and who was beaten on the prohibition
issie by only 15.420 votes, his opponent
beine a son of Senator Proctor.

What part the high cost of living |
plaved in the Vermont campaign we |
don't know. Probably it was negligi- |
ble. as the folks there have well pro |
vided boards, if not wealth. Ther ase,
for reciprocity with Canada, and other-
wise the tariff 1s not an issue, All re-|
ports agree that the main issue in the)
campaign was Dr. Mean. Topica dis-
cussed on the stump related only to

The Right to Fortify the Canal.

General J. Warren KEIrer is re-
ported by the New York Herald as say-
ing at Paris on Tuesday last:

” The treaty actually in force Is that of Novem
ber. 1991. drawn by Mr Mav and Lord Parwcr
pore, which supersedes the Clayton Bulwer
treaty. It eapressiy forbids the fortification of
the Panama Canal in terms similar to those of
the Suez Cana! treaty of 1808 1888) It was pre-
sented for ratification to the Senate by Mr Rooes-
TRLT himself. who then must have approved its
provisions

This treagy. which wae accepted by both
countries. is now in full force. The fact that Mr

in recent years has been:

Yards Value.

| 1907 15.917,068 980,754

| 1908 17,825,742 | 45.080
1908 21,080.454 1278.
1910 12,875.96 a2 stg

| Manufacturers of boots and shoes have
, been commendably enterprising. Sales
in 1905 show a value of $1,322,000, while
1910 sales amounted to $2,058,103. In
iron and stee! and the manufactures
thereof this country holds a long lead
over its competitors, and the increase has
| been about all that could be expected.
| Shipments of lard, one of the chief arti-
\ clea of export to Cuba, have increased
in quantity and value. The sales of 1910
were 33,000,000 pounds, valued at $4,000.00,
in comparison with 1995 seles of 24,000,000
pounds, valued at §1,800.000. There was
‘also a business last year of 82,276,000 in
lard compounds and substitutes for lard.
| Most of the articles on the export list,
| including lumber, furniture, naval stores,
hacon, electrical appliances. agricul-
tural implements, &c., show fluetuation
from vear to year rather than marked
| increases. The American share of Cuba's
{total imports averages a little less than
|) per cent Proper attention to the
conditions and the requirements of th
market would soon increase the share
to 70 per cent or more
There are certain little clouds on Cuba's
_ Political horizon and the elections to be
held this fall] may bring on a political
crisis, but the present indications are
| that another big sugar crop will be made
| next winter and that good prices will be
received by the planters. Too mucn
| money is taken from the people and tho
| industries by the Government, but the ex-
perience of the late Government of inter.
vention deprives Americans of al! right
leo criticise the Cuban Administration on
that score. Receipts for the fiscal year
1910 are reported by the Cuban Treasury
| Department as $27,439,979, exclusive of
‘borrowings. This ig about $7,000.00 in
excess of a reasonable requirement
