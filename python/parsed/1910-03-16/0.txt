necessary Wo 4 Gaynen, Mayor

After reading the ictter the Commis-
sioner said he would get the information
for the Mayor and forward it to him as
soon as possible. It probably will take
him two or three days.

It ia the opinion of the Mayor that
men who travel around in couples tn plain
olothes are responsible for a great amount
of the grafting which is done by the po-
lice. From the moment he entored the
City Hall Mr. Gaynor has given a great
part of his attention to the police situa-
thon and from the beginning of the year

he has beén mapping out plans for put- |
tang the department on a basis that will |

tend to do away with the corruption,
which he dors not hesitate to say infests
it stilt deepite efforts in recent years to

improve things

One part of the system that the Mayor
ie aiming to cope with is the evile arming
from the ramblings of plain clothes men
who, although nominally asmagned to
epecial duty, seem to spend most of their
time, according to information which
has come to the Mayor, in preying on
saloon keepers. These men on Sundays
end in hours when saloons ere supposed
to be closed make a practice of dropping
ito a saloon and after calling for drinks
addenty flashing their badges on the
eaicon keeper and inviting him to put
on his coat and go to the police stauon.

Havt got that far. the Mayor has
been . the plain clothes men hint
that it is their day off, that they don't
wish to put themselves to trouble unnec-
easarily and tha if the saloon keeper is
willing to equare the matter they would
be willing to drop it

Mayor Gaynor, it is umilerstood has
information and affidavitea of a iarge
volume of cases where saloon heeper
rather than [ace police court proceedings
and risk cancellation of ther licenses
pay over $10, $15 or $20 to prevent being
lugged off to cour’ Such saloon men
have come to look upon the payment
of from $10 to $20 a month as a reguier
contribution to the police for being al
lowed to keep open on Sundays and after
hours.

The payment of these sume i6 apart
from the subscriptions which the saloon
men make to their district branches
of the liquor dealers’ associations, sh-
scriptions which, it has been reported
go in part to precinct police officials to
prevent interference by uniformed men
The day of the collection of levies from
the saloons by wardmen is past. There
ie no such thing now as precinct detec
tives, but there are in exch precinet from
two to eight men assigned by the captain
to plain clothes duty They can be kept
out of uniform for onty twenty-four
hours except by special permission ob
tained by the captain from Headquarters
or from his inepector

But while thie rule was made to do
away with the evile of (he old precinet
detective system it has been told to the
Mayor that some of the men who are
temporarily assigned to duty in ervilan
clothes. now that they are no longer
expected to collect for their superors,
have the grafting scheme of their own
just desenbed.

The Mayor has !~en told that these
men never play the game in their own
precineta, but go to some territory where
they are not known and work the trick
by threatening the saloon keeper with
arrest after they have tasted the liquor
served to them Alrhough Mayor (ay-
por = net prepared for the moment to
talk much about thie phase of his in-
vestigation, it ie understood that he has
efidavits from many saloon keepers show -
ine that they have been victimized

It iw what the Mevor hes learned fram
the saloon keepers themselves that led
him to write the letter he sent yesterday
to Commissoner Baker |t i his opin-
jon that when a policeman goes out of
his OWN precinct to make an excise arrest
the chances are that he does not go out
of a high sense of duty

Another purpose that the Mayor has—

um seeking informauion i to ascertain

if the shortage of patroimen of which |

Commuesoner Faker is complaining can
not be met to some extent by putting 4
large proportion of the plain clothes
men back into uniform and on sidewalk
duty. According to information in the
Citw Fall at least 500 men are awigned
Deen clothes work in the precincts.
The Mayor beheves there is no need for
such a large number, thar haif of them
could return (o patrol duty without any
decrease in the efficiency of the precinct
commanders

The Mayor's letter surprised the pohee
For several days it had been the opinion

passed the union leaders do not take
ieuch «a hopeful view of the situation.
| Both sides assert that they will not yield
fon the disputed points, whieh really in-
| volve a question of jurisdiction between
| the firemen and the engineers, and if they
adhere to their positions the mediations
of Mr Knapp and Mr. Neill may prove
futile. In anv event there i no im-
| mediate danger of the strike order being
issued while negotiations are under way.
Formal communications were ex-
| changed to-day between the managers
and the firemen, the former notifying
the men that they had invoked the aid
lof the Erdman law to avert a confiiet.
(In the reply sent the managers Mr. Car-
ter vaed the following language
ormmittee again insists that aetde
from the interests of the public there are
ne other parties concerned in this dispute
except the ratlwave represented by the
managers’ committee and the employees
represented by our comrnittee

The paragraph wae intended to inreem
the managers that a plea of com-
tracts made with the locomotive engineers
would have no weight with the firemen
The managers have insisted that to grant
the demanda of the firemen would be @
breach of contract with the engineers.
which they are anxious to avoid.

Mr. Carter anid that the date for the
strike to take effect had been set at a
conference early this morning, but that
it would not be made public in view of
the Federal intervention He saidit was
not more than four days ahead, but the
tume would be extended if necessary
_ He addeds

We have shown a disposition to be fair
and reasonable in this controversy from the
frat and we could not refuse the mediation
sought by the managers We do not wish
to ineenventence the public and would
prefer to see an amicable agreement, but
from the present attitude of the genera,

postponed rather than averted

Said ©. L. Dickeson of the Burlington,
speaking for the general managers:

There is po reason toanticipare a strike.
We have felt confident from the first
that matters would work out ai! right in
the end and have made no preparations
‘or a strike because we feel that none will
be called
