ERIE RAILWAY COMPANY.

By the agreement dated January 1, 1896, under
which the above-mentioned Stock Trust Certif-
cates were issued, \t was provided, among other
things, that on the first day of December, 1900,
if the Erle Railroad Company should then have
pald four per cent. cash dividend In one year on
its First Preferred Stock, and, if not, then so soon
as such dividend should be pald,
Trustees, in exchange for, and upon surrender of,
Stock Trust Certificates then outstanding, would
deliver proper certificates of atock of the Erle
Rallroad Company.

On January 19, 1904, the Roard of Directors de-
clared a semi-annual dividend of two per cent.
upon the First Preferred Stock, payable February
29, 1004, The payment of this dividend betng,
the second dividend of two per cent. pald during
the year, fulfils the condition Iimiting the period
of the Voting Trust as above set forth, and It
therefore becomes the duty of the Voting Trustees
to arrange for the delivery of stock of the Erle

-Ratiroad Company in exchange for the Stock Trust
Certificates now outstanding.

In view of the present situation the holders of
important interests In the property have strongly
urged us to arrange for an extension of the Voting
Trust for a further period of five years, during
which it ts hoped that most of the important de-
velopments of the property which are now in con-
templation can be completed.

Inasmuch as the earnings of the property have
now reached a point where the dividend, upon
which the continuation of the Voting Trust was
limited, could be safely pald, we have felt that
our obligation had been fulfilled and that we were
entitled to be relieved from further responsibillty~
Considering, however, the urgency of the request,
we have deemed It our duty to bring the matter to
the attention of the present holders of the Stock
tTrust Certificates,

We therefore give notice that on and after
the first day of May, 1904, the Voting Trust
terminates and we shall cease to transfer the
present Voting Trust Certificates.

We also give notice that, if before that date,
holders of a sufficient amount of the present
Voting Trust Certificates shall have signified
heir desire that the Voting Trust be extended
for the period of five years, say until May 1,
1909, we will consent to such extension, and
will arrange so to extend the agreement for

Due notice will be given in
order that the present Stock Trust Certificates
may be presented for stamping or for ex-
change into new extended certificates, as may
be determined.

Holders of Stock Trust Certificates who desire
to have the Voting Trust extended should signify
such desire without delay to Messrs. J, P. Mor-
gan & Co., 23 Wall St., New York, stating num-
bers and amounts of certificates held.

Holders not desiring to unite tn extending the
Voilng ‘Trust will upon surrender of their Voting
Trust Certificates be entitled to recetve in ex-
change certificates for stock of the Erie Rallroad
Company, a5 soon as the same are prepared, of
which due notice will be given.
