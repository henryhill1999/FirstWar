Rervano, Mareh 3.—The police have
fix y attention on one person as the
muriercr of E. L. Burdick, who was beaten
to deat) in his home on Ashland avenue
laat iveday night,

| .1-picion points toward a woman
w yme is in the Kémwood district and
wise oe oer they have investigated from
her childhood

Ge) William 8. Bull, the Superintendent
ef Police, to-night gave the most important
ma'emeut made since the tragedy. Here-
tofore he has declined jfractioally to say
anything. He spoke after he had had a
long conference with Patrick V. Cusack,
ihe chief of detectives. He said:

*While I have not taken an active part in
the work, I have left it to Mr. Cusack. He

has reported to me fully. Mr. Cusack
has Welle defined theories and he has es-
tablished the motive. I gave my ideas to

Mr. Cusack as to the motives that led up
to (ve murder and told him who I suspectea
commited the crime. He took my sug-
gestous, put them with the facts, theories
and iaformation he has had in hand, and
he came to the same conclusion I did.

“Wh ls we think we could make an arrest
in safety, we prefer to wait and believe
that certain evidence we wish to gather
wi!) lead to successful results.”

“Will an arrest be made?” the Superin-
tenden' was asked.

“Yeo, but T eannot say when it will come.
Nor until we have enough evidence to justify
jt When we have that we will feel that
we have enough to convict.”

That is the police situation in a nutshell.
They do not wish to make a move in the
way of an arrest until they can convict
their prisoner of Burdick's murder.

The social prominence of the victim and
of those whose names have come into the
case account for this unusual caution. The
police know where their suspect can be
found at any hour.

They expect the arrest will cause a sensa-
tion, even in case the prisoner is a person
whore name has already been prominent
in the mystery, and they expect a terrific
legal battle afterward.

District Attorney Coatsworth went to
Albany last night to attend the hearing of
Sheriff Kaiser, but he was at home early
this evening and ready to ®ontinue work
on the murder case. He had two confer-
ences with Mr. Cusack to-night.

“I reiterate,” said Mr. Coatsworth, “that
1 believe the murderer was alone in the
yoom. whan the crime wes committed.
Whether the murderer is a man or woman
i will not say. But I will say that the
mourderer at the time of the crime was
@lone with the murdered man.”

WOMAN TELEPHONED BURDICK.

The police have found out the name of
the woman who called up Burdick on the
telephone the afternoon on which he was
killed. She is Mrs. Seth T. Paine of Elm-
wood avenue, the dentist's wife, who has
been twice examined by the District At-
torney

“Yos, I called up Mr. Burdick that after-
fhoon,” she said to-day. “It was in response
to a telephone message from him the night
before and related exchusively to social
efaire. It had no relation to any appoint-
ment with him at any time.”

‘The chief of detectives Mr. Cusack, said:

“Mrs. Paine is not under arrest. There
Se) lenty of time for her to be set right
Mf who has been made public does not
@em to do her justice. I do not, at this
lime, core to pass judgment upon what
the hes told us.”

Then, turning to a genera! view of the case,
Mr Cusack said:

“lam as firmly convinoed as evér that
t vas a wornan who killed Burdick This
Yonsn was pot a woman of the street,
tither, She was a woman of some social
banding probably one of the set in which
Burdick moved.”

“What was her motive?”

“To hueh up and end forever the scandal
Which would have resulted from the trial
of (he divorce case whieh Burdick brought
agein' his wife, and to which she replied
by charging Lim with offences against
the marriage tie) Bome woman took this
Means to prevent the advertisement of
ber character to the world. Women do
eBtracrdinary things when they are aroused
4 bad woman & worse than a bad man ”

other acts, extinguish the gas light.

The finding of a chair directly under the
gas jot, a place where it did not belong,
indicates that the murderer put out the
gas as he or she was about to depart, know-
ing that this would leave the room in gloom
until well along in the morning. The
shades had been drawn since Thursday
evening.

The assistant medical examiner, Dr.
Howland, told Tae Sun man to-day that
when he arrived at the house, between 8
and 9 o'clock on Friday morning, and stood
at the coor of the smoking room, the dark-
ness within was almost impenetrable. It
could be discerned that something of bulk
was upon the couch, but no part of the
body was so exposed as to be seen in the
semi-darkness.

This was as much as Mrs. Hull, Burdick's
mother-in-law, had seen when she stood
irresolute at the door and said: “Maggie,
have you got the nerve to go in there?”

LIFE INSURANCE TO MRS. BURDICK.

Charles E. Parke, who was Burdick’'s
associate in the Burdick Envelope Com-
pany, said to-day that the dead man's !ife
was insured for about $25,000, Early in his
business career he took out some small
policies and these have been added to from
time to time. The largest policy is for
$10,000, and Burdick's wife is named as the
beneficiary. It is probable that all the
policies are made payable to Mrs. Burdick.

After deciding to sue his wife for a divorce
Burdick changed his will so that nearly all
of his property would fall to his children
and none of it to his wife, but this precau-
tion did not extend to the life insurance
policies, and as the matter stands to-day
Mrs. Burdick will get about $25,000 from
them.

Friends of Burdick say that they think
he meant to substitute the names of his
children for that of his wife in these policies,
but he delayed too long.

ELMWOOD CEUB'S DANCE.

In spite of the unsavory notoriety that
has been thruat upon the Elmwood Dancing
Club by the disclosures following the mur-
der, the club, among whose members are
the couples known as “the Burdick circle”
has decided to go on with the series of sub-
ecription dances and one of these was
held at the Elmwood School, private
institution, to-night.

When MPistrict Attorney Coatsworth
said that there had been several divorce
suits in the circle “and perhaps there ought
to be more,” some of the members talked
of disbanding. Eventually the pendulum
ewung the other way, the club deciding
that not to dance would be unwise.

One of the members of the club said to-
night:

“The club has been running for ten years
and has had over 100 members. In all
that time it has not had a single divorce
As to Pennell and Burdick, they paid their
subscriptions to the club this year, and
have not attended the meetings. Mr.
Burdick was there once with his daughter.
Mr. Pennell has been out of town most of

the time,.. of the club knew
nothing at divotae proceedings. except
by vaguest ruttiors. ;

The members of the club have arranged
to have a conference with District Attorney
Coatsworth to give him a chance to be-
come acquainted with the membership in
order that he may recast the opinion at-
tributed to him that there ought to be more
divorces in the club. The members, who
include some of the most sterling business
men in the city, @re tired of having the
club misrepresented.

SAYS BURDICK FEARED MURDER.

—_—~

Private Detective Tells of Work He Did
for the Buffalo Man.

John M. Boland, head of the Roland
Detective Agency at 220 Broadway, said
yesterday that he had been hired last fall
by lawyers acting for Edwin L. Burdick,
the man murdered in Buffalo, to dig out
evidence upon which Burdick might secure
a divorce

Mr. Boland and his assistants went to
work and learned many things in a pursuit
of Mrs. Burdick and A. P. Pennell, whom
Mr. Burdick accused of being too much in
Mrs. Burdick's company. Mr. Boland
made public a number of the letters which
pasaed betnver himaelf and Mr. Burdick,

which Mr. Burdick wrote freely of his
desire to secure adivorce on the eons
of his wife's relations with Pennell. rpland
also told of Mr. Burdick's admiasion that
he carried a revolver because a Buffalo
man had threatened to kill him.

DINNER TO OUR AMBASSADOR BY
PILGRIMS CLUB OF LONDON,

 

Speeches All Based on the Friendship Be-
tween Britain and the United States
—Karl Roberts Says Mr. Choate Has
Done Much to Promote It in Four Years

Special Cable Despatch to THE Sun.

Lonpon, March 3.—One of the highest
compliments ever paid to an American
Ambassador, and what, in some respects,
was the most successful Anglo-American
gathering ever held in London, was the
celebration, under the auspices of the
Pilgrims’ Club at the Hyde Park Hotel
to-night, of the completion of\four years
of service by Mr. Choate as thé American
representative at the Court of St. James.
A distinguished company of 190 persons,
about equally divided between English
and Americans, under the presidency of
Earl Roberts, Commander-in-Chief of the
British Army, dined and listened to one of
the most brilliant displays of after-dinner
eloquence that those present had ever
been privileged to enjoy.

Among those who attended were Stan-
ford Newel, American Minister at The
Hague; Lawrence Townsend, American
Minister to Belgium; Henry White, Secre-
tary of the American Embassy here; Capt.
Cassatt, American Military Attaché; Capt.
Clover, the Naval Attaché; Ean Halsbury,
Lord High Chancellor; Lords Kelvin, Reay,
Aberdeen, Cadogan, Strathcona, Grey, Hill-
ingdon, Kinnaird and Balfour. Justices
Collins, Darling and Poynter, Sir Lawrence
Alma-Tadema, Sir Alber: Rollit, Mr. Yerkes,
Mr. Gridler and Signor Marconi.

Earl Roberts proposed a toast to®*the
President of the most flourishing and most
enterprising republic the world has
ever seen, and to the King of that empire
on which the sun never seés.” This toast
was honored by the band playing “The
Star Spangled Banner,” and “God Save
the King.”

Earl Roberts then proposed a toast in
honor of Ambassador Choate. He de-
scribed his position as unlike that of all
other Ambassadors because he represented
the nation to which Great Britain is most
closely bound by ties of origin, language,
ideals, duty and responsibility.

Earl Roberts declared that nobody could
have used the gifts of power and influence
with wiser discretion and more generous
purpose than Mr. Choate, during whose
term the two peoples had learned to know
each other better, with the result that
mutual respect had daily grown.

Mr. Choate, in replying to the toast, made
@ humorously clever opening. which was
mainly occupied with graceful thanks and
compliments to the Pilgrims’ Club for the
compliments paid to him. He said he was
in full sympathy with the cardinal objects
of the Pilgrims’ organization, the promo-
tion of a better understanding between the
two countries. That, indeed, was part of
his constant duty under the President's
commission.

In paying tribute to Earl Roberts, whose
headship of the Pilgrims’ Club was a guar-
antee of sucoess—for wherever he lead
victory was certain -Mr. Choate remarked
that no warrior ever donned the garb of a
pilgrim with more grace than when the
foremost soldier laid aside the sword to
lead those around him to the great triumph
of peace, a lasting and abiding peace be-
tween the two nations whose fortunes and
future were inextricably bound together.
It was an indication to him and the world
that the greatest soldier is the greatest
peacemaker, and that the British and
American armies and navies will never
be turned against each other. Mr. Choate
added:

“Let me propose a reciprocity treaty to
Earl Roberts. I propose that he crogs the
Atlantic and dine with the Pilgrims* Club
of the United States. I can assure him a
warmer welcome than any Englishman
ever received, and if his digestion is equal
to his military powers, he will return the
favorite here of both nations.”

Congratulating the club upon its marked
avd sudden success, Mr. Choate said that
if herecalied Bunyan aright it was Goodwill
who opened the wicket gate to Christian,
and it was the good will of the two great
countries that had opened the wicket to
those Pilgrims on the road to victory
During his residence in Engiand he had
done what little he could to promote more
frequent interoourse between and better
knowledge of the two countries, but it was
not to him that the improvement in the
relations between the two nations in recent
years was due It was due in the first place,
he believed, tu the popular will on both
tides of the Atlantic, which will not permit
these countries to be dissevered in their
friendship

on side, so far as Governmental
action ls concerned, it ie due to Lord Balia-
bury and Lord Lansdowne, who by their
uniform candor, fairness and friendliness
in the treatment of every question that
hae arisen and by their careful considera

COURT FORBIDS A STRIKE.

e¢ Wabash Gets an Injunction Againet
Union Leaders.

St. Lovis, March 3.—The Wabash man-
agement checkmated the employees who
threatened to go out on a atriké to-day
by securing an injunction from Judge
Adams of the United States Circuit Court
against the heads of the Trainmen's Union,
as follows:

“We, therefore, do strictly command
you, until further order of the court, abso-
lutely to desist and refrain from in any
way or manner ordering, coercing, persuad-
ing, inducing or otherwise causing, direct-
ly or indirectly, the employees of the! said
Wabash Railway Company to atrike or
quit the service of said company.”

When the papers were given to the United
States Marshal to serve he found that the
committees had departed for the general
offices of the Wabash to notify the manage-
ment that the hour for the calling of a
strike had been extended till 6 o'clock.
When the members of the committess
returned to the hotel the legal papers were
served on them.

Shortly after 5 o'clock President Ramaey
notified the committees of the rejection of
their modified demands submitted to him.
His refusal was at once telegraphed to
employees along the line. ,

J.J. Hannan, Grand Master of the Broth-
erhood of Firemen, W. G. Lee of the Train-
men and Chief Conductor C, H, Wilkins
stated this evening that they would reapect
the order of the court and take no action
until a hearing had been had on the
injunction.

P. M. Arthur, Grand Chief of the Brother-

‘hood of Locomotive Engineers, arrived in

the city this afternoon. He denied that
his arrival had anything to do with the
Wabash trouble, but nevertheless his com-
ing has added another uncertain quantity
to the situation.

Late this afternoon President Ramsey
received a demand for a 10 per cent.
advance from trainmen and firemen e¢m-
ployed on the Buffalo division of the road.

President Ramsey says that the looo-
motive engineers and the conductors
will remain loyal to the road, and that
while a strike would doubtless embarrass
the road somewhat, he did not think that
it would entirely cripple traffic, as they
would endeavor to secure men to take
the places of the strikers.

The injunction issued by Judge Adams
is the most sweeping ever made againat
a labor organization, and the legal fight
will doubtless be watched with great
interest.

WHERE HAS THIS £100,000 GONE?

Two $80,000 Checks Frem the Lankensso
Estate Not Received by Legatecs.
PHILapgLPAia, March 8.—A controversy

has arisen over the disposal of tive $16,000,000

estate of the late John D. Lentenau, the

philanthropist-banker,; who died In 1001

leaving his fortune to the German Hos-

pital and the Mary J. Drexel Hume. The
vice-president of th» former inatitutien,

Col. M. Richards Mucklé, says that neither

oc arity bas as yet received any of the money.

To this George Sergeant, the only living

executor, replies that he sent checke of

$50,000 each to the institutions on Jan. 20,

last, and offered them as much ro *.

Col. Muckle’s story was told to the Appro-
priations Committee of the House of Repre-
sentatives in Harrisburg last week. He
was there to plead for the 850,000 for the
Gerinan Hospital as an aid from the State
Treasury, and during his recital went into
details as to the financial condition of the
institution. He said that the Lanihenau
estate was held up because of a dispute
as to the fees of the executors. C. A. Moer-
wag was originally one of the latter, but
his death left Mr, Sergeant in full control

In reciting to-day his former story, Col
Muckle said that the German Hospital for
a long time has been running far behind in
ite revenues. The deficit his been about
$40,000 a year and this was always made
good from Mr. Lankenau's purse while he
lived. Since his death the officials have been
compelled to borrow money to keep up the
great monument of his charity.

BRICKS FOR NON-UNION WEN.

The reserves of the West Sixty-eighth

POPE'S STRENGTH HOLDS OUT.

HE GOES THROUGH THE ANNI-
VERSARY CELEBRATION.

 

 

“After To-day, | Can Die Happ),"' He Says
—Votce Weak When He Gives the Bene-
diction—Crowd of 80,000 at Mt. Peter's
for the Mass Cry ‘Long Live the Pepe.”

Special Cable Despatch to THE Son.

Rome, March 3.—The papal mass in ob-
servance of the twenty-fifth anniversary
of the coronation of Pope Leo XIIT, was
celebrated this morning amid the greatest
enthusiasm. His Holiness was carried to
St. Peter's in the Sedia Gestatoria in the
midst of a group of forty-four Cardinals.

Many ecclesiastics from all parts of the
world had assembled at the entrance of
the church. The approach of the Pontiff
was heralded by the blowing of ailver trum-
pets. There ‘was a faint sound of singing,
which gradually swelled until his Holiness
came into view, held high above ths crowd.
He was followed by the famous choir of
adult male trebles.

The crowd at the Basilica of St. Peter's
was estimated at 90,000. This enormous
crowd greeted the Pontiff with cries of
“Long live the Pope!”

Immediately afier the oeremony the
Pope returned to the Vatican. The pag-
eant was marred somewhat by a downpour
of rain.

Forty-four Cardinals and 315 Bishops
were present at the ceremony. A notable
feature was the English delegation, headed
by the Duke of Norfolk and several other
Catholic peers. All the bells of the 493
churches in Rome were rung for half an
hour.

The Pope appeared to be in good
health, although he was pale and his voice
was hoarse. He showed no sign of weak-
ness otherwise. Before leaving his apart-
ment he said, with evident emotion, * After
to-day I can die happy.”

The Pope, in reply to the Duke of Nor-
folk's salutation, pronounced a special
benediction.

The benediction was given in a weak
voice. During the service the Pope twice
partook of a cordial.

It is interesting to note that the flabelli,
the immense feather fans carried immedi-
ately behind the Pope, were the gift of an
American, Mrs. Drexel, who obtained the old
ones for a museum in Philadelphia. The
flabelli have been carried in Papal proces-
sions for at least a thonsand years. Their

BABY WASN'T MRS. MARTIN'S.

Norse Says a Midwife Get the Child for
Ker.

The efforts of Dr. John McLeod Martin,
the Boston physician, to prove that the
baby girl alleged by his wife to be hers was
not born to her are likely to result in the
arrest of Mrs. Martin and of Mrs. Lana
hi-kert, the midwife who filed the birth
certificate saying that the baby was Mrs.
Martin's.

Dr. Martin and his attorney, Champe
8. Andrews, have been investigating Mrs.
Riekert’s career for the last few weeks.
Early in February, as the result of sleuthing,
done largely by a cousin of the doctor,
the lawyer learned that the midwife had
made a false certificate of birth in another
case last July. In that case a baby was
entered on the Healih Department records
as (Catherina Dorathea Lubkert. Mra.
Katherina Lubkert of 848 Bast 117th street
was found, and she said that she had ob-
tained the baby from Mre. Riekert: and
that the midwife had made out the certi-
ficate and fied i

MRS. MAYBRICK TO BE FREED?

Report That the British Ambassador Has
Se Notified Our Government.

Ricimonp, Va., March 3.--It was re-
ported here to-day that Mra. Florence Cc,
Maybrick would be released from Ai's-
worth prison in England May 1, 1904. The
tidings were brought here by representa-
tives of the imprisoned woman, who is
a party to 4 suit involving a million acres
of land in southwest Virginia and other
States. The information that she would
be freed after spending thirteen years in
prison for the murder of her husband came,
it wae said, from the State Depariment at
Washington, having been communicated,
it is underatood, by the British Ambasador.

The land in question was deeded away
by Mra. Maybrick on the evening of her
conviction in consideration of $10,000. The
suit pending here is to upset the agreement,
and, it is said by Mvs. Maybrick's represen-
tatives that whe will be released in time
to appear as a witness.

WIRE COILS AROUND A CAR.

Spectacular Display Follows an Accident
on the Unton Ratiway Line.

Passengers on a Union Railway trolley
car iad an exciting time last night when the
feed wire got jammed between the wheol
and axle of the trolley pole and was torn
down. The accident happened at 134th
street and Third avenue, and as ‘ar north
as 138th street the wires on both the north
and southbound tracks were torn down.
The wires, recoiling, wrapped around
the car, imprisoning the passengers, many
of whom were women.

For about ten minutes there was the
finest kind of an electrical display. Sparks
flew in all directions and the wires fell on
other cars coming up. Flashes of blue
flame almost enveloped the first car, and
the front and back doors were closed by
a wire which had wound itself around the
car.

Peter Sullivan, the motorman of this
car, was knocked unconscious. The con-
ductor, James Hahns, was blinded for al-
most an holr. One woman in the car
fainted, but was soon revived. ‘The repair
wagon was called, and the crew, wearing
rubber gloves, cut the wires around the
car.

When the repair men were cutting the
wire an end dropped, striking the handle
of the motor box on the back platform.
There was a shower of sparks which dazed
the conductor, who had refused to leave
the car.

It took about an hour to repair the wires.

HOLD-UP BY AN ARMLESS MAN.

With a Revolver in His Toes, He Forces
Faro Dealer to Give Him 665.

* Butte, Mon., March 3.—The most sensa-
tional and novel hold-up known in the West
was perpetrated about 5 o'clock this morn-
ing when Charies Payne, an armless man,
entered the Catifornia Club at the corner of
Main and Broadway, and with a revolver
held between the toes of his right foot
compelled a faro dealer named Richards to
return to him $5 which he had lost during
the night.

There were only a few players in the room
at the time and they made a rush for the
doors, when Payne swung his gun into
action. Richards begged him not to shoot
and Payne said all he wanted was the return
of $5 which he had lost. That was cheer-
fully returned to him and he hopped out
of the club while keeping the dealer covered
with his gun

The robbery was not reported to the
police till this evening, and aftor Payne
had been arrested for taking a shot at
another man in a boarding house later in
the day. He resisted arrest and tried to
cut the officers with a razor which he held
between his toes He was overpowered,
disarmed and taken to jail

Payne was formerly a vaudeville per-
former, but has been out of engagements
for more thana year because of diasipaticn
and war said to have been crazed with
drink at the time of the robbery and
shooting

~~ PRICE TWO CENTS.
CONGRESS'S WORK ABOUT DONE

THE LAST APPROPRIATION BILL
OUT OF CONFERENCE, 7

 

 

Senator Tillman Gets an 631,000 Item
Into the General Dedciency Bul Under
a Threat to Kill the Bil—Mr. Bartlett
Wants te Fight Mr. Reeder of Kansas.

Wasuinoton, March 3.—Midnight—Both
Houses of Congress have been in seasion
far into the night for the purpose of bring-
ing the closing session to an end in an
orderly and businesslike manner. The
galleries were filled with American citizens
of all ages and sexes. The overflow crowd
surged through the corridors, and the
generally demoralized air that marks the
dying hours of every Congress permeated
the entire Capitol.

Never in the history of Congress has the
calendar of business been in such satia-
factory shape at midnight preceding the
final day of the session. The last ap-
propriation bill came out of conference
early in the evening, as the result of the
drawn battle on the question of the build-
ing ui warships for the navy, and peace
seemed about to spread its wings over the
statesmen of both houses, when suddenly
a black cloud appeared.

It came in the shape of Senator Ben Till-
man of South Carolina, who was in warlike
mood because the General Deficiency bill
as agreed upon in conference leaves out
an item of $81,000, representing the princi-
pal and interest on an old claim of South
Carolina against the Government for money
advanced during the War of 1812. Tillman
has sworn a mighty oath that this item
shall go into the Deficiency bill or the bill
will not pass, even if he to filibuster
until the stroke of 12 to-morrow,

It was dull and uninteresting in the House
of Representatives to-night. The only
ripple on the emooth surface of affairs was
caused by the hot-headed Bartlett of
Georgia, who wanted to fight Reeder of
Kansas, because he mistakenly thought
him to be the man who said “Sit down;
you're an ass.” Bartlett is the same man
who in the last Congress threw a book at
Brumm of Pennsylvania to emphasize @
point during a debate.

The final funeral services over the Aldrich
bill took place early in the day, and then
the corpse of the Philippine Tariff measure
was resurrected for use as a dummy with
which to prevent the consideration of
measures that were long ago marked for
defeat.

A recess was taken in the Senate at 60’clock
for dinner and at 8 o'clock all the Senators
came up to the changber feeling comfort-
able and happy (except the qoceme of
vituperation, who are never py), for
Tiliman had not heard of the little slip
about the South Carolina claim. Perfunc-
tory debate went on in a dreary way, with
the Philippines Tariff bill as the subject,
until 11:30, when President Roosevelt in-
jected himself in the proceedings with a
veto message on a bill to correct the military
record of an army officer guilty of every
crime against the law.

The President's message was a char-
acteristic of wri that left
no doubt . the

Fane greatly worried at tie reading
wo
and pretended to be astounded that a com-

mittee of its own members should be #0
careless as to correct the military
of a man like that.
‘ The conmwress, < p the capers Deftcleney
prop’ on bill reac an os
ane o'clock to-night, and the conferees on
the Naval bill also patched up a compro-
mise later in the evening, thus, as far asthe
differences between the two houses are
concerned, Geposing of the last of the twelve
great money bills.

Chairman Cannon was told by leading
Senators that Tillman would undoubtedly
make good his threat and force an exere
session by talking the Naval bill to death
They urged the House leader to yield to
the’ South Carolina Senator's demand,
At 1:45 A. M. Mr. Cannon yielded to the
entreaties of his fellow colleagues and
consented to the placing of Mr. Tillman's
claims item in the General Deficiency bill
This broke the deadlock.

Mr. Quay sprung the Statehood bill es
an amendment to the Philippine Tariff
bill, saying, “I will tell the Senator from
South Carolina that the objectionable
provisions regarding annexing Indian Ter-
ritory to Oklahorna are stricken out.”

Mr. Tillman- Then I'll vote for it.
|Laughter.}

Tillman's amendment war inserted in
the General Deficiency bill, the Naval

Deficiency conference re-
jorts were agreed to and Quay's State-
Coat amendment was withdrawn. Then
at 1:50 the Senate took a recess until 10
o'clock A. M
