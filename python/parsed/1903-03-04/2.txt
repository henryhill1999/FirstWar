sf. PATRICK'S CATHEDRAL.

 

apal Delegate the Celebrant and the
Archbishop, Bishops and Pricets in
Hundreds There—Light-Crowned Law
Giver, Jesuit Orator Calls Leo X11.

Perhaps the largest throng that ever
Patrick's Cathedral assembled

ta yesterday morning to witness the
celebration of the papal jubilee mass by
his Excellency Archbishop Falconio, the
Papa! Delegate to the United States. When

the Cathedral chimes told the beginning of
10,000 persons stood to witness

the mass,
the entrance of the distinguished proces-
sion. Not only the pews, but the aisles

and even the side chapels were filled and a
aquad of police had to stand at the doors to
prevent further crowding of the edifice.

The centre aisle from the communion
rai] to the doors was filled with white-sur-
pliced priests, Christian Brothers and
a@eminarians. The north and south sanct-
nary held at least a thousand priests of
the New York diocese.

When the music of Haydn's Imperial
Mass began, the procession entered from
the south vestry, the purple-robed cross

pearer and acolytes leading. After them
qgme the censer bearer and incense bearer
and then fifty altar boys and several hun-
dred priests. Two torch bearers preceded
Archbishop Farley and two pages carried
the train of his violet and fur capa manda.

The Archbishop and his ministers, Mer.
Edwards, deacon of honor, Dean Lings
and Father Lavelle as subdeacons, pro-
ceeded to the white and gold throne erected
on the right of the sanctuary, and at its
foot Bishops O'Connor, McFaul and McDon-
nel] took their places.

Two more torchbearers entered before
Archbishop Falconio and the officers of
the sacrifice, Mgr. Mooney, Chancellor
Colton and Fathers McGean, Kean and
Lamme! They proceeded to the altar,
where Archbishop Falconio knelt and made
the sign of the cross. Mounting the altar
steps with his five ministers he then placed
the gold chalice before the tabernacle.

After the Confiteor had been said the
Papal Delegate gave the absolution, then
bowed and kissed the altar before the
tabernacle, and taking the golden censer
@wung it toward the altar thrice, while
the choir sang the Gloria. After agaip
the altar the Papal Dele turned an

wed upon the 10, bowed heads

imposing ceremo: of the mass to

Sesuits, renthed.” He be by giving a
graphic description of political and religious
conditions in Europe at the time of the
death of Piua IX. and the choice of Leo
by the . In part be said of the
present Pope:

Their choice fell upon one down whose
cheeks the tears were streaming as the pen
dropped from his helpless hand. An old
man long past the meridian of life; scarcely
known beyond the limited circle of his im-
mediate associates, was selec for the
tremendous responsibility of the high office
Who was he?

He was one born in the long past, when Bona-
parte, the flerce jailer of another pontiff, was
trampling upon the nations and deluging
them in blood: one whose race was that of
the sandalled and togaed people of the Vol-
seclan mountains, descendants of the settlers
of ancient Latium. He was one in whose veins
ran the blood of the famous Rienza the last
of the Tribunes, the dreamer of a Roman
republic. He was one who later in Rome,
singularly enough, received part of his theo-
logical training from an American professor,
the illustrious Anthony Kollman of the 8o-

achool where the Lady chapel is being e .
And thus, it would seem providentially, the
ancient and modern Roman, the popular hero
and the noble, the democratic and the Ameri-
can were commingling elements preparing
the great Pontiff that was to be.

In characterizing the Pope's life work
Father Campbell said:

LADY COOK DENOUNCES COURT.

Creates a Scene When Verdict Is Given
Against Her for Slander.
Special Cable Despatch to Tux Son.

LonpDon, March 8,—The suit of Mr. Wal-
lace, the former private secretary of Lady
Francis Cook (Tennie C. Claflin) against
her for damages for libel and slander, was
heard to-day. He alleged that he was em-
ployed by her to watch the movements of
the late Sir Francis, her Ladyship’s husband,
and those of a mysterious woman, whom he
agreed to call “Mra. G.,” and who was
suspected of alienating the affections of
Sir Francis.

Wallace further alleged that Lady Cook
offered to make him independent for life
if he followed her instructions. Wallace
acted the réle of a private detective, not
only in this case, but he also watched the
movements of “Mrs. G.'s” father, mother,
grandfather, grandmother, sisters and
brothers. ;

Eventually a paragraph, said to have been
inspired by Lady Cook, was published,
referring to an alleged plan to blackmail
Lady Cook. Wallace stated that he be-
lieved the paragraph to have been a direct
referenoe to him; hence his suit.

Lady Cook was not called upon to testify.
The jury awarded the plaintiff £550 damages.

When the verdict was rendered Lady
Cook approached the bench and in an ex-
cited voice loudly protested against the
decision, waving her arms and screaming.
She declared that she would have the case
reopened. The Chief Justice several times
told her the case was over, and ultimately,
in the same excited condition, she was in-
duced to leave the court.

One of the ushers took Lady Cook by the
arm. She protested, crying out, “Don't
pull me out! I'll walk out! Iam asorrow-
ful woman. I have done more for England
and America than anybody else has done,
and my reputation is ruined!” She was led
from the court crying, “Cruel! Cruel! Cruel!”

 

 

 

TO TRAIN GERMAN SEAMEN.

 

Association Formed for That Purpose
With Herr Ballin at Its Head.
Special Cable Despatch to TmE Sun.
HaMbuRG, March 3.—An association is
being formed by the leading shipowners
and merchants here to devolop German
seamanship. Herr Ballin, director of the
Hamburg-American line, is provisional
president, and Emperor William is an
honorary member. The objects of the
association are to train lads aboard Ham-
burg sailing vessels, to encourage efficiency
in sailing by building large yachts for
training purposes, ta promote yachting as
A sport, and to do everything possible to
create first-rate sailors, who will be able
to participate in international regattas.
Although the association will be entirely
independent of English auspices it will
emulate English methods. The associa-
tion will also establish rewards for bravery
at sea, and will donate medals and other
gifts to be won in sailing contests. The
movement is undoubtedly partly commer-

| cial, and is directed toward establishing

the reputation of German seamen in view
of Germany's increasing maritime com-

| merce.

EUROPE'S ECONOMIC ALLIANCE.

Plan Already Under Way in Austria and
Germany.
Special Cable Despatch to Tux Sun.

VIENNA, March 3.— Preparations are al-
ready far advanced toward the formation
of a “Central European Economic Associa-
tion,” in which some see the nucleus of
the long-threatened European combination
against American competition. A pros-
pectus has been issued and departments
formed for various classes of the propa-
ganda which the association will under-
take.

Prof. Julius Wolf, of Breslau, an econo-
mist of some eninence, contributes an
important communication on the subject
to the Neue Freie Presse. He says that
the association will not have a political
character, and in enumerating its objects
he does not go beyond setting forth the
means of promoting codperation between
Austria-Hungary and Germany

It cannot be said that the prospects of
the association are immediately hopeful.
Owing to the hostility of the German in-
dustrialists and German agrarians and
Austrian industrialists to a customs union,
the promoters of the movement avoid
that phrase in the title of the new organiza-
tion, and advocate beginning by creating
a series on international trusts. They
say they have the support of the leaders
of three of the greatest parties in the Ger-
man Reichstag, and also that of Herr Moel-
ler, Prussian Minister of Commerce.

FAREWELL
IN THE OPERA ‘HOUSE.

 

He Had Spoken for Two Hours to Cheering
Thousands, but Handshaking Tired
Him QOut—Parade Without Him.

One of the most impressive meetings
ever arranged by the Salvation Army
in this county was held last night. when 4,000
members and friends of the organization,
crowded in the Metropolitan Opera House,
bade farewell to Gen. Booth, who is to sail
for England next Saturday,

A report was spread yesterday after-
noon that the venerable head of the Army
had fallen on a stairway and so injured
himself that the services of the evening
might have to be shortened considerably,
even if they were not put off on account
of his inability to be present. But Gen.
Booth was present and in excellent spirits.

The opera house was prettily decorated
for the occasion, mostly in the American
colors. The most telling feature was the
effect obtained by the distribution of pro-
grammes printed on differently colored
paper. In the orchestra, as well as on each
of the balconies, the first third of the au-
dience received red programmes, the second
thirc§*hite ones and the last third blue
ones. When Gen. Booth appeared on the
stage, the audience rose to ite feet and be-
gan waving these programmes. To the
object of the demonstration and the guests
of honor seated with him on the a , it

seemed as if the walls and the floor of the
house were all covered with the national

colors.

The chief officers of the American branch
of the army were on the stage, and their
bright red coats gave additional brilliancy
to the spectacle. Music was furnished by
fifteen Salvation Army bands from this
and neighboring cities.

The services were opened with prayer by
Mrs, Booth-Tucker, consul for America.
Then Col. John Lawley sang a farewell
song, “Until We Meet Again,” which had
been composed for the evening and dedi-
cated to Gen. Booth. The chairman
Supreme Court Justice McLean, was then
introduced by Commander Booth-Tucker
Senator Hanna was to have presided, but
had sent a letter of regret, having been
detained in Washington by the call for
an extra session of the Senate.

Justice McLean spoke only a few words
in introducing Gen. Booth. The General
received an outburst of cheers which lasted
for more than five minutes. Meanwhile
all the bands played and the air was filled
with waving programmes in red, white
and blue.

Gen. Booth spoke for two hours and at
the end of his address he showed no
sien of fatigue. Jt was remarked that,
while he re edly spoke of hia daughter,
Mrs. Booth-Tucker, and the good work done
by her and her husband, he did not once
refer to Ballington Booth by name and
only once indirectly, when said that
“many acrimonious things had been ut-
tered about him by some people in this
country.”

After expressing his thanks personally
and as head of the Salvation Army, for the
enthusiastic reception granted to him, Gen.
Booth said that he loved and believed in the
American branch of the organization. In
spite of what had been said and done against
it and against himself, the Army was rapidly
advancing here and the people were coming
around to more and more favorable views
of it.

He said that he had found the work
here much advanced since his previous
visit and he expressed the belief that,
if the present rate « ee was kept
up, the American branch would soon stand
foremost of all the branches in the world.
The object of his coming here was to show
his approval and to arouse etil) -further
the enthusiasm of the workers. Gen.
Booth then reviewed in detail the inception
and development of the Army up to the
presen’ time and his ambition for its future

rowth.

. Another demonstration which seemed
to shake the walla of the opera house
marked the close of the speech. Then a
collection was taken up and hundreds of
messages were read from absent well-
wishers of the Army. Among them was
this note from President Roosevelt:

My Dran jkx. Bootr: In wishing vou
farewell and continued success for your work
in the future, let me say how glad I was t
have had the chance of meeting. oe and
having pos break bread in the White House.
With alf good wishes, soeet, rouee.

THEODORE ROOSEVELT.

Other messages were from Senators
Clapp, Frye and Hoar; Speaker Hender-
son, Gov. Odell, Gov. Nash of Ohioy Gov,
Terrell of Georgia and Mayor Semitz of
San Franciaco

THEY WOULD LIKE HIM TO RULE
THE BUFFAIO DIOCESE.

 

 

Few Knew the Candidates Chosen by the
Priests of the Diocese and They Wish
te Put the VicarGeneral There
—Ne Choice Announced Officially.

Aooo to the information which
asnul ae Catholic clergy last night the
Very Rev. Joseph F. Mooney, Vicar General
of the diocese of New York, may be re-
quired to accept the office of Bishop of

‘alo.
aie, weeks ago Tun Box told of the
alarm which Mgr. Mooney’s friends felt
when it became known that the Church
was looking to him as the man to fill the
place of Bishop Quigley, who, against his
will, was promoted to be Archbishop of
Chicago.

A little later it geme ont that a
had uested that name °
saered. as he preferred to remain in New
York. This was natural, because, soon
after his appointment Archbishop Farley
signified that he would recommend to Rome
the appointment of Mgr.Mooney as Auxil-
iary Bishop of New York, an office second
in rank to that of the Archbishop, and by
the nature of Church rule, the place of suc-
ceasion to the Archbishopric. Circum-
stances, however, seem to have taken
shape which will make Mgr. Mooney Bishop
of Buffalo instead of Auxiliary Bishop
of New York.

A meeting of the Bishops of the province

monies of the evening—“the trooping of | was héid at the see house in Madison avenue

the colors.” Twenty-five or thirty grou
of six men and women each, dressed in
the costumes and carrying the flags of all
the lands in which the Salvation Army
has established itself, marched upon the
stage and gave homage to the chief of
the army. This took more than an hour
Finally Commander Booth-Tucker offered
a set of resolutions in praise of Gen. Booth
Gen. Booth when he left the meeting
stepped from the stage into the orehestra
and started up to the dway entrance,

shaking hands on both sides of the aisle as |
'

he naseed along

The handshaking proved too much for
Gen. Booth's strength,
drawn upon, and he nearly collapsed when
he was half way down the aisle. A chair
had to be brought, on which he sat for
several minutes until he recovered suf-
ficiently to walk to the door

A terehtignt procession, formed by about
2,000 members of the Salvation Army,
most of them women, Was waiting outside
to escort the Army's chief to Weat
Fourteenth street headquarters

Gen Booth was to have marched at the
head of this prooemsion Instead of doing
eo, he drove in a carriage with his daughter

and son-in-law along the shortest route

to Fourteenth street, while the procession
followed the line of march laid out through

WILL WATCH THE SULTAN.
Austria and Russia Determined to See
That Reforms Are Carried Oat.
Spectal Cadie Despatch to TaE Sun.

Visnna, March 3.—Dr. von Koerber, the
Austrian Prime Minister, and Herr Coloman
von Szell, the Hungarian Prime Minister,
made pronouncements to-day in the respec-
tive parliaments of Austria and Hungary
regarding the policy in the Balkans.

Austria and Russia, Dr. von Koerber said,
were firmly resolved to see that Turkey
discharged the obligations she had under-
taken. They would not be satisfied with
mere promises.

The Christian populations, therefore, had
every reason to confide in the two Powers,
and should not allowthemselves to be led into
committing acts of violence, which would
give Turkey the right to resort to repres-
sive measures.

The Hungarian Prime Minister added to
a similar statement an emphatic warning
that if the people in the provinces affected
tookrevolutionary steps nobody, not even
Russia, would interfere to prevent Turkey
from energetically’ repressing them.

The statements were loudly cheered.

 

 

Chinese Viceroys' Sons Coming Here.
Special Cable Despatch to TaR Sun.

SHancual, Mar@ 3. Native opinion,
especially among officials, is much im-
pressed by the fact that Viceroys Chen
Chih Tung and Tuan Fang are sending
their sona at their own expense as students
to the United States. They are attached
to the suite of Sir Liang Chen Tung, the
new Chinese Minister at Washington.
Their step is regarded as a hopeful sign of
the progress of liberal ideas.
