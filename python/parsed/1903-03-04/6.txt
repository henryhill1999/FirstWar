Odom Tumbies in the Mad, but Wins With
De Reszke—Ahamada a Clever Winner
_¥. K. Smathers Buys the Crack
Two-Year-Old Dick Bernard for 68,000

Orn-eaNs, March 8.—Although it

continually during the afternoon, a
large crowd Was at the Fair Grounds. I¢
was the second and last “Ladies’ Day” of
the winter meeting and the card was spoiled
to a great extent by the numerous scratches,
The track was deep in mud. Three out of
the «ix favorites managed to make con-
nections

Dick Bernard, considered to be the best
colt here, was sold to E. E. Smathers to-day
by Durnell & Herz for $8,000. Durnell &
Herz, who had the largest stable here, will
ship to Memphis on Tuesday,

rhe mile and 70 yards handicap produced
a lot of ugly talk after t was decided, Three
books in the ring took all the money offered
on imp Albula, the favorite, Albula raced
himacif to pieces with Bud Embry in front.
Consequently he had nothing to finish with.
Major lenny, the second choice, who
was backed by the wise money, was the
winner There were only four starters in
the firet race. Bondage was the favorite.
De Reszke was the good thing of the race.
While the field was at the post George Odom,
on De Reatke, got caught in the barrier and
took a tumble in the mud. Although Odom
was covered with mud it did not dampen his
spirits, as he sent De Reszke to the front and
was never headed, winning in a gallop by
six lengths from Bondage.

Ahumada was an odda-on choice for the
second race, ata mile, He made all of hie
own pace and won cleverly from the pace-
maker, Birch Broom

Iefiare Was the best in the third, at a mile
and a quarter. He went to the front after
a tile had been travelled and won galloping
by four lengths. Ceylon managed to out-
ame the favorite, Nettie Regent, in the rup
or the piece. and secured it by'a neck

som Hildreth landed his second purse of
the afternoon in the fifth with Floyd K
The son of Pontico was the favorite. He
wascft last, but under a hard drive managed
to get up in time to win by a nose on the post
from the Corrigan cast-cff, Frank Rice.

GOSSIP OF THE RUNNERS.

Definite Proposition for a Match Between
Mo Chesney and Hermis.

If George Spear, who trains E. E. Smathers's
trotting horses, speaks by the card, it would
appeur to be up to L. V. Bell t> match Hermis
against MoChesney. Spear said yesterday:

Mr. Smathers is ready to enter McChesney
at the proper time in a sweepstakes against
Hermis on any E.stern track, either in August
at Saratoga or later on at Sheepshead Bay
or Morris Park, and he will bet $20,000 on the
side or as much more as the Hermis people
wish to bet.”

As soon as Mr. Smathers verifies this state-
ment it can be regarded in the nature of a
challenge, but in all probability it will not
be accepted until Mr. Bell is eure of the con-
dition of his famous horse. Hermis has
many valuable stake engagements to fill
before the Saratoga meeting, and if he goes
through them safe and sound and can be sent
to the post fit to indulge in a hard race with
MoChesney a match will undoubtedly be
made. But just a present turfmen sey that
Mr. Bell should not be in a hurry.

Turfmen thronged the “Broadway Pad-
dock,” or rather the Hoffman House, yester-
day afternoon. Among them was Edward
Garrison, familiarly known as “Snapper,”
how, according to various rumors, is more
or less associated with E. E. Smathers, the
new owner of McCheaney. Somebody atarted
the story the other day that Garrison would
train McChesney when the colt comes Fast,
but when asked about the matter yesterday
the “Snapper” declined to say a word He
did say, however, that he will train for the
Holly Grove Stable this year, the owner of
which he did not make known, and that
among the horses in the string is The Rhymer,
who ia in the various handicaps with so light
an_impost that his chancea seem rosy

The story to the effect that a protest would
be | ed against the entry of Advance
juard in the various handicaps because of
alleged faulty. registration of ownership
created no end of talk among turfmen at
the Paddock yesterday. The consensus of
opinion was that it would be a hardenip for
Owner Shields if the stewards of the Jockey
Club should decide to throw the “iron
horse's” entry out. The excuse offered
for the mistake in registration made by
Shields is that he, like many other owners
waa not conversant with the meaning of
the new rule adopted last December by the
Jockey Club and that, as a@ consequence
he should be treated with some degree of
leniency. Advance juard has been entered
in stakes valued im gross at about $100,000
and to throw him out would be a severe
blow to his owners

Thomas W. Lawson of Boston will have a
racing stable of flat_racers this year as well
as steeplechasers. His son, Arnold Lawson,
is authority for the statement

A. J. Reed, former partuer in the Fairview
Rtud with his father, Charlies Reed, has just
bought a membership button in the Metro-

olitan Turf Association, paying $4,250, the
ighest price on record, illy unn has
also purchased a button for $4,000. The
highest previous price paid for membership
in the “Mets” was $3,500

Jockey Otto Wonderly has signed a con-
tract to ride for M. H. Tichenor & Co. this

ear for $12,000. He will take the place of

uchanan revently set down by the New
Orleans stewards.

Jockey fpner Redfern has arrived at

Sheepshead Bay.

Weights for the Bennings Handicaps.

The Bennings Spring Handicaps will be
run on the first and last days of the meeting,
March 28 and April 14. The distance of the
first event will be six furlongs and of the

Read Drivers Meet.

The annual meeting of the New York Road
Drivers’ Association was held last night
at the Rossmore Hotel and for nearly four
hours the session was a lively one. The
question of issuing bonds to pay for the club-
house built last year was after much dis-
cussion referred to the incoming administra-
tion. When it finally came to a vote on the

ticket proposed by the nominating corm-
mittee the rea] strength of the so-called dis-
turbing element was shown. The by-laws
provide that the president can appoint this
nominating committee and that the nomina-
tions shall be sent by mail to every member
of the association.

It developed at the meeting that a majority
wished to place a new ticket in the fleld, but
2 do this {t was necessary to amend the by-
awa so that @ nomination could he made
with the time and notice provided in the
by-laws. On the question of amendment
a majority present voted in the affirmative,
but the by-laws made a two-thirds vote neces-

  

 

sary, and the majority was not large enough
to cover this

CANOEISTS SETTLE TROUBLES.

WINNERS OF TOURNAMENT TO
MEET WEST AND SHAWANOE.

 

 

Gunwale Tilting and Racing a New Featare
at the Sportsmen's Show's Contest
—Milicete Indians Bulld a Canoe
and Will Enter the Tournaments.

The trouble with the canoeists at the
Sportsmen's Show at the Madison Square
Garden has been settled. Those who had
already taken part in some of the bouts and
had won did not want to lose their chances
for the prizes, and s0 a compromise was
brought about. The tournament will con-
tinue to the end as originally arranged. Then
the winner will meet Francia West, the man
to whom there was s0 much objection, The
winner of this bout will meet Shawanoe, the
Ojibway Indian, who has never been beaten.
West and Shawanoe will give exhibition
bouta until the end of the show

One of the most interesting tilting contests
seen 6o far was between four members of the
Seixas family. This contest is not in the
tournament, but is to settle a family dispute.
Stanley and Claude Seixas met Albert and
Harry Seixas, They are all very handy
with the paddles and each crew won a bout.
A third was necessary to decide which team
should meet Philip M. and Marion Seixas
to-night. Stanley and Claude seemed to
have the advantage in the final bout until
Stanley overreached and fell into the water.

The Camp Rainbow boys caused lots of
fun in their bout. The contestants were
J. Fauth, Jr., and 8. Lewis against J. J.
Griffiths and Alfred Kalzaner. They thrust
so fast with their spears that they soon got
tired out and had to sit down to rest. Fauth

and Lewis finally won. ‘The Vreeland broth-
ers won a good bout from UG. H. King and
F. Keller.

Later on the Vreeland brothers appeared
against J. B. Dunn and J. A. Robinson the
spearmen egrecing to stand on the gunwales
of their canoes eorge Vreeland succeeded
in catching Dunn end sending him into the

water

The. Millicte Indians have finished the
birch bark canoe they have been working
on since the show opened and launched it
last night. To-day they will enter the con-
tests. This canoe {is 18 feet long, 30 inches
wide and weighs 40 pounds, It is made of
one piece of bark, the girth of a great birch

Wooden pegs and tough cords of rattan
bind the ribs together,
In the afternoon Tom Shawanoe and

Francis West met in a single blade canoe
race. West was better able to handle lis
canoe at the turns than the Indian, but Shaw-
anoe paddled 60 fast in the straights that
he won by two lengths. In a_tail-end race
Wabanoosa, the Winner on Monday, Was
beaten by Andrew Landen of the Ontario
camp. Another new feature in the contest
line was a gunwale race. Shawanoe and
William Harris rowed against two Indian
canoeists, Wabanoosa and Bubwiljininil,
and won by three lengths

The Canadians seem to be winning every-
thing in the contest line. In the portage
race yore Gieorge Linklater and tieorge
Crawford of Ontario won in the fast time of
i minute 10 seconds. The Adirondack men
were second, beaten by nine seconds

Prof, Ramon Reyes Sala, the Poilig ine
lecturer, Visited the show last night. rof
Rala was born at Manila and has been lectur-
ing on the new possessions in this country
for three years. He was very. much itn-
pressed with the bodily statue of the Ameri-
can Indians as compared with the Filipine

in a Very Rough Game.

The Crescent A CC won a hockey game
from the New York A. C last night that wae
of the rough house order. It was expected
thatthe game would be a hot orfe and the St
Nicholas Skating Kink was crowded with
enthusiasts. Inthe first half the New York
team took the lead and at the end of the half
the score was 2 to 1 in their favor In the
eecond half the New York players scored
twice more and when the half was nearly
over it looked aa if the champions would be
were two goals behind. The
Crescents then rushed things and managed
to make the score four each when the time
expired. It was necessary to play an extra
