| morning train.

Hean Senators Called to Albeay by Wire.

Arbany, March 3.—The business of the
State Senute is to proceed without inter-
ruption so far as the Democratic Senators
are concerned and in spite of the attitude
of Senator Grady, the minority leader, in
attempting to hold up legislation last night.

This was the practical result of a caucus
of Democratic Senators held to-day before
and after the Senate session. Senator
Grady announced at ihe session that the
Democratic Senators had not concluded
their deliberations in cauveas and at his re-
queat the third reading caiendar was laid
over until to-morrow.

Before the caucus was resumed after
the Senate session “Big Tim” Sullivan,
who came here with orders from Leader
Mutphy of Tammany Hail, had a long
talk with Senator Geady, ahd it had a de-
cidec ly quieting effect. upon him.

A majority of the Democratic Senators
erwin open hostility to the position taken
by Se vatorGrady, but in order to let their
Jeadér ‘down easy the cauvus adopted a
resolutivn, offered by Senator Dowling,
insisting ‘hat horeafter the rules of the
Senate be observed and enforced, Senator
Grady practically begged off for his ab-
sence last Wack, and promised that it would
not ocr om

Grady, that the Democratic Senators would
not af! in passiag even an unobjectionable
local bt'! unless there were enough Repub-
lican Seviators in their seats to give the re-
quired twenty-sit votes to pass a bill, that
their wish would be gratified, no matter at
what persovial sacrifice to the Republicans.

There were twenty-four Republican Sena-
tore present at to-day’s session. Senators
Marehall and Stewart reached Albany this
morning and wenator kisberg, this after-
noon. ides Senator White the other
absentees were L’Hommelieu, Sherwood
and Prime.

Minority Leacer Patiner to-day created
a tempest in a teapet in the Assembly.
He challenged a rolicall on the Stevens
bill, ‘providing for the atteration of the
election districts in towns where ballot
machines are used. The Democrats op-

the bill and vot ed against it, but the
Chairfannounced that it had p . Mr.
Palmer claimed that the roll had not been

Republicans in the cham ber to pase the bill
He was declared out of otder and appealed
from the decision of the «.bair, which call
brought about a wrang/e that was not
end for an hour, whet the Chair was
sustained by a vote of 80 to 59.

yor Low's New York :Ventral terminal
bills were to have passed the Assembly
to-day, but it was discovered that an errur
had been made in printing 0:16 of the three
measures, a line having tween omitted.
This necessitated a three day's’ delay and
the reprinting of the bill. As there was
nothing to be gained by passieg the other
two bills Assomblyman Bedell, who intro-
duced them, had them put over until next
Monday night, when they will pass the

Greene Sees Gov. Odell and Bill for Longer
YWerm May Be Pressed.

Aunany, March 3.—Police Commissioper
Greene camo Albany to-ight in time to
dine at the Executive Mansion, with
Gov. Gdell whwse guest he was to-night.
He left New Y ork city at 3:30 o'clock this
afternoon, and will return on &n early

His visit here wasat theinvitation of
Governor Odell, e ttended through Mayor
Low, and persotally, During Mayor
Low's recent visit Gcrv. Odell triea to change
his attitude, which is opposed, at this time
anyway, to an extension of the term of
Police Commissioner (jraene. The Mayor
asked the Governor to takk with Commis-
sioner Greene about it. Tliis is one of the
reasona of Commissioner Greene's visit
to-night.

The Commiesioner also has been opposed
to the extension of his term. It can be
stated, however, that Mayor Low is not
£0 strongly opposed to the jolan as he wae
before his last talk with ov. Odell. It
can also be stated that if a bi! is introducea
as a result of Commissioner Greene's visit
to-night, it would be at the insti ation of
Gov. Odell, and its passage pres through
the Lermielernre with all the power at tis
commandof te “hief Freeut he of the Stete

It can be stated positively that such a bill,
if introduced, will not come from Mayor
Low, and also that he will not. openly favor
or oppose it. He will 1. ave the. uestion to the
final action of Gov. Odell and Commissioner
Greene.

Every one who knows anything about
politios can readily understand why Gov.
Odell wants a friendly New York, city Police
Commissioner who will be in offic e for several
years to come.

In this connection it may be ywinted out
that a bill has already passed the Assembly
and is now on the Senate calendar which
materially inereases the membersnio of the
New York city police force withia the next

) years, One provision is for 1,500 ad-

T 4 -
The Republicans | ditional patrolman this and next year.

The Governor has the appointment of a
successor to Supt. McCullagh, who also
has the appointment of 700 deyvuties each
year. Robert C. Morris, presicient of the
New York Republican County Committee,
hes been here since last night. He had a
long talk with the Governor to-day re-
garding Mr. MocCullagh’s rea intment.

After Mr. Morris's talk with he Governor
to-day it was learned that while the Gover-
nor was still disinclined to re@ int Mr.
McCullagh, he had expressed opinion
that none of the candidates so far suggested
for Mr. McCullagh’s place would be likely
to fill the bil. Senator Eleberg, who is
a close friend of Gov. Odell, has a candidate
for Mr. McCullagh's place.

President Morris is opposed to Senator
Elaberg’s bill abolishing the office of Cor-
oners in New York city.

CIVIC FEDERATION AND UNIONS.

Request That Independent Labor Be Repre-

sented in Organization.

Ansany, March 3.—The Rev. E. M. Fair-
child has given out the following statement
regarding the National Civic Federation
and its relation to independent workmen:

There are fifteen presidents of labor unions
included in its executive committee \“on
the pare of wage earners,” but not one in-
dependent workroan to represent the vast
majority of the working people of this
counury wha are outside the unions. tu
its orgamzation the National Civie Federa-
tion assumes that the labor problem of the
country includes only that one-eighth of
the worknwn who are unionized

Aea matter of fact 50 per cent. of the mem-
bers of the anions are members by compul-
sion, and they may they “pay their money
just to keep the unions quiet "Anyone can
diseover this by inquiry among the mene
themselves. The most intelligent and trust-
worthy workmen of the country are not
hearty #u rvers of the unions

lt is unfair to the labor problem, therefore,
to organize the National Civie Federation
with representatives “on the rt of wage
earners” who in fact stand for only the
recon, socialistic minority of the working
claes

The assumption of the plan of organization
secms to be that agmements between cms
nlover and unions are “the way out,” as Mr
Lasley puta it. which means that the inde-
nendents must get in tue unions in order to
find tuig way out

The National Civic Federation therefore
lends itself to forcing the great majority
of the working people to come in under the
leadership of thes radical, socialistic union
labor leaders, beenuse thes* agreements
sought by the unions are designed to have
clauses in which employers bind themselves
to hire “none but tnembers.” They also
commonly restrict apprentices

The agreement plan, in simple, is to kee
down the number of those engaged in: eac!
trade, to prevent any from working inde-
pendent of the union, and after thus having
secured a monopoly of the trade, to run the
wages of members up as high as possible
No igtelligent man not a party to the move-
ment, who takes the trouble to get inside
information, will doubt the accuracy of this
statement

The “union label,” wich the National
Civic Federation uses on its publications, is
the banner of a great national boycott, which
has as ks consummation the exe lusion from
the skiQfed trades and from all but general
laborers’ work of a wreat portion of the work-
ing peopde of this country,

Mr Mitahell may deny that he is interesting
himself in this national boycott against inde-
pendent Workmen, but any one who knows
the hopes of the Label League knows that
every lator leader in harmony with the
American Federation of Labor is working
for exactly this result

Ky its present organization and policy
it is quest nable whether the National Civic
Federation is not guiding the general public
wlong the union Way in, rather than showing
anybody the way out

On behalf of independent wer’men, I have
asked the = eretary, Mr K y Fasles e

HEARING ON WEGENTS’ BILL.

MR. AINSWORTH I€AKES BITTER
ATTACK. ON BOARD.

He Intimates Bishop Deine Is to Blame
for Trouble—The Bhhop Favors Bill
Giving Regents Contrp! of Education

—Others Oppese Brown Bil.

Aumany, March 8.<The Hon. Danforth
E. Ainsworth, Deputy State Superin-
‘tendent of Public Inst ruption, to-day made
another bitter attack upom the State Board
of Regents. Mr. Ainsworth took, the oo-
casion to vent his person. feelings while
ostensibly speaking on Scmator Elon R.
Brown's bill, which is intended eventually to
wipe out the Regents of the University
and give a State Board of Educ ation, termed
Regents, control of the whole school system
of the State, both primary and secondary,
and higher education.

Mr. Ainsworth eaid nothing in, favor of
the bill, but he did add fuel to the existing
breach’ between the Regents and the De-
partment of Public Instruction.

Mr. Ainsworth's speech was passionate
and caused a great deal of surprise, espe-
clally as he gave the inference that the
Rt Rey. William Croswell Doane, Epis-
copal Bishop of Albany and Chancellor of
the University, was to blame for all the
troubles. The Bishop was in the Senate
chamber where the hearing was held,
but he refused to answer Mr. Ainsworth,
and was with great reluctance prevailed
upon by the committee to give his im-
pression as to educational affairs.

While Senator Brown stands as the spon-
sor of the bill and says it originated wholly
with him, yet it was quite apparent that he |
and State Superintendent of Public In-
struction Charles R. Skinner entertained the
same views to a surprising degree.

Senator Brown was moderate in his
views and did not deal in any ‘personalities
Mr. Skinner, though, showed quite a
knowledge of the workings of the bill,
Skinner, Brown and Ainsworth were the
onty ones to favor the bill.

J. Russell Parsons, secretary of the State
Board of Regents, A. R. Conant of Elmira,
representing the Academic Association of
Principals, composed of 700 members, and
Charles F. Wheelock, chief inspector of
the Regents, opposed the bill. Mr. Parsons
said it would give additional cause for
friction, and was unwise and illogical.
He declared it would mean a continuation.
of at least four years of present intoler-
able conditions, He reviewed the state of
affairs as they now exist, and said there is
conflict in having the schools visited by
two sets of inspectons. He asserted thats

secondary education in this State now is
paral
ation.
He declared that unification cannot be |
'
'

by reason of the present situ-

brought about except through the Regents
and said they were the proper persons to
look after the schoals.as they are analogous
to the looal Boards of Kducation.

Mr. Conant said his association was al-
most unanimously opposed to the Brown
bill and he thought it brought about dis-
unification instead of leroy ae the situa-
tion. He thought there would be improve-
ye if the oes 7 nie aed select
the Superinte t 01 ucation and stayed
that immediate relief was desired by all
school principals, who object to double
inspection of their schools.

Senator Brown, in defending his bill,
contended that the Board of Regents was
too large and it did not represent the spirit
of the le. He said he would take the
best out of both educational departments
and unite them and thus give the best re-
sulte to the people.

Mr. Skinner said he alwayr favored any
fair plan of unification, but blamed the
Regents for there being no unification.
He said he was tired of existing conditions
and thought the Brown bil! the best means
to bring about harmony,

Chairman Lewis then persuaded Bishop
Doane to make a few remarks. The Bishop
eaid when it came to personal accusations
or poraonal defence he would have to be
counted out. He said the best thing the
Legislature can do at this seesion will be
to pass a bill now igs ageey~ by the Re-
gents which will put the entire education
of the State under the Regents as now
constituted.

He «aid the Regents were not concerned
with their dignity or their power, but were
concerned as to their service, and they do
not want that service diminished

Regent Pliny T, Sexton opposed the bill
ina written communication, as he is confined
to his room by illness. “It would be idle,”
he said, “to dweil upon the defects of the
Brown bill in detail. Its fatal offending
is in its scarcely concealed attempt and in-
tent—its leading urpose—a =: Purpose
equally apparent in ator Brown's #imi-
lar measure of a few years ago-—w place
the adimiaistration of the entire public
school system of the State under assured

wrmanent Kepublican political control.

neidentally, and in aid of such purpose,
the bil! insults and seeks to diseredit the
present Board of Kegents of the University
of the State.

THE SUN, WEDNESDAY, MARC

CARNEGIE TO HELP MAKE A LAKE

@n Which Princeton students May Develop
& Boat Crew.

Parncyton, N. J., March 3.-—-President
Woodrow Wilson of Princeton University
denies the report that Andrew Carnegie
has. given to the university $1,000,000. He
says that Mr. Carnegie has never even
intinated that he thought of doing anything
for the university directly.

Mr. Carnegie haa, however, promised
a substantial contribution to a fund that
is being raised to make, on the southern
end of the campus, a big artificial lake to
be used by the residents of Princeton for
rowing, aud particularly by the under-
graduates for developing a crew. That
was learned to-night from sources outside
the university.

The cost of the lake is not yet known,
but it is said that it will be considerably
more tian $100,000. There is a natural
basin at the foot of the campus and plenty
of water within easy distance. The uni-
versity owns considerable of the land, which
is swampy and is covered with water during
a large part of the year. *

The lake, it is said, will probably extend
from the aqueduct, about a mile below
Princeton to a point about a mile above
the town. The water will be taken from
the Millatone River and from Stoney Brook.
The Tigers have not been represented on
the water since 1886.

It is asserted emphatically that the under-
taking is not at all a university affair, but is
the work of individuals who are interested
in the town and the institution.

ARREST CORBETT, JEFFRIES,

Net East Side Beer Drinkers Only, Cries
McCall te the Police.

Upon the description he had read of
the meeting of Corbett and Jeffries in a
Broadway saloon laat Saturday to talk
tWapt conditions for a fight, Alderman
AecCall wrote a long resolution, which he
piesented to the board yesterday, calling

| upton the Police Commissioner to enforce

the Excise law as strictly on the West Side
of tthe city as on the East Side.

In.the preamble he said that some quarters
of the city were more favored than others,
that all the laws were not impartially en-
forced, and that the Corbett-Jeffries meet-
ing to promote a prizefight was a clear
violation of the law.

“Why should a thug from southern
California,” exclaimed Mr. McCall, “be
allowed to come here and grind his teeth
and threaten to kill a citizen of New York,
and arrange a prizefight in a Broadway
saloon when people on the East Side were
arrested for sellingadrink? I know that a
police inspector and two captains were
standing on the corner of the street, near
the saloon where this prizefight was ar-

The resolution was made a special order
for next Tuesday.

VERMONT FOR LICENSES.

110 Towns Vote to Have Saloens—All the
Cities Vote the Same Way.

Burirnoron, Vt., March 3.—The voters
of Vermont to-day settied the question
whether the several towns should be for

cense or prohibition. On Feb. 3 a refer -
endum on the liquor question wes sub-
mitted to the people and by a majority of
7% a license law was substituted for the
prohibition law which had been on the
statute books for fifty years. When the
vote on the referendum was taken 8 towns
voted yes. and a by no.

Since that time the sentiment has chang
in favor of the new law. All of the aie |
in the State and 100 towns with some yet |
to be heard from, have voted for local |
option. It is estimated that when al) the
towns are beard from 110 will be for license,

The license ee went into efect to-day,
but saloons will not be open for a month or |
six weeks, owns to the fact that Com-
missioners must be appointed in each town
to immue the licenses. Under the old pro-
hibitery law saloon were operated openly |
in every cil t and large town in the State |
and in Bur on there were about two |
hundred places where liquor was sold. |
To-day not 4 saloon is open in Burlington
and i's practically Unpossible to buy 4

RECORD FLOOD OF 1897 LIKELY
TO BE SURPASSED.

Levee System From Cairo to the Gulf Now
fn a Finished Cendition—@. Francis
Qverfow Basin Cut Off—Causes the
River to Rise Higher Than Usual.

New Orveans, March 3.—The lower
Mississippi Valley, from Cairo to the Gulf,
now recognizes that it may face the highest
water ever known in the Mississippi River.
There has been no high water since 1897,
when the maximum of three and a half
feet above the danger point was reached
at New Orleans and sandbags had to be
placed on the levees to prevent the water
from running over into the street.

River experte believe that the high water
record of 1897 will be broken at Memphis
and at places as far south as Vicksburg.
in consequence of the completion of the
St. Francia levees, protecting the St. Fran-
cis Basin of Arkansas from overflow. Tre
are the last in the line of Mississippi River
levees to be constructed, and for the first
time in

tected overflow.

Heretofore the St. Fiaacis Basin has
acted as a safety reservoir in which a large
amount of flood water was stored up. This

revented the flood from reaching it« °

at the same time it made its duration
much longer. The closure of this immense
reservoir, covering many thousand square
miles, has ren f the river to rise
