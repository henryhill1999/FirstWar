carded for the noisy machine with trum-
yet and drums and the whirring of gongs.

“H" wrote THe SUN last Sunday, regard-
ing Marlowe's death and other things. Per-
haps Marlowe did die of the plague; he was
at Deptford for the purpose of avoiding it.

Rut John Addington Symonds, whose
“Shakespeare in the English Drama,” and
jis editorial work in conjuncton§ with

Havelock Ellis and Arthur Symons in the
Mermaid “Marlowe” give him authority,
says Marlowe was stabbed in a squabble
over women. Sidney Lee declares for the
plague theory, What's the difference? We
prefer Symonds to Lee. The former is
quite as accurate and a thousand times
nore aeniaene. Lee's life of Shakes-
peare is a handy, dry little book of facts,care-
fully garnered; but of interpretative vision—!

4s Marlowe lived, Marlowe died—vio-
ently. We like to think of him as dying
inrepentant, a passionate man, a great
over, a fierce hater. The ger thrust
fits the legend better than the plague story.
We could never fancy Marlowe, like Greene,
writing “A Groat's Worth of Wit” or “The
Repentance of Robert Greene,” or exhort-
ing, as did the latter in 1592, his boon com-
anions to mend their evil ways. No, Mar-
lowe died an unregenerate genius

 

We must plead not guilty to the “actress”
nterpolation, for, like the snakes of Iceland
(as set forth by the worthy Bishop of Pontip-
pidian), there were none in Marlowe's day.
We mentioned ladies with the scarlet letter—
they came out actresses in the types.

fers toa bet about a forthcoming Rosatind,

In one of the boxes at the Manhattan
Theatre on Monday night sat a matronly
woman with a youthful, pretty face, It
was Mrs. James Elverson, once Eleanor
Mayo, daughter of Frank Mayo. Mrs.
Elverson, who is the wife of Col. Elverson,
editor and owner of the Philadelphia In-
uirer, came over to see her sister ronda

yo in “The omens Move.” It was
nearly ten years ago that as Eleanor Mayo
she ma“e her début on Broadway in Julian
Edwardes's “King Kénée's Daughter,” one
of the composer's early but most ambitious
compositions.

The statement that Edouard de Reaske
has never appeared publicly in concert ts
an error. The big basso, whose heart ia
even bigger than his voice, sang several
numbers on the stage of the Metropolitan
Opera House a decade ago. The affair
was mixed opera and concert, a benefit
arranged by Mrs. Thurber for a French
charity. We cannot recall all that M. de
Reszke sang, but remember his dramatic
declamation of Tschaikowsky's “Don Juan
serenade,” with Victor Harris at the piano.

When Beerbohm Tree was rehearsing
“The Eternal City” in London Mr. Hall
Laine objected to the mildness of the actor's
*truggle with the Roma, Mias Collier.

“Mr. Tree,” said the Rabbi of Man, “T

leading lady across the stage.”

“That is nothing remarkable,” retorted
the fiery Tree, “when I was in France the

the feet and dust the stage with her. But
it vasa Punch and Judy show.”

KNEISEL QUARTET CONCERT.

Fifth ment ef the Series at Men-
deissehn Hall.

The Kneisel Quartet gave its fifth con-
cert last night at Mendelesohn Hall. The
programme consisted of Techaikowsky's
E flat minor quartet, written in memory
of Ferdinand Laub, the violinist; Georg
Henschel’s song, “Adieu de  |'Hotesse
Arabe,” Bach's C major sonata for ‘cello,
unaccompanied; two folk songs, “Fair Ellen”
and “Faithful Johnnie,” with accompani-
ment of piano, violin and ‘cello by Bee-
thoven, and Brahms's sextet for two violins,
two violas and two ‘cellos, opus 36. The
singer was H>len Henschel, the pianist
Georg Henschel, the second viola player
Max Zach and the second cellist J. Keller.

The Kneisel audiences are loyal enough
now to satisfy the most exacting soul.
They pour themselves into all the crannies
of Mendelasohn Hall and they applaud
with a palpable desire to show their un-
failing good will, Yet they contrive to
make gradations in their manifestations
of joy, and they made a subtle one last
night. They applauded Helen Henschel
sufficiently to insure her a recall, and then
they proceeded to give Alwin Schroeder,
the ‘cellist of the organization, such a
welcome when he appeared to play the
Bach sonata as to leave no doubt of the com-
parisons which dwelt in their minds.

It is difficult to conceive of any good
artistic reason why singing should be inter-
jected into these lovely chamber music
concerts. We hear altogether too much
singing and moat of it discouraging—
not quite so much so as Miss Henschel’s,
to be sure, but atill enough so to make us
wish ‘that it were rarer. The young lady's
delivery of her father's song was far from
ape either as an interpretation or as
an exhibition of technical accomplishment.
Mr. Henschel played the accompaniment
gimiremy. For that relief much thanks.
The two folk songs arran by Beethoven
were interesting as cu ities, for they
are seldomn heard, but they are unimportant
and could easily be spared. The Knetsel
quartet should keep to its own beautiful
miasion and hold its concerts sacred to in-
strumental chamber music.

Mr. Schroeder's performance of the
Bach sonata (written really for viola pom-

sa) Was also interesting as a curiosity.

e composition has all the earmarks of
the wonderful old cantor of Leipzig, who
thought in music, and who never felt anxious
for a single instant as to whether he was
writing things hard to play. A man has to
be a real virtuoso to perform such a com-
position, which Bach proventy never con-
ceived as a public concert piece, though
he hada family of musicians and loved to
have concerts at home. Mr. Schroeder
played it with a wealth of tone and a technic
quite masterful. The audience knew it
was good and said so in the language of
audiences.

The Techaihowaky quartet is one of the
Ruasian's most troublesome works, crowded
with intricate harmonic relations and wit!:
croas rhythms. Probably the Kneisel gen-
tlemen were a little nervous about the
first movement, for it did not flow with that
certainty which we look for in the art of
these players. But after that they played
superbly. The scherzo went with remark-
ably fine effect, while the tone tints in the
slow movement were autumnal in the
richness and variety of their glory.

The Brahms sextet is one of those com-
positions of which it is impossible to write
adequately without rhapsodizing. It is,
as a German once said about his own music,
*too lovely.” It overpowers one with the
apparent simplicity of its thought and the
marvellous art of its construction. It was
performed with admirable ensemble and
with warm sympathy by the six members
of the Boston avephony Orchestra. It
must be delightful to belong to an orchestra
so well supplied with chamberemusic players
that they can be picked out anywhere
almost at random,

CROWD AT ADA REHAN’'S SALE.

John PD. Crimmins Bays a Harp—Most
Bayere Not Spending Much.

At the second day's sale of Ada Rehan's
stage properties and household furnish-
ings at 7 West Twenty-ninth street, yester-
day afternoon, there was a bigger jam
of curiosity seekers than on Monday, and
there was no pretense of keeping even one
aisle clear. On Monday, when the sale was
on the second floor, the company which
crowded that apartment were dependent
upon a single elevator to get up and down
Yesterday they were dependent upon a
single aisle to get in and out on the first
floor and that aisle was practically im-
passable even to the people who desired to
get out and make room for others.

day, the 260 catalogue lots sold yesterday
bringing $4,887.35, as nat $3,363.65 on Mon-

BOOKMAKER JOHNSON: QUITS.

STORY THAT HE LOST A MILLION
LAST YEAR IS DOUBTED.

 

 

Has Gold His Turf Association Member-
ship—tie't Likely te Step Betting,
Though—Has a Reputation as a Daring
Plunger—Sued the Hostetter Fstate.

Dave Johnson has sold his membership
in the Metropolitan Turf Association and
will give up bookmaking, according to com-
mon report among the gamblers yesterday.
Johnson is ill at his home at Forty-fifth
street. He had a slight operation per-
formed a few days ago and has been con-
fined to his bed since.

That Johnson has sold his membership
was practically admitted at the headquarters
of the association in West Twenty-sixth
street yesterday. It was said that it would
not become positively known until a meet-
ing of the club on Saturday. Two other
members of the association are said to have
sold their seats. Johnson got $3,500 for
his.

Johnson was quoted yesterd ay as saying

that he had lost $1,000,000 in the last year
afi that he had quit the ring for good
The first part of the statement, his friends
said, was probably exaggerated, although
they admitted that Johnson had been a
heavy loser. A well-known bookmaker
said:
“If Johnson has sold his seat no one be-
lieves that he will give up betting at the
racetiack He was a heavy loser last
year aad at one time during the summer
announced that he had retired from the
ring. He was back again in about three
weeks. Last he didn't make book
much, but bet heavily outside. It is proba-
ble that he will not make book at al! this
year and that is why he has sold his seat.”

Johnson has owned and been interested
in gambling houses in this and other cities.
Recently he got some notoriety by bringing
suit for $118,000 against the estate of the
late “Ted’ Hostetter of Pittsburg for
gambling debts. The suit was with drawn
and it is said that Johnson settled for $10,500.

As an illustration of Johnson's reckless
betting a bookmaker told this story yes-

ben - 4

“Johnson was making book in the old
days at Monmouth Park. One day old
Tea Tray was in a race at 10to 1 and the
favorite was 6to 5. Johnson took in all the
money he could handle on the favorite
and bet it on Tea Tray. The favorite was
ridden by Isaac aren who was drunk
and fell off at the h. Johnson won
about $100,000 on Tea Tray's victory.”

 

SAW A BIG FREIGHTER SINK.

 

Steamship Pisa Was Trying te Reach Her
When She Went Down.

The Sloman Line steamship Pisa, in yes-
terday from Hamburg after a strenuous
voyage of eighteen days, sighted on the
afternoon of Feb. 16, about 300 miles weat
of the mouth of the English Channel, a
freighter, about 400 feet long, apparently
abandoned and in a sinking condition.
Second Officer Fey, who was in charge of
the bridge, saw the frieghter about three
miles away. He headed for her and called
Capt. Fendt.

The freighter’s boats were gone and she
had only one mast standing. Her stern was
deep in the water. When the Pisa was
within about a mile and a half of the stran-
ger she sank stern first, leaving practically
no floating wreckage.

Capt. Fendt says he believes that some
passing vessel rescued the crew of the
sunken vessel.

 

PASSES FOR STATE OFFICIALS.

Proposed Law in Minnesota te Force Rail-
reads te Give Them.

St. Pav, Minn., March 3.—A bill was
introduced in both branches of the Legis-
lature to-day to compel the railroads of
the State to issue annual passes to members
of the Legislature and State officials. The
movement is said to be backed by the rail-
roads, and it is favored by the State Au-
ditor, who declares that the State will save
thousands of dollars a year.

The proposed law is the result of the aoc-
tion of the Northern Pacific road in sending
to the Legislators passes good only durin
the legislative sessions, ..any of whieh
were returned. Under present conditions
officials travel on passes and charge up
transportation against the State at 6 to
10 cents a mile. Under the proposed law
they could charge no mileage.

 

 

AID FOR A COLLEGE COURSE.
Barnard Trying to Put Ite Poor Stadent
Fund on a Permanent Basis.

An appeal has been issued to the grad-
uates of Barnard College to raise a fund for
needy students. In the past three years
the Students’ Aid Committee has proved of
great value, both in helping graduating
students to find places and in assisti:
students of limited means to derive the fu
benefit from their college course, unhaim-
pered by the problem of finding the cash to
make their way through college. It is
hoped to put the fund on a permanent
basis, with the idea of avoiding an appeal
to outside friends for support.

LIVE TOPICS ABOUT TOWN.

One of the city Magistrates who lives
on the West Side below the 50s discovered
a few days ago that a gambling house was
in full operation in the next street below
him. From a back window in his house
he could see through the rear windows into
the other house.

The Magistrate went around to the station
house and told the captain what he had
seen. That night the gambling house
was raided. The police got only three
prisoners, and no evidence. From his
own window the Magistrate saw the men
in the raided house going over the back
fence.

It so happened that the three_ prisoners
were arraigned before the same Magistrate
the next day. The police had no evidence
on which they could be held.

“Can't you bring me some one who has
seen gambling in this house?” asked the
Magistrate. “Can't you get the man who
tip) you off?”

he policeman explained that his captain
had said that the tip had been given to him
in confidence and that the name of the man
who had given it could not be made known.

“I know of one witness in this case whose
testimony 1 couldn't eee. remarked
the Magistrate. “But unfortunately I can't
call him. The prisoners are discharged.”

One of the railways to the West put out
a little sign in ite Broadway window the
other day. It read:

 

    
   
   
   
   
   
  
   
   
    
  
   
  
   

“The effect of that display is astonish-
ing,” said a Niagara hotel keeper who is
spending his summer profits in New York.
“Whenever that - 6 put out it fills up
all the hotels at Niagara and does even
better for the Buffalo hotels, for few of the

ood hotels at Niagara Falls are open at
this season. A large number of New York-
ere never mias a chance to see the falls in
the full glory of winter.”

Certain rumors appeal so strongly to New
York's ideas of the fitness of things that
they survive the most positive denials.
One instance of this occurred a year ago
when it was reported that a conspicuous
jewolry firm was to build a new establish-
ment on the site of a merchant prince's
former home. The idea pleased the persons
who heard it and though any such inten-
tion was formally denied by the firm the
rumor seemed too satisfactory not to be
true,and it was not downed until a build-
ing intended for quite another purpose
was rearad on the site in dispute.

Another popular rumor still survives in
spite of many denials and all lack of real
foundation. It was said some months

© that the three upper stories of a new
skyscraper were to be taken off because
the vibration felt there was so great that
none of the offices could be rented. There
was no vestige of truth in the rumor, but
New Yorkers liked to think that there was.
It seemed such a probable sort of a story,
and it had the ular “I told you so” char-
acter that le it liked.

So in spite of its falsity half the persons
who now pass the building observe with
an air of wisdom that the top stories are
to be removed. And they probably will
continue to do so. It seems as if folks
must always have something of the kind
to talk about.

 

Pat Sheedy, who is known as a gambler,
but seldom gets a chance to gamble in these
days, is in St. Louis watching the con-
struction of the World's Fair. Col. Sheedy
spent the Pan-American season at Buffalo,
but found no excitement excepting the
seizure by the police of some tools which
he had had no opportunity to use. If a
more “liberal” policy obtains at St. Louis,
however, Mr. Sheedy may be one of the
features of the fair.

A ragged woman who made every effort
to conoeal her features was before Magie-
trate Pool a few days ago, charged with
drunkenness. The Magistrate directed the
policeman on the bridge to take her hands

down.

“Discharged,” said the Magistrate, as
goon as he saw the prisoner’s face.

The court reporters knew that agitate
Pool was not in the habit of disc ging

risoners without @ hearing, so they as

im about it later.

“It was very simple,” eaid the
trate. “That worman was our cook a few
years ago, and a very good one, too. But
she would on a spree every few months.
Firally we had to discharge her, and I told
her then that some day she would come
to this. She was not without shame, you
see, for she tried to hide her face from me."_

Electric ambulances have not yet proved
themselves to be unqualified successes
for general use in New York. A surgeon
of one of the largest hospitals recently
had occasion to call for the hospital am-
bulance to take a patient from Fourteenth

street to the hospital to be operated upon
for appendicitis. This was at 7 o'clock
in the evening. At that time one of the
two ambulances was out of commission
and the other was being charged, After
the batteries of the latter had been filled it
was found that something was wrong.

It took two hours after the time the sur-

n telephoned to get the vehicle started
Geantime the surgeon arrived at the hos-
vital expecting to find his patient ready
a him on the operating ta ne. An hour
later the surgeon in charge of the ambulance
telephoned that it was stuck on ite way
back with the patient, and that all tinkering
was of no avail to get it to move. More-
over the patient was getting worse and
transfer to another ambulance was out of
the question.

The night clerk of the hospital went to
the reacue by telephoning to the hotel
where he knew there were electric cabs
One of these towed the disabled ambulance
in. Then, about midnight the potions
was put under the knife fortunately with
successful results.

 

A small Harlem girl was sent by her
mother to apologize to a schoolmate with
whom she had crommed words on the way
home. The mother of the insulted child
admit ted the bearer of the apology to the
ports and the other child war brought

The Pianola and the Orchestrelle embody a principle which
makes them available to every one.
And while a good many are owned by musicians, the majority
of them belong to people who knew nothing of music before they

bought them.

The figures given above strikingly illustrate the change
which the purchase of either of these instruments makes in the life

of the average

rson who buys one,

Instead of being utterly dependent on others for all they
enjoy of music, they are suddenly endowed with the ability to

study and execute a vast collection of musical com

sitions.

‘This library of music embraces every class and variety, from
heaviest classics to lightest song, and increases at the rate of
about two hundred numbers a month.

It is startling to think of people who only yesterday were
unable to play a note on any instrument, to-day playing with taste
and perfect execution such music as is found in this month's

bulletin.

Massenet’s Scenes de Bal., Op. 17.
Schubert’s Moment Musical, Op. 94, No. 6.
Brahms’ Walzer, Op. 39, from 1 to 16 inclusive.
Mendelssohn’s Prelude and Fugue, Op. 35, the greatest
composition of its kind since Bach’s time.
Dvorak’s Slavisch Tanz, Op. 46, No 7.
And interspersing such a program, with selections from the

“Sultan of Sulu,” “

aire,” “Mr. Pickwick” and “ Peggy from Paris,” ete.

These

show the different kinds of music the bulletin contains.

How the Pianola and Orchestrelle play this music, and what
the principle on which they are constructed, which makes it pos-
sible for any one to play them, and with them imitate the most
artistic playing of the best musicians; cannot be realized or seen
except by closest personal inspection.

The merely curious are cordially invited to visit our new
exhibition rooms, and are sure to be amply repaid for the trouble

of doing so.

The cost of the Pianola is $250.
Purchasable by monthly payments.

$200 to $2,500.

  
  

 

MISS GLEASON TO GO TO COURT.

 

Will Testify on March 20 Concerning Her | A
E. G. Gilmore & Eugene Tompkins, Props. &

Father's Estate.

Miss Jessie Gleason, daughter of the late
Patrick J. Gleason, former Mayor of old
Long Island City, will appear before Surro-
gate Daniel Noble at Jamaica on March 20
and apply for the appointment of an ad-
ministrator for her father's estate. This
announcement was made by friends of the
former Mayor and his daughter in Long {|
Island City yesterday. Dr. Neil O. Fitch |
of Astoria says he has heard from Mise ;
Gleason indirectly. She is supposed to be
in Cortland, N. ¥., and has evaded service |
of papers from the Surrogates’ Court ever |
since Dr. Fitch made application for letters
of administration on the Gleason estate.

Dr. Fitch, who was Gleason's physician
for quite ten years, asserts itively that
he left a fortune and a will. No will has
been filed and its whereabouts are unknown.
Some say that it is in the possession of Miss
Gleason..

Stocks, bonds and other securities are
said to make up the volume of Mr. Gleason's
eupecoes concealed wealth. He qpeced
implicit confidence in his lawyer, P.
Burke, and it is said that the greens tangle

y

is due to the sudden death of the latter.
