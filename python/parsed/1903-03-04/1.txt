ALDRICH BILL DISPLACED

AFTER MR. ALDRICH HAD MADE
A STATEMENT OF ITS ORJECTS.

Be Said It Was Not a Party Measure, but
® Business Proposition Intended te
Prevent Money Panics—The Philip-
pines Tarif Redection Btit Takes Its
Place as the Order of Businces—-Omnl-
bus Public Baiktings Bill Passed.

WagHinaton, March 3.—When the Sen-
ate met a 11 o'ciock to-day the con-
ference report on the Presicential Pro-

tection bill was ¢alled up and discussed,
but at 1 o'clock the Aldrich bill was laid
before, the Senate as unfinished business.
A parliamentary struggle for precedence
between the advocates of these and other
bille ensued, in the course — Mr.

roposed a progamme of successive
rok as Omnibus Statehood bill, the
Aldrich bill, the Anarciry bill, the Philip-
pine bill and the Pure Food bill. The hair
(Mr. Perkins), ruled Mr. Quay’s proposal
out of order, and Mr. Aldrich then made

this statement on his bill:

I desire, before this bill passes from con-
sideration of the Senate, to say a few words
in reply to critteisms passed upon it by Sen-
ators on the ogher side IT was surprised
by the vehemers and zealous denunciation
of national hanks by the Senator from Ala-
bama and the Senator from Kentucky. It is
an echo of the Democratic attacks in the days
of the war. The national bank system if
established firmly, vot by the consent of
the Democratic party, but in spite of all ite
attacks. It is established because the in-
teresta of the country «‘emand it und no party
can change it.

Some Democratic S?nators found fault
with this bill and charged that it conferre d
new fights and privileges apon Hational bauks
I deny that in toto liwre is not a word,
not a syllable in the bill conferring any ad-
ditional right or privilege on the national
banks. On the contrary, ceTiain restrictions
ure imposed by the bill thet do not now exist
in law. It relicves the country from the
danger of inferference by one man with the
finances and of causing a stringency that
will injure all the industries af the country
The bill proposes a plan to relieve the country
in this particular This is no new policy.
It was approved by Republican and Demo-
cratic Scerctaries of the Treasury, including
Mr. Fairchild and Mr. Carlisle. ;

We are following the same policy of the
Government indorsed from the time of Wash-
ington to Roosevelt, including Andrew dack-
son, who was mentioned by the Senator from
Arkansas. There are two restrictive pro-
visions in this bill which the Democrats are
opposing. One of these is the placing of
liens on the assets of the banks in which Gov-
ernment money is deposited, and the other
ie the colle@tion of interest on the deposits
Both of these are objected to by the Demo-
cerats in this chamber They are willing to
wive every privilege and immunity to national
banks that they heretofore enjoyed, without
any restrictions, but they are not willing to
agree to the restrictions we now propos”

It is contended by the Senator from Colo-
rado and others that there is a great surplus
in the Treasury that will be turned over to
the national banks, He contuses the surplus
of revenues with the surplus in the Treasury
and includes in his surplus the gold reserve
of $150,000,000. No condsiderable body of
men in the United States can be found who
will favor the reduction offthe gold reserve
That is the rock and foundation of the gold
standard, If there is anything which the
American people have settled it is the ques-
tion of the monetary standard, and you could
net get half a dozen votes even in this cham-
ber against reducing the gold reserve

Mr. Aldrich gave the figures of the actual
receipts and expenditures of the Govern-
ment and the condition of the Treasury
and continued:

Thefe is no such surplus in the Treasury as
is claimed. If the Senator from Colorado
is correct as to the expenditures expected to
be made in carrying out the treaties with
Colombia and Cuba we may have a deficiency
Instead of a surplus within the next fiscal

year

Our firet dut T hear
the charees made that this is in the interests
of the @itional banks, but T repeat what I
said last night, that the only word from any
Bitional bank on the subiect | have received
was a letter fe it. The banks of Chicugo

is to the Treasury

and other citles are also objecting, on the
grown that they cannot make « profit on
jovernment money under the plan proposed,
The gitional banks of the country have no
right to say to us “you must defeat this bill
inless you make it profitable to us to handle
Gove ome, Genoslts "It is impossible,
unless the Republican licy is changed, to
joerense these deposit» largely We have re-
duced the revenues in this Congres® §160,000,-
0 Gand we will continue to reduce the surplus
whenever it exeeeda a reasonable limit of
eafety. The Republican party has never
proved recreant to its trust in managing the
financial affuirs of the country, and it will not
be reereant now

Our purpose in this bill is not to increase
the deposite tn National Banks It is to give
to the Treasury the control of customs re-
ceipts, the sare as other revenpes, and to
turn them in times of stringeney and Btrena,
into the channels of trade promptly and ¢flect-
ually for the relief of that stringency. It is
not the purpose to turn all this money over
to the national banks, hucit is the purpose to
take away from them the right to use Govern-
ment money wlthout paving for that use

The bill includes other features, among
them the authority to accept other securi-
ties than Government bonds for the deposit
of public money. This provision is made
for two reasons, one being that the high
price of tiovernment bonds renders it im-
possible end impracticable to furnish them
as security for these deposits, and the other
reason te that In some parts of the country
tovrnment bonds are not readily obtain-
able, while first clits. local securities are at
band, whieh for the purposes of security
are a6 good us any bonds

It ix char@ed by some Democratic Sena-
tors that there is a proposed change of the
status of the deposits in national banks
Can any Senator, reading this bill, seriously
contend that these deposits are on exactly
the same footing as before that they are

yable on demand? The Seeretary of the
Rrensury ean call on tbe banks for Chis mone
ff any time, and they are required to furnish
{ on such demand, «Xaeth: as under the
present low Hut if the banw faile to return
the deposits, or if there is a deficiency in
the sule of the securities, thin bill gives an
additional security which is oot mn the present
law. The Reoretary of the Treasury is an-
thorized to sell the current
bank and thus coverany def
arise

! ried it on for fourteen weeks for the pur-
| pose of killing the Statehood bill. e
opposition was organized largely by two
men, one of them the leader whose bill
has just been defeated. If he could have
looked a little further into the future he
would have icnown that he was killing his
own bill when he was digjjng the grave of
the Statehood bill.”
PHILAAPINES BILL ene ad »

Mr. Lodge explained the purport of the
Philippine Orarilt bill. Great hardships
had stricken the Philippine people in 4
visitation of cholera and other troubles
not caused by men. Congress ha
given them $8,000,090 to assist them to re-
stock their farms ane on their feet,
but mere help ~~ p ood He appecled
for the passa, of the bill on groun
humanity. The importations of sugar and
tobacco would be a small matter in the
United States, but it would mean much to
the Filipinos. After some further dis-
cussion the Senate at, 5:30 went Into execu-
tive session and at 6 o'clock took a recess
until 8.

Two items of business transacted during
the session were agresesen to the confer-
ence report on the una Civil bill and the
relief of Mr. Bailey of Texas, at his own
request, from duty on the Committee on
Foreign Relations and the appointment
of Mr. Clark (Dem., Mon.) in his place.

After the executive seasion, Mr, Foraker
made another attempt to pass the bill ex-
tending the irrigation laws of the United
States to Hawaii, as a substitute for the
Hawaiian Ditch Company bill. This time
he succeeded.

Mr. Kittredge (Rep., 8. D.) called up the
bi!) to effectuate the provisions of an inter-
national convention fer the protection of
industrial property. The bill refers to the
issuance of patent rigias, making the prac-
tice of the Patent Office conform to the

yrovisions of the interivationa! convention.

he bill was passed. .

A bill was passed for the relief of home-
stead settlers in Alabama.

‘After recess the House bill providing for
a Delegate to the House from Porto Rico
was passed as amended by the Senate yes-
terday. The amendment strikes out all
reference toa Delegeze and provides for a
commission to inveraigate Roman Catholic
land titles, the colamission to report to
Congress.

Mr. Fairbanks (Reo., Ind.) presented the
conference report on the omnibus Public
Buildings bill.
Mallory (Dem., Fla.) said the Senate cou-
ferees had agreed to tlre House amendments
only under the threat that unless they did
so the whole bill would fail, and Mr.Warren
(Rep., Wyo.) tendered his apology for
forcing upon the Senate the agreement
“under the grand bluff” of the House, the
report was agrecd to.

Mr. Penrose offered a joint resolution,
which was agreed to, transferring to the Sec-
retary of Commerce and Labor, on July 1,
1903, all authority, power and jurisdiction
given the Secretary of the Treasury by the
immigration bill.

DISPUTE BETWEEN CARMACK AND HOAR.

Consideration of the Philippine Tariff
bill was then resumed and Mr. Carmack
(Dem., Tenn.) spoke on the bill. He re-
ferred to the objection made by Mr. Oxnard,
the beet sugar manufacturer, to the bill
and said: “If Uongress cannot pase a
bill without first obtaining the consent of
Mr. Oxnard it is time that the fact. should
be known. Mr. Aldrich charged that his
financial bill had been talk to death.
The Senator talked his own bill to death
through the filisuster on the Statehood
bill. Other bills will fail. The senior
Senator from Mnassachusetts has a_ bill,
but he has said that if there was to be a
debate upon it he would have to abandon
e.

Mr. Hoar—The Senator is as mistaken
as any benighted individual ever was
I never said anything of the kind. [Laugh-

tor] 7.

Mr. Carmack—The Senator said sub-

stantially whet T have said.

Mr. Hoar—I never anid verbally or sub-
stantially anything of the kind. [Laugh-
ter.]

Mr. Carmack—Well, I shall not discuss
the matter with the Senator, as he is about
+o lose his temper or get crusty. He is a
young man with a quick temper, some-
times.

Mr. Hoar (a moment later)—I have got
from the official reporter, verbatim, et litera-
tim, what I said. [{Laughter.] ]

He read his statement and then with

reat vehemence thrust his finger toward

Mir. Carmack and shouted: “That's what

Lsaid.” [Great laughter.)

Mr. Carmack—The Senator has got the
wrong page. [Laughter.|

Mr. Hoar—The Senator has got the wrong
story. [Laughter.]

Mr. Carmack then sat down and Mr.
McEnery (Dem., La.) spoke against the
bill.

Mr. Lodge demanded a roll call on the
committee amendment raising the tariff
on Philippine sugar and tobacco from 25
per cent. to 50 per cent. of the Dingley
rate. The amendment was agreed to, 29
to 19

The vote was about to be taken on the
bill when Mr. Dubois began a speech against
it

HOUSE PROCEEDINGS.

Mr. Cannon Explains Why Item for Post

WASHINGTON, March 3.—When the House

met at 11 o'clock this morning Mr. Richard-

son (Dem., Tenn.) again made his point of
no quorum, a point which he has raised
every morning for the past week.

Mr. Payne (Rep., N. ¥.) demanded that
the House proceed to vote on the question
pending when the House took a recess last
night, the conference report on the Immi-
gration bill) The Speaker ruled that the
presence of a quorum was not necessary
to comply with the demand for a vote

The rol! was called and the report was
adopted, 187 to Il

Mr. Cannon (Rep. LL) presented the
conference report on the Sundry Civil
Appropriation bill, Mr. Kichardson = in-

ment be read

started out to annihilate the eotopye, but
they concluded by inviting J. rpont
Morgan to the White House and holding a
love feast. Hanna and Morgan were
ratified and the whole thing made satis~
factory to the Administration. The
Rough Rider in the White House has lost
hie spurs,” said Mr. Little, “and has put on
the habits of Hanna and Morgan.” | The
situation, he said, reminded him of the
prophecy of Isaiah, that “the wolf also
shall dwell with the lamb and the leopard
shall lie down with the kid; and the calf
and the young lion and the fatling to ther,
and a little child shall lead them; the cow
and, the bear shall feed and their young
oneé shell play together, and the lion sha
eat straw like the ox.” [Great laughter.|
The bill was passed on a roll cal
Mr. Latimer (Dem., 8. C.) moved to sus-
nd the rules and a bill to enable the
Fhomas Jefferson Memorial Association to
have made at the Philadelphia Mint medal-
lions of Thomas Jefferson.
On roll call the bill was , 187 to 3.
Mr. Mercer (Rep., Neb.), called 3 the
conference report on the omnibus blic
Buildings bill, and it was adopted 202 to 8.
Mr. Hill (Rep., Conn.) called up a confer-
ence report ona bill affecting national banks
in cities of 25,000 inhabitants. Pending
a vote on the report, Mr. Payne moved a
recess until 10 o'clock. ;
Pending the roll call on this motion, a
little excitement occurred, recalling the
outbreak on the night that war was de-
clared to exist with Spain, when Mr. Bart -
lett of Georgia and Mr. Brumm of Penn-
sylvania engaged in a book throwing =
sode. Mr. rilett was making objection
to the proceedinge, and much turbulence
ensued. Some one on the Republican side
shouted to Bartlett to sit down coupled
with an irritating epithet. Bartlett was
up in the air at once. Thinking the re-
mark came from Mr. Reeder of Kansas, he
angrily retorted in highly unparliamentary
language, and was only restrained from
rushing over to the Republican side by the
exertions of Mr. Williams of Missiasipn'.
While all this was going on, Mr. Reeder
was in good humor, laughing at the fracas,
but when he learned that Bartlett's out-
burst was against him he lost his temper
and wanted revenge. However, nothin
more serious than lingual assaults occurred,
and the vote being taken on the motion for
/ a recess, it was agreed to.

When the House came to order at 10
o'clock the galleries were filled with spec-
tators to witness the last night session of
the Fifiy-seventh Congress. The east
gallerv, reserved for members’ families,
resembled a theatre dress circle at a fashion-
able and popular performance.

The pending question was the conference
report on the bill providing for the eatab-
lishment of national banks in cities of not
less than 25,000 inhabitants, and it was agreed
to, 19 to 18.

Gen. Grosvenor moved to suspend the
rules and pass his bill to give preference
in the appointment to civil positions in the
Government service to persons discharged
for disability from the military and naval
service, or who served in the Union army
from 18f1 to 1965

The bill was passed 170 to 48.

Veneznela Wants Preferential Issue Settied
Outside, to Save Cost.

WasHiInaoton, March 3.—An effort is
being made to adjust the question of pref-
erential treatment arising out of the Vene-
zuelan troubles without a reference to The
Hague Court of Arbitration.

If the question goes to The Hague Vene-
zuela will be obliged to pay her share of
the cost of the arbitratien. To this she
objects as a useless expenditure of money,
and is now endeavoring to arrange for an
adjusiment of the preferential payment

FOR FIVE NEW BATTLESHIPS.

Conferecs Agree on Two of 18,000 Tons
and Three of 16,000 Tons.

Wasninaton, March 3.—Three battle
ships of 16,000 tons each and two of 13,000
tons each ie the increase of the navy author-
ized by the Naval Appropriation bill, agreed
upon by the conferees to-night. The con-
ferees have been in deadlock for several
days, the House insisting on its provision

for four of 12,000 tons each
provided for one first class armored cruiser
and the Senate for two

A compromise was finally reached tc-
night for five vessels, ax stated above, ana
the cruisers were dropped out entirely. The
Board of Naval Constructors and the navy
officials generally urged that the new battle-
ships be of the larger size, while Admiral
Dewev stood almos* alone for the 12,00c-
ton ships, contending that they were ae
effemive as the 16.000-ton vessels

The most important provision of the bill,
as far as the personnel of the navy is con-
cerned, is the great increase in the number
of officers and midshipmen authorized.
In the line there are sawed thirty addi-
tional Lieutenant Commanders, fifty addi-
tional Lieutenanta and such additional
Lieutenants of the junior grade and of
Ensigns as may quatily, and the number of
midshipmen at the Naval Academy is
doubled by permitting each Senator and
Representative in Congress to appoint two
instead of one, this plan to remain in effect
until June 3), 1013. The age of admission
to the Academy is raised from 15 to 16 years,
with maximum of 20 years, as at present

The increase in the staff corps is five
additional! medical nepectors, 25 additional
surgeons, 120 additional assistant surgeons,
2 additional pay inspectors, 36 additions
paymarters, 26 additional passed assistant
and ussistant paymasters, 20 additional
naval constructors, | additional civil engi-
neer and 12 assistant civil engineers

PANAMA CANAL OPTION OURS.

BARGAIN CLOSED WITH THE NEW
CANAL COMPANY.

We Take Actual Possession of the (Canal
Properties and the Paname Rallroad
When the Treaty Is Ratified by the
Senate and the $40,000,000 Paid.

WASHINGTON, March 3,—Attorney-Gen-
eral Knox made the official announcement
after the Cabinet meeting to-day that the
Government had closed its option for the
purchase of the rights and properties of the
Panama Canal Company and that the bar-
gain holds until the treaty shall be ratified
by the Senate. Final action was taken
to-day in the following letter:

Hon. P. ©. Knox, Attorney-General:

Sin: Pursuant to authority upon me con-
ferred by the president of the New Panama
Canal Company, 1 beg leave to state that the
acceptance made by the President of the
United States through your enblegram
of the 7th ult, of the offer of the company
as contained in its cablegrams of Jan. 9 and
11, 1903, addressed to the president of the
Isthmian Canal Commiasion, is hereby ac-
cepted as being in conformity with said offer.
lam, sir, very respectfully yours,

WILLIAM NELSON CROMWELL.
General counsel New Panama Canal Company

Mr. Cromwell said to a SwuN_ reporter
after his conference with the Attorney-
General:

“This action absolutely assures to the
United States the acquisition and com-
pletion of the Panama Canal, as well as
the cortrol of the railroad. The rest is
only a matter of detail and of time. The
only delay now in the taking of actual
nossession by the United States arises

rom the necessary formalities of ratifica-

tion of the pending treaty by the United
States and Colombia; but in the meantime
the Panama Canal Company will continue
thé work of construction upon the Isthmus
in accordance with the plan of the Isthmian
Canal Commission and keep the working
forces in steady operation up to the day
that the United States takes actual charge.

“As to Colombia, my advices satisfy
me that while the treaty has disappointed
their expectations in several respecte it
will be ratified in ita present form by the
new Congress, for which elections are now
taking place. The Panama Canal has
now become the American canal.”

GRANT SEEKS REINSTATEMENT.

The Dismissed Inspector and Capteins
Stephenson and (iannon Get Writs.

Writs of certiorari for the review of their
dismissals by Police Commissioner Greene
were obtained yesterday by ex-Police In-
spector Donald Grant and ex-Captains John
T. Stephenson and James Gannon. The
writs were issued by Supreme Court Jus-
tice O'Gorman, on the application of Ter-
ence McManus of the law firm of Black,

The applications for the writs were based
on the usual grounds of unfairness and
{ajustice, but the point was also raised that
the District Attorney had interfered in the
trials in an unwarranted manner. Gannon
adds that he was dis:nissed because he did
not use criminal methods in deteoting crime.

inspector, when Jerome ordered raids in

the precinct as a result of which both were
dismissed.

ADMIRAL CROWNINSHIELD OUT
HIS FLAG LIEUTENANT,
ALSO RESIGNS.

‘

The Chicage. Assigned Crowninshield as

Flagship and He Was Left Without an
Armor-clad—Both Had a Part in Schley
Couart—Cetten to European Station.

WASHINGTON, March 3.—Surprise and
much comment were caused among naval
officers to-day over the announcement of
the Navy Department that Rear Admiral
A. 8. Crowninshield, commander-in-chief
of the United States naval force on the

} European station, had applied for retire-
ment. Rear Admiral Charles 8. Cotton,
commandant cf the Norfolk Navy YarJ,
will e:cceed him.

There was a disposition to attribute
Admiral Crowninshield's action to some
sensational reason, and this feeling was
increased when it became known later that
Lieut. Henry H. Ward, his flag lieutenant,
had resigned from the naval service.

The intimacy of Admiral Crowninahield
and Lieut. Ward, and the fact that the name
of the younger officer had usually been

coupled with that of the older in the attacks |’

upon the Navy Department growing out
of the Schley controversy, made it seem
probable to many naval men that some
Joint cause was reaponsible for the course
which they have pursued.
It is doubtless true that Lieut. Ward's
resignation was a direct consequence of
Admiral Crowninshield's decision to leave
the active list. Lieut. Ward cast his lot
with the Admiral many years ago and they
have been closely associated throughout
the many hard battles that have been fought
by Crowninshield against his enemies and
| critics, In W dmiral Crowninshield
always had a devoted and resourceful
henchman, and there were many who re-
garded the younger man as essed of
ability which would carry him to the highest
honors in the naval service.
For the past eight months there have been
rumors that Admiral Crowninshield in-
tended toapply for retirement. The original
rumor was coupled with a statement that
he would not retain command of the Euro-
an squadron if it were combined with the
North Atlantic and the South Atlantic
squadrons for the winter manceuvres in the
West Indies under the supreme command
of Rear Admiral F. J. Higginson.
There had been a quarrei between Admira\
Higginson and Admiral Crowninshield just
before the Spanish war. They had been
lifelong friends. It was said that opposition
by Crowninshield to giving Higginson com-
mand of the battleship Massachusetts was
at the bottom of the affair.
When last winter’s joint manmuvres
were first pro it was supposed that
Admiral igginson would be the fleet
e>mmander, but this assignment was given
to Admiral Dewey. When they met in the
West Indies. Higginson and Crowninshield
made up their differences and became
good friends again.
From what can be learned here the in-
dications are that Admira! Crowninshield’s
desire to retire was due partly to the action
of the Navy Department in assigning his
flagship, the new battleship Tiftnois, to
the North Atlantic squadron, and direct-
ing him to transfer his flag to the cruiser
Chicago, a much inferior vessel.
A new arrangement of squadrons left
Admiral Crowninshield without a single-
armor-clad, ali of which were transfe-red
to the North Atlantic station. Admiral
Crowninshiefd protested. Senator Platt
of New York «aw President Roosevelt
in his behalf, but the President declined
to interfere. Secretary Moody finally sent
a telegram to Admiral Crown'nshield, di-
recting him to transfer his flag to the
Chicago. He did so and returned to the
European station.
Just after eee back to Europe Admiral
Crowninshield sent a request to be retired,
but for some reason it was not acted upon.
The second application was dated Algiers,
Feb. 3. In response to this Secretary
Moody to-day telegraphed Admiral
Crowninshield at Messina, Italy, that the
request would be granted and that the
Navy Denertment regretted his action.
Admiral Crowninshield was born in New
York and was appointed to the Naval
Acaderay frém that S tate in 1860. He saw
service in the Civil War. In 1870 he was
appointed principally through the influence
of Senator Platt to be Chief of the Bureau
of Navigation, the most sought after and
important office in the naval establishment.
He held the place throughout the Spanish
and Philippine wars. He was reappointed
for another term of four years in 1901, but
volunteered for sea duty in 1902, and was
assigned to comman:! the European station.
It was while he was serving as Chief of
the Bureau of Navigation that he wrote
the famous order directing Admiral Dewey
to seek and destroy the Spanish equadron
in the Philippines
Partisans of Admiral Schley accused
Admiral Crowninshield of being at the
bottom of what they termed the “con-
spiracy” against that officer. He was bit-
terly attacked by the Schley preas. His
sup! enmity to Schley was attributed
to the alleged action of a court of inquiry,
of which Schley was president, agueutes
(o investigate charges that Admi Crown-
inshield did not keep an adequate supply
of coal and oil on his ship, the old battle-
ship Maine. Scaley and Crowninshield
were then Captains. Schley commanded
the armored cruiser New York, flagship
of Rear Admiral Bunce, to whose squadron
the Maine was attached
The charges were preferred by Bunce,
who appointed Schley and two other Cap-
tains to investigate. In the heat of the
Schley controversy that officer's friends
and newspaper defenders allege that the
charges egainst Crowninshicld had been
found proved by the court of which Schley
was president, and that Crowninshield was
trying to injure aaeney for having done
his duty. As a matter of fact, the court ex-
operated Crowninshield, and Schley signed
the report
Actniral Crowninshield’s friends aay that
his only opposition to Schley came from a
firm belief that Schley had been guilty of
reprehensible conduct in the Santiago cam-
paiagn, aud that hie failure to apply for a
court of inquiry to investigate his record
had brought reproach upon the navy

Children’s Shoes.

Long experience in selling Children’s Shoes, has
taught us just what hinds are best adapted for the correct

training and fitting of young

feet. Oar scientific lasts—

obtainable nowhere else—have been planned upon the lines

of experience.

Not only are the materials used in our

Children’s Shoes chosen with the greatest possible care,
but we carry by far the largest variety of all sizes and

widths.

Hence, we can guarantee complete satisfaction in

every particular—shape, style, fit, wear.

Is it a wonder that so many entire shoe-outfits,

“‘school’’ or ‘‘dress’’ for boy or girl, are invariably

selected here?

NEW PHASE OF TAYLOR MURDER.

Peter Yerkins, Uncie of Mrs. Taylor, Ar-
rested as a Participant in the Crime.
MonrTiceLLo, N. Y., March 3.—Evidence

discovered by District Attorney Frank S.

Andersen, tending to show that Peter

Yerkins, an uncle of Mrs. Lafayette Taylor

in jail here charged with shooting her hus-

band and burning his body, was unduly
intimate with the accused wife, that he
urged her to kill her husband and promised
to buy an adjacent farm and give it to her
if she did, resulted to-day in the arrest of

Yerkins charged with murder in the first

degree.

At the examination of Mrs. Taylor, prior
to her commitment, Yerkine was an. im-

rtant witness. @ swore that Mrs.

aylor had confeased her crime to him,
that he understood her when she said her
husband was a “red dog,” a term used by
the mountaineers in referring to a mur-
dered man, and that he had furnished
paint with which she obliterated the blood.
stains on the kitchen table. It appears that

Taylor was jealous of Yerkins’s attentions

to his wife and that they came to blows

on one occasion,

The daughter Ida will be the principal
witness at Yerkins’s examination to-mor-
row. She told a connected story of the
crime the events leading up to it. Ver-
kins réfused to say anything about the crime,
but immediately called in a lawyer.

AUTOS TO BREAK A STRIKE.

Former Trolley Men in Waterbury Pian
te Use Them—Violence Continues.

Watersrry, Conn., March 3.—Torpedoes
on the tracks made a great noise at 530
o'clock this morning when the trolley cars
appeared. Last night a motorman, to
save his own life, was forced to leave his
car, revolver in hand, and threaten a crowd
after a fusillade of stones had hit him, in-
juring his face.

Grout Out for Mayoralty Nemination.

It is the opinion of some close political
omervers in Brooklyn that Comptroller
Edward M. Grout is a candidate for the
regular Democratic nomination for Mayor,
and would decline a renomination for his
present office on a fusion ticket. Col.
Michael J. Dady, who not only knows most
of the secrets in the Republican camp, but
aleo to keep himeaelf tty well
posted on Democratic affairs, said yesterday
that Mr. Grout was an aspirant for the
Mayoralty nomination and would not ac-
cept any minor Mr. James Shevlin,
as the keaman of the Democratic
organization, said that so far the matter
of Mr. Grout's candidacy had not been
discussed by the managers

NO BUILDINGS OVER 150 FEET.

Alderman Would Limit Their Height and
Scatter Population.

Alderman Downing of Brooklyn has drafted
an ordinance for the restriction of buildings,
to be hereafter erected in the city, to a
height of 150 feet. In presenting the or-
dinance at yesterday's meeting of the
board Mr. Downing said it would help the
firemer. and would also benefit other bor-
oughs at the expense of Manhattan.

When the people can't spread up they
will have to spread out.

The matter was referred to the Com-
mittee on Buildings.

GREENE ON PETTY BLACKMAIL

Dismisses Policeman Alwell and Writes
a Letter to the Force.

Policeman Peter F. Alwell of the Church
street station was dismissed from the force
yesterday by Commissioner Greene. Al-
well, who was tried before Deputy Com-
missioner Ebstein last week, was accused
of having taken candy from a pushcart
pedler and of having tried to extort a small
sum of money from him. In dismissing
Alwell Commissioner Greene sent a letter
to be read in all station houses in which
he said:

A more contemptible exhibition on the part
ofa patrolman than that shown by pitrolmin
Alwell can hardly be imagined. He has dis-
graced his uniform: and unfortunately it is
believed by the public that he is not the only
one on the police force who has been guilt)
of this cowardly oppression of pushcart ped-
fers. I appeal to the honest and self-respect -
ing members of the force to coOperate wit!
me in driving out the men who thus disgrace
their uniform. Such parties cannot exist
without their being known to a large number
of the members of the force; and if this petty
stealing is regarded in its proper Heht by
members of the force they will not associate
with any one guilty of it, and will promptly
report any one suspected of it.

GREENE APPROVES OF GORMAN.

Says the Captain Did Right in Making the
Dragnet Raids.

Police Commissioner Greene gave out
dome figures yesterday to show that a larger
percentage of convictions had resulted
from the arrests in the two months he has
been in office than in the same perioa in
1902,

Gen. Greene also had this to say about

Magistrate Crane's criticism of Capt. Gor-
man for making 125 prisoners in the raids
on Saturday night:

*I fully approve of what Capt. Gorman
did. He warrants for every one of the

reons arrested and they were all of the
owesat character. Cant. Gorman acted
quite within his duty.”
