NURSE WORE A WHITE DRESS.

ONE CAUSE OF NURSES STRIKE
AT EYE AND EAR INFIRMARY,

Strikers Were All Graduate Nurses and
Wore Uniformse--They Also Say That
They Objected to the New Head
Nurse—Dr. Derby Gets New Nurses.

‘The nine nurses who went out of the
New York Eye and Ear Infirmary in @ body
on Saturday last struck because a nurse,
who they thought was favored, wore @
white dress, while the rest of them had to
wear uniforms. The story of that cause
of the trouble came from Dr. Richard H.
Derby, head surgeon of the hospital,
yesterday

The nurses wouldn't say anything about
that or anything else connected with the
strike. They were too busy fixing up their
headquarters in a flat at 136 East Seven-
teenth street and looking for jobs to do
any talking for publication. When a re-
porter of ‘THE SuN called there yesterday
afternoon a tall young woman opened the
door, ani in response to a request for the
nuraes’ side of the story, screamed to the
othera:

“Have we got
reporter?”

“No,” answered about eight voices.

“We've got something to deny, haven't
we?” asked the tall one

“No,” answered the chorus.

Dr. Derby gave part of their secret away,
however, He said that a white dress had
made a good deal of the trouble. According
to Dr. Derby, when Miss Stewart came from
the Presbyterian Hospital to act as head
nuree she brought with her Mrs. Field as
an assistant. Mrs. Field, who is not a
graduate nurse, wore a white dress instead
of the regulation uniform and pretty soon
the other nurses began to worry about it.

Finally, Dr. Derby said, Mrs. Muchmore
asked that Mrs. Field should be diacharged
because she wore the white dress. r.
Derby said he couldn't discharge her for
that. Then Mrs. Muchmore asked the
doctor to order her to take off the offending
garment,and he wouldn't do that either,
Then came the strike.

Though the nurses wouldn’t talk, a friend
of theirs who has been mentioned as being
concerned in the trouble told what she
had heard the etrikers say.

“The nurses told me,” she said, “that
they objected to having Miss Stewart boss
thein. Now, of course, I don't know but
I have heard that when she first came she
criticised pretty severely and the nurses
aidn't like it. I know that they planned
to leave the hospital for several days be-
fore they went and had no idea of sending
any notice of their resignation to Miss
Stewart. They didn't want to recognize
her at all, but I prevailed upon them and
they sent word to her that they wouldn’t
report for work on Saturday, and sent
their resignations to Dr. Derby.”

Dr. Derby has sent to almost every avail-
able place to get nurses to take the atrikers’
pyacee and some of them arrived yesterday.
fore are expected from Boston to-day or
to-morrow.

NO STORAGE BATTERY PATENTS,

Antes May Benefit by the Expiry ef the
Last One Vesterday.

The fourth and last of the sweeping
patents on storage battery electrodes
which were obtained seventeen years ago
hy Charles F. Brush, the inventor of the first
aro light, dynamo and the first commer-
cially valuable arc light, expired yesterday,
This means that the manufacture of the
cheapest and best kind of lead stor-
age batteries may be taken up by a num-
ber of electric concerns which have so
far been kept out of the field by the
Electric Storage Battery Company of
Philadelphia, the holder of the Brush

patente.

The patents were unusually wide in scope,
covering practically every kind of storage
battery in which were used pasted lead
plates and compelling all rival concerns to
employ the slower and oostlier Planté
process. They have been contested in the
courts repeatedly and have always been
upheld. The outlay of money in attack-
ing and defending them is said to have
been enormous

Applications for all four of the patents
were originally made in 1881 and three
were grented at once. The fourth was
held up by an interference and was not
issued untill March 3, 1886. This had the
effect of giving all the patents an additional
five-year term of life

William Hand Browne, Jr., technical
editor of the Klectrical Review, said yester-
day that he cid not believe that the expira-
tion of the last Brush patent would enable
=mall firms to take up the production of
pasted lead plates, as this required costly
special machinery Nor did he hope
that any great lowering in the cost of stor-
age batteries would resull, but he expected
that the firms hitherto employing the
Planté autogenous process would desert
it for the Brush process, which would re-
sult in an improvement of the quality
of the batteries

“The automobile manufacturers will
profit more than anybody else,” he said
“Lighter and better batteries for motor
cars will undoubtedly appear. It is aleo
likely that the highly developed products
of European firm. will be imported. The
prices of the motor cars taay be made
more reasonable in this way wh le at the
~uine time their quality is improved The
result of this, of course, Will be @ further
inerease in their populaniy *

it wae ale suggested yesterday that the
expiration of the Brush patent will clear

he way entirely for the new Edison battery
«hieh has long been heralded Lut which
hus not yet been pul on the market
