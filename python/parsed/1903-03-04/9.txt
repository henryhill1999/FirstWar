Turspat, March 3.

At the opening of the Stock Exchange
this morning the professional speculators
who have recently been active in attacking
the market were inclined, upon the an-
nouncement from Washington that the
Aldrich bill stood no chance of passing
Congreas, to take whatever profits there
were accruing as the result of their ven-
tures. During the firet half hour of busi-
ness, therefore, the market was compara-
tively steady, but the professional element
soon discovered the absence of any specu-
lative or investment buying and that the
generally apathetic condition of affairs
had not changed. They therefore resumed
| their assault upon values, and continued
it until the closing hour, when another
rally in prices occurred, consisting for the
most part of retirement of short contracts,

which left prices not far below last night's
closing figures. Nearly everybody having
market interests at stake declared that
they were glad that the fate of the Aldrich
bill had been settled one way or the other,
as the suspense concerning it only served
to confuse the financial situation. Re-
viewing the efforts made to piss the
bill, it must be admitted that sub-
stantial financial interests throughout
the country did not exercise themselves
exceedingly in the matter, and the con-
clusion is, hence, reasonable that there is
no great gloom in high quarters over the
failure of the bill to become a law. Indeed,
the op'nion was not infrequently expressed
to-day that it was doubtful if there had been
proper cons deration of many amendments
that had, for reasons of policy, been hastily
attached to the measure. The operation of
the prop-sed law would not have imme-
diately increased in great degree the sum
of money in the national banks. The bene-
ficial effect of the enactment on the stock
market would have been, for the moment,
purely sentimental. It is now certain that
within a comparatively short time the
Panama Canal Treaty will be ratified and
$50,000 000, will have to be paid at once to the
Panama Canal Company's stockholders in
Paris and to the Government of Colombia. |
It is very doubtful if the Secretary of the
Treasury, in view of the large existing cash
surplus in the Treasury, will care to pro-
vide for the payment of more than one-
half of this amount by the issue
If the cash actually in the
Sub-Treasuries at the time is sufficient
te allow him to draw therefrom the
entire amount required, he will undoubt-
edly do 80; but, in all probability, he will
only do so if this withdrawal atill leaves a
working balance of $50,000,000 in the Treas-
ury vaults proper. If the excess revenues
| from custom duties go on increasing as
they. have done the Government will have
in its possession a sufficient sum to allow
the Panama Canal payment to be made
without encroaching upon public funds
in the national banks; and if the Aldrich
bill were to become a law and the deposit
of customs revenues were thus to Cease,
the banks would in turn be called upon

| | shortly to pay it back again to the Govern-

oldies in
|
me

| $43,758,521,

ment for the Panama Canal payment.
The real value of the Aldrich bill, if it had
become a law, would have been demon-
strated in the crop-moving season in the
fall. What may happen or may not hap-
pen because of the failure of Congress to
act in the matter is, of course, at the present
time purely conjectural.

Judging from the temper displayed by
the stock market to-day it ia doubtful
whether if the news from Washington this
morning had been exactly the reverse of
what it was, it would have excited ary
speculative enthusiasm worth mentioning
The heads of most of the leading commission
houses, while freely admitting the pros-
perity of the country and the general |
health of business affairs, are advising
their customers that they see no particular
reason for buying stocks until later in the

| apring and that in the meantime the aag-

| ging tendencies of the market incident to

the time of year may be expected to pre-
vail. The value of imports of merchandise

000, | of all kinds at this port for the month of

February was officially stated to-day as
as against $36,107,078 for the

' game monch list year; while exports are

% per cent. for sixty |

This is a superficial indication at least
that Government receipts will continue
to show a considerable excess over Gov-
ernment expenditures and that the money
market may be thus proportionally affected
