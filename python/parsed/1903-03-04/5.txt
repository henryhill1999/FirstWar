WORRIED ABOUT NEAL & CO.

DEPOSITONS, YOU SEE, DON’T LIKE
HYPNOTISM IN BANKING.

 

 

Not Fxactly a Ran on the What-Dy'e-Call-It
Bank, Yesterday, but Bome of the
Folks With Money in It Wanted to Know,
You Know—So Mr. Neal Explains Again

E. Virgil Neal, senior member of the bank-
firm of E. Virgil Neal & Co., and a stock-
ler in the Columbia Scientific Academy,

both doing business on the fourth floor of
the building at 1031 Broadway, called up
Tur Sun office on the telephone early yes-
terday afternoon and said:

“That article printed in this morning's
Sn about the Columbia Scientific Academy
and the bank has caused the bank some
annoyance. Some of our depositors have
been around this morning to find out what
it all meant. They were uneasy, you see,
about the money they had on deposit with
us and were inclined at first to withdraw
their accounts. I told them it was all a
mistake about the bank and I'd like to
have THE SUN to do something about it.”

A reporter was directed to find out just
what Mr. Neal wanted done, and to the
reporter the banker explained as follows:

*I didn't care what THR SuN said about
the academy and Mr. Robertson, president
of the institution, doesn't care what the
English editor, Mr, Labouchere says about
it, but it was wrong to mix up the bank
with the academy. There's no connection
between the two.”

“THe SUN didn't say there was,” said the
reporter. “On the contrary, it quoted you
as saying that there was no connection
between the two.”

“I know that,” seid Mr. Neal, “but you
ealled it a ‘hypnotic bank’ and that’s what
caused me a lot of trouble. Some of our
depositors, who read the article, got the
notion that the bank was teaching hypno-
tism. Now it isn't a hypnotic bank and it
doesn't teach hypnotism and has nothing
to do with hypnotism. It has nothing to
do with the Columbia Scientifie Academy.
I happen to be a stockholder in the acdaemy,
but Mr. Robertson is not interested in the |
bank to the extent of adollar. To be sure,
Mr. Robertsou was once a banker, and the |
bank is at the front end of this floor and
the academy at the other, but that’s just
a coincidence you know. I'm a stockholder
in the New York Central :ailroad, but that
doesn't indicate that the railroad is inter-
ested in either our academy or our bank.
Besides, the academy doesn't put out a
course in hypnotism. It just throws in
gome literature on hypnotism, free of
charge, with its regular courses.”

On Monday, Mr. Neal said he was presi-
dent of the bank and mentioned the names
of other officers and the directors. Yester-
day he was particular to speak of the bank
as being conducted by the firm of E. Virgil
Neal & Co. He said the members of the
firm were himself, Anton Masterson (it
was J. 1. Masterson, Monday), ©. W. Robbins
and L. M. Wilson. Mr. Robbins, Mr. Neal
explained on Monday, has no connection
with the Columbia Scientific Academy except
to write glowing letters about the academy's

courses. ;
“Who's L. M. Wilson?” Mr. Neal was

ed.

“She’sa Miss Lila M. Wilson who lives in
West 104th street,” said the banker-acace-
mician, “S!e used to be a private secretary
in the office of Redding, Kidder & Greeley
Then she was my secretary for a while, but
she inherited a good deel of money, $20,000
or $30,000 and now she doesn’tdo anything
Bhe invested about $5,000 in our firm.

“How many stockholders have you?"
the banker was asked.

“Upwards of twenty, and our deponitts
amount to about $35,000. But if you want
to know anything about us, here's a report
on us made by R. G. Dun & Co., which a
friend of mine just happened to send to me
this morning. It was made some time ago
and is incorrect in some particulars, but it
will show you something about us, I make
it a point to tell all our depositors to look 4
our rating before they open accounts with
us. You see, they have nothing to secure
them, but our individual responsibility.”

Mr. Neal read a@ report from R. G, Dun
& Co. to the effect t: at Neal had told the
agency that the capital of the banking
firm was $25,000, al! paid in, The report
stated that the members of the firm, col-
lectively, were undoubtedly worth much
more than $25,000. The report also stated
that Mr.Neal used to run the National Pro-
tective Association of the United States.

“What became of thatconcern?” asked the
reporter ,

I'm under the impression that it’s still
in existence.”

“What is it?”

“Oh, we used to sell insurance policies.”

“As a matter of fact, isn’t it doing busi-
ness right here in this building?”

“Come to think of it, I believe it is,” re-
plied Mr. Neal. “But I have nothing w
do with it now.”

- “Had any run on your bank to-day?"

*Well, not exactly what you might calla
‘run, but we've had calls from several of
‘our depositors, who thought of drawing out

‘*their money after they read THE Son.
_ 1 showed them that statement from
‘ » & Co., and told them the article was a

\ ppeieke and that we were all right. Moat

as) them went away satisfied, but some
‘reduced their deposits, one by a little more
than 60 per cent. Now, aa I said, I don't
eare about what you said regarding the
academy, but I'd like to have it made plain
that there's no connection between that
and the bank

It was said at the office of the State Super-
intendent of Banks yesterday that the
Btate Bank Department has to jurisdiction
over such, concerns as the “Banking House
of F. Virgil Neal & Co." Supt. Kilburn
said at Albany last night: “So far as any

legal supervision of such concerns goes,
there is none. They can run (ler business
like a grocery store.”

| VICTIM OF OHIO’S STRANGLER.

Body of the Third Wife of Murderer Knapp
Found in a River.

INDIANAPOLIS, March 3.—A body found
in the Ohio River at the New Albany wharf
was identified this morning as that of
Hannah Goddard Knapp, third wife of
murderer Alfred Knapp, who recently
confessed in Hamilton, Ohio, that he killed
the woman, This is the link of evidence
necessary to convict him of the crime and
bring about his exeoution.

The identification was made positive by
a band around the woman's ankle and a
amall gold ring on her finger. A scar on
the forehead also tallied with her descrip-
tion, The body was thrown into the Miami
River by Knapp, according to his confes-
sion, on Dec. 22, Knapp has also confessed
to the murder of his second wife, Jennie
Conner Knapp; Mary Eckart, a Cincinnati
woman; a child in Hamilton, Ohio, and Ida
Gebhard, a West Indianapolis girl, whom
he first aseaulted. He strangled all his
victims.

BUCKLIN PREJUDGED, HE SAYS.

ExJustice Fursman Says He Can't Be
Fairly Tried Here.

The argument in the motion made by
ex-Justice Fursman for a change of venue
for the trial of David W. Bucklin, Canfield’s
manag:r, was heard yes‘e:day by Supreme
Court Justice McCall, and afier some itn-
passioned oratory on both sides, the papers
were submitted and decision reserved
Justice McCall refused to modify the stay
recently obtained by Bucklin's counsel
which stopped all proceedings against the
alleged gambler. He said he would have
to refer that matter to Justice MacLean,
who granted the stay.

Justice Fursman said that the newspapers
had denounced Bucklin, Canfield and Frank
Farrell and their counsel so much that the
general public had condemned Bucklin
unheard, and it would be impossible for him
to get a fair trial in this county. The public
had been led to believe that these alleged
gamblers were so bad that they had con-
svired to assa-sinaie the District Attorney.

“One paper,” he said, “has actually
dared to warn and reprove Gov. Black and
myself for taking retainers to defend these
people. It is of no consequence that the

| charges made are not true; the public mind

has become so inflamed that the accused
have been prejudged felons and criminals.
I know of no case where a change of venue
was so imperatively needed.”

The Assistant District Attorney in charge
of the case told Justice McCall that if a
change of venue were granted in thig case,
it would have to be granted on similar

rounds in many others, and ao the ends of
Fiatioe would be defeated.

“The other side,’* he said, “has just be-
thought itself of this move, after an agree-
ment had been reached for the trial of the
case last month, These gambling cases
have not had one-twentieth the notoriet
that many famous criminal cases have had,
Out of our millions of citizens here I wa-
rrant we can find plenty who have never
heard of Canfield or Bucklin.”

 

GIVES CIGARS AWAY.

 

Dealer tn Specially Mede Ones Jamps Into
the Merry War.

The retail cigar war reached an advanced
stage yesterday when Morten & Co. at
44 Beaver street announced that they would
give cigara away.

Last week Acker, Merrall & Condit and
then the United Cigar Stores Company cut
the price of imported Havanas.

Yesterday Morten & Co. published this
announcement:

“We're in it too. We will give away
cigars to all customers on our books to

date.”

When asked to explain the advertise-
ment Mr. Morten enid:

“The ostensible war between Acker, Mer-
rall & Condit and the United Cigar Stores
Company is undoubtedly part of a scheme
to drive out of business the unfortunate
retail dealer. It is obvious that when the
small retail dealer and shopkeeper shail
have been ruined and effaced, as he un-
doubtedly will be, and when his competition
shall have ceased, the poopie who will then
have a free field will be able to sell to the
public, any cigars, made of any tobacco,
at any price they may choose to ask.

“Further than this I do not care to make
any statement other than that as the cor-
poration I represent deals only in cigars
specially made to order of the finest tobacco
and of extra heavy weight, we are not af-
fected by this atternpt at extermination.
It is true, however, that the threat has
been made that my own customers could
be taken away from me if it were thought
desirable. Of course, I must take my
chances.”

A humidor as large as a small cottage
occupies most of the ground floor at = the
building of this firm, It is filled with boxes
of cigars made to order. Most of them
are twice as large as the ordinary perfecto.
Some of them have the customers’ initials
on the paper bands and are $1.25 a piece.

THE SUN, WEDNESDAY, MARCH 4, 1903.

MAYOR LOW, THAT COLD MAN.

WOULDN'T MELT IN JULY, SAYS
ALDERMAN M'CALL.

 

 

Suspected of Operating at Albany to Take
Street Openings Out of the Beard's
Hande—They Will Send a Commit-
tee te Try and Checkmate Him.

“He's so cold that I think he wouldn't
melt in the hottest day in July,” Alderman
McCall said of Mayor Low at yesterday's
meeting of the board.

He attacked the Mayor for endeavoring
to take away from the Aldermen by legis-
lation some of the power that remains to
them, and he called on the Aldermen's
Committee on Laws and Legislation to
go to Albany and oppose Senator Marshall's
bill, which seeks to take from the board
authority in opening and closing streets.

Alderman Goodman (Rep.) epoke up for
Mr. Low and said he had been a great deal
nicer to the Aldermen than his two prede-
ceasora, who used to ignore them when there
was a social affair or a public reception on
band.

“I don't retract anything I have said
about Mayor Low,” retorted Mr. McCall.
“We are getting tired of the bouquets he
throws at us. I never saw, in all my life,
a man so cold as that man downstairs.”

Alderman Pegeons—-Bie personal attack
is unssomiy. © not think we ought to sit
here quietly and listen to aspersions like
these on the Mayor from a member of the
board

Alderman McCall—Why, only a short time
ago a committee of this board went down
to see the Mayor, and if it hadn't been for
my friend r. Parsons, we would never
have got in to see him. My friend, Mr
Parsons, has perhaps been invited to some
pink teas, but in the district I come from
we don’t know nothing about pink teas.
Our Mayor nae shown what respect he has
for this board when hardly before we had
taken our seats here he raised a cry of bribery
and then refused to act on a resolution offe
by Alderman Sullivan asking for an investi-
gation don't know if I am coming back
as an Alderman and I propose to have my
say now. I say that it fs not a proper thing
for the Mayor to go to Albany to ask to have
the powers of his own legislative body taken
awny.

Alderman Parsons said that the Mayor
had misunderstood the date upon which
the committee that had a hard time getting
to him was to call. He saw them almost
immediately when he learned that they
were waiting. They waited leas than ten
minutes.

The committee was the committee in-
formally appointed by the Aldermen to ask
the Mayor to assent to the proposition to
raise the salaries of the Aldermen from
$1,000 to $2,000. The Mayor told Mr. MoCali
and his fellow committeeimen that he thought
the Aldermen were more than sufficient]
paid already for three or four hours’ wor
@ week.

The Aldermen voted to send its com-
mittee to Albany 2s proposed by Mr. McCall

OXE OF THE BOUQUBTS.

On the recommendation of Mayor Low

the Aldermen adopted a resolution author-

a the appointment of a committee of
twelve to confer with him to devise means
for the proper representation of the city
at the St. Louis Exposition. The resolution
provided for the inclusion on the committee
of the President and Vice-Chairman of the
Aldermen and the five Borough Presidents
President Fornes will select the Aldermen

to go on the committee.

 

BRONX TROLLEY GRIDIRON.

 

Aldermen Not’ Agreed About Interboroagh's
Proposed Franchise.

The franchise asked for by the Inter-
borough Railway Company to gridiron Tv
Bronx with trolley lines was brought up
at yesterday's meeting of the Aldermen
and was laid over for a week.

The Board of Estimate and the company
have agreed upon terms,but the form of con-
tract must have the consent of the Alder-
men. Ina report signed by the majority
of the Cominittee on Railroads the grant-
ing of the Interborough's application is
recommended, but a minority report urges
several modifications in the routes asked
for by the company.

The principal point in the minority re-
port is the apparent effort that is being
made to keep the Interborough company
from crossing Macombt's Sem brides. The
Union road wante this crossing.

BROUGHT COFFIN FOR HIMSELF.

Strange Man Said He Would Need It in a
Few Houars—Did He?

A well-dressed young man entered an
undertaking establishment in Union Hill,
N. J., yesterday morning and asked to see
some ooffins, After inspecting several he
selected one asked the price and paid for
it. Wiliam Necker, proprietor of the shop,
asked where he would send the coffin.

“Keep it here,” said the young man. “I
want it for myown funeral. You'll probe
ably hear from my friends in a couple of
ours.

Necker concluded that the young man
contemplated suicide and reported to the

lice. Up to a late hour t night he

dn't heard from the young man or his
friends.

SUBWAY' TRENCH FLOODED.

Accident Will Delay the Work at the Hariom
River Crossing.

The subway tunnel across the Harlem
River at 145th street and Lenox avenue
sprang a leak at 2 o'clock yesterday morn-
ing and the excavation was flooded with
water.

McMullen & McBean are the contractors.
The work of excavating ia about one-third
finished, and the accident yesterday will
set them back several weeks.

The approach to the tunnel on the Man-
hattan side is 1,000 feet long and is dug out
nearly half way, Last Monday a slight
leak was noticed under the sheeting at the
eastern terimnus. That night the water
began pouring in and Mr. McBean de-
cided to let the entire trench fill with water.
It will then be pumped out and the exact lo-
cation of the leak found. The excavation
is 83 feet wide and 40 feet deep.

There were no workmen in the trench
at the time of the accident.

AMES REQUISITION BLOCKED.

Babeas Corpus Writ Prevents the Return
of the Ex-Mayor to Minneapolis.

Hancock, N. H., March 8.—A petition
for a writ of habeas corpus on behalf of
ex-Mayor Ames of Minneapolis, the requi-
sition for whom has been honored in this
State, was granted by Judge Pike of the
Superior Court at Manchester this after-
noon and made returnable in Manchester
on Wednesday, March 11, et 10 o'clock inthe
forenoon. This will mean the beginning
of a legal fight to prevent the removal
from this State of the fugitive former
Mayor for trial for bribery.

The move was expected, and if it does
not prevent the doctor's ultimate return
it will have the effect of a long delay. Nine
different questions are raised by the counsel
for Ames, United States District Attorney
Hamblett of Nashua among them. The
point is made that the State law of New
Hampshire, permit the fixing of a
certain day for the delivery of such a pris-
oner as Ames, rather than on demand, is
against the Constitution and laws of the
United States. On this point alone it
would be possible to make a fight which,
if carried to the United States Supreme
Court, would make a delay of three years.

This order of Judge Pike prevents the
delivery to Sheriff Dreger of Hennepin
county, Minn, ordered by the Gov-
ernor two weeks ago. He cannot now be
yielded up to the Western officers until
after the hearing on the gute raised
by him, and not then until all appeals from
the decision of the court upon them have
been settled.

The application for the writ, which was
signed by Dr. Ames in a shaky hand on

rch 2, was sworn to before John R.
Spring, Mr. Hamblett’s law partner, acting
as Justive of the Peace. It sets forth that
the petitioner, Albert A. Ames, is “illegally
restrained of his liberty by Nathaniel
Doane, Sheriff of Hillsborough county,
who claims to hold your petitioner by
virtue of an arrest made in pursuance of an

Executive warrant on a nee from
the Governor of the State of Minnesota.”

FORMER CHAMPION ON PRESENT
AMATEUR PLAYINGCON DITIONS.

 

He Would Retain the Qualifying Reund,
but Have Only Thirty-two Keep On
—How the Pairings Should Be Made
—Emphatic Talk From the Neted Geifer

Walter J. Travis, National
and present Metropolitan Golf Association
champion, put himself on record yesterday
as to the conditions be favored for the ama-
teur championship. What he said is of
especial importance at this time as the execu-
tive oommittee of the United States Golf
Association has taken the stand that those
who oppose the present way of playing the
amateur championship would substitute for
it match play without a qualifying round,
the plan followed in Great Britain. Tuer
BUN, on last Sunday, showed the fallacy of
this point of view, the opnosition that devel-
oped at the annual meeting having been
against the large number to qualify and the
system of pairing, not against the qualifying
round or the principle it stands for.

The present system, introduced last year,
permits sixty-four to qualify at eighteen
hole medal play, who keep on at eighteen
hole match play, to the semi-final and final,
which are at thirty-six holes, Walter J.
Travis is not of a very communicative nature,
but as his remark at the U. 8. G. A. meeting
that “any system was better than the present
one” has been twisted into an indorsement
of siraight match play, he was found willing
to break the silence he usually maintains
on guestions of golf policy.

“There is every reason why I should speak
freely on the subject, as I did not have an
opportunity to express myself at the United
States Golf Association meeting regarding

the former

pionship and I have since received a number
of inquiries asking my opinions about them,”
said Mr. Travis, “Frankly, | am not in eym-
pathy with the method of pairing as adopted
last year. Theoretically, the object sought
was to make it impossible, by the ‘luck of the
draw,’ for a player of comparatively weak
ealiber to reach the final round. The aim
was 80 to divide the players as to secure half
of the strongest in each division; the winner
of a match to progressively meet a stronger
player each round and so insure the final
being played by the two best men.

“We need only look_at the practical working

National championships respectively—to see

“The cause is not far to seek.

One man

attempt to arrive at any definite roquite, is.
n these circum stances, alrnost bound to ait.
hen again, no proper provision is made for
ties at medal play. This, joined to the fact
that the difference of each singie stroke ip
the score theoretically determines the alloca-
tion of the players in the two divisions, upper
and lower, but by reason of ties does nut do
80 practically, only adds to the complication
and invites defeat of the desired aim by having
cone of the divisions very much stronger than
the other. Moreover, the system is wrong
in principle in that it confessedly discriminates
against the weaker player. After a man
has qualified he should not be discriminated
against. All should be on the same plane
Whoever devieed the system has not dis-
closed his identity, for which he cannot be
blamed.

“One reagan why some people favored
a change from the old method,” said Mr
Travis in 4 reminiscent tone, “was on account
of the well-grounded syspicton that the draw
sas not a legitimate one It has even been
admitted that this has been the case ”

“llow can a better method be obtained?

The game now is essentially the same in
principle that it wasten ortw ebly years avo,"
answered Mr. Travis, “The only modern
problem is the handling of a big crowd. ‘The
idea of having a preliminary round at medal
play grew out of a desire to reduce the fleld
to a workable basis. This was the
adopted in the U.8.@. A. championships
1596 1o 1801, inclusive, and it is the same plan
which now obtains generally throughout
the country in open tournaments. EX peri-
ence has demonstrated that it works well
I thoroughly believe in the retention of the

vlan
rom

preliminary round, No man should be con-
sidered a finished golfer, certainly not a
champion, unless he can combine reasonable
proficiency at score piry with high abilities
asa match player. Then, too, the preliminary
round has @ certain sentimental value which
is worth a great dea) -in that in a way it
fixes the ranking of the contestants, sorme-
thing that ts entirely lacking {n match play
pure and simple. Moreover, it is ensentl

ally
an American idea, and a very good }

one, and
its abandonment now would be u tacit: ad-
mission that we have seen the error of our
ways, which I, for one, am not prepared to
admit at all”

“Would straight match play be an advance
or @ retrogression?”

"Undoubtedly @ step backward. I fail to
any advantage whatever in disearding
the qualifying round and having match play
only. Match play is open to the objection
that there is @ greater chance of a compara-
tively poor plaver working his way by easy
matches to the final in a big fleld, say of 145,
than in atieid of thirty-two, if assisted by the
luck of the draw,’ as the thirty-two who
have qualified have proved, in a way, their
superiority over the remaining 10s, The lowi-
cal proof of this may be found by reducing

iflers,

nee

  

the number of qua for

eight
Any one of the qualifiers may reasonably
be counted on to give his opponent a far
better match than a player who, at soore play,
would finish in, our. the seventieth place
plorsover, with a field of thirty-two ready
or the business in hand, there is bound to be
a better exposition of play, it's a case of
‘play, ball from the start. The ‘luck of the
raw may possibly bring two of the strong-
ext players together the first round, whether
the field Le composed of thirty-two or 140,
but that, like a bad lie
and must be borne with
can Win, even inthe final
“I should Like to see the fleld of contestants

HERMAN'S LIBERAL OFFER.

Promoter Ready to Deposit Half Purse
for Jeffries to Meet Corbett.

Jack Herman, matchmaker of the Inter-
national A. C. of Fort Erie, left for Buflalo
last night with $6,000 tucked away in his
inside pocket. This money represents for-
feits for two battles which the Canadian
club failed to secure, namely, the MceGovern-
Benny Yanger tilt and the Jim Corbett -
Jim Jeffries fight. Herman, when in New
York, a few weeks ago deposited $5,000 in
support of hie offer of a $25,000 purse for a
scrap between Jeffries and Corbett. He
withdrew the amount yesterday, also $1,000
which represented the forfeit for Terry's
bout with Yanger, which was to have been
decided on March 16. Herman ie much dis-
appointed in losing both contests, especially
the one between Yanger and McGovern
Herman, however, is still hopeful of eecur-
ing an important attraction for his club
und has already taken stepa to land # mill
between Bob Fitzsimmons and Tommy Ryan

‘l am ready to give the men a puree of
$10,000," said Herman to THE SUN reporter
yesterday have notified Fitzeimmons
to this effect, and | think he will accept
Kyan, aoomingiy. is anxious to box Fits-
simmons, and I really lieve that they will
eventually come together I am ready to
hold the battie either during the month of
May or June. They can meet earlier, if
they care to, but « later date would be pre f-
erable 1 cannot understand why Corbett
and Jeffries did not decide to accept my
purse of $25,000 and fight at Fort Erie. 1
am willing todo anything that is reasonable,
and if they are satisfied to accept will
place half of the purae in cash with any bank
they may name. If we fail to go ahead
with our agreement they ean make 86,250
each, which is enough, | think, to compensate
them for their trouble. 1 would not do this
if 1 thought there wae any chance of the
authorities stepping in and stopping it. If
Young Corbett and MeCiovern fail to mert
at San Francisco the International A C. will
bid for the fight.”

RYAN EVADES FITZ.

Names New Cenditions fer a Battle With
the Lanky Cornishman.

Tommy Ryan now announces that he wi I!
fight Bob Fitssimmons, but names a number
of peculiar conditions which may prevent
the pair from coming together Ryan ie at
present at Hot Springs, Ark, where he is
nursing @ mild attack of malaria’ In a
despatch to a friend in thie city yesterday
Kyan said) “Being the middleweight cham-
pion and having won the title by constantly
meeting and defeating all comers, I still
stand ready to meet Fitzsimmons or any
other boxer in the world who will come within
the middleweight limit) It was but a month
ago that this same Fitgeinmmons when asked
to feht me eaid he would do so if he received
a year to @et into condition his | eaid |
would do, and while he is doing this I will
