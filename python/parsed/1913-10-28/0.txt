FRICK MAY LEAVE DIRECTORATE

—
Over Parchase of Cambria

Steel Co. Stock.
HILADELPHTA, Pa, Oct.
Henry C. Frick and those in responsible
management of the Pennsylvania ail-
road a_ situation has developed which
may result in Mr. Frick’s retirement from
the directorate.

The Frick-Donner group, now the chief
minority tfterest in the Cambria Steel
Company, wants complete control of this
independent steel property. About a vear

ago Mr. Frick and P. A. B. Widener a
$50 a share for the .504,100 of Cam-
bria Steel stock held by the railroad |
company, This offer was not accepted.

Recently it became known that the
Pollak-Block interests were = finding it

difficult to finance their intended purchase
of the steel company. Mr. Frick is un- |
derstood to have taken the position, as a
director of the Pennsvivania Railroad, ,
that the company should hold absolutely |
to the option terms and make no cons |
cession to the Pollak-Block Interest to!
help through a sale. It is generally un- !
derstood that the option at $60 a share
expires with this month, although some!
believe that it runs or has been extended |
for thirty days more. '

Socording to reports, Mr. Frick has!
expressed himself to some men in the
Pennsylvania Rallroad management in’!
terms far from thelr liking.
endeavored to guide the matter along;
lines calculated to uphold every moral!
obligation of the big company.

The point has been raised that Mr. |
Frick, as a director of the ratlroad, is
hardly in a position to urge sale of the|
Cambria Steel to the group in which he!
is the central figure.

Telling of
Delmontco Conference,

Promises Letter To-day

When the statement of Charles F
Murphy was shown to Gov. Sulzer last
night at the Broadway Central Hotel he
discussed it for some time with several of
his advisers. He then wrote this:

“It is after midnight now and 1 have

not had time to read Mr. Murphy's state-
ment sufficiently to reply in detail He,
however, admits much IT have said and 1
am surprised that he should admit any-
thing. It is not Murphy's way.

“The assertion that Mr. Murpny re
turned the $25,000 is to laugh and makes
the statement ludicrous. Murphy never
returns money He things it {s bad luck.
Ask The Chief's friends. They will cor-
roborate this. I have the proof of all I
say."
