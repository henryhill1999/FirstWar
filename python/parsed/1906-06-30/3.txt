HERR WINDMULLER CONFESSES

VO THE CRIME OF THE TOMATO
HE ADDS A THEFT OF CHERRIES.

 

 

4
Distinguished New Yorker Breaks Down
Under Crose-Examination—stubbernly
Refuses to Admit That He Stole the
Virst Oyster He Ate and Didn't Like

Louis Windmuller, publicist ard treasurer
of the Reform Club, told only half the truth
the other day when he confessed in a letter
to the editor of the Hvening Post that he
once stole a tomato, Yesterday he broke
down completely and told of otber thefts
committed in Germany.

Perhaps he was buoyed up by his knowl-
edge of the statute of limitations, eo far as
that tomato was concerned, and by his
familiarity with the fact that there is no
treaty yet in existence between this country
and Germany which would provide for his
extradition én case the police authorities
of Munster should desire to take action
at this late day on crimes of the early '50s.
It was this sense of security, perbaps, that
enabled Louis Windmuller to assume yes-
terday an air of bravado after making a
clean breast of his hitherto hidden past.
He actually laughed about that tomato,
and although he didn’t say so in words, his
laugh meant nothing {f not the bold chal-
lenge.

“Well, what are you going to do about
it? I’m the treasurer of the Legal Aid
Society, which furnishes gratuitous service
to helpless strangers.”

It is but fair to Louis Windmuller to say
that the Legal Aid Society has been in
existence only twenty-five years. It was
fifty-two years ago that hestole that tomato
It was in Vesey street that the crime was
committed. Now that all the facts have
been brought out, it is perfectly clear that
Mr. Windmuller’s conscience began to trouble
him long ago when he wrote an essay en-
titled “Food That Fails to Feed.”

That essay was, no doubt, the first weak
stguggle at a vague confession. For the
stolen tomato did fail to feed the man who,
stole it. As he said in his confession the
other day, “I was disappointed by the taste
and scolded the poor driver after robbing
him. From the beautiful looks I had ex-
pected a better flavor.”

He took but one bite and in the half cen-
tury that has elapsed he has tried to cone
vince his conscience that one bite was
punishment enough for laroeny.

“I had the same experience with oysters
when I first come to this country,” he aaid
yesterday.

“Where did you steal the oysters?” asked
the inquisitor, firmly but not unkindly.

“Oh, I didn’t steal the oysters!” he ex-
claimed, quick and apparently glad to
seize an opportunity to digress from actual
crime. “I meant that didn’t like the taste
of the first oyster that I had ona Fulton
street corner out of curiosity, and I spat it
out.”

The third degree was tried on the culprit
at this point, but he stuck to his assertion
that he didn't steal the oysters.

“Was there a policeman eating there at
the same time?” he was asked.

“I don’t know,” he said doggedly, but with
downcast eyes. All the time he was ner-
vously fingering a batch of manuscript for
a Reform Club pamphlet.

“Are you sure that you didn’t like oysters?”

“Yes, lam.”

“But you’re a member of the Reform
Club and you go to Reform Club dinners?®

“Yes,” faltered Louis Windmuller as a
man trying to feel his way and fearful of
what was coming next.

“And you go to other dinners of the uplift
variety?" fa

“Yes,” said Louis Windmuller rubbing his
stomach with a painfully reminiscent look.

“What did you mean then by writing
about ‘food that does not feed’ ?”

This was merely a digression resorted to
by the inquisitor to confuse the witness,
but for the moment he seemed to lose sight
of his crimes altogether and declared with

an emphasis almost desperate that he |

wasn't thinking about Reform Club dinners
at al] when he wrote the feedless food pam-

hlet.
P “Did you have the Vesey street tomato
in mind?”

The man refused to answer.

“Now you have admitted that you attend
many reform dinners.”

« es.”

“Do you eat them?”

“Must I answer that?”

“Yes,

“Well, then, I do eat them.”

“Now at every reform dinner are there
at least two oysters served to each re-
former and at every dinner to inaugurate
@ particularly great reform aren’t there at
Jeast three oysters for each diner?”

“Yes, there were four at one of our din-
ners,” said Louis Windmuller in a boasting
manner,

“Asa rule you sit at the head table where
all the guests can see you?”

5 etimes,” .

“Now, then [with impressive slowness)
do you spit out the oysters?”

“} do not.”

“Ah, thoughtso. Now yousay you did
spit out thet oyster on Fulton street?”

“I will ask you once more, did you steal
that oyster as you stole that tomato? And
if not, will you explain why you spat it
out if your conscience was clear, while
now that oysters are all canned with poi-

sonous preservatives you can swallow two, |

sometimes three and, 2s you have said, on
Ong Occasion four?”

e muttered something about being will-
ing to take any risk for the sake of reform,
but the strain had been too much, and it
was at this point that Louis Windmuller
told everything, including the story of his
reoord in Munster.

“I was ony, a boy,” he faltered,
“Go ahead now, make a clean breast of

LIVE TOPICS ABOUT TOWN.

New steel framed and aluminum Mned
cars have been put on the Broadpray line
during the last few days. They are closed
cars and are being tried out for use in the
cold weather. The seats are of motal with
a heavy brussels covering. Whoever de-
signed the seats must have bad queer ideas
as to what New Yorkers oo er ocom-
fortable. The bottoms of the seats run out
from the side of the car at a raised angle
of about five degrees, while the backs are
pointed toward the centre of the car at an
angle even more pronounced. Sitting in
the new cara gives one a sensation like
teat 4 sitting in the top of # headless

arre).

“What becomes of all the falee faces?”
asked the city «a “Who wears
them? ‘A trip on the elevated road gives
peeps into floors where dovens of workmen
do nothing year in and year out but make
false fhcea, The output must be sufficient
to enable the entire population to go about
dressed for a continuous carnival On
Thanksgiving and a few other féte da
masks are in demand, but the rest of
time most of us are content to show our
natural gountenances. comparatively
light local trade, even when swelled by
the year round trade of small shops in
populous districts, leaves a ous
number of false faces to be accounted for.”

For tha second time since a Rialto has
existed in New York its site has been shifted
to the west side of Broadway. The summet
gathering of the actors on Broadway began
on the east side of that thoroughfare when
Union Square was the theatrical centre of

the town. Subsequent progress northward
always found the summer groups on the
enst side until they be to assemble at
Twenty-eighth street. next jump took
them to the sidewalk in front of the Knicker-
bocker Theatre, and again to the east side.
Now they have crossed over to the west.
The block in front of the Metropolitan
Opera House has\this year been selected
for the aay meetings that last from the
morning early until dark.

The country life commuters have a new
game now and few there are who do not
show its signs. A dull red splash on Cort-
landt street serge does not-mean slovenly
habits, nor is a deep russet stain on the
right thumb evidential of cigarettes. It
simply means that Mr. Commuter has been
busy doping his lawn with the hypodermic.
For all the ages of commu the dandelion
has meant an endless fight, lawns pitted in
ghastly polka dot effects, backs of amateur

ardenpers cre g and sore. This season
the fight is waged with all the resources of
chetnistry. Whenever the jagged leaves
appear on the turf the Pat ree gets out his
flask of nitric acid and a pipette, although
a fountain pee filler will serve on a pinch.
A drop of the caustic acid in the dandelion
crown and chemistry does the rest. Taraxa-
cum nitrate is formed down to the last rami-
fication of the roota and the lawn is kept
up to the standard of Brick Church and all
the Oranges. .

 

 

 

 

The dome of the Federal Building is a
genuine old curiosity shop such as it would
delight the heart of any thoroughgoing
antiquarian to rummage in. Around the
walls of the dusty old room under the curved
roof are heaped records of the Federal
courts running away back to the year 1789,
the year when the Federal Government
was set a-going. Even more interestin
than these, with their reminiscences o
legal battles once famous, now almost for-
gotten, are the ranks and piles and heaped
shelves of patent exhibits. Here are du-
Baonee of every invention of note made

uring the nineteenth century. Howe's
sewing machine, the Edison incandescent
light, baby carriages, nail making machines
—these and nearly every other mechanical
invention of importance have heen the
subject of litigation in the local Federal
courts until the patent rights of one or
the other claimant have been established.
As the suites were brought exhibits, copies
of the origina! inventions, were filed with the
court and ended here, contributing to one
of the most varied, extensive and interestin
Sallectone of antique objects in New Yor!
city.

“Did you know that there is an annual
epidemic of thieving from the maifs which
rages among post office clerks?” said a
postal inspector. “There is, and it come
as regularly as the flowers in May.
course, we arrest a clerk now and then all
through the year for stealing, but these
arrests and the OPA Bia lr that lead to’em
are fairly few and far between. In May
and June, however, they come all in a
bunch. We've received complaints in a
single week of those months that have
made us put ten stations on the blacklist to
be tested.

“I suppose the reason is that any clerk
who has it in him to riffe letters is going to
fall at this time. The temptations seem to
be Geto and the will to resist distinctly
weaker; for the opportunity to steal is ob-
viously never absent.

“Of course, the spring and early summer
is the most expensive s*ason of the year
for the post office ler . The doctor bills
for the usual spring illnesses of his children
are due. Summer clothes must be bought
for them and his wife, and she is fagged out
and would be better for a couple St weeks
at the seashore. Qh, there are plenty of
reas ns for the epidemic, and it comes as
regularly as the season. We have to get
to work, fix up our tests and send them
through until the whole thirteen or fourteen
men doing the stealing, for that is about the
usual number every year, are caught with
the goods on. Caught they are sure to be
inthe end, just as surely as they attempi to
keep up their stealing.”

PUZZLE OF A PISTOL SHOT,

Fired Just as Pajiceman Kirchoff Was
Overcome by the Heat.
Policeman Henry Kirchoff of the East
Twenty-second street police station was
remoyed to Bellevue Hospital on Thuraday
afternoon and treated for heat prostra-
tion. The policeman was leaning against a
newastand on the corner of Eighteenth
street and Third avenue a few minutes after

5 o'clock when he collapsed.

Henry M. Landgraff, president of the
Manhattan Protective Association, a private
detective agency, says that he was in a
drug store across the street when Police-
man Kirchoff was overcome, and .that he
heard a shot fired. He says that he ran to
the side of the policeman and disarmed
him of his revolver, one chamber of which
wasempty. The police at the East Twenty-
second street station deny that Kirchoff
fired his revolver while suffering from the
sudden prostration,

Boston, June 20.—“Guilty as charged”

The charge against Proctor was the

to give to the Republican State committee
for campaign purposes, Bestgen being at
that time a candidate for the American

Consulship at Solingen, Germany, which

MAKES UNION LABOR LAW.

Umpire Allows Both Rivals for Same Kind
of Work to Do it.

The first decision rendered by an umpire
under the arbitration plan in a dispute be-
tween two unions as to the right to do cer-
tain kinds of work which the members of
each union can do was given yesterday by
Alfred R. Wolff, who was chosen as an um-
pire in a dispute between the Cement
Masons’ Union and the Plasterers’ Union.

Mr. Wolff is an architect and was chosen
as umpire on account of his familiarity with
the work. The main question was on the
work of a plying oement mortar to ex-
tensions of t dings. The case in point was
the new Riding Club cee ger. ty-eighth
street, between Fifth and M n @venues,
which is faced with artificial stone in which
cement mortar is used/

Mr. Wolff, after determining some minor
points in the dispute, decides that both the
cement masons and plastererr can do the
work. This decision, it is said, will be a

recedent which will prevent many disputes
rom the same cause, as the same conditions
will ocour on hundreds of buildings. In
former ca of this kind disput
was always awarded to one union and the
ana union invariably made trouble about

to donate a prize to be competed for, but
just what the prize would be he told the

ICE MEN ACCUSE JUDGE.

Alleged That Leniency Was Promised and
That Judgment Was Biased.

ToLepo, Ohio, June 29.—Charging that
Judge Kinkade was guilty of corruption
and breach of faith, attorneys for Beard
and Lemmon, two of the convicted ice men,
to-day filed a motion for suspension of
sentence,

The direct charges are that prior to the
pleading of the indicted men Judge Kinkade
assured counsel for the defendants that if
they would plead guilty he would be lenient
with them, also that he has been biased
in his judgment by statements not intro-
duced as evidence.

When Judge Kinkade opened the hearing
this afternoon he briefly reviewed the case
and then launched forth a denunciation
of the attorneys. He characterized the
motion as a eourrilous insult to the Court
and ordered it expunged from the record,

The attorneys then appealed to the Circujt
Court to hear the motion and it will come
upinthe morning. °
