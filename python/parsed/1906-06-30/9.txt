FINANCIAL AND COMMERCIAL.

FRIDAY, June 29,

Prices of stocks at the opening of the
security market to-day were generally
quite @ little lower than they closed yes-
terday, reflecting, perhaps, the influence
of the lower range of quotations sent over
from London. It was announced that
£100,000 in gold had been taken in London
for export to this country, and as sterling
exchange here is now at the normal gold
import point it was held altogether probable
both at this centre and in London that our
bankers will receive a good share if not the
greater pertion of the $5,000,000 in gold
that will be laid down in the open market
in London from the Rand mines early next
week. The likelihood of this event was not
altogether agreeably regarded in London,
and because of it and further selling of
stocks there for French account the London
market during the day was weak. Here
after a little while prices rallied and fluc-
tuated without any great change until the
early part of the afternoon. The market
was, indeed, actually dull for a couple of
hours around midday, and the volume of
transactions for the day's business as a
whole was appreciably less than it was
yesterday. In the last two hours of the
afternoon stocks again developed pro-
nounced weakness and fell rapidly, with
only a small recovery just before the close.
On thedecline many of the principal stocks,
such as United States Steel, common and
preferred, Pennsylvania, Northern Pacific,
Missouri Pacific, Union Pacific and Reading,
touched lower figures than they have at
any time since the culmination of the up-
ward movement in prices that ensued after
the period of demoralization in the market
in the first days of May; and the United
States Steel stocks made a new low record
for the year. Especial pressure converged
upon the Northern Pacific, Great Northern
preferred and so-called Hill group of secu-
rities, while on a very small volume of trad-
ing Pacific Mail stock broke heavily.

The peculiarity of the market to-day was,
as it has been throughout the week, thait
there was no definite news to account for the
decline. Call money was firmer, as every-
body knew it would be in view of the calling
in of funds by the banks incident to the large
disbursements next Monday. It was as-
serted that there was perturbation in bank-
ing circles over the demand made during
the day by the Secretary of the Treasury
upon the banks in the large reserve cities
for the return to the Treasury betwesa
July 10 and 20 of the $10,000,000 in special
deposits of public money which were placed
with these institutions a few month; ago,
but it is altogether unlikely that this excited
any tremors in the quarters named, inasmuch
as it was clearly stated when ths deposits
were made that they were to be recalled at
the end of a certain fixed period. The sell-
ing of the Reading issues was attributed
to the falling off in the May earnings of the
Reading companies as set forth in the day’s
morning newspapers, but it was understood
that during the first half of the month the
anthracite mines were shut down, and no
sensible person expected thit the earnings
of any of the hard coal mining and carrying
companies would show other thana decrease
for the month. No attention was paid
by the market to the clear prospect of gold
imports to which reference has been made,
backed up by to-day’s preliminary engage-
ment; nor was a sharp fall in the price of
wheat, due to better crop news, regarded
with any more attention. The Canadian
Pacific, Illinois Central, Rock Island and
San Francisco and other largs railway
systems made splendid statements of May
earnings, which were as little heeded as if
they had not appeared at all. Estimates
of to-morrow’s bank statement conc urred
in forecasting a gain in cash by the banks
of nearly $2,750,000; and as the liquidation
in the stock market in the last two or threa
days will hardly show to its full extent in
the bank return, there is every reason to
believe that not only will the exhibit of bank
conditions at the end of the week be of
encouraging character, but that the state
of the banks will be really better than the
exhibit shows. Ordinarily ths fesling of
relief always experienced in Wall Street
upon the adjournment of Congress counts
as a helpful stock market factor of no little
importance. This afternoon the winding
up of the present session of Congress ap-
peared to be only a few hours away, but in
no apparent degree did the fact stimulate
buying of stocks.

THE OUTSIDE MARKET.

 

The valume of business in the cutside
market to-day was decidedly reduced and
the tendency of prices was irregular.
net changes one way or the other were small.
The trading was uninteresting and largely
confined to Boston Copper. United Copper and
Tonopah Extension. and these stocks all de-
clined, Boston losing %, Tonopah Extension

1 point and United 2%,

Final

Chicago Subway sold

2 points higher, but closed unchanged. The

American C
what easier,

declined fractionally.

THE COTTON MARKET.

 

Higher in Spite of July Notices for 60,000
Bales—Spot Interests Stopped the
Notices.

The July notices, amounting to 60,000 bales,
had less effect than was expected. It is not
the first time that the bears have mapped out
a certain programme for a day, only to find,
that they had got tho cart beforo the horse.
At any rate, although prices declined moder-
ately early in the day, they soon turned the
other way and advanced sharply under the
influence of buying by large spot houses and
others, A good many thought this indicated
a firm. undertone, At least, it indicated that
cotton is no such drug in the market as the
pessimists had supposed, The weather was
favorable, the Liverpool advices were not by
any means inspiriting and the speculation
was still small, but in spite of it all there was
buying of a good character and now that the
July notices are out of the way it would not
be at all surprising to see a healthier market~
at least foratimy. The short interest is still
very large in the next crop and some private
Liverpool advices state that the undertone
there is firm. Some have “evened up” pende
ing the Government report which is to appear
on Jaly 3.

Carpenter, Baggot & Co, said: “All those
who are acquainted with the situation, while
expressing themselves as fully satisfied with
the showing that the crop is making at this
time, generally end their remarks by calling
attention to the fact that It is too early in the
season to feel sure, as the next five or six
is practically the making or rufning

weeks
of the crop. Old farmers claim that a mod
erately wet July following a dry spring,

which has given the plant a good tap root,
means a large crop. ‘The July option, {f to-
day cen be taken as a sample of what is to be
expected in the future, is passing out rather
fidilerently. After the Government report
of next ‘tuesday interest generally will centre
inthe new eron options, and it looks as though
the rcarket will work lower, unless something
hannons to tne new ero or frightens shorts, "
Messrs, Price, McFadden, Hutton, Craig
and Ware were buyers. Messrs. Norden,
Pache, Carpenter and Violett were sellers,
Marshall, Spader & Co. said: “The effect
of the local spot situation will, we believe,
grow less important in the near future, We
expect to see a large part of the cotton move

into consumption and the market therefore |

will be more dependent on crop news for its
trend, with the added fact that the statistical

| position is nearly ‘sure to grow very much

stronger in the near future. This is one of
the developments promised for the end of
the week and supplies of American cotton will
hardly equal last year's by 600,000 bales on
DUM”

Cotton on the spot was unchanged, Mid-
dling, 10.80¢,, against 10,15¢, last year; New
Orleans and Gulf, 11.05¢., against 10.40c.
Sales, 285 bales for spinning and 200 delivered

THE GRAIN MARKET.

Wheat Lower—Increased Offerings of New
Crop— Com and Oats Higher.

Wheat very depressed, especially July,
ywing in part to increasing offerings of new
wheat. July certainly was the weakest
option. A year ago at Kansas City the July
option was 2c. over September. Yester-
day September there was ic. over July. In
other words, a year ago Jply was in good
demand there. Now it is neglected.

Bearish factors in addition were favorable
weather for the harvest, rather larger Argen-
tine shipments than expected and some de-
pression in Minneapolis. Argentine de-
spatches reported more rain with ploughing
and seeding in progress in Buenos Ayres.
Chicago reports that 60,000 bushels of new
wheat were bought on Thursday there by
elevator people.

The crop and weather reports were e¢s-
pecially favorable from the Southwest, the
Mfodern Miller's crop report was bearish
and it is said that only red rust, not the more
serous black rust, is reported at the Northe
west.

A food deal of liquidation was noticed.
Local operators rather incline for the moment
to the bear side.

Liverpool closed 4d. to %d. lower. Berlin
was %c. lower to 4c. higher. At Budapest
there was a holiday. Paris closed unchanged
to 2c. higher.

Bears were encouraged by the Modern
Miller's statement, whic said:

‘Returns from the threshing of winter
wheat generally show a good yield of grain
of excellentQmilling quality, Few reports of
deficient yields are received. Crop con-
ditions in Nel.raska have improved since the
recent rains and good crop promise else-
where ‘3 maintained, Rains have impeded
the harvest and delayed the movement to
market, but the prow penta are that the move-
ment will be free if the weather continues
favorable.”

The Argentina shipments were about half
a million bushels larger than expected,
amounting to 1,386,000 bush., making 67,110,000
thus far this season, against 73,544,000 in the
Game time lagt season. The cash trade was
as dull as ever and so was the flour market.
In fact the stagnation in flour is said to he
unprecedented. The total exports for the

ei 4 THE CORN 6ITUATION.

rices dropped early partly in sympath

with the decline in wheat and partly owing 4
favorable weather. Later on prices advanced
a little owing to the firmness of cash cortt
and the smallness of the country acceptances,
Liverpool closed 4d. to 34d, lower.

The strength of oats had a bracing effect
on corn. Chicago reported a Mand cash
demand, with prices 4c. to %c. higher. The
receipts there were smaller than recently,
amounting to 809 cars, including 197 of con-
tract grade. The Argentina shipments were

in the same time last year. Omaha houses
were buying at Chicago.

Messrs. Cudahy, Canby, Marfield, Bartlett,
Love, Updike and Friedman were buyers.
The selling was scattered.

Bartlett, Frazier & Carrington said: “The
trade is watching weather conditions closely,
At present the weather favors growth, but
speculators fear that hich temperatures will
continue without adequate precipitation.”

cut loose from other grain aud advanced
on big transactions. They were the bull
trump curd of the day,

Bad crop reports came from all sections
The Weather was excessively hot. A good
cash demand moreover, Was re orton at
the West and bears covered free y. Com-
mission houses had buying orders from all
sections. Chicago received 126 cars, in-
cluding 40 of contract grade. ’,On the rise
there was heavy realizing and part of the
improvement was lost. The: tone of the
market, however, Was strong throughout the
session.

Chicago.—Oats are

the leaders of
speculative markets. +he
