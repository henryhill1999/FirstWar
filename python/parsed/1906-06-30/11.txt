PLATT 10 DOUBLE DIVIDENDS.

we

STOCKHOLDERS FORCE A CUT-
TING OF U. 8. EXPRESS MELON.

 

They Wanted Rate Raised From 4to 12 Per
Cent,, but the Easy Koss Compromised
on %—Cash Assets of More Than 618,-
000,000—Paying for New Building.

United States Senator Thomas C, Platt
and his associates in the management of
the United States Express Company, of
which the Senator is president, have given
azsurancea to complaining stockholders
that the dividend will bé doubled at the
next dividend period in November.

The assurances were given as a result of
a concerted though informal stockholders’
movement which was inaugurated a month
ago. The movement would have taken
the same form, persons interested in it
said yesterday, as the stockholders’ move~-
ment in Wells, Fargo & Co. had the Stnator
not acquiesced in*the demands.

The company has a capital of $10,000,000
and is controlled by Senator Platt and his
sons, Edward T. Platt and Frank H. Platt,
through stock they and their associates
own. Edward T. Platt is treasurer, and he
with his brother and the Senator are on
the board of directors. The company paid
dividends at the rate of 8 per cent. for
several years prior to 1901, but since that
time has paid 4 per cent. It is the only
express company in the United States which
does not pay a dividend of at least 8 per

cent.

Like all the other express companies the

United States Express Company makes no
annual reports to stockholders, but large
minority stockholders, who had been
grumbling for some time at the paucity of
the dividends, ascertained not long ago that
the company had cash assets of more than
$15,000,000 and was earning annually more
than 18 per cent. on ite capitalization.
\ After this information was obtained an
informal meeting of the minority stockhold-
ers was held end it was decided to make
earnest representations to Senator Plast
in regard to the advisability of increasing
the distributions to stockholders.

In these representations the minority
stockholders pointed out that the company
is a joint stook association and on court
action by stockholders could be dissolved
and its property divided among the stock-
holders, It was felt that this lever was too
strong to be overlooked or cast aside.

“However,” said one of the stockholders
yesterday, “we did not need to resort to
any drastic steps. The Senator met us
amiably enough, showed us the methods
of investment of the surplus and proved
to us, in fact, that the company was ip
even better financial condition than ever
before. Part of the assets of the company,
for instance, were stocks and bonds that
had appreciated greatly since their pur-
chase, but were still carried on the books
at the purchase price. The assets also
did not include mugh of the physical prop-
erty of the company. The 500 horses
which the company owns in this city, for
instance, were not included in the schedule,

“The only objection raised by the Senator
was that the stocks and bonds were too
valuable to be parted with and that he
wanted the company to build the new build-
ing in course of eonstruction at Church and
Rector streets entirely out of the earnings.
The land had already been paid for, he said,
from earnings, and he thought the building,
which will cost more than $2,000,000, ought
to be paid for in the same way. After
that was done, he said, the company would
make more money than ever before and
might triple the dividend.”

The stockholders had expected to ask
for a dividend of 12 per cent., but the “Easy
Boss” smoothed things over so nicely that
after one or two conferences they decided
that they would be content with 8 per cent.
for a year or two to come. A dividend at
that rate will accordingly be paid in No-
vember. It will be a semi-annual decflara-

a

“tion at 4 per cent.

The stockholders who took part in the
movement deglined to permit publication

of their nam The list of stockholders is
not at the ferusal of the public. A late
report of the State Superintendent of In-

surance showed that 2,000 shares were
owned by the Continental Fire Insurance
Company and 1,600 shares by the Metro
politan Life Insurance Company. -

Five years ago the stock of the com-
pany was selling below 60. Since then it
bas sold as high as 160. The present quo-
tation is about 117. Most of the stock-
bolders of the company purchased the stock
below par. The report of the Continenta]
Fire Insurance Company, for instance,
shows_that it purchased on an average of
about 98.

DETECTIVES HELD UP CEDRIO

 

 

@n Vain Hunt for Coal Passer Accused of
Smuggling Women.

Two immigration inspectors came panting
into Marshal Henkel’s office at 10:80 yes-
terday morning and said that one of the
coal passers on the White Star liner Cedrio
was wanted at Ellis Island for smuggling
in women immigrants from Europe. Would
he get a warrant and arrest the man be-
fore the Cedric sailed at 11?

The Marshal, who has a particular grudge
against importers of women, got a warrant
from United States Commissioner Shiekis
and sent two his fieetest deputies, Blake
and Ankner, to the White Star pier at West
Eleventh street. The deputies were still
seacrhing the bowels of the ship for
their man, who was in hiding somewhere,
when orders were given to get under way.
The deputies did not get out on deck until
the lines had been cast off.

It. delayed the big ship a few minutes
before she got close in again and the two
deputies were sent ashore in a light gang-
way.

Marshal Henkel said that if he'd been
warned in time he'd have got his man,
and he'll get him next voyage, anyway,
unless he has the prudence to desert in Eu-

rope.

The man was apcused of secreting steerage
passengers in the coal bunkers and smug-
gling them ashore at night at the dock.
As it is said that he got in balf a dozen
amen and women a trip and got $50 to $60
a head for the job, it is supposed that he
made a pretty good thing out of it.

 

WABASH BONDHOLDERS CONTENT

No Opposition to Be Made to the New
$200,000,000 Issue.

The directors of the Wabash Railroad,
at a meeting yesterday, approv@éd the
proposition for a $200,000,000 bond issue
and the retirement of the A and B deben-
tures. A resolution was passed providing
for a special stockholders’ meeting to vote
upon the propositign. Designation of the
date for the meeting was left with Presi-

dent Delano. E

He Evans, president of the Conti-
nent Fire Insurance Company, whose
efforts as chairman of the debenture

holders committee RIOR the manage-
ment and the holders of these bonds to-
ther, submitted a statement of the num-
ee of bonds that have been pledged for
transfer under the plan. The number
was not given out, but it wassaid that there
was no possibility of the plan falling through
by any objection on the part of B holders.

RICH MEN'S DRIVERS IN COURT.

Cornelius Vanderbitt Held Up in Aute
—Harriman's Man Weak on Kngilsh,’

Fenry F. Front, an auto driver employed
by Cornelius Vanderbilt, was arraigned in
the Yorkville police court yesterday on a@
charge of speeding on Fifth avenue.

Policeman Bernard of the traffic squad
said that he timed the machine between
Fifty-second and Fifty-third streets and
that it was going uptown at the rate of
twenty miles an hour, Mr. Vanderbilt was
in the car at the time.

Former Magistrate Ommen appeared
for the prisoner und said to Magistrate
Finelite that there was no intention to
violate the law and that the chauffeur was
obliged to make a little spurt with his
machine to avoid collision with a cab.

“The automobile trailed behind thia cab
for six blocks and then started to pass
it. While doing so the chauffeur saw an-
other carriage coming down the avenue
and had to hu up. The high speed was
only maintained for a block,” explained
Mr. Ommen.

“How's that, officer?” asked the Court.

“Phat’s about right, I think,” the police-
man responded.

“I'll discharge the prisoner,” announced
the Magistrate.

Emil Fiaelkez, who gave his address as
88 East Fifty-fifth street, and said through
an interpreter that he was a chauffeur for
FE. H. Harriman, was charged with refusin
to keep his automobile near the right cur’
as he went up Fifth avenue Thursday
night. He said that he had come from
France three weeks ago and did not under-
stand English. When the Boreas spoke
8 him on the avenue he failed to understand

m.
“You had better learn the rules of the
road if you are going to drive in this
country,”' said the Magistrate, as he im-

posed a §2 fine. \

HUSBAND CHARGES PERJURY.

Hearing on Mulr's Charge That His Wife
Suborned Witness tn Theft Case.

A special hearing was held yesterday by
Magistrate Wahle in the Tombs police
court upon the complaint of subornation
of perjury made by George A. Muir against
his wife, Elizabeth Markle Muir. The:
husband is 86 years old, and calls himaglf
@ gentleman farmer of Sheffield, Mass.,
but lives at 230 West Ninety-seventh street,

He is a son of John Muir, a broker. He
caused the arrest of his wife at, 260 West
Seventieth street, where she lives, charg-
ing that she got Michael McGraw of Shef-
field to swear falsely.

The case grows out of the arrest of Muir
{in March on complaint of Edward Fuller,
a son of Mrs. Muir by a former marriage,
on a charge of stealing a diamond ring
valued at $500, alleged to have belongsd
to Mrs. Muir and taken from a dresser
drawer at 230 West Ninetyseventh street.

It is alleged in affidavits that in March,
when Muir was arrested, McGraw was
Bp rTOe cast by Mrs. Muir with the object
of having him swear that he had heard
Muir say “this ring belongs to my wife,”
and that he had seen it on Muir's finger.
It is alleged that letters were written by
Mrs. Muir to McGraw, and she also saw
him personally. She is said to have been
then living at the Hotel Wellington, at
Seventh avenue and Fifty-fifth street.

Muir, who is a fine looking man, and his
wife were married in June, 1904, but for
various reasons they have lived apart
the greater part of the time since. He
claims that she's at least ten years his senior.
She says she is 36 years old. She alleges
that in March, 1904, previous to their mar-
riage, she gave him $67,000 with which to
buy a seat inthe New York Stock Exchange.
She says that he never has done so. She
claims further that he has obtained other
sums of money from her.

The hearing yesterday was adjourned to
August 2, at the Yorkville court.

 

 

 

MAN WITH SEWED UP HEART DIES

Doctors Say Death Was Caused by the
Wound in the Shoulder.

*- Anthony Savage, in whose heart three
stitches were taken by doctors in the East-
ern District Hospital, Williamsburg, a week
ago last Thursday as a last resort to save
his life from a stab wound which had in-
jured that organ, died yesterday. Another
wound was in the left shoulder. Savage
seemed for a time to get better.

At 6 o'clock yesterday morning, how-
ever, his face became flushed and a nurse
asked him how he felt. He said he felt
“fine.” A moment later his lips began to
ania, and Che PUP of his eyes became

ilated. He died within tem minutes. An
Sulopey slowed that one of the stitches
had n entirely absorbed and the
two othera and the heart itself were in
good condition. This showed that the
operation had been entirely successful.
Death was caused, the doctors say, by
the wound in the left shoulder, whioh had

netrated the left lyng and produced
nternal hemorrhage.

Savage was 21 years old and lived at 217
India street, Greenpoint. A week ago last
Suey night he and some of his friends, it
was al og , intruded on a christening cele-
bration in the house of William Ehlers, at
229 India street, and in a general fight he
was stabbed.

Cuicaao, June 29.—Liquidated Walsh
assets within a few days have paid $700,000
to the Clearing House banks, and it was

and those that have been made the sum
orlginally advanced by the Clearing House
banks to secure an orderly liquidation by the

THE SUN, SATURDAY, JUNE 80, 1906.

WELLS FARGO DIVIDEND UP.

BUT MINORITY STOCKHOLDERS
WILL KEEP UP FIGHT.

 

 

Increase of Two Per Cent, Not Enough ,They
fay, in View of the Large Farnings
Now Hold More Than 80,000 ef the
40,001 Shares Needed for Control.

Wells, Fargo & Co., yielding apparently
to pressure exerted by the strong stock-
holders' movement headed by Mesars.
Stokes, Litchfield and Pomeroy, announced
yesterday an inorease of 2 per cent. in the
dividend rate and a semi-annual declara-
tion of 5 per cent. payable July 16. The in-
crease is not sufficient to bring about a
discontinuance of the stockholders’ move-
ment. The leaders of that movement still
insist that, since the company is earning
more than 30 per cent. annually it ought to
pay at least 16 per cent. either in cash or
stock,

“The increase does not alter the situation
in the slightest,” said John F. Thomson of
W. C. Stokes & Co. “According to the
admissions of agents working for proxies
for the management in New England, the
company is earning 30 per cent. and has a
surplus of $20,000,000. We believe that the
earnings and surplus are greater than stated
by the agents, but, taking them at their
word, we can see no sane reason for with-
holding a larger distribution thanthat just
announced, °

“We don't know why the directors in-
creased the dividend, but if they think
we will be satisfied with the increase they
are mistaken. We are very well satisfied
with the number of proxies sent to us and
are more than pleased with the character
of the individuals and corporations which
have placed their interests in the hands of
the committee.”

It was reported that the Manhattan Life
Insurance Company, which is a large holder
of Wells Fargo stosk ee one of the oor-
porations which has joined in the atock-
holders’ movement. There are also repre-
sented in it fire insurance companies, life
companies, trust companies, trustees of
estates and many large and responsible
stockholders. Altogether, it was said by
a large stockholder who has given his
proxy, the committee had a month ago
proxies for 33,000 shares. Tho number
necessary for control is 40,001 qhares.

Since that time the management has
been aroused to great activity by the suo-
cess of the stockholders’ movement and
has had men canvassing for proxies and
buying stock at a price in excess of current
market quotations. These men have pur-
chased some of the stock for which pruaies
had been given to the stockholders’ com-
mittee, eo that there has been a shrinkage
in the proxies secured a month ago.

This shrinkage, however, has been more
than compensated by a large number of
new proxies received since that time, Rep-
resentatives of the committee refuse to
give out the list of the stockholders asso-
ciated with them or the number of proxies
they have secured. But this information
given by a large stockholder may be relied
upon and shows that the committee has
made greater progress than most people
considered possible against so strong an
SesroRasion as the Harriman group in
control of the company. ,

One of the stockholders which sold its
stock after giving the committee a proxy
was a company which did not care to an-
tagonize Mr. Harriman and besides could
use the money to advantage.

“We didn't want to antagonize the man-
agement,” said an offloer of the company
yesterday, “and we, of course, didn't want
to withdraw our proxies. Accordingly we
sold our stock and got out of the hee

The excuse rai by agents of the man-
agement that the surplus was to be used for
purchase of the exclusive right to operate
express cars on the Union. Pacific has helped
the stockholders’ movement. The Pacific
Express Company now has most of the
Union Pacific business, and since this com-

y is controlled by the Goulds, who are
uilding the Western Pacific in pppoe Bor to
tha Union Pacific, exclusion of it from the
Union Pacific lines by ving the contract
to Wells Fargo would enable Mr. Harriman
to deliver a blow at the Goulds and grasp
the Wells Fargo surplus at the same time.
ee the Western Pacific is completed
it is believed that the Pacific Express will
have charge of the express business upon
it. At present that gonpery has the busi-
ness of the Wabash and the Missouri Pacific,
two Gould roads, and the Union Pacific, a
Harriman road, Sixty per cent. of its stock
is owned by the Wabash and Missouri Pa-
cific and the remainder by the Union Paciflo.

Mr. Harriman consummates his report-
ed plan to drive the company from his road
he will accordingly impair the value of stock
held by the Union Pacific and need a large
sum from the Wells Fargo treasury to com-
pensate him for that loss. This, it was said
youeraey Mr. Harriman might use as a
pretext for transferring practically all of
the Wells Fargo surplus to the Union Pa-
cifio treasury.

THE BOSS VISITS ELLIS ISLAND.

Secretary Metcalf an Unexpected Caller,
but Finds Every One Hard at Work.
Viotor H. Metcalf, Secretary of the De-
partment of Commerce and Labor, paid a
visit to Ellis Island yesterday. Thecomin
of the Secretary was entirely unex! h
but every one there was busy and things
wore if tiptop shape when Mr. Metcalf

arrived.

Although the Secretary refused to discuss
the nature of his business,it was said on good
authority that he had come to investigate
personally the recent complaints of em-
ployees, who allege yey are being worked
overtime. Secretary Metcalf spent the
nes part of the afternoon on the island.

@ was non-communicative when he re-
turned to the Battery landing.

Outcome of Case.

Cuicaao, June 20.—Judge H. M. Landis
entered an order in the United States Dis-
trict Court to-day vacating a former order
which adjudged John Alexander Dowie a
bankrupt.

When asked ooncerning the entry of the
order the various lawyers interested in the
outcome of the case were unable to explain
what bearing the new order may have on
the final disposition of the case.

order adfudging Dowie a bankrupt
was entered on the motion of Gregory,
Poppenhusen & McNab, counsel for t
titioning creditors wh attack Dowie
ndividually,

Dowie in his answer to the petition con-
fessed that he would be insolvent if it was
held that he does not own Zion City, because
then, he declared, he would have no prop-
arty and be unable to pay his individual

ebts.
