AMONG THE AUTOMOBILISTS,

VANDERBILT CUP RACE 18 FILL~
ING UP RAPIDLY,

 

 

Three Entries Received Yesterday Bring
the Total Up to Thirteen—Giidden
Tourtsta Also on the Increase—Ama-
tear Driver Fined for Fast Going.

Three more entries for the American tea
In the Vanderbilt cup race were foasived
yesterday at the office of Chairman Jefferson
De Mont Thompson of the A, A. A. racing
board, bringing the total up to 1% Twe
were from the Oscar Lear Automobile Com-
pany for 110 horse-power FrayerMiller cars
and the third was from the Maxwell-Briscoe
Motor Company for a Maxwell. The notice
from Chairman Thompson's office gave Mr.

Robertson as driver for the Maxwell, but this |

may be a mistake as Robertson was reported

yesterday as having agreed to drive the

Apperson racer, which is yet tobe formally
entered. On account of Chairman Thomp-
son's absence in Europe, where heis per
sonally attending to the entry of the French
team, there will be no meeting of the A. A, A.
racing board ag the Vanderbilt cup commls-
alan until Mr. Thompson returns. For this
reason intending entrants of cars for the
American team are requested to send in
their entries on or before July 1, the date set
ot entries, both foreign and American, to
close.

 

For the third annual tour of the Amerioan
Automobile Association three more entries
were received yesterday at the office of Tour
Superintendent A. B. Tucker. Number 84
was from John W. Breyfogle of Rochester,
N. Y., for a Gearless oar of 50 horse-power,
through the Rochester Automobile Club.
Number 35 was from ©. Henry Fosgate of
Quincy, Ill., who did not name the car. He
entered through the Chicago Automobile
Club, and will make the trip from Chicago to
Buffalo, but will not contest for the Glidden
trophy. Number 36 was from W. W. Burke
of New York city for a 40-45 horse-power
Columbia, through the New York Motor Club.
Mesers. Breyfogle and Burke will drive from
Buffalo to Bretton Woods and both will be
contestants for the Glidden trophy.

 

Louis R. Smith of this city, the amateur
driver who defeated the professionals in the
obstacle race at the recent open air show
at the Empire City track, has joined the
ranks of those automobilista who have been
fined for excessive speed. He was returning
from Tarrytown to his home on Thursday
afternoon in a Maxwell runabout and was
held up by a village constable as he was
passing through Irvington-on-the-Hudeon.
He was taken before Police Justice Irving
M. Taylor, who fined him $10 on the testi*
mony of Officer William Grady that he had
been travélling twenty-two miles an hour
Mr. Smith and his companion both declare
the charge was untrue, but this made no

ifference. He demanded a rcecipt for his

ne and received a very unofficial document

reading as follows: “Received from Louis
R, Smith Ten Dollars for exceeding the speed
limit of the corporation of the Village of
Irvington.” It was signed by “Irving M.
Taylor, Police Justice,” who did not date
it, and bore the endorsement “Taken by
Officer William Grady.” Mr. Smith said
that the drivers of four other runabouts
were arrestcd and fined the same day, but
that he Boticed several big touring cars
folns through the town at thirty miles a
our without molestation. He | warns all
drivers of small cars to go through Irvington
very slowly unless they wish to make invol-
untary contributions to the village treasury.

The plan of the Rochester Automobile Club
to hold a road race of 100 miles four times
around a 25 mile circuit on Labor Day is
meeting with some opposition, Qne of the
objectors is County Engineer McClintock of
Monroe county, who thinks the contest should
not be run,ifor the following reasons: First,
there are eleven crossings of steam railroads

e, 80 that each car that makes the fu
run of four times around the 25 mile ciroult
w cross the railroads forty-four times.
Second, the bridge over the Genesee River
south of Scottsville, which will be used, is
one of the en gegs cast iron bridges ever
erected. ithas been condemned for anything
but ent loads at low speed, and is not cone
aldered worth repairing. Third, the closing
of 25 miles of the highway in Monroe count
to Kodera travel on a holiday from 10 o’cloc
in the morning until 8 o’clock In th e afternoon
is unfair and unreasonable, especially as the
only two improved roads entering the city
from tho south are included.

Automobilists given to touring in this
country and advocates of good roads are
much {nterestod in a bill introduced in Con-
grote y Representative Rhodes calling for
he eqtablishmont of a national commission
o pa lic highways. The measure provides
that the commission shall cooperate with
the States and Territories in the construction
and improvement, and to bring about as far
as practicable a uniform system of construc-
tion and improvement, of the pubs roads,
TheBcommission is to be made up§of three
members, one of whom is to be appointed
by the President of the United States, and
who must have practical knowledge of road
engineering and building. The Postmaster-
General and the Secretary of Agriculture
are to be the two cther members of the com-
mission. The Postmaster-General isto ba
president of the commission and the practical
road builder is to be secretary. The bill also

rovides that the legally constituted author-
ities of the several States and Territories who

ave jurisdiction over the public roads, on
having expendeiagiven sum subsequent to
January 1, 1907, in the establishment, or
fmprovement or the public roads under their
jurisdiction, shall file in the office of the State
or Territorial auditor a duly certified and au-
thenticated statement of all money 80 ex,
pended, When any State or Territory shall
make application to the commission for
national aid for the construction or improve-
ment of the roads therein, according to the
rules and regulations laid down by the com-
mission, it shall be the duty of the commisston
to immediately appropriate a sum of money
equal to the amount expended by such State
or Territory in the establishment or improve~
ment of the public roads within twelve months
prior to the date of the application. The sum
appropriated to any State or Territory shall
ty exceed the sum of $500,000 in any one
year after January 1, 1907. The bill appro-
priates $50,000,000 for the purpose of carrying
out its provisions, the appropriation te be
available not to exceed $25,000,000 a year
during the years 1907 and 1908.

PAINTERS CALL OFF STRIKE.

WI Return te Work Under Terms of Um-
pire’s Decision Against Them.

The strike ordered by the Brotherhood
of Painters against the award of Charles
Stewart Smith as umpire of the demands
against the Master Painters’ Association
was declared off yesterday and the strikers
returned to work under the terms of the
decision, which was against the granting
of their demands.

The Masters Painters’ Aesociation has
in the meantime declared for the open ehop
in the trade but the painters are still in
the general arbitration board of the em-
ployers and the unions. Since the strike,
which went int. effect on May 21, two at-
tempts were made to oust the painters
from the board but there was a tie vote
each time, The decision of the painters
to return to work was hastened by tho
action of the Amalgamated Painters’
Society, which had begun to fill the places
of the strikers. It is believed now that
the open shop plan will not be pressed.

The Housesmiths and Bridgemen’s Union
has been notified that ita application for
reinstatement under the arbitration plan
cannot be considered by the ep lenats
until it first declares its strike off. he
strike is for an advance in wages from
$4.50 to $5 a day, but the housermiths offer
to waive this demand, return to work under
the old terms and give a bond that its mem-
bers will observe any agreement which
may be reached if the union is recognized
again.

SUSPECTS NARROWED TO TWO.

Police Looking for Positive Proof in Kinnan
Murder Case, Capt. Price Says.

Acting Captain Price of the Bronx De-
tective Bureau said yesterday that the in-
vestigation of the Kinnan murder mystery
had narrowed the range of suspects to “prob-
ably two.” He refused to give names or
even to tell the sex of the persons he had in
mind.

“While we have no information to give
out,” said Captain Price, “because we don’t
want the guilty parties to get wind of our
suspicions, we are now working on pretty
definite grounds. The trouble isto find legal
proof of guilt. It is an this that we are
working and it is going to bea long, tedious
job. The whole character of the case makes
conclusions very difficult.”

Martin Egan, who was examined by Act-
ing Captain Price two weeks ago and againa
week ago regarding his business relations
with Mrs. Kinnan, submitted to an hour
and a half of questioning by Coroner Mo-
Donald yesterday. The proceeding was
without any result eRoep to prove that
Egan knew nothing about the case. Egan
eaid Mrs, Kinnan wasafraid of her mether.
