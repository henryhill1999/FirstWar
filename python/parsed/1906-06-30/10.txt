IRON AND STEEL.

Continuing Imprevement in Iron Market
Active Demands for Sheet Steel.

The improvement in Easter and Western
markets for pig iron which oecame general
early in the week is going from strength to
etrength. Yesterday was a notably good
day in bookings of Southern and Northern
foundry irons and steel making metal for ae
nearby delivery as makers were able to ar-
range. The bearish symptoms that were
general a week ago have passed away and
there are Indications of bullish markets soon
to come. So long as the majority of Import-
ant foundry tron melters maintain their
present aloofness from the market there will
not be that surface appearance of firmness
which foreshadows higher values. But the
more experienced iron makers observe in exist-
ing conditions a strong undertone that ts
bound to make for heavy buying at strong
prices within a few days.

The presidents of several important pig
iron making corporations give it for their
opinion that the majority of iron melfers
have not bought within 60 per cent, of their
requirericnts for the second half of the year.
Prices are firm all around. The Southern
price cutting movement has come to an end.
Latest quotations from Alabama makers
are on the basis of $13.50 for No, 2 foundry
at Birmingham. Northern foundry, No. 2 X,
is $17.50@$18 at furnaces. There are few
Northern furnaces which are not well sold
up for some time ahead. Eastern Penn-
sylvania, New Jersey and western New York
fron makers report heavy deliveries and a
good run of new business. The fuel market
is unchanged. Prime 72 hour foundry coke
{s firm at $2.75@$3 for nearby or distant ship-
ments,

In the steel trades plenty of new business
is reported by the’ larger corporations, In-
dependent makers who rely upon the larger
associated mills state that they are evidently
in for a long season of famine in raw and semi-
manufactured products. Yet all exprese
the belief that they are being well treated
by the larger combinations, as it is evident
that a number of plants owned by these
gigantic corporations are unable to get ade-
quate supplies of billets and bars.

An instance of the congested condition of
the stee] working industry is seen in the lack
of an adequate supply of steel freight care
on the railroa4 from Conneaut, Ohio, to the
Pittsburg district. This road is owned by
the United States Steel Corporation, which

 

 

 

also controls the largest steel freight car |.

works in the world, and these works are
getting out more care to the order of the
strongest competitors of that corporation
than are shipped to the parent organization,
There is acute pressure for sheet steel, not
only from boiler and pipe makers but in
geveral other channels which work in sheet
metal, Steel alloys are scarce and dear.
Cables received yesterday from Ruasia relate
that settlements of strikes in the manganese
ore district are remote, and that conditions
are growing worse with respect to shipments
by rail, as the Ministry of Transportation
refuses to hire or buy rolling stock.

GOSSIP or WALL STREET.

erbaps the worst feature of the market
yesterday was the weakness of the Steel
{ssues, which could hardly be attributed to
any other cause than liquidation, The reason
for the selling was not to be found In the
trade, ae all trustworthy information indicated
that not only was activity undiminished but
that bookings for the coming year were on
& larger wcale than ‘at the cofresponding
time {n years past. A possible explacation
of the selling lies in the fact that a great
amount of both stocks has been speculatively
held in the expectation that the common
would enter the dividend Ist in the fall of the
Present year--an expectation which seems
likely to be disappolnted—and that prevall-
Ing money conditions have involved the
necessity of a reduction of loans by certain
speculative interests which have not un-
naturally sought to accomplish this by liquida-
tion iS stocks which have at all times a free
market.

Bear tips began to circulate soon after the
opening ef the market, among them being
& prediction that United tates Steel common
would drop below 80, - It did not, and at about
4 an buying seemed to be of very good
quality,

 

The extreme of bearishness was repre-
sented by the prediction that the decline
would continue until railroad stock reached
@ level to yield & par vent. on the purchase
price, Now as @ matter of fact several issues
ere at that point already. Baltimore and
Ohio, with 8 per cent. to come off in the middle
of August, yields considerably more than &
per cent. at preaent prices, and Atchison
preférred paya 5 per cent. and sells at par.
Should the Union Pacific dividend be ine
creased in the fall the yield on the present
Price would be nearly 6 per cent., and severa)
others could be picked out to yield aboutthe
same rate. This takes acoount of regular
dividends only, entirely disregarding the
poasibility of righte, which in some cases add
materially to the average return on the in-
vestment over a period” of years.

In spite of the heavy preasure of stock
in the afternoon there wasno demoralization,
and any one wishing to sell securities could
alwaye find a market for them, at declining
prices, to be sure, but without the risk of
any very big drop from the previous trans-
action,.jAs prices went down demand im-
prov when the Steel stocks were making
new low records for the year thousands of
sharea could be sold without muob effect
on the quotations,

 

Real liquidation cannot be stopped until
{t haa run its course. So long as it can be
accomplished without any more serious
effect on prices than it has had ih the last
week there ia no real cause for alarm. About
all that has eo far happened is that large
speculative interests which made a great
deal of money in the last three years have
been obliged to part with some of it as a re~
sult of their own imprudence in loading up
with certain stocks which they moved up
toa price level where the public refused to
take them off their handa. When money
market conditions made it difficult for these
interests to renew loans they were forced to
liquidate something, and as their specialties
did not command a very wide market they
were obliged to turn out their most salable
securities. It was not considerations of
value but the exerencies of individuals that
forced the liquidation in such stocks as Steel
preferred, Baltimore and Ohio and Union
Pacific,

A conservative broker of long experience
says that le has never known a time when
the line of value was so much above the line
of prices as it is at present. The line of
value he would make to correepond with the
earnings represented by the various stocks,
and this would be crossed and reocrossed by
the line representing the fluctuations in the
market prices. The line of price ig some-
times above, sometimes under the line of
value, and a carefal study of the relations of
present earnings te present prices discloses
the fact that earnings now represent a better
return on.market-prices of stocks than ever
before.

The interesting question suggested by
the divergence of the line of price from
the line of value is whether the adjust-
ment will come from a raising of the
price line or a lowering of the line of value,
One or the other must happen, as the present
abnormal condition cannot last forever. If
business fs to decline that settles it. At pres-
ent there is nothing whatever to indicate
any lessening of the country's activities, and
so long as chese keep up and the market oon-
tinues to decline the further price and value
get away from one another and the greater
must be thé market advance ultimately to
restore the national relationship between the
two. A condition of normal ease in money
would be a sreat help toward readjistment.

There was a disposition among brokers to
argue that the short interest had been practi-
cally eliminated by the advance on Thursday.
But it is very hard to see how such can have
been the case. On that day the activity was
not extraordinary, the transactions totalling
little more than 1,200,000 shares, and as a great
part of these represented transactions be-
tween traders on the floor and the usual
manipulative business, it seems entirely im-
possible that there was room for the extinction
of the whole or the greater part of the short
interest which had been forming for weeks.
It was reported that two houses covered be-
(ween them 100,000 shares, which n ay be an
exaggeration, but the mere mention of such
heavy ventures on the short side suggests
that, taking the Street as a whole, the bear
account must have been a very large one.
The probability ts that a good deal of short
stock was covered but that a still larger
amount still remained out at the end of the
day, although rendered less unwieldy by the
partial covering movement and by the in-
crease in the floating supply resulting from
the liquidation during the week. To this
already existing short interest yesterday
probably supplied @ very considerable addi-
tion.

When Steel preferred broke below 100 it
was pretty generally commented that If this
issue was not worth par there was hardly a
stock on the lst that was worth ite price.
The temper waa still bearish, but this singling
out of one+seourity, on the ground that it
looked relatively cheaper, was a stepping
atone to discriminating purchases.

“Somebody has been obliged to go to the
bottom of his box and turn out the best he
has,” said a shrewd trader when he noticed
the commencement of liquidation in Great
Northern and Northern Pacific: “and,” he
added, “when there Is liquidation of that kind
there are apt to be bargians for those who
can afford to pay for them." ;

Pennsylvania was one of the centres of
attack by those working for a decline, andthe
usual weapon of a prediction of a big break
wads used with some effect, On account of

e large volume of fhe mock, the traders
sere not afraid to sell i and while
6 was & deal of reat Havdeting, there
there, a foubt phat, much of the selling was
ofa very different kind.

Pacific Mail led the ‘decline in the Parriman
stooks. This company is controlled by
Southern Pacific and the selling attracted
attention to the possibility of heavy loss of
busin: by these con\ panies as 4 result of
the destruction of San sranceeco and. the
diversion of traffic to other ports. There

COPPER, TIN AND LEAD.

Remarkable Consumption ef Copper in the
' Electrical Engineering Trades.

Aside from steady buying of copper for
foreign and domestio electrical engineering
lines there is little doing Mm the markets.
So much business of magnitude is shaping
forth in contracts to the great electrical
power and telephone engineers of Europe
and America that these Interests are buying
copper to the end of the year.

The president of one of the most important
electrical manufacturing corporations in
speaking to Tor SUN onthe matter of copper
said: “Our corporation will mark this year
with the consumption of 60,000,000 pounds in
our own factoriee. Other domestic workers in
copper will record for this year’s production
on account of foreign and home contracts se-
cured by our company about 125,000,000 pounds
of copper. If we had the room for 16,000
more working people we could use their ser-
vicea to-day. We are extending our plants,
and the same is the case with eighteen other
domestic: corporations in the same pursuits.
It has been difficult to get on time deliveries
of copper during the six months, and it seems
to us that the production of copper is barely
commensurata with the world's demands

Hydroelectric tranemission is only in ita
infancy. To-day the world has but 1,523,645
horse-power actuated under the system.
Accepted plans soon to be carried out for
important installations in the United States,
Mexioo, Canada, Europe and Agia call for
almost 2,000,600 hydro-electric horse-power,
When lord Armstrong installed the first
hydro-electric plant at his home in England
in 1882 the p¥acticable transmission distance
was one mile. To-day the zone has been In-
creased to 600 miles, and it would be pos-
sible to operate every railroad and lighting
station and factory plant in the State of New
York by hydro-electric power generated
from the watershed of the 11,000 equare miles
known as the Adirondack region. Pro-
ducers’ prices for copper are firm and un-
changed at 18% @190. for lake, August and
Beptember; electrolytic, August and Sep-

OUTLOOK.

THE BUSINESS

 

State of Trade Throughout the Country
Reviewed by ‘ Dun‘s" and ‘‘Bradstreet's.’’

Dun's Weekly Review says to-day:

To-day closes the most successful fiscal
year in the nation’s history thus far, and
optimism is so general throughout the com-
merolal world thet the next. twelvemonth
period promises to oarry the high water
mark etill higher. With few exceptions the
crops are making good progress, and the new
year will start with more business on the
books of menusacturingegagerne and greater |
enterprises and undertakings in contempla-
tion than on any previous July 1.

Scarcely any labor struggles of {mportance
exist, and there is no Inflation of securities
through speculative operations with bor-
rowed money. These are some of the reasons
for confidence in the future. Trade reports
for the week indicate a seasonable disposition
to curtail wholesale business, but even this
summer influence is less quieting than usual.
More new acales have been signed by which
wages will be increased, and the pending dis-
pute at textile mills promises amioable settle-
ment. Railway earnings in three weeks of
June were 10.8 per cent. larger than in 1905,
and disbursements for interest and dividends
at this centre next month are estimated at
$160,000,000, which Is about $20,000,000 larger
than a year ago. One of the few adverse |
reports of the week is the delay to rebuilding
San Francisco by the high price of labor
and the tardiness of some insurance settle-
ments.

Bradetreet’s says:

A week of comparative quiet in wholesale
trade, but of improved retail distribution,
favored by warmer weather closca a half
year. period the like of which, for activity
and volume of business done, has probabiy
never before been oqualled. Rank clearings,
foreign trade returns, railway earnings,
etatistica of iron production, railway build-
ing ond all available measures of trade and
industrial volume go to confirm this, view
despite numerous disturbing elements, such
as Congressional deb«tea on rate bills, dis-
turbed money market conditions, insurance
legislation, the San Franeiaco fire and the
coal strikes, which tended, pérhaps, to modify
what might otherwise have been super-
abundant activity.

Tooking to the future, the prospecta cer-
tainly suffer little by comparison with the
garnered results of the past six months.
The crop situation asa whole is good—in fact,
exoellent—and will compare favorably with
any similar period in the country’s history.
Basing their operations upon these under-
lying conditions, dealers have bought liberally
in anticipation. Salen for next fall, winter
or spring, as the caso may be, are of full
(in many lines record) volume, Prices show
remarkable strength, oonsidering the in-
creased productive elements brought into
play and the proverbial effect of high prices
on consumption, ‘
