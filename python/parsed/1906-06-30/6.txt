buying up mortgages and making rather
unscrupulous use of the power ho derives
from them. When he extends this mort-
gage system to the whole State and makes it
last for a generation and more it is rather
hard not to smile at his ingenuousness. In
his anxiety to attribute corruption and
cowardice to a whole State he seems to
forget the quality of a born leader which
he attributes to Jethro, and which is per-
haps of more importance than the power
to corrupt in a really permanent “boss.”

It sends us back forty years when we read
ebout those mortgages. What an infamous
thing a mortgage was to all who had to do
with it except the borrower. What tale
was complete without the villain who
threatened to foreclose? Has any other
form of business transaction been treated
as harshly in fiction? There is no indication
that Jethro was ever a harsh or unjust
creditor, but his holding mortgages damns
his moral character at onos.

His political rival, too, the mug, respecta-
ble business man with his silk hat and side
whiskers, steps right out of the oldtime
melodrama, The gallery recognizes him
asa villain at once. It is too bad that he is
used merely as a foil for Jethro; for a shrewd
and successful business man, even when he
steps into politics, or rather lobbying, need
not always be a chump.

In a genial manner Mr. Churchill drops
hints as he procecds with his story that he
intends to write others and bids the reader
watch for them. We hope that when he
does he will be merciful and not use two
words where one will do. Mrs. Florence
Scovel Shinn’s illustrations are well drawn,
but she has made the mistake of assuming
that Mr. Churchill's characters are carica-
tures, which they are not.

A Great Change in New York.

It was rather ingenious to sweep the
map clear of the city of New York to make
way for a renewal of the sort of people that
lived and did rude deeds in the Dark Ages.
According to Mr. Van Tassel Sutphen’s
story of “The Doomsman” (Harper & Bros.),
the time of which is set in the year 2015
A. D., something extraordinary befell the
town of Tammany Hall and the Waldorf
and Little West Twelfth street toward the
close of the twentieth century. We speak
advisedly (we have long been eager for the
chance to employ that word) when we eay |
that what happened was extraordinary;
practically the whole place was done away |
with. Of course there were ruins—so much
may be learned from the illustrations, which
are, in our opinion, particularly interest-
ing by reason of the presence in them of
ruinous remains.

The reader will be thrilled by the ad-
ventures of Constans amid the ruins of
New York, along about page 63. It may
be imagined that the skeletons of skyscrap-
ers looked ghostly enough in the moonlight.
In one of these skeletons the oppressed
wanderer counted thirty-six ribs, or atories.
There wero people, too; indeed, the Dooms-
men of the City of Doom were very terrible
people. Constans, who himself belonged
to the House People,saw plenty of them,
{ncluding their chief, the ninety-year-old
Dominus Gillian, before he got out of the
placs.

It is diMcult to say, even after a close
consultation of the book, just how it was
that the Great Change waseffected. Per-
haps it is sufficient to know that it was ef-
fected, and that the whole world, all the
way around, had the civilization that we at
present enjoy suddenly knocked out of it.
After it was knocked out, people, as may
be learned in the story, propelled their
war veseels with oars and fought their
battles with bows and arrows. It certainly
was a Great Change, and we do not wonder
that the historian should spell it with capital
letters.

 

Foreign Lands.

An entertaining account of the accsesible
places in the old Barbary States, helped
out with excellent colored pictures, will be
found in “Algeria and Tunis,” by Frances E.
Nesbitt (A. and C. Black, Macmillans). It
is an unpretentious journey the author
takes, seldom leaving the railroad and only
touching et well known places, but that
will make it easier for the traveller to follow
in her steps. She sees things intelligently
and has plenty to relate that is of interest
of modern times, of the old Mohammedan
days and of the remnants of Carthage and
of Rome. Algiers, Biskra, Tingad, Tunis,
¥] Djem, Kairouan all supply their share
of brilliant pictures. The author, who is
also the artist, is more successful with land-
scapes and street views than with figures,
which is perhaps to be expected in water
colors. In this book she certainly tempts
the traveller out of the well beaten road
into lands where a step will tale him out
of Western civilization and she brings
him to the brink of the great desert.

The wildness and barbarity that may yet
be found in Europe are described by Mr.
Frederick Moore’ in “The Balkan Trail”
(Macepfllans). It is a novel and refresiiig
account of personal experiences. Mr.
Moore went to Macedonia in search of
Turkish atrocities in behalf of the Londoa
Times. He has the remarkable gocd judg-
ment to leave out these matters, save as
they fit in incidentally with his adventures.
From the mass of incidents, many trivial,
many often amusing, none professing to be
more than the impression of the moment,
the reader will be able to form a pretty vivid
{dea of the jumble of races who are cutting
one another's throats under the Sultan's
rule. There is a delightful absence of
prejudice for one side or the other that gives
force to the author's observations and
rakes his book very readable.

The tour of Spain is described, a trifle
pompously, perhaps, and with too evident a
desite to instruct, but pleasantly enough,by
Mr. Edward F.utton in “The Cities of Spain”
(Macmillans). The author follows the line
of the railroad from Burgos to Ma ir:d, then
to Seville and Granada °c back by way of
Valencia and Baroelona. His description is
greatly assisted by Mr. R mingion's vretty
colored pictures, The accoun’ of the Madrid
picture gallery, to which Mr. Huiton devotes
much space, is illustrated from photographs.
The book will be a useful companion for
intending travellers in Spain.

The inclusion of books from other sries
in the pretty “Mediaval Town” seri+s, issued
by J. M. Dent and Company, is to be re-
gretted. The “Paris” by Mt. Thomas Okey
(Macmillans) now added to it, when it first
appeared, under another title, a couple of
years ago did not secm to be a very suo-
cessful pico? of work, owing in part to the
fact that the subject was too larg3 for a
moderate sized volume. That fault is
apparent in this volume too, tae author
having chosen to bring in general French
history, when the town history alone would
have strained his resources in Fpacs. The
last chapters form e@ sort of guide to the
city. There is no harm in that when build- |
ings are to be described; but why go into
the contents of the Louvr> gallerics and
why should the “Victory” of Samothrac3
be the frontispiec? for medimva! Paris?

 

Fiction for Hot Weather
No great mental exertion will he needed
to follow “The Colonel of the Red Huzzare,”
by Mr. John Reed Scott (J. B. Lippincott
Company) as he rattles through his many
adventures. Thos? occur in one of the

mythical kingdoms favored by modern

Th ee I a et a

fiction, so that habits and manners and
probabilities are beyond the range of criti-
cism. So is the spelling, as the title shows.
Naturally, most of the characters bear
titles, We mset a genial old king with
a daughter, who is a very nice girl. There
is hadinage marked by quantity rather than
quality. Considering how much of the |
story is devoted to flirtation and love the

need for a foreign stage setting is not ap-

parent. The story reads easily.

An earlier story by an author of popular
automobile tales, Mra. C. N. Williamson's
“The House by the Lock,” is republished by
B. W. Dodge and Company, New York. It
{s a story of crime and detection in which
the speed with which things and people are
made to move may blind the reader to gaps
and flaws in the plot.

Elizabeth, with her horticultural ex-
periences and her not very kindly views of
the people about her, seems to have estab-
lished herself in our fiction and to have
found her imitators, A new edition of
“Flizabeth in her German Garden” is issued
by the Macmillans, with colored pictures
signed Simon Harmon Vedder. The pict-
ures are pretty and seem to be very well
reproduced,

Mr. Danio! De Leon continues his good
work of making Eugéne Sue’s “Les Mys-
teres du Peuple” known to English readers.
He translates another of the tales in “The
Iron Trevet, or Jocelyn the Champion”
(New York Labor News Company). It
deals with the days of the Jacquerie and of
Etienne Mare?! and is full of excitement.
We wish, however, that the translator had
refrained from calling it the “uniquest of
the series.”

The rise of an energetic young man with
red hair from rural beginnings through
newsboy and journalistic experiences to
be the political master of his State is re-
counted by Mr. Richard Barry in “Sandy
of the Sierras” (Moffat, Yard & Co.). Some
episodes are well told, but there is a deal
of vapid declamation, and at this late day,
after the flood of newspaper, political and
wild West novels, it is difficult foranauthor
to avoid arousing reminiscences in his
peader.

The rather miraculous bodily removal
of a fashionable church into a slum neigh-
borhood gives Mr. Amos R. Wells in “From
Tuxedo Avenue to Water Street” (Funk
and Wagnalls Company) occasion to attack
| the hypocrisy of some phases of religious
life and to express his approval of revival
| methods. Some parts of the story are put
so brightly that it seems a pity, that the
author has not made more of it than he has,

 

 

Other Books.

Mr. Louls Frederick Austin, born in
Brooklyn, was a well known London jour-
nalist who died suddenly last year. A col-
lection of his articles, mostly of recent date,
has been made by his friends in “Points of
View” (John Lane Company). In the nature
of things they deal with matters of
ephemeral interest, but they are all bright
with touches of scholarship and of humor
that preserve their readable quality. The
longest is a sketch of Sir Henry Irving,
written for the North American Review
just before Austin died, which reached
America just in time to serve as Irving's
death notice.

The sociological ideas of the late Henry
Demarest Lloyd will be found blended with
his philosophical and religious beliefs in
“Man, the Social Creator” (Doubleday,
Page & Co). It presents a system which,
though left not wholly complete, yet fairly
sums up what the author had thought out
regarding the construction of society and
the forces that will affect its future.

The volume on “The Election of Senators,”
by Dr. George H. Haynes (Henry Holt &
Co.), recounts fully and fairly the history
of the manner of electing Senators and the
attempts at legislation on the matter in
the past. It also presents the arguments
in favor of election by the people and those
against. The latter, however, are answered
in the notes,so that the bock reads like a
plea for popular elections.

In “The Legislative History of Naturali-
zation in the United States,” by Dr. Frank
George Franklin (The University of Chicago
Press, Chicago), we have an excellent sam-
ple of modern research methods in Ameri-
can history; it isa conscientious, laborious
and dull doctor's dissertation. There is no
attempt to show the existing curiosities of
naturalizetior, for the study ends with ths
civil war.

Ministers will probably welcome “Spur-
geon's Illustrative Anecdotes,” edited by
the Rev. Louis Albert Banks, D. D. (Funk
& Wagnal!s Company). The stories which
the great preacher used to make his points
are cut out from the sermons and grouped
under suitable heads for reference. Some
of them lose by the process, while the
application of others does not seem so
clear. We imagine that it may be some-
times dangerous business for less eloquent
men to borrow Spurgeon's thunder.

In “The Law cf Marriage and Divorce,”
by Frank Keeper (William J. Nagel, Bos-
ton) we have a general dissertation on the
rubject followed by synopses of the stat-
utes of the several States ‘and Territories
as to marriage and as to divorce. To
these are added forms, statistics, the reso-
lutions of the Divorce Congress .and the
United States Supreme Court decision in
the racent case of Haddock vs. Haddock.
It is a well prepared treatise, practical and
clear, add remarkably up to date in the
cases quoted.

 

The Inner Life of College People.

It isa strange coincidence that two novels,
published almost simultaneously should
deg, with ‘n> same rather out of the way
community, viewing it from the same
point and treating it much inthe same way.
Mrs. Mary Tappan Wright's exoellent story
“The Tower,” recently reviewed in THE Sun,
told of the faculty life in a small college,
touching on the differences between the
old and the new, and that point was empha-
sizea by her in a later magazine story.
Now comes another story of a small college
faculty, a capital story, too, “In the House
of Her Friends” (Robert Grier Cooke, New
York), with no author's name,in which the
same contrast is made.

Every college man knows the old pro-
fessors with their ripe scholarship and the
traditions that have gathered about them.
Every one knows, too, the young and push-
ing specialists who are taking their places,
Men out of college have assiimed that these
latter would ripen also as the years went
by, but these women chroniclers of
faculty life tell another tals. Gentleness
and modesty yield to push within college
walla as they do without.

Here we have a woman's tragedy. The
President's daughter-in-law, sensitive, re-
served, attending to all her own duties and
those the college imposes on her, unable
to fit in with the college peop e or the town
people, finally breaking out into a cry for
freedom from them and their narrow life.
That feeling, we fancy, will find an echo
in many a college heart; she is drawn very
well indeed. Then there is her daughter,
a young gitl growing into womanhood,
who finds time amid her own flirtations to
be jealous of that part of her mother’s
life that she does not enter into. We do
not recollect having come across the de-
scription of that relation before. It is
done delicately bere, but we should have

 

_ “THE SUN, SATURDAY, JUNE 30, 1906._

liked to have had it worked out with a
mother leas reserved.

The right people are all delightful—the
kindly, autocretic president who overrides
his faculty, the professor who goes to the
bad, the energetic middle aged lady who
eols a4 4 sort of deus ex-machina, soine of
tbe boys and girls, The wrong people,
on the other hand, though every college
will recoginve zome of them, have rather
exaggerated faults, and the misdeed of the
mischief making old maid is beyond belief.

Tho main love story is interesting and
unusual; the college atmosphere is main-
tained throughout; there are charming
descriptions of xcenery and bright bits of
convereration that is not smart. The book
is well written, though half a dozen, or #0
slips may be pointed out that jar. “In the
House of Her Friends” is worth reading asa
story and as something more.

FENWICK’S
CAREER

By Mrs. Hamphry Ward

“Unquestionably it is one of |
the few really notable novels of —
the year, and it is almost univer-
sally conceded by the critics to be
the crowning work of Mrs, Hum-
phry Ward.’—Lewiston Fournal.

“Eugenie is even more appeal-
ing than Julie le Breton or Lady ©
Kitty in all that goes to the en- |
dowment of sweet womanhood. ©
She is very feminine, very human,
very unconscious, very noble in
character. She is one of Mrs.
Ward's cleverest portraitures.””

THE |
SPOILERS

By Rex Beach

“As good as The Spoilers,”

the way other novels are tet
advertised, which means that The ~
Spoilers is what a novel should be.
“Everybody is alive in The i
Spoilers,” says one critic, which
may explain its great popularity. —
“One of those rare stories that |
seem real to the reader even after
the book is closed.”

—Columbus Fournal,

EVE'S
=| DIARY

By Mark Twatn © ‘

You may be sure Adam never #
got a glimpse into this interesting 4
journal that Eve kept in the
Garden of Eden. She has a lot
to say about him, but after all
her naive confidences about her-
self are the most delicious. Mark |
Twain declares he has faithfully 7
“translated it from the original” —
—a guarantee of its authenticity
and laugh-provoking qualities.

BESS OF
THE WOODS

By Warwick Deeping

     

A romance of the English for-
est country with all the charm of &
Robin Hood. i

“Bess stands out as a sin
larly strong, sweet and attractive
personality.”’---N. 2. Tribune.

THE
DOOMSMAN

By Van Tassel Sutphen

“A fictional glance ahead into
a new age."—N. 2. /’orid.

“One of the best novels of the
fantastic class, abounding in con-
trasts and stirring narrative.”

—T.ouisville Courier-Journal.

*A good many of us have
wondered what is to become of |}
things at the rate we are going,
and have fancied that it would
i result in some such smash as this
author assumes to have taken
ee "—Rochester Herald.
