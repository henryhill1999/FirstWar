J. EZ. MADDEN SAYS GO BETWEEN
18 A STALLION.

 

Ho ls Willing to Bet 65,000 That He Is Not
@ Gelding and 8100 te 610 That He Is
Not a Ridgeling—The Caso Is Still On
«A Gloomy Clubhense Commissioner,

John I:, Madden, who trains F. R, Hitch-
oock’s Dandelion, the horse that ran second
© to Go Between In the Brooklyn Handicap,
/ pame out yesterday with this positive asser-
tion:
“Go Between is neither a gelding nor 8
ridgeling. He 1s a stallion, pure and simple.
I have examined him myself and I etand
ready to bet $5,000 that he is not a gelding and
$100 to $10 that he je not eridgeling. In future
‘ there is no rule that will permit Shields to run
Ge Between as a gelding, getting the usual
three pound allowance.”

Robert Tucker, who bought Go Between
as a yearling, said yesterday that when he
first saw the son of Meddler there was noth-
ing to show that he was not a gelding, as

| represented. He expressed surprise that Go
| Betwoon ha@ been pronounced a stallion.
The statement of Madden goes to show why
| FF. R. Hitchoeok has protested Go Between's
victory in the Suburban. a case is still
in tho hands of the stewa of the Coney
Island Jockey Club, but it ie believed that it
will goon be turned over to the Jookey Club
to be finally adjusted. Should Go Between's
viotory be declared null and void his share
of the Buburban stakes, $17,000, would revert
to Messrs. Hitchcock and Madden, Aleck
Shields has persistently declined to discuss
the matter. He has acted {n good faith all
J . When he bought Go Between out of
the Thistle Stakes last year for $7,000, an
' official of the Jockey Club, as he put Go Be-
tween up at auction, described him as a bay
goldipe. He has raced as such ever since.
In the Suburban he was handicapped to carry
| a certain amount of weight. He packed this
impost and won the race fairly and equarely.
Jt was not until then that the protest was
filed. Sentiment among horsemen who have
looked into this affair leans toward Shields.
Some time ago bookmakers got an impres-
sion tbat the clubhouse commissioners had
. a pretty soft thing handling the big bets of
the notables of the turf and much jealousy
was the result. This spring a well known
' bookmaker and poolroom keeper decidod to
“ take advantage of @ pull to got tato the club-
house where he might seoure some of the
- eupposed cream. He made book and was

from bad to worse and the newcomer was.

\ literally torn to pieces, as far as his bank roll
' was concerned. Yesterday he was walking
under the trees behind the grand stand in
a gloomy mood. A friend who was passing
playfully punohed the brooding bookmaker
in the chest.
“Ghoer up!” said he.
coming!”
“You ought not to hit me like that!" said
' the bookmaker, as he quickly thrust bis hand
into his inside pocket and began taking out
) the fragmonts of a bottle. A label was on
one of the fragmonts and the friend, pickling
' ig up, read the words;
“Carbolic acid!”
“I got it to take a stain out of my clothes!"
was the way the sad eyed person explained
' the startling diacovery. Iter the book-
« maker and former poolroom keeper was doing
- business as usual, but on a very einall acale.
© Wille Shaw did not ride Ormonde’s Right
~ {n the Thistle Sta'ces, although bis name had
heen hoisted on the jockey board. Ho had
climbed into the saddle in the paddock when
the ugly tempered son of Ornronde threw
down his bead and rolled over. Shaw fell
heavily and one of his legs was jajured. The
jockey fainted, but came to later, more
* frightened than hurt. Jerrine was hastily
& engaged to take the mount and the betting
¥ took a quick rise,
. When First Mason won the Thistle, for
» which he was entered to be sold for only
“$2,700, Robert MoKeever proceeded to bid
him up to $4,200, C. E. Rowe, the owner,
» bidding an extra $5 and eending the son’ of
' First Mate back to his etall. Rowe, it will

be remembered, bid up horses belonging to.

. the Raineys and C. T. Henshall some time

» ago, and this boost was in retaliation, it was

' believed, as McKeever is the betting com-
missioner for the Clev@land turfmen. Pee
run up netted $750 for the owner of Garnish,

who ran second. Previous winners of the
Thistle were Francesco, Andy Williams,
Dainty and Go Between, whe wes beught by
Shields as stated above.

’ Eddie Burke won about $20,000 on Mel-
bourne Nominee in the firat race. He got
an average of 15 to 1 for his money. The
erowd near the judges’ stand did not see
Melbourne Nominee at ali until he suddenly

'.Joomed up in front of him. He ran within a
few feet of the outer rail,as soon as he got
»past the bend in the track. Lady Ellison,
near the inner ral Jooked the winner until
Melbourne Nomines hooked up with Ancestor,
bobbed into view right on top of the judges.
The crowd along the rail had shut this pair

‘off completely from view.

Amberjack was posted as a starter in the

. first race, but he was withdrawn after the

|~betting was under way. Some bookmakers

| refunded bets made on the Daly horse, while
| others kopt the money on the plan of play or
 pey.

+" A raft of money was lost on Toddles in the
\‘third race. The public and many of the big
| operators went to the mare with all kinds of
money until she was practically backed off
ithe boards. Many in tre clubhouse took
| Jersey Lady two ways. Lyne, who rode

the letter, made Miller look tike e novice
|-when it came down to a finish.

Grenade gave nine pounds to Maxnar in

| the handicap at a mile and a quarter. Just

| why Maxnar was made such a hot favorite
| Was something of a mystery. Many smart

, players did not bet on the race at all,

~ “If you knew which one to play,” said a
‘elubhouse patron, “you could win a good bet.

“But which one is it?”

* Grenade was in hand all the way and could

“have run the distance in much faster time
*had he been extended. Grenade i¢ one of
‘the most consistent horses in training. He
has won five out of his Jast six races. The

\ wise guys, in all bi one or two instances,
‘passed him up.

'* The last race bristled with good things,
Monfort, Frank Lord, Ben 8frong, Curriculum,
Al Powell and Judge Davey were all on the

‘tip of the tongue. Judge Davey is owned

“by C. De Witt of New Orleans, who had a big

‘bet on him to show. With Martin riding
“August Belmont's Curriculum, the word was

passed around that this was the jam. Big

money was bet on the son of Hastings, but

“it went up in smoke = L. Willlams, who rode
ne Lord, did everything but fall off. As

, er went to the post full tilt with Monfort

he struck the horse numerous blows over the
head to keep him from running out, But in

“the race the Ornament colt bore out all the

way and burned up a lot of money. Only

the pikers bet on Solly M., at 60 to 1, The
pesult of this race was a good thing for the

» bookies all around.
<< A Weary lot at bettors saw Content, whom

“they had backed to beat Brookdale Nyroph,
‘trail home last in the second race, Content
‘had no speed at all and wag beaten before she
travelled a quarter of a mile.

EMPEROR TO SEND YACHT.

William of Germany and Sir Thomas Lipten
So Race at the Jamestown Exposition.

WASHINGTON, June 20.—Acoording to ad-
vices received from Berlin by the James-
town exposition offloers, it seems assured
that Emperor William of Germany will not
only send one yacht to represent him in the
international yacht races next year, but that
he will also send the Meteor, which was chris-
tened by the President's daughter, Mrs.
Nicholas Longworth, and was the scene of a
recent dinner in her honor at Kiel.

President Tucker of the exposition com-
pany has also received assurances that Sir
Thomas Lipton will come over with a yacht,
and it is hinted that he is almost ready to
announce that he Wui participate in the race
himself, hoping to win the President's cup.
Sir [Tbomas saye that be wishes to visit his
old home in MA foak as He asked President
Tucker to ascertain if members of the family
for whom he worked in Dinwiddie county
when he was a boy are still livin an
whether they. might be found on the ol
homestead, hen a boy Sir Thomas came
to America as a stowaway and started in life
with a Virginia family,

While only two American yachts can enter
in the coming race, it is expected that there
will be more foreign yachts entered than has
ever before been known in aracs underAmer-
ican auspices and that it will be the most
spectacular event of the kind ever held,

Clothier and Larned Take Finals for Middic
States Doubles.
William J, Clothier, the Pennsylvania State
lawy tenis champion, and William A, Larned,
formerly a titleholder on many courts, yes-
terday won the final round of theMiddle States
doubles tourney at Mountain Station, de-
feating Theodore Rt, Pell and Harry Torrance
in a four set match, The winning pair were
‘a little shaky, Larned being renowned as
almost anything but a doubles player. Pell
played well enough, serving strongly at all
times and occasionally showing brilliant
streaks, He found a lot the matter with
Torrance's play and kept up a running fire
of admonition that was unnerving to his
partner. In the first set, won at 6—4, Clothier
and Larned got 27 points, against 26 for their
opponents; Pell-Torrance won the second
sot at 7—5, scoring 40 points against 80; Larned-
Clothier won the next two at 6—2, ScOFIAg 28

day's and yesterday's games rere DOM y: he
out an @rror on the part, of the New of 8.
The hitting of the New orks was as telling
as their fielding. They bunched nine hits in
two innings and score proportionately,
Chase started both rallies, Conroy seconded
him each time, and Laporte, Williams, Dele-
hanty and Hoffman followed on with drives
that sent men in. It was soulful, altogether
slamming.
Chase and Conroy made a hit each that did
not count in the scoring. his was in the
first inning Chase being caught stealin.
a alngle; then Conroy prodding a safety to
right was wiped out stealing. Armbruster
put the ball in just the right spot for the
stealers tc run into it in Parent's hands, For
the Bostons Chesbro’s slants were veiled in
mystery except in one inning, the third, The
trailers lifted the veil in that inning and that
inning only.
After Dineen had struck out, Parent singled
dpat out of Williams's reach, Stahl worked
fappy Jack {st four balls, and Freeman re-
called his old home run days b
triple to the right fleld fence.

awkwardness allowed Hoey's raspin

‘erris fii to Delehanty, Hayden was hit,
Morgan's perpendicular single fell between
Chesbro, and Chase and Hoey .. Dineen
walked in the fourth, Parent filed to left and
Stahl singled, Freem
could have retired Stahl at third, but made
the play on Freeman at first. The erroneoue
reasoning cost nothing, as Williams by a light-
ning stab with his left hand gathered in Hoey's
suddenly shifting Rounder =
fhe New Yorks broke loose in the fourth:
Chase's grounces whistled st Morgan.
Conroy hit to the same point of the compass,
and Laporte swung at a ball that suited him
like an athlete throwing the hammer. He
met the ball late, and it went to the right
fleld fence. Chase and Conroy jogged home.
and Laporte paused at third base. Williams
doubled to left, scoring jsporte. Quick
flelding would have held Williams at first.
Delehanty sacrificed, which seemed a pity,
in view of the way the New Yorks were bump-
ing Dineen. Williams scored on Hoffman's
single, and this time Stahl returned the ball
sharply and nipped Hoffman at second.
Parent's fumble of Hoffman's grounder,
McGuire's out at first and Morgan's ba
throw of Chesbro's grounder gave the New
Yorks a run in the seventh inning. Chase
dropped a single in centre in the eighth.
Conroy bunted Bafely toward first. Freeman
fielded the ball poorly to Ferris, who covered
first, and Chase reached third, porte
fouled to Morgan, and Williams doubled to
left and scored Chase and Conroy. There
was another double left in New York's locker,
and Delehanty found it. Williams came in

on it. The score:
