Chairman Dick has tssued a statement in
which he says that the returns Justify the claim
that the Kepublicin plurality in Ohio will be
froin 75,000 to 80,00, which ia the plurality
shown by the Republican poll of the State.
Chairman Dick also cla s the election of seven-
teen and possiliy elehteen of the Republican
candidates for Congressmen, a net gain of two
and possibly three members. This Congress
estimate includes tie Third and Twelfth, which
are now represented by Democrats, and the

SURROUNDED DY FRIENDS HE GEIS
DESPATCHES OP VICTORY.

From the Very Oatset the News Was Favor-
able and the Hoaschold Was Cheerfal--The
Way the Retarus Came In—Scenes Earlier
in the Day~The President at the Polls
~Cordtal Greeting to Chairman Hanna Who
Made a Visit to Canton tn the Afternoon.

 

Canton, Ohio, Nov. 6.—Telegraph bulletins
of the election were received at the McKinley
home in the room on the second floor above
the reception room and from the same room
inuch of the news from Canton was despatched.
The oMce room of President McKinley con-
tained the telephones giving direct communi-
cation with National Headquarters at Chicago
and New York with Gov. Roosevelt's residence
at Oyeter Bay, New York, with the White House
and with the Union Club at Cleveland where
Senator Hanna was receiving the returns

The President and a number of men friends
received (he early despatches in the library,
while Mre. Mebiniey and the women visitors
were recelvirgg the news in the rooms on the
routh side of the house, The front reception
room Was occupied by the reporters

The first news eae from New York and was
in line with what have been the expectations
all alone, indisoting a wreat victory in the Fme-

  

pire state. It was followed by reports indi-
eating Nepublican siueeesses in Cook county
and Maryland. Fuller details in the way of

figures seemed to make McKinley's election by
Oa bie vote a certainty

One of the pleasantries of the evening was

 

A tlash over the wires from Senator Seott to
Senator tlanna, soving “Shake, old limpy,
shake." It was the use of the committee name
that Senator Hanna's rheumatism: has earned
hin

The President received the intelligence pas
tively, but the others in the house could not
restrain a ripple of laughter when the news
came at #45 o'clock that Bryan would make
no statement unti! he had full returns and that
he had goue to bed.

About 10-3 o'clock J, H. Manley telegraphed
the President trom New York headquarters
as follows

“Praise ¢
Your triumypt

od frov. whom all blessings flow
iad reelection are conceded by
the Demmocratiomanagers, I tender my earnest
congratulations We are very happy at head-
quarters every State in your district will give
you its electoral vote

ried at least twenty-seven Stales with 284 +
that the President is satisfied that it will .ot be
lee Hon W. A) Lyneh, Gold Democra., also
receiving news with the President, said at the
sume time that Mehinley’s electoral vote would
not be below, 284 and it looked as theugh it
would exceed 300

President McKinley was in good spirits
all day and awatted the coming of the elec-
tion bulletins with complacence and ap-
parent confidence, which, If possibe, was
strengthened upon the arrival of Senator

ballot, + we there was some fluller about
the polling place as he approached, so far as

ercised the right of franchise in the same demo-
erate fashion that he has always done. Judge
lay, lis neighbor, who votes in the same pre-
cinet, walked to the polls with him. and they
were followed by Secretary Cortelvou, Dr

INDIANA BY 30,000,

INDIANAPOLIS, Ind, Nov 6.--At midnight
the returns from Indiana indicate that the Re
publicans have carried the State by a plurality
that will reach 30,000. if the ratio of gains
continues the Republicans will also elect their
state ticket aud have ma (orities in both branches
of the Levisiature. The returne from = the
Congress districts are not complete enough
to base a conclusion upon, but it is certain
that the Republicans have held their own and
have possibly elected their candidate in the
Fourth district, making a gain of one member
The Democratic campaign committee do not
concede a Republican vietory, but claim that
later returns from the country districts will
show Democratic gains

Mr. Harry &. New, editor of the News, gave
out this interview:

“McKinley has cerried Indiana bevond the
slightest possibility of doubtand I fully expect
the plurality to exceed 25.900. The chances
are that we shall gain two Congressmen, Al!
the State officers and both branches of the
General Assembly are Kepublican. Fuller
returns will inerease rather than decrease
McKinley's plurality.”

 

WEST VIRGINIA FOR M'KINLEY,

WHEELING, W. Va, Nov. 6-—The Democrata
have almost conceded the State. The Republi-
can managers claim that President McKinley
will have a plurality of about 15,000. In the
Third district the Republicans have gained
a Congressman, knocking out the Charleston
Dermocratic combine. The Republicans have
elected to Congress in the First district Bo B
Dovener: Second, Alston G, Dayton: Third,
Joseph Ho Gainer: Fourth, James E. Hughes
The Legisiature is in doubt, and the result
may not he determined for two days. The
Democrats claim it, but the Republican mana-
gers are confident of a working majority
Later returns give every reason for the bellef
that McKinley's plurality will be about 17,000
the four Congressmen have undoubtedly
been elected by the Repubiteana The Lecis

States like Illinois, Michigan, Wisconsin,

and Wyoming, as well us the States on the
Pacific Coast, show much larger pluralities
for McKinley than are recorded in other
parts of this paper.

In Nebraska, Bryan's own State, the Re-
publicans hope to find the plurality finally
as high as 20,000,

Utah continues to show a good account
of itself, and is surely Republican, Mon-
tana sends reaffirmation of the election

States are practically as given elsewhere.

It is a Republican victory more sweeping
than even the most sanguine Republican

ROOSEVELT TO M'KINLEY,

He Congratolates Him and the Nation on the
Result,

Oyster Bay, L. 1, Nov. 6.—Gov. Roosevelt
sent the following despatch to President
McKinley to-night:

“OYSTER Bay, Nov, 6, 1900,
“Premdint William McKinley, Canton, Ohio

“I congratulate vou and I congratulate far
more the nation. I feel the most heartfelt
gratitude over the result

“TMBODORE ROOSEVELT.”

The receiving of the election news by the
Governor waa merely an incident in a quiet
evening at Sagamore Wit, and the Governor
did not forget, in his intevest in what the voters
had done, that there ‘ad been a big football
game between Columbia and Princeton.

He asked for the results of the game as soon
as he had lear.ed that New York State was
safe for the Kepublicans.

The Governor made no special arrangr-
ments for getting the returns st his home
There im no telephone in his house and he de-
clined offers from the telegraph and telephone
companies to put wires in for election night
tle did ask some of his friends at Oyster Bay
to let him know what they heard

The Governor was at dinner with his only
guest of the day, Lient, Ferguson, of the Rough
Riders, when the first neighbor arrived with
election news That was about 8:89 o'clock.
Gov. Roosevelt went out on the steps to meet
hin and was told that New York State was
Republican by about 150,000,

“That settles it,’ sad the Governor,
more than I] « xpected.”

Then he astonished his neighbor, who wre
inclined to tak more about election, by ask-
ing him about that feotball game. The caller
wasn't sure, but thenght that Columbia had
won bv a seore of 6to5

In the meantiinioe the members of the Gow-
ernor’s family, who seemed to he more ex-
eited about the election than he wis, were wnrit-
ing impatiently for hun to eome back to the
house to tell them what he had heard. Thev
finally sent foeut. bergusen out to get the
nows for them

The Governor got later reports through the
evening from newspaper men and after hear-
ing of Republican vietories in the Western
States exclaimed

“This proves tiat tue American people are
al! right.”

That was the only comment he eaid that he
had to makeon the election to-night. He «aid
he would sit up till 12 4) ocloex to hear more
from the Western Steies in which he had seen
the tight hinwelf, and hen go to bed

The Governor gave ont during the dae the
text of the two Ceiecrams wiieh he received
last night from Mayor Van Week and sheriff
Grell in response to hia jettors, in whieh he
insi-ted upon harmor Stare and
