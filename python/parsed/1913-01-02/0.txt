his hands with apparently # lack of sys-

In 1911 O'Ryan presented @ voucher for |
payment of expenses for an authorized |
trip to Washington and was paid $56 by)
the State, which !neluded travel, sub-
sistence and pay. We found on investi-|
gation that he had also drawn $14 from!
the civil funds of his organization for |
travel on the same dates which was!
covered by the State voucher. And from |
the same civil fund he further drew $75 |
for expenses to Washington. For this
three day trip he drew an aggregate |
of $145. |

In October, 1911, O'Ryan made a per-)|
sonal visit to Gov. Dix at his summer
home at Lake George. For this he drew
travel and subsistence from the State for
$32.36. He then drew from his organiza- |
tion $6.90 for travel from New York to
Lake George and drew $25 for expenses.

These are examples of many similar
cases and these are some of the facts that
an investigation would have brought out,
