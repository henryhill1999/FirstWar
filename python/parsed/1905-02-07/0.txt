MILLION STEEL BONUS

Will Go to Fully 5,000 Employees of U. 8,
Steel Corporation.

The United States Steel Corporation, ft fa

undemtood, edded 590,000 tons in January

At the close of the

to its ordera on hand

| December quarter the corporation reported

| Men and so on

unfilleel ordens of 4,996,208 tons, which, with
the January orders, brings the total np to
about 5,200,000 tons, or within 200,000 tons

of the corporation's record of 5,410,719 of |

un filled orders

The cash bonus of about $1,000,000 which
the Steel Corporation will distribute among
its employees is expected to benefit fully
5,000 of the company’s men, including heads
of departments
into the ranks of the steel
workmen. If the amount were divided
equally. each man would receive about $200,
but the division will be arranged on the
basia of salaries or wages

The American Smelting and Refining
Company. which also distributed a cash
bonus to its employees at the end of the last
fiscal year, is expected to follow the ex-
ample of the Steel Corporation and make
another distribution this year.
ing company inquired of Mr. Carnegie as to
the beat way to interest employees in the
business of the company, and his reply
was

“Let them participate in the earnings of
the company; then they feel that they are
not only salaried men, but are in reality co-
partners, and that everything they do for
the company they also do directly for their

| own benefit.”

This was the plan followed in the old Car-
negie Steel Company.

REGISTRATION DAYS,

Witt Baneh the Four a Month

Ahead of Election.

A bill is to be introduced into the Legis-
lature this week providing for several
radical amendments to the existing Election
law. The more important of these amend-
ments will be one changing the days of
regiatration in cities so that instead of
being sener-ted into Fridaya and Safur-
‘days a week apart they shall be four con-
secutive days, the last not less than thirty
days from the day ofelection. The purpose
of this alteration is to give more time to
the Superintendent of Electiona in this
city. Provision is also to be made in the
bill for a new system of identification of
Pereods registering and voting.

JACK LONDON FOR MAYOR,

, The Western Novelist Nominated for Office

"Several people have obtained the con- |

sent of Congresa to build a railroad up
that bil, which is $60 feet high. with the
idea of building pavilions and restaurants
and making it a resort. They have never
succeeded. Now come two other men, and
they ask for the privilege, and the House
has granted it. If they think they will
conduct a gambling resort on that hill
they are doomed to a rude awakening.
So far as the Government is concerned, it
has no objection to anybody building a
railroad up the hill and building pavilions
andsoon. Then if gambling fs attempted
the railroad will belong to Uncle Sam
That's not a bad plan, fs it?”

“Did you know the character of the men
to whom this permission {9 granted?” Mr
Lacey was asked

*No, I never heard of them, and TI don't

what their character is That
If they have

stolen property which they appraise at
$10,000. They also arrested several young

foremen. olerka, furnace | ™&2 who, they say, have been looting Har-

lem houses and flats for months past.

The robberies were frequent and the
police strove hard to get track of the thieves,
but for months could not locate them.

The residence of Thomas Lloyd at 2028
Lexington avenue was robbed about ten
days ago of $800 worth of clothing, jewelry
and silverware. A gang of young toughs
made a hangout of a poolroom run by

Edward Schaeffer at 125th street and Third |
When the Lloyd robbery was re- |

avenue.
ported, Capt. Burns told Detectives Teevens
and Sullivan to look the place over. He
sald he was convinced that some of the
thieves would be found there. The de-
tectives went, but the men they were look-
Teevens in

bundle of clothing which looked suspicious.
When Schaeffer could not give a satisfac-
tory account of jt he was arrested.
Schaeffer was put through the “third
degree.” As a result, John Wesley, alias
“Hall,” of 2711 Eighth avenue, was arrested.
He would not talk, but the eleuths next
learned that he had a brother, Benjamin
Hall, living at 424 Fast 12¢th atreet. When
they went to search his home yesterday
they were told by the janitor that Hall had
moved away. They traced bis effects to
a storage warehouse on the east side of
Harlem, and there they found two large
Saratoga trunks filled with stolen goods. The
list of the property includes nearly 800 pieces
of solid silverware, jewelry, silk dresses,
kid gloves, vases, lace curtains and valu-
able paintings. The paintings had been
cut from the frames. After the stuff had
been laid out last night in the captain's

oom it looked like a section of an art
museum.
Some of the silverware had the name

Lloyd on it, and there were a lot of silver
spoons with the letter M on them. There
are several rings and braoceleta which had
evidently been set with diamonds or otber
Valuable stones. The stones had been re-
moved. Capt. Buros said last night thet
he had arrested eight of the gang, and the
detectives went out to look for two more,
all that remained.

From information he has received from
some of the gang, the captain says that

‘they had a regular syatem of robbing houses.

It was their intention to take in more mem-
bers, so Chat their operations could be ex-
tended to other parts of the city. They
generally worked in pairs, and never in
the same locality at one time. Most of
their operations were confined to Harlem,

of Jefferson Davis tells the story of her hus- ;

indignant when ashe told of the manacles

St. PeTenssuna, Feb. 6.--The Assembly
of the Nobility of St. Petersburg has, by
a vote of 158 to 20, adopted an address to
the Czar, in which is an appeal to his Majesty
to summon elected representatives to assiat
the Government. Following are extracts

| from the address:
“Sire, we have met in distreasing times.
Our hearts are troubled at thé sight of our

| and disorders at home. Foes are attacking
us. Their aim is to bring Russia to a
shameful peaoe, to ruin her, to wrest from
her her distant territories and to bring to
naught the system of government which
| haa the sanction of centuries. Such a

material forces of the country. A way
out of our difficulties must absolutely be
found. Sire, all our hope ia in yous

After an appreciative reference to tho

has weathered troubles in the past, coming
out stronger, the addreas continues:
“From the union between an autocratic
monarch and a devoted nation Russia has
ever derived a atrength which neither a
foreign foe nor troubles at home could ex-
haust. ‘
“Sir, the nobility of St, Petersburg
are convinoed that this union has not been
shaken and must prevail with the aid of
God. Our valiant troops, sparing not their
lives for the Emperor and fatherland, will
crown the Russian arms with fresh glory.

With the aid of God the unrest at home, |

too, will abate. Your intentiona, Sire, are
clear, and the whole nation awaits with
eagerness the fulfilment of the imperial
will, but officials and statesmen, whatever
their qualities and zeal, cannot solve all

Hewsinarors, Feb. 6.—Procurator Johna-
son of the Finnish Senate was shot and
killed to-day. The assassin presented a
visiting card at the Procurator’s residence,
inscribed Lieut. Alexandre Gadd. He asked
to see the Procurator on business and was
admitted to the study, where M, Johnason
was working. He immediately fired three
shots at the Procurator, each of which
was effective. Death was almost instan-
taneous.

M. Johnsson's son, who is 17 years old,
was in an adjoining room. Hearing the
shots, he rushed into the study and fired at
the assassin, who responded. Both were

Spectal Cable Despatch fo THE Scw.

| Lonpon, Feb. 7.—The St. Petersburg
| correspondent of the Chronicle asserts that
| Gen. Gripenberg’s reverse and the apparent
| Impossibility of gaining a victory over
| the Japanese have caused the Grand Ducal
party to review the situation, with the
result that it has decided in favor of peace.

The announcement that Gen. Kuropat-
| kin might be recalled was really started in
| order that negotiations to terminate the
war might be facilitated,

The oorrespondent says he knows that
the Russian representatives in Paris have
been instructed to take whatever steps
they deem advisable to secure the good
will of Great Britain, with the object of
obtaining the most favorable terms from
| Japan. Count Benckendorff, the Russian
| Ambassador at London, was in St. Peters-
| burg last week in connectiof with the situa-
tion, and he waa similarly instructed.
| For the first time since the war com-
menoed the Russian Government on Mon-
day stopped overland telegraphio com-
munication with the Far East. Ship-
owners who telegraphed to Vladivostok
making inquiries concerning their steamers
had their messages returned marked,
“Wires under the contro) of the Russian
' Government.”
| ‘The linea affected are the Great Northern
| Company's by way of Siberia and Man-
ohuria. It is stated that no messages
| for the East have been transmitted by this
line from St. Petersburg for several hours,

One inference is that the strike, which
| was lately reported to have spread to Ir-
kutsk, Krasnowarsk, Tomsk aad elsewhere
in Siberia, has become serious. Another
| inference {s that some war movement isa
| afoot necessitating constant communication

ment,
