According to reports presented to the

delegates whose seats are to be reviewed
by the committee on credentials. It is
the firm belief of those directly interested |
in the culmination of this convention
that by the time the committee onfereden- ,

difficult to nominate the President on the

Moptb or So,

One of the biggest Washington Market
| merchants imparted to a Sun _ reporter
| yesterday the cheerful news that the
| present high price of beef is likely to per-
| sist all summer and that other (marketmen
with whom he had talked agreed that in
|a@ month from now it will be still higher.
Beef at wholesale jumped the usual quar-
ter of a cent yesterday but there was no
general retail advance.
| The well informed Washington Market
| dealer attributed the lofty prices to scarc-
| ity of cattle on the Western ranges.

“Of course there is manipulation of
prices,” he said, “but the consumers
should know that the fundamental cause

{of their troubles is shortage of supply.
| There simply aren't enough beeves to go
laround. Of course high prices will
cause an increase in production, but as
{t takes two years to bring’ steer to the
| selling point you can figure that no apeedy
| relief is in sight. Lamb and pork will be
| cheaper sooner than will beef, for lambs
! and hogs don't take #0 long to raise.
“Look at what beef on the hoof was sel!-
‘ing for in Kansas City yeaterday~ from
115 to 35 cents a hundred pounds more
\than the previous high mark! The beef
| trust had nothing to do with that. De-
; mand was so much greater than supply
| that. the cattlemen and their agenta got
| practically whatever they asked.”

The mathematicians in the conference |
after going over State after State and
Territory‘after Territory could not:figure
more than 470 votes sure for Roosevelt. ;
The sanguine ones in the conference be-
lieved that the entire La Follette strength
of twenty-six votes in Wisconsin could
be turned over to Roosevelt and that |
would make his total 496, or fourty-four
less than enough.

But those familiar with the Wisconsin
situation pointed out that the La Follette
delegates from that State had been elected
at open primaries and publicly instructed
by the votera for La Follette. It was
true that Henry F. Cochems of the Wis-
consin delegation, for many years chief
lieutenant for Senator La Follette, had
been won over to the Roosevelt cause,
but inasmuch as he dared not disobey
his instructions for Senator La Follette
he had resigned his credentials and his
alternate was to act in his place, !

Mr. Gompers and iis associates Were the

Mr. Gompers had brought was one similar
to that with which he beseiged the plat-
form committee four years age. It
called for a law vrobibiting the issuance
of injunctions in labor disputes. Tt was
virtually the same as a bill which Was

lastly that the Republican party should

Mr. Gompers and his cammittee talked
for almost half an hour for the full plat-
form committee. When he came out
he intimated that he regarded the outlook
for his planks as being dubious. It will
be remembered that four years ago the
committee absolutely refused to accede
1o the demands of Mr. Gompers in the

then threatened the party with extinction

|RULE TROUBLE

 

At an early hour this morning Col.
| Roosevelt urged his followers not, to
| let the delegates whose seats were con-
tested vote in the convention and if thir
| Was permitted he advised them to or-
Ganize their own convention in the same
‘hall

The Pennsylvania delegation to the
national convention voted last night,
; 82 to 2, to bolt the convention. Cal.
Roosevelt addressed the delegation and
other delegates who had gathered with

them, Indicating that he would sanction
' the bolt.

, The nineteen Roosevelt members of
the committee on credentials left that
committee and resolved to hear contests
on their own account at a hotel,

During the proceedings of the con-
| vention the Roosevelt delegates started
‘a demonatration for Gov. Hadley of Mis-
'souri, When the cheers began to die out
a woman who refused to give her name
; hung a plceture of Roosevelt from the
| weet gallery. A wild scene ensued. Men
cheered and the Rooseveit detegatiqns,
} ‘aking up thelr State standards, paraded
alsies. The demonstration lasted
forty minuter.
| Chairman Root was frequently com-
_Pelled to suppress turbulent delegates,
especially from Texas and Pennsylva-
nia. Once’ he threatened to have @
| Texan ejected from the hall.

{ A motion of Gov. Deneen of Illinois
to prevent delegates whose seats were
contested from voting on their own con-
tests was tabled by a vote of 564 to

510. Four délegates did not vote.

The committee on credentials went
| into session as goon as the convention
adjourned. The Roosevelt people sub-
mitted seventy-two contests. 4

The commitee on resolutions went
‘into seesjon at §:30 o'clock to draw up
a platform.

At the meeting of Roosevelt leaders
heid on Tuesday night Garfield, Fort,
| Flinn, Pinchot and Col. Roosevelt de-
‘clared for a bolt of the convention.
' Senator Botah and Gov. Hadley refused
to sanction action that they believed
would wreck the party and bring dis-
aster to the Republican tickets In the
States. It was pointed out that Pinchot,
Garfield and the other bolt promoters
controlled no votes and had few po-
litical interests.

There was renewed taik yesterday of
a compromise candidate, particularly
among the rank and file of both camps.
Justice Hughes's name was much heard,
but there was some opposition to him.
With Justice Hughes's name was eou-

‘the

pled the names of Gov. Hadley and
| Senator Cummins, e
Col. Roosevelt spent the day in his

rooms receiving reports from his heu-
tenants and giving orders. He held a
conference with some of his delegates in
| private. It was the 190th day since he
, declared himself a candidate for the
| Presidency.

to delay decision until he had ascer-
