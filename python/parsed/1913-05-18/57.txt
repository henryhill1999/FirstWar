of misfortune But let her cheer herselt
with the thought that this year, when
diaphanous materials and seant styles
and absence of petticoats rule the day,
she can carry mnore clothes in @ sult ease
than ever before

The woman wh

her heaviest and most bulky clothes
For instance, suppose she wants a eoat

wear them, or suppose she s that she
must have her new afternoon
the kind that is modelled onthe eat of
army capes and boasts a lining of gay
plaid silks, she should manage
that over a thin wool, silk or cotton one

wear the heaviest shoes and the bulkiest
clothes which wants to have with
her and so leave more room ino her suit
care.

Present day underwear does not take
up much room, The necessary changes
ean be packed in a very thin layer in the
bottom of the case. A thin silk petticoat
oer one of crepe de chine or wash net

the suit case takes up only a fraction of
an inch. Stockings are never seriously
inconvenient, for they can be tucked in

It Is fn bad taste to overdress on a

j do, but ft is a mistake to be shabby
jand to try to get another week's wear
lout of every leftover in the closet. The
| blue serge suit should be put on every
j day With a fresh whit and a
jsmall hat which fits down on the head
and has a minimum of trimming which
must not consist of feathers or quills,

Tt !s usual to run thre

comfortable. The one frock

lis the only time you really have a
chance to wear white wash skirts with
blouses and white shoes. They are use-
less and expensive for KMurope and
should not be taken, but they serve ad-
mirably on the ship.

There is no way of getting
soiled, and so one does not
more than two skirts, Colored lMnen
coat sults and frocks are also avail-
able the whole way over if the weather
is moderate, and even when it is eold,
one looks smart and {s comfortable in
short white skirts and light frocks of
wash fabrics covered with a loose top
coat of heavy tweed or homespun.

If one wishes to wear these clothes

Choosing the Top Coat.
No matter what else is dispensed

with on a trip abroad, the top coat must
be carried along from start to finish,
Its uses are many, for it serves as a
pillow and a Dianket as often as it does
a covering to a gown, It should he
warm, ght In welght and well cut, As
it must be steadily worn it needs to be
an addition to a gown and not a make-
shift.

The so-called polo coat, which swept
over the country two years ago, is no
longer favored, and the short raglan
with ite back belted or loose and cov-
ered with capacious pockets is the
choice of the day. It is a good tdea
to make all topeoats short instead of
long, as they are not so heavy to carry,
and this means a good deal when one
wears such a coat through ten hours
of sightseeing.
