Merchant Marine,

Crisco, May 17,--Charles G. Dawes,

ex-Comptroller of the Curreney, had

this to say to-day of tariff legislation
how before Congress:

“Heplying to your letter of May tz. if this |

Governinent decides in favor of free trade,
many ot the larger Amertean manutaec-
turers ure ready to compete with the skill
and organizing genius of all the world, but
the Government that bids its imunuface
turers meet such a challenge should not
in the next breath by operation ofylaw
destroy the eMficiency and economic po-
tentiality of those who are willing to accent
that chellenge,

“Portioulariy is this to be avoided as
Lurope is seeking to create and build up
the very unite of production that America
Is seeking to destroy,

If these two policies persist--American
disintegration and European consolidation

the world may then read the fate of Amer-
ican exports and later the fate of itsdumestic
trade in the depressing history of the Ameri-
ean foreign merchant marine. That
business is now entirely in strange hands,
Like our manufactures it once helped to
enrich this nation and was our boast and
pride. It has been drivea from the seas
as completely as though it never had exist-
ence through unwise American legislation,

“The resulting losa to the country is
immeusirable to-day, The remnant of
that merchant marine is reduced to the
pitiable plight of begging a Government
subsidy to offset carrying an American
flag lo-morrow emasculated American
Inanufacturera may be reduced to the
necessity of begging @ bounty on exported
products,

“We cannot destroy a thing and hold it
too, We cannot cripple it and expect to
win the race. This ie not a question of
politics; it is purely one of business and the
publie welfare,

“Lt it is to be settled to the advantage
of America it must be done by men who
have courage to declare that an unwise,
uneconomig popular idea is a bad idea,
No defence of maagpol of manufactur
is here intended nor Is the destruction o
competitive conditions approved. No ap-

proval of wrongful practices is here sought
Nor is wny remedy suggested.” gue

New Tariff Won't Solve High

‘SOME

 

 

Many American manufacturers, re-

plying to a request from THe Stn for,

| their views of the probable effect of
the proposed tariff on the cost of liv-

‘the income of the consumer will be re-
‘duced as much as the cost of living,
(Jeaving the problem unsolved.

The Yale & Towne Manufacturing
(vmpany, the only coneern to take a

spite of a 44 per cent. reduction on its
products, would have preferred a tariff
cut by instalments, but is “not alarmed”
and is “ready to give the new rates a
fair trial”

Other manufacturers say that the
proposed tariff is the result of incor-
rect information and no information at

a time, but make sheep scarce and mut-
ton higher eventually, and that suffer-
ing; Wili be caused In various lines dur-
ing the readjustment made necessary
by tne new tariff,

A Dayton, Ohio, concern believes the
“industrial etagnation” that will come

ter.”

workmen can be hired in England for
the pay of one here, and that the Amer.
ican laboring man muaet bear the loss
that wil! follow the introduction of for-
elgn shoes in the American market.

Tho manufacturers say that American
mactinory and business methods are be-
Ing used ecxvtenelvely abroad and that
the manufacturers there are just wak-
ing up co the possibilities of an export
trade to this country, Here are some
opinions:

Enterprise Manefacteriag Ce.

James P. Verdery, president of the
enterprise Manufacturing Company of
Augusta, Ga., makers of sheetings and
shirtings, said: :

Our Dusinese may be slightly disturbed
by the passae of the proposed tariff bill,
but after adjustment to the new condition
of things, we look for a iong period of
profitable business. The effect of the
bill will be to lower the cost of living
to some appreciable extent.

American Sugar Refining Ce.

Edwin F, Atkins, vice-president of
the American Sugar Refining Company,
said: .

The American Sugar Refining Company
Wishes to be recorded in favor of a re-
duced tariff! upon sugar. It is our belief

that a moderate reduction which is not

Insular industries or to reduce such

consumer, end would neithe:
forelun values on raw matertal,
per pound.

We urge the retention of the amall dif-
ferential duty as a@ protection upon re-
fined sugar, if protection is to be accorded
to any industry, and the continuance of
the present color standard as the most
practicable distinction between raw

l refined sumar
cation

The present differential or protection of
a cents per hundred pounds ts) but
seventy-five one thousandths of a cent per
pound upon granulated sugar, and should
be retained, {f not tnereased in order te
cover the wagte resulting from the pro-
cess of refining, us well as the higher cost
| of labor and materfals tn this country.

{ We are opposed to the abottion of all
{duty upon sugar for the following reasons:
| Jt would cause the termination of the
Cuban reciprocity treaty under the provi-
of whieh a preferential rate of
per cent. is accorded to Cuban sugars, and
Cuba gives preférential rates upon goods
coming from the United States of
to 40 per cent

would open the United

 

fined beet sugar from Europe upon exactly
the same terms as raw sugar in com-
petition with domestic refined, and we
should expect to see, as formerly, large

from Germany and Austria,

In our opinion, the first effect of free
sugars. while present production ta matn-
tained, would be to drop prices here to, or
ubout, present bond values. 80 low a
price would destroy the Lousiana indus-
try, alvo the beet sugar industry in many
{Jocalities and particularly east of the
| Mississippt River, whieh is not protected
l by a long ratiroad haul against sugars
coming from the Atlantic and Gulf ports,
it would carry the price of Porto Rican

land Phittppine Island sugars far below
ithelr cost of production, and make
'Hawailan production unproftable, Thus

‘our present sources of supply would be
largely curtatled, for under normal crop
conditions these domestic and insular
sources of production are now furnishing
upward of 1,800,000 tons, or half our sup-
ply. Onee this production was 60 reduced,
foreign prices would advance until they
|
|

reached a point where domestic producers |

could again enter the fleld; how long a
time this would require {!# problematical ;
meanwhile, disaster would be widespread

| aud consumers would get but a temporary |

benefit.
United States Rabber Coe,

Col, Samuel P. Colt, president of the
United States Rubber Company, said:

The proposed reduction in the hard rub-
ber schedule from 85 per cent, ta 25 per
cent. ad valorem leaves sufficient protec-
tion, but the proposed reduction from 35
per cent. to 10 per cent. ad valorem fn
the soft rubber schedule, which includes
automohile tires, is insufficient protection
and should be modified to conform to
the hard rubber schedule,

There are forty manufacturers of auto-
mobile and vehicle tires in the country
and the sharpest competition prevails be-
tween them. Prices have been reduced
over 40 per cent. since 1910 and at the
same time labor has been advanced more
than half of that amount. With existing
lower prices for crude rubber labor plays
# more important part in the production
of tires than formerly and 10 per cent.
duty is not sufficient to overcome the
difference in wages in this country and
foreign countries, especially when taken
in connection with the higher cost of con-
struction and maintenance of manufac-

Arbuckle Brothers.

Arbuckle Bros., coffee and sugar im-
porters, had this to say:
, The new tariff will not affect coffee, it
having been on the free list for some
thme. In the case of sugar the cost will
(be reduced to the cousumer, which will
bring about an increase in consumption
as well as an increase in the {mportation
of. the raw product

Sugar will continue to be grown
those parts of the United States where
the climate and soil are adapted to the
plant's economical growth, while in other
parta, Where the Industry is now of the
hothouse variety, the business will be
eliminated. This {@ as {t should be

We favor free sugar and regret that it
| has been tahen off the proposed free leat.
| A 25 per cent. reduction is not big enough
| and three years is too long to wait for the
| article to become non-dutiable.

| From Hammond Typewriter Oo.
{ This is the response of Nell D. Becker,
president of the Hammond Typewriter
‘Company, New York:

| The business of manufacturing type-
writers is Hkely to suffer severely 1f the
proposed tariff bill becomes a law, The
DIN retains a tariff upon many of the ma-
| terials out of which we make typewriters,
but takes the tariff off the completed art!-
cle. This arrangement is 60 unjust that I
think {t must be the result of an overe
sight. The Germans are able to buy their
material cheaper than we, and their labor
costs them much less, so that !f the bill
goes through they will be able to deliver
typewriters in America cheaper than wo
ean furnish them. The effect will doubt-
less be a reduction Jn wages of employees
engaged in the manufacturing of type-
writers. Our European representatives re-
port to us that the German manufacturers
are jubilant over the prospect and are
freely predicting that they will compel
many American typewriter companies to
close their factories.

As to the effect of the new bill upon the
cost of living generally I am of the
opinion that the cost df living to the
people as » whole may be somewhat de-
creased, although considerable suffering
will be caused in certain lines because of
the necessary reudjustmenta.
