PAGE PROTEST NOT OFFICIAL.

Based on New ¥ abc Secretary's Per-
sonal Opinion, It Is said,

Special (able Despatch to Tae Sts
Lonnon, May 17.—-Speaking to-day of

   

the protest against th selection of
Walter H. Page as United States Am-
bassador to the Court of St. James's
made by the London Trades Council,

William Coffey of the Nationa) Union of
Bookbinders, who introduced the resolu-
tion of protest, said action was
based on a@ letter on the official paper
of the Allied Trides Council of New
York city and signed by Charles L.
Conway, its secretary, asking the Eng-
lish trade unions to protest against
Mr, Page’s appointment on account cf
Lis attitude toward union labor,

“T thought,” said Mr. Coffey, ‘that
the latter represented the official atti-
tude of the council, but to-day I find
that beyond an appearance of being an
official communication there is nothing
in the letter to indicate that it may not
he wnything more than Mr. Conway's
personal opinion. I have written to him
asking him for an explanation. If it
turns out, however, that it was only a
personal request from Mr. Conway and
that the facts are us he stated we will
not withdraw our protest.”
