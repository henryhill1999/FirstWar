Make YOUR Car a 1913 Model

ntil now it has cost the owner of an old
om 3400 to $600 to install an electric
ra and lighting system and prevented

‘his excessive cost and sacrifice of time
esuted from the necessity of altering

$409 and ready for delivery in a few days.
e Hartford Starter is the most powerful
and cfficient yet built—weighing less than

ni other and occupying less room. For
hese reasons its application is practicable to
he front of the car without unbalancing the
ign or detracting from the car’s appear-

de

But alteration is no longer necessary and
every car owner can thoroughly modernize
his car in the matter of efficient electric
starting and lighting equipment at a cost
that is well within his means to afford.

This has been made practicable by the in-
vention of the

lariford Fleciric Starting

 

System

It spins the largest motor fast enough
to start on the magneto in spite of fisher
compression, congealed oil and zero weather.
This wonderful exhibition of power is ex-
plained by the uses of a fly wheel on the arma-
ture shaft of the motor which develops from
ten to sixty H. P. as needed and turns an en-
gine at 110 r.p. m. on the least current con-
sumption.

With the Hartford Starter the gasoline car
is as much the woman's car as the electric—
starting instantly on the press of a button.
