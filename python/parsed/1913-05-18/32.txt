the custom tn fig growing districts to
hang caprifigs upon the branches of
the cultivated fig tree, in spring so that
the wasps emerging from them may
enter and fertilize the flowers of trees
which harbor no insects of their own.

will mature whether the flowers are
pollinated or not. There are species
which do produce what ts called a pomo-

tree fruit with seeds, without the medi-
ation of wasps.

Inspector W. Ho Lyttle to-day innoculated
a nuinber of Jackrabbits in the west end
of the county with the new disease “snufles.”
The purpose of the inoculation is to spread
the disease among the bunnies in the hope
that it will kill off the pests

The disease resembles distemper and is
said to be very fatal to rabbits, though the
only other animal susceptible to it is the
house cat and that animal is said to be not
seriously affected by it. In addition to
those liberated Dr, Lyttle brought home
several of the animals which he inoculated
