One cloud that hung over the social |
horizon has now been lightened. It was)
the dangerous condition of the Duchess of |
Connaught, whose death would have gone |
far toward ruining the season. There
were no hopes of her recovery a little
while ago, but her marvellous powers of
recuperation surprised every one. Her
{lness, however, naturally will be long and
tedious, and it is considered improbable
that the Duke will return to Canada to
resurne his duties as Governor-General
ond leave her here.
