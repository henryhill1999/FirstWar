ureg this may also be effective in the
other direction and the possibilities fyr
harm in some cases are even greater
than the possibilities for good, It must
be done right. The man who Is strong
may do almost anything with Impunity,
but he who Is only trying to become
strong should be careful.

In the case of one with poor circu-
lation and low vitality, injudicious cold
bathing may be very weakening. When
the victim of promiscuous but well
meant advice upon the subject goes
with grim courage into his morning
cold tub or shower and dreads the
shock of contact with the cold water
then he should know that he is placing
an undue tax upon his vitality. Tak-
ing a cold bath under such circum-
stances may be an excellent way of
cultivating character and moral stam-
ina, but it is not right that one's health
should be impaired in the attempt.

Briefly if you enjoy the morning cold
dip, or, in other words, if your in-
stinets approve of it, ther? it will un-
doubtedly do you good, But if one is
not robust, what then? Should frail
and delicate people avoid cold bathing
entirely? Assuredly not, but they must
know how to go about it. There are
certain simple conditions which should
be fulfilled, not merely in order that
the bath should be beneficial, but that
it should not weaken one of limited
vitality.

Perfect reaction or recuperation is
the first essential, and this really de-
pends upon several conditions, Nearly
every one knows in a general way the
intended physiological effect. The first
contact of the cold water contracts the
skin and the blood vessels, driving the
blood away from the surface of the
body, this being followed by a reaction
in which the blood is brought rushing
back to the surface in large quantities,
It is this reaction which is important,
and it is for its sake, or its expectation,
that men and women are willing to
brave the rigors of a morning chill.
But if the bather cannot get this re-
action, if his body has not sufficient vi-
tality to respond to the demand made
upon it, then he should either let it

The fing

alone entirely or so modify his method
of taking the bath that he can recuper-
ate perfectly.

Even if the body seems at the time
to react properly, with a ruddy glow
of the skin, you may know that it has
been too much of a drain upon your
vital energies if you experience a
trembling and nervous sensation after-
ward, If it should happen that you are
chilly after a cold shower the best thing
to do is to get your feet in hot water
as soon as possible, or to wrap your-
self up warmly and drink something
hot so that you may become quickly
and thoroughly warmed through from
top to toe,

As already said the important thing
is the reaction, arousing a vigorous
circulation of the blood, and having ac-
complished this the bather should not
linger in the bath until he becomes
chilled. One great secret of success-
ful cold bathing is brevity. Simply
get into the water and then get out
again, whether it is a tub or a shower,

And does this apply to swimming
also? It does in a very large measure,
The hotter the weather and the warmer
the water the longer*one can stay in
with impunity. It should be remem-
bered that one goes swimming under
more or less natural conditions, condi-
tions sometimes very different from
those which attend the tub bath in the
raw, early morning. But yet in most
cases open air bathers would do much
better to spend about one-fourth as
much time in the water as they usually
do, This applies not so much to robust
athletes as to those who are only trying
to build up health and gain strength,

For cold bathing, or for any bathing,
the room should be comfortably warm;
otherwise it would be better to forego it,
Never attempt to take a cold bath ina
cold room, for it will be much more dif-
ficult to recuperate,

Next, be sure that you are yourself
thoroughly warm, This does not mean
that you should be overheated, for un-
der such circumstances you should be
more than ever careful not to become
chilled, either through reckless bathing
or in any other way. But you should

te thoroughly warm through so that
the thought of cold water upon the skin
Will appeal to you, and will actually feel
good when you take the bath, There is
nothing so refreshing and gratifying as
a cold tub or shower under the right
conditions, That is why it is usually in
order immediately after vigorous exer-
cise, for the body is warm and the cir-
culation is active,

Under no circumstances take a cold
bath when you are already chilly, when
your hands and feet are cold or when
any part of the body is covered with
Looseflesh, It is true that a vigorous
tnd full blooded individual might take a
eold plunge even when chilled and might
thereby arouse such a circulation as to
become warm through the reaction, but
the ayerage man or woman trying to
bulld up vitality should not attempt it
except under right conditions,

Of the two extremes It Is probably
better to take a cold plunge when too
hot than when too cold if the bath Is
brief, for the surplus heat of the body
will’‘enable one to react instantly, But
to take a cold shower when one 1s al-
ready chilly Is to make recuperation
difficult and is like striking a heavy
blow at the vital organism, It is like
adding to burdens already too heavy,
If, on the other hand, you are perspir-
ing freely it does not matter, But
don't linger in the bath; It should be of
only momentary duration,

The important thing naturally is to be
absolutely warm and comfortable im-
mediately after the,bath and the preced-
ing bodily warmth and comfortable room
are required only for the sake of en-
abling you to be so, If your teeth chat-
ter afterward there fs something wrong,
The entire body should be In a glow
and your spirits high so that you can
sympathi with your bath robed and
exultant friend who greets you with the
declaration that he “feels like a fighting
cock," however unwarlike his actual
disposition. My own experience fs that
after a successful cold bath one feels
very different from and very much bet-
ter than a fighting cock, Perhaps more
like a crowing cock,

The shock that is experienced upon
entering cold water may when too se-
vere serve as a warning. It is then
truly a shock to the nervous system
and is likely more or less tu upset the
normal action of the vital organs, It is
true that even for one who is strong
and capable of enjoying the cold water
there will always be something akin to
a mild shock upon sudden immersion,
but this is not unpleasant or detrimental,
It brings about the reaction and the
benefit. The test lies in the question
as to whether the shock Is pleasant or
otherwise, whether It Is a source of de-
light or of dread, What do our Iin-
stincts say about it?

The temperature of the water Is an-
other important factor. Naturally the
colder the water the more powerful the
reaction and the more effective the
result, but each one must comsider the
limits of his own powers of easy re-

cuperation, The temperature of the
water should depend upon the in-
dividual, but it ds not usually best to

have it too low. A regular cold bath of
45 degrees Fahrenheit Is too strenuous
a proposition for many people, A tem-
perature from 60 to 70 degrees will be
very pleasing to some, but others will
require water considerably warmer,

It is a matter of personal preference
whether one takes a »iunge or shower,
sometimes a matter of convenience,
ut if these two forms of bathing seem
too rigorous In your case then a quick
sponge or splashing with cool water
will be better,

Tf your condition is so delicate that
even this seems to chill youfthen you
will probably get successfv results
by placing the feet In warm water for
a minute before the bath or even by
standing with feet and ankles Jin hot
water while you quickly sponge the
body with cold water, first the legs, then
the arms, then the abdomen, then the
back and finally the chest,

If your vitality is so low and your cir-
culation so poor that you cannot find
pleasure and comfort even in this
method then you would better not try
cold bathing until you have gained in
health and strength through outdoor

life and moderate exercise, After a
warm bath you will probably find en-
joyment and benefit in a quick cool
spray while standing in the warm water,
If so then such a spray or shower should
always follow a hot bath.

One cold bath each day should be
enough, Track athletes have sometimes
found that too much cold bathing af-
fects their speed and power, although
a quick shower after exercise would not
do this. If one is engaged in athletics
or takes any other active exercise in the
afternoon or evening that should be the
time for the cold bath Instead of in the
morning.

The first thing in the morning has
commonly been suggested for the cold
bath, probably because it is so often the
most convenient time. This does not
mean that it is always the best time
for one trying to gain strength, It is
true that it wakes one up, arousing all
the vital and functional organs, and
that this is desirable in many cases, but
for one of limited vitality it may not
always be best that his energies should
be so suddenly and violently aroused,
In such cases it may often be better if
the activities of the body are awakened
more naturally and gradually,

A cold bath is something of a stimu-
lant. This naturally does not apply to
the shower taken after a cross-country
run, but it is true of the morning cold
tub, taken just after getting out of bed,
It is furthermore a natural stimulant
and does not have the ultimately detri-
mental effect of a drug stimulant ex-
cept where one fails to react.

Nevertheless it arouses the activities
of the body to an unusual extent, per-
haps to an extent that will call for a
depression later. The time worn ex-
pressions, “whipping up a tired horse"
and “borrowing energy from nature in
advance” used of stimulants in general
will also apply to the morning cold bath
in some instances, since it may result
in a slump in one’s working energies
some time during the day. And this is
particularly true when the morning dip
is regarded as a duty rather than as a
pleasure.

Of course these remarks do not af:

fect Cousin Henry, the fresh young f
brute, who has so much vitality to
spare that he would not know it if he }
lost a good deal, One person may be so }
rugged that he can do almost anything, i
but this does not mean that the same ff
tests of vigor should be applied to
others who find it necessary to make a |}
continuous fight for health and energy.
I knew one young man who went inf
for cold baths. In the morning he }
would come flying out of the house
filled with vim and energy, highly stimu-
lated, but along toward noon came anf
inevitable slump. “That tired feeling”
struck him when the day was only half}
fone, He had just about energy enough
for his dally work if he saved it and
used it right, but he had no extra vi-
tality to waste through that morning
stimulation,

Tt is true that he might have done even
worse and that he used water too cold,
A dip in water of more moderate tem-
perature with a less violent reaction
might have done him good., And It is
also true that thousands do probably
even more harm through thelr morning
stimulation with strong coffee. How-
ever, vitality is such a precious come
modity that one cannot afford to squan-
der it In any way. I have emphasized
these points not to discourage cold bathe
ing but to show how important it {s not
to make any mistakes, The other exe
treme of physical stagnation is even
worse,

A similar caution may apply to © the
morning exercise If a man takes his ex-
ercise at this time of day, It Is better
to take only enough for warming up and
getting the blood ift circulation whether
through bedroom movements or a morne
ing walk. The walk is the better o
the two, However, some enthusiasts
endeavor to take the entire allowances
of exercise intended for the whole da
the first thing on getting up, and th
is kely to detract from the energy that
one can put into his daily work. Th
late afternoon would be a far bette
time or the evening.
