E. Irving Couse Has Lived for Ten
Years Among an Ancient, Pictur-
esque People in New Mexico

Irving Couse, who has) which Inevitably comes with the advent

of the railroad.

In this region live the oldest com-
munities of Indians known to exist any-
where, and they still preserve all their
rites and customs inviolate. Tradition
has it that these pueblo or town In-
dians, so called because they live in one
community like a little town, are Aztecs,
of the same race as the sun worshippers

ALLAHASSEE, the capital of
Florida, was for some years the
home of Prince Napoleon
Achille Murat, son of Joachim |

Murat, whom Napoleon made King of
Naples, The Prince and his wife were
buried in the Episcopal cemetery of the
town, and visitors to Tallahassee may
still see their graves and also the house

in which the Princess lived before her
marriage, with her parents, Col. and
Mrs. Byrd Willis. The plantation of

Prince Achille is near by, a portrait of
the Prince and a photograph of the
Princess are in the public library, and
many white halred men and women are
still living who remember the interest-

ing, strangely assorted but devoted
couple.

Among those who remember the
Princess with pecullar affection is

year's | Fanny Taylor, a very old negro woman,

the daughter of Patsy Lee, who was the
personal maid of Katherine Willis in
Virginia before she went to Florida and
was still her maid after her marriage.

Patsy, with several other former
slaves, was remembered in the will of
the Princess, and Patsy's daughter still
lives in a cabin near Bellevue, which
was the last home of the Princess, The
cabin {is new, but is on the site of the
former cottage, In which were recently
burned many historic and _ beautiful
pieces of Murat furniture, because, as
Fanny expressed It, “there was no man-
kind about to put out the fire.” The
cabin is as clean as a pin, In honor per-
haps of the fact that in it are gifts
from royalty.

Fanny showed a recent visitor with
modest but evident pride two silver tea-
spoons, three forks and an old fash-
foned twisted gold brooch given to her
mother by Princess Murat. From a
wash cloth of finest birdseye linen
hemmed with almost invisible stitches,
and the last one ever used by the Prin-
cess, Fanny unfolded two locks of gray
hair, one of the mistress and one of the
maid. The last and most cherished pos-
session displayed was a small photo-
graph of the Princess taken during th
latter years of her life.

Of both the Prince and Princess
their former slave remembers many In-
teresting Incidents. One of these was
the well known anecdote of how during
an absence of the Princess the Prince
dyed all the household linen, the lin-
gerie of the Princess and every dress
that the servants did not hide from him
a vivid pink, The dye used, tradition
says, was pokeberry juice.

On another occasion he invited a Tal-
lahassee friend to stay for dinner, urg-
ing the fact that he had killed a “tur-
key buzzard” and was having it cooked.
A sawdust pudding was another of the
odd culinary concelts remembered
against him.

Nothing could have been more royally
brillant than the Prince's first twenty
years nor more democratically dull than
the last twenty years of his life.

He was 6 years old when Napoleon
made Joachim Murat King of Naples;
and as the heir to the throne little
Achille was known as the Prince Royal
of the Two Sicilies and with his younger
brother, Lucien, spent a pampered
childhood at the court which his father
and mother established.

When Achille was 14 years old his
father and Napoleon became estranged,
and at this most inopportune time the
King of Naples also lost the loyalty of
his Italian subjects. In an effort to re-
gain his power by force he was cap-
tured and executed and his wife and
sons were sent as prisoners to Austria,

It was after several years of wander-

whom Cortez found in Mexico. The
Taos Indian is at any rate a devout
sun Worshipper. When he rises in the
morning his first act is to step out-
side his door and make obeisance to the
god of day, who shines through the
clearest sky in the world for nearly
twelve months in the year. When a child
is born it is taken at once aut of doors
and held high in the face of the sun.
Sun worship indeed, pure and simple,
is the basis of the creed of the Taos
Indian,

Not more than a dozen of the tribe

station, and actual contact with civil-
ization {is still a dream to them except
as it has come through the few painters

ings over Europe that Prince
drifted to America at the age of’ 20,

and it was in Florida that he spent most |
of the remainder of his short life. When
Col. Murat, as he was called by most
of his American friends, arrived in Tal- |
lahassee the belle of Florida was Kath-

erine Willis Gray, a young widow who]

lived with her father, Col, Byrd Willis,
who had sought and made his fortune In
the new territory of Florida.

Mrs, Gray had married a Scotsman
at the age of 15 and was left a widow
at 16, and as her child also died she
returned to live with her parents at
Willis Hall, near Fredericksburg, Va.,
and accompanied them when they
moved to Florida, The Willis home in
Tallahassee on South Monroe street,
near the Capitol, was a centre of the
social life of the State,

The beauty and charm of the young
Virginia widow, who was then only 22
years old, immediately captivated the
son of Caroline Bonaparte and_ his
courtship seems to have been as ardent
as might be expected from a tempera-
mental Frenchman, However, the
young woman was not only beautiful
and wealthy, but her mother was Mary
Lewis, a niece of George Washington,
and not even the dazzling fact that Col,
Murat’s mother was a_ —sister of
Napoleon could blind the eyes of the
blue blood of Virginia vo the knowledge
that his father, Joachim Murat, was
the son of an obscure innkeeper.

Beside which the Prince was eccen-
tric to a degree that was almost ill bred,
He spoke a burlesque of the English
language and was perhaps easily af-
fected, but certainly often affected, by
wine, He was, however, an intensely
interesting companion, and was eagerly
sought socially and valued as a sincere
and unchanging friend,

the Princess made a great impression
among English nobility, and they were
!of real financial assistance to members
of the exiled Bonaparte family, especially
Louis Napoleon, the cousin of Prince
Achille. The following year Prince
Louis Napoleon came to America ex-
pecting to visit his “Cousin Kate” and
“Cousin Achille” at their Southern home,
but he was recalled from New York by
the illness of his mother.

The Prince, with his active mind,, be-
came at one time very much Interested
in the study of law, to which he devoted
his entire time and quickly mastered it,
He was admitted to the bar in New
Orleans and formed a partnership with
Mr. Garnier, and for several years made
his home in the congenial French city,
where he divided his time between his
beautiful town house and a large sugar
plantation which he bought on the
Mississipp! River. Not understanding
the culture of cane, he lost a great deal
of money, but learned at the same time
a great deal about the people and their
life, which he recalls in his books on
America,

Returning to the ever cherished
neighborhood of Tallahassee the Prince
and Princess spent a number of years
at Econchattie, another of their planta-
tions, and it was then that the fighting’
blood of the Bonapartes was aroused by
the continuous outrages of the Indians,
and the Prince in command of a regi-
ment fought with Americans for Amer-
ican rights. |

The Prince was a brave and daring
soldier, quick, firm and resourceful, but
his wife proved herself a mate worthy
of a Bonaparte by following him
through every peril of the campaign,
nursing him through an almost fatal
case of fever and remaining with him
; until the bloody little war was over,

the Princess after the death of Prince
Murat. She bought the place and with
her favorite slaves settled there to
spend the remainder of her life. It is a
pretty white cottage of four immense
high pitched rooms, set on a beautiful
hill overlooking Tallahassee to the east.
An oleander lined walk leads from the
road to the doorway, and all about the
house are enormous magnolia trees cov-
ered most of the year with big white
blossoms, red berried holly trees and
srapefrult trees which at all seasons
are beautiful with either fragrant waxy
blossoms or pale yellow frult.

The entertainments given by the
Princess at Bellevue were noted all over
the South for their lavish hospitality,
and were enhanced perhaps in interest
by the service of solid gold and the im-
perial livery of the Bonapartes. The
privilege of using the red and gold liv-
ery was bestowed with $40,000 on his
“Cousin Kate" by Louis Napoleon after
he had become Emperor.

In the cottage were also a marble bust
of Caroline Bonaparte, many exquisite
pieces of French furniture and other
handsome gifts presented to her by Na-
poleon when, with the other members of
the Bonaparte family, she went to Paris
for his coronation. On many occasions
she was selected by him for especial
honors and welcomed as a Princess of
France.

On one occasion she was invited to a
court function at the Tullerles and was
told that she would know her position
at table by the rank of the person with
whom she went in to dinner. As one
after the other of the dignitaries present
passed out before her to dinner her
heart sank at the sight of the few non-
entitles left. Her unaffected surprise
and delight greatly pleased the Emperor
when he himself came quickly in, offered
her his arm and seated her beside him
at the table,

Another story she told was of Eugenie
and Louis Napoleon, with whom Mme,
Murat was spending a quiet evening at
the Tulleries, It was a custom at the
palace to serve ices and pastry during
the evening and when the liveried at-
tendants had come tn and placed the
refreshments and withdrawn, Eugenie,
although ill and forbidden te eat sweet-
meats, ran to the table and helped her-
self lavishly. The Emperor protested
and reminded her that the doctor's or-
ders must be obeyed. The Empress
laughingly heaped a plate and sat down
gayly on the arm of his chair and fed
him one spoonful and ate the next her-
self, saying:

“I'm not a bit afraid of you, Louis; you
must think I'm one of your Generals.”

The Emperor was never tired of listen-
ing to the animated stories of his Amer-
ican cousin and he and Eugenie begged
her to make her home in France, but
Mme, Murat could not forget the friends
left in Florida and that many planta-

{tions and slaves needed her personal

attention, so she returned to America

jand to Bellevue,

When the close of the war left Mme.
Murat penniless, although possessed of
thousands of acres of fertile farm lands,
and she and her several hundred slaves
faced starvation, the Emperor came to
her assistance and gave her a large
yearly income, on which she not only
lived in great comfort but with which
she did a vast deal of charity, helping
many stricken families and friends in
Florida and Virgina.

Mme. Murat made another visit to
Paris in 1866, where she spent a year in

‘an effort to regain her failing health.
