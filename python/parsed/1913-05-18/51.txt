OU Americane are always talk-

ing about the simple life.
You make it a sort of reli-!
gion—in talk; but from all

the Americans I have ever seen I glean}

that you never really apply it, just
merely talk about it in your enthusius-
fic way; for you are furthest from the
simple life of any people In the world.

You come over here and teach us
lessons of extravagance and luxury that
Nearly take our breath away.

But I got interested In the simple
life theory, and I thought about it and
thought about it. TI had read that good

minister’s book, “The Simple Life,” that
you Americans went mad over, and I
went over to Mr. Wagner's church over

Near the Bastille in Paris, and listened
to him with deep interest, and then I
decided to pur it into practice,

I found at last exactly what I
wanted at Maraise, only an hour's ride
from Paris, It was a little old cottage
that had been occupied by peasants, but
very neat and clean. I paid the
peasant woman a round sum to give It
up to me for a fortnight, and she went
to live with her married daughter across
the fields,

I did not tel] a soul what T was golng
to do, not even my maid, for I thought
that if I did all my friends would be
tearing out in automoblles to see me,
and would make my life miserable}
by their ridicule.

I sent out a trunk of simple clothes,
just the
gense told me would be fitting for the
humble cottage, and then I went out

was after banking hours in the town
and before they were released a Journey |
of several miles had to be made to sub-
mit the suspicious coins to the local
cashier, Even when he pronounced the
money good the loca) authorities re-
leased the men grudgingly and opined
they wire suspicious looking fellows
anyway.

Cases frequent where = good
money and good citizens connected with
good money are deemed spurious. There
fs nothing more embarrassing than to
Jand in a strange town with only a few
cents in change and a bank book In
pocket representing the ownership of
substantial sums—miles away. If a
traveller of this sort reaches a strang
town on Saturday evening and wishes
to leave the next day he often finds
himself in a predicament. He proffers
the hotel c'erk a check !n payment for
his room and meals. No one knows him
and the rule Is that the check cannot
be honored because proffered by a
stranger. He shows his bank book and
protests that he is absolutely good for
his full balance if he writes a check for
it. The hotel clerk shakes his head, He
can’t disobey he rule. Besiv’es he re-
calks some slick sharper who had said
the very same thing before and “put it
on him.”

The traveller sends out or rather
starts to send out telegrams asking for
money by wire. He strikes a snag right
off. He can’t pay for the telegrams and
the operator doesn't want to send them
collect without a guarantee. He may
have to show a pocketful of credentials
before he gets the operator to take a
chance, The local office is kept open
an hour later than usual but no tele-
graph money order comes, It's a half
holiday in the distant city and offices
are closed, The traveller has to stop
over until! Monday. Just as he gets a
money order, off the train steps a local
man who knows him well and is willing
to indome his check. He leaves swear-
ing never to get caught again,

Bills of too high a denomination have
often been refused in small localities,
Their very denomination makes the ten-
derer an object of suspicion. A $3 gold
piece is sufficient to have the constable
called in many places, This may be the
game spot where a Confederate $10 bi})

will be accepted just as readily as a
United States gold certificate,

And, oh! wasn't I happy! From the

When I got to the cottage the little
old woman was there. She had buiit
a fire on the hearth and set out for ne

with a big jug of home made beer, and I
sat down and ate ravenously.

Then she went away, and I took off

on my coarse linen skirt and set to
work. I swept up the floor with the

the open fire.

I sang and trilled as T

I chopped up the meat.

It was the most delicious meal I ever
ate.

In the afternoon I lay down and had
a nap, and then I got up and ate a little
supper and sang and trilled some more.

fire and perched my feet on an old

After thirty-two years of blindness
Mrs. Peter Berger of Syracuse is slowly
regaining her sight. The case has at-
tracted the attention of ophthalmic ex-
perts all over the country because, while
the cure in her particular case is not of
itself remarkable, the fact of the trouble
having extended over so many years
makes it especially noteworthy. Mrs.
Berger is the mother of eleven children,
of whom she has seen but one,

The recovery of sight that was once
enjoyed, while rightly deemed a remark-
able achievement of science, is, of
course, not considered by professional
men to be worthy the rating that is
accorded the initial establishment of the
powers of vision. That is, to enable
a human being to see who has been
blind from birth is the real triumph
of ophthalmics, The cases are not by
any means so common that a fair com-

I was immensely happy.

And then I went to bed. Such a crude,
common lHttle old wooden bed, at one
side of the hut it was, but I never en-

 

parison can be made with those where
sight is restored to those who once en-
joy d it.

There is a French case related in
which a boy was born blind—at least
he was born without the power, ap-
parently, of exercising the sense of
sight. He was treated by an eminent
Parisian practitioner and at the age of
ten years he came gradually to see.
He continued ‘to improve in sight until
at the end of a year he had no trouble
with his eyes at all, But—here is the
odd thing of it—when he reached his
fifteenth birthday his sight began to
leave him again, although he had by no
means overtaxed his eyes. Within a
few months he was biind as a bat
again. The experts took him in hand
again, but for two years their efforts
were unavailing. Finally he detected
a giimmer of light. More and more
every day the glimmer grew until once
more he could see the faces of his fam-

Before the Mire GWrithr

I was tired and

joyed a bed more,
happy, and wholesomely fed, and I went
to sleep just like a baby and slept all
night long. The last thing I remember
was the hoot of an owl in a nearby

 

 

ily and the green earth, This boy lived
to be a man of seventy with intervals
of blindness and complete recovery.
From his sixty-eighth to his sixty-ninth
year he was absolutely blind again and
the eye experts were afraid to treat him
because of his advanced age. Suddenly
he recovered his sight and his eyes for
the one year remaining of his life were
all that eyes could be wished. The
ophthalmists declared that there was
a veil-like growth in constant progress
over the pupila of his eyes that no
treatment could completely remove.
Three of his children were born blind
and never had their sight sense estab-
lished. A daughter suffered periodical
fits of blindness the same as her father.

In Boston recently there was a case
of restored hearing quite as unusual as
the restored eyesight of Mrs. Berger.

tree, a sound that delighted me, though
it would have terrified some people.

In the morning I woke up bright and
early, feeling fresher and finer than ever
before in my life. I crawled up and
looked in the little mirror above the
bed to see if 1 looked as happy as I felt.
In fact, it was a very radiant face that
looked back at me, and I said:

“The simple life is a winner, Isn't it?”

And the mirror smiled back gayly.

And go it went on for the two weeks.
I worked and ate and slept and sang
and got years younger, and I wrote to
my friends the most ecstatic letters
just pitying them and telling them all
about my experience ‘in detail, and I
set them all wild with curiosity and
wonder.

And when I got back to town, looking
like a wild rose, with more beauty than
all the Paris specialists could ever have
produced, they were more curious than
ever.

And then they all trooped out to the
little cottage and marvelled at my
courage, and a few tried the scheme
{hemselves, but they fled at the end

of the first Gay, and mut one of them
enjoyed it.

So, you see, one has to have an espe-
clal genius for leading the simple life
successfully.

 

Want a Widows’ Pension Law
Would Mean to New York

HERE was an old Frisian law in

Anglo-Saxon times which read:

“When the child is naked as a

worm and without a roof, when

the black fog and the cold winter reach

her; then may te mother her
chiid.”

At present in the city of New York
there is a law which might be stated
thus: “When the child is naked as a
worm and without a roof, when the
black fog and the cold winter reach her;

ect’

then may the mother ‘commit’ her child
to an instiltition.”

But at present in the city of New York
certain people are trying to enact a law
which will read, in terms of the old
Frisian law: “When the child is naked
as a worm and without a roof, when the
black fog and the cold winter reach
her; then may the mother be paid by
the State in order that she may feed
and clothe and raise her child.”

At 3 o'clock of an April afternoon
a young woman stumbled into the
basement of the Children’s Bureau of
the city of New York. She stumbled
—why? Because,in her arms she held
a child. And because on either side
of her, clutching her skirt, were other
children. She sank on one of the
wooden benches of the Children’s Bu-
reau, She sank because, even in April,
sometimes it rains and children are
heavy and she had walked a long way.

The Children’s Bureau Is busy—busy
because each year ten thousand women
make application to it for the commit-
ment of children. The young woman
sitting huddled on the bench waited a
long time before she received atten-
tion. She did not know that she was
but a unit in a series—a series stretch.
ing even beyond her Anglo-Saxon fore-
bears; one link in a chain of mothers
who have through poverty killed or sold
or committed their children.

The young woman was a widow. She
|was poor. Her husband had been com-
{mitted to a hospital for the insane.
Later he had died. She had worked out
every day, putting the children in a day
nursery. But it had cost her 15 cents
a day to have the children cared for.
And 15 cents Is sometimes a very large
j}amount of money.
| Therefore she sat on this April after-
jnoon on a bench at the Children’s Bu-
| reaw. She wae waiting to “put away"
{o. children. That was all she could

 

 

 

a

do, since the State did not allow her to
kill them or sell them, and since it did
not feel that it could pay her to keep
them.

Eventually, as the result of her work
on that April afternoon, her children,
at her skirts and in her arms, became
enrolled among the 33,000 children who
are in the Institutions of New York.
| They joined the class compased of 25

fathers are “put away” from mothers,
fat they did not stay together as a
ittle group in that class of children,
The child who had burdened the wom-

  

an's arms went to an infant asylum.
And the others went, boys this way,
girls that way, to other institutions,

The mother, quite unburdened with
the weight of her children now, went
back to the place whence she had
come. But she did not go gladly.
She went filled with the greatest heart-
ache there is. And if she had been able
to realize exactly what, to her children,
that April afternoon would mean she
would have gone, if possible,
gladly,

She was akin, theugh she did not
know it, to the Anglo-Saxon mother
who, living In a bitter and inhospitable
climate, amid forests and marshes,
without pasturage or agriculture, de-
pendent for existence on the uncertain
produce of the chase, deemed it an act
of parental tenderness to put her child
to death. “A child cries,” she said,
“when he comes into the world, for he

 

 

tlago that he was absolutely deaf. He
had been stationed near one of the big
guns on the cruiser and he recalled
that something seemed to have snapped
in his ear, He remained quite deaf
until a few weeks ago. There was an
explosion of dynamite in a quarry on
the outskirts of Boston and the veteran
found to his amazement that immedi-
ately following the explosion he could
hear once more, Ear experts called it
a case of “quicksand of the drum," com-
paring it to the shift of sands from one
resting place to another.

 

Referendum for All

Lestershire, a suburb of Bingham-
ton, N. Y., appears to have been the first
village on record to decide to put Sun-
day baseball to the referendum teat.
There have been several different sorts

of villages, towns and cities, but base-
ball was never before, according to re-
port, placed in the spotlight for a de-
cision,

The number of “differences of opin-
jon" that may be left to the referendum
for decision are practically unlimited.
Advocates of the exercise of this pre-
rogative are confident that eventually
these differences will all be settled by
the referendum method. The local op-
tion question on the liquor traffic has
long enjoyed the “put it to a vote”
test. It has been proposed by many
that the woman suffrage question be put
to a referendum—but only women vote
upon it. This to show what percent-
age of women wish to exercise the fran-
chise, aside from what the men gay.
