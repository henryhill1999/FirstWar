poet who figures as the hero of the
familiar opera “The Tales of Hoff-

parts for the strings were written in
red ink, those of the wood in green and
those of the brass in black. “Bee-
thoven's Ninth Symphony,” says Wag-
ner in his autobiography, “was a mere
Pleyel sonata by the side of this mar-
vellously concocted overture.” The
thing was actually played under Hein-
rich Dorn in Leipsic. At every fourth
measure the tympani player had to
sound a note forte. When the audience
recovered from its first astonishment it
shrieked with laughter.

Note again a significant fact. In the
Hoffmann stories “The Brothers of
Serapion” contains an account of a con-
test of song at the Wartburg Castle
afterward used in “Tannhaeuser,” and
in another, “Master Martin, the Cooper
of Nuremberg,” are hints of things
found in “Die Meistersinger.” Heinrich
Dorn, Who produced the wonderful
overture, saw signs of talent in the boy
and became his friend. He was one of
Wagner's stanchest adherents in the
later day when such were much needed,

The youth now matriculated at the
Universtty of Leipsic. He attended the
lectures on aesthetics and philosophy
and gained information which later led
him to submit his mind to the power-
ful influence of the philosophy of
Arthur Schopenhauer. This philosophy
had an enormous authority in some of
Wagner's creative thinking, and to it
we owe the ethical doctrines preached
in some of ‘his great dramas. The prin-
ciples proclaimed in “Tristan und
Isolde,” which bear a resemblance to
the Buddhistic doctrines of Nirvana, are
directly traceable to Schopenhauer,

Finally the young man settled down
to serious music study under Theodor
Weinlig, who sat in the reverend chair
of Bach as Cantor of the Thomas
School. In less than six months Wein-
lig had taught Wagner counterpoint
and, as he sald to the young man, had
made him musically self-dependent. At
this time too Wagner became acquainted
with the music of Mozart, which exerted
precisely the influence he most needed.
Its healthy frankness, its fluent nat-
uralness, its candor of thought and its
elegance of melodic line showed the
youth that he must rid himself of a
fantastic manner of bombast, of grand-
iloquence. He at once began to seek
for a natural, unforced style. He wrote
a sonata, which was published by the
old house of Breitkopf & Hartel, and
this was the real opus 1 of the great
Richard Wagner,

It was when he was 19 years of age
that he wrote his only symphony,
that in C major. It was produced at
a Gewandhaus concert in Leipsic on
January 10, 1833, or eighty years ago.
In the season of 1834-35 Wagner
brought the composition to the atten-
tion of Mendelssohn, who was then the
conductor of the Gewandhaus concerts,

and Final Triumph

and the great man promised to examine
if. Liut he sald nothing, and Wagner
was too timid to ask about it.

The result was that the score was lost
and it was not till 1872 that the or-
chestra parts were found tn an old
trunk which Wagner had left in Dres-
den in the course of the revolution of
1848. In Venice on Christmas, 1882,
os a feature of a birthday fete for his
wife, Wagner conducted a performance
of his youthful work. Looking back to
it from the year of “Parsifal,” he still
found that there were some things in
it not so bad, It was first performed in
this city under the direction of Anton
Sefd! at Chickering Hall on March 2,
1888, and has since that been played
once at the Century Theatre by the
Symphony Soclety under Walter Dam-
rosch.

Wagner began his career as an opera
composer in 1832. His first essay was
at a grewsome story entitled "Die Hoch-
zeit,” the libretto of course by himself.
His sister Rosalie was so shocked by
this work, of which he composed some
parts, that he destroyed it. In 1833 he
wrote after the style of Gozzi's fairy
tales “Die Feen" (“The Fairies"), and
set {it to music imitative of Weber,
Beethoven and Marschner. The “k
was announced for production at the
opera in Leipsic, but was not given. Its
first hearing was as a historical curios-
ity in Munich January 29, 1888,

Not much later in Hfe he became ac-
quainted with the writings of Heine,
who, as he himself tells us, was the
apostle of highest artistic and lowest
sensual pleasures of life and who had a
genuine sympathy with music. Wagner
now became filled with what is called
“the joy of living,” and his lyric realiza-
tion of his ideal was shaped in his next
attempt, an opera called “Das Liebes-
verbot,” which was produced in 1836. It
had no success,

In Munich at the time of the revival
of “Die Feen” this work was placed in
rehearsal, but the libretto was found to
be a mass of unbridled license and the
music an unblushing imitation of Doni-
zetti, So the thing was again aban-
doned. Perhaps the only interesting
fact worth remembering in connection
with this opera is that {it contains a
“Salve Regina” which begins with the
same melody as the so-called “grace”
theme in the introduction to the third
act of “Tannhaecuser,”

After the failure of the Riga experi-
ments and the stormy voyage to Lon-
don, all of which Wagner has described
with so much vivacity in his autobi-
ography, the master at length arrived
for the first time in Paris with a head
full of brilliant, if apparently imprac-
ticable, ideas and some finished and
unfinished scores in his trunk. It was
in 1839, and from this year we may
properly date ahe end of Wagner's

 

formative period. He had partly writ-
ten “Rienzi,” his first truly mature
work, and he completed the score in
Paris in 18$0. He had already con-
ceived the outline of the story of his
“Flying Dutchman” and had absorbed
some of the color of the sea in the
course of his voyage,

It was in Paris that he finally real-

Anne Goldthwaite should still

be claimed by the Paris art world
instead of our own, For this clever
wielder of the needle belongs to this
country. Her first steps were essayed
here in New York about ten years ago
while still a student of painting, and it
must have been a real call that started
her in that direction, for she knew no
etchers and almost nothing of etching.
On her return to New York Miss
Goldthwaite set about the search for
ways and means of continuing work in
the medium she found so congenial,
It was a discouraging quest. The only

she promptly offered herself. ‘“But,"
said the powers that were at that time,
“only men students are admitted." In
answer to her gentle but’ persistent
“Why ?" the powers finally referred her
to J. D. Smillie, the class's director-in-
chief,

No, Mr. Smillie sald, he did not fa-

were not capable of becoming good
etchers, but they were too liable to be
diverted—-matrimony and all that. He

throw it all overboard just when they
began to be worth while.

Having learned how important a part
the printing of an etching plays, Miss
Goldthwaite was never content merely
to etch. Soon after admittance to the
class she found the rare opportunity of
buying a press—an ancient and unusu-
ally heavy one. This, to the honor of
janitor and landlord, she installed in the
top floor room of the apartment where
she had set up her studio.

In 1906 Miss Goldthwaite again went
abroad, and after a summer's travel

settled down in Paris, where she still
remains, dividing her time between the
etcher's needle and the brush. Except
for portraits her choice is usually of out-
door subjects, so the warm season finds
her in Brittany, or perhaps only out
near Fontainebleau at the quaint village
of Grez. In the winter her studio on
the Boulevard Raspail is the rendez-
vous of many of the quarter's residents.

ized that the search after success with
managers and public was for him un-
availing. It was in Paris that he fell
upon days of despair, and there he
finally took the last splendid plunge
into reckless originality and wrote the
music of his first truly Wagnerian
opera, “Der Fliegende Hollander.”

getting much joy out of both life and
work, the fine sweep of her etched line
tells more of pleasure in the doing than
of deeply conscientious effort. Yet what
more of the wetness of a wet winter's
day in Paris could one get, by any
amount of consciousness, than is real-
ized in the “Entrance to the Bal Bull-
ler’? And although the = sinuous
“Oriental Dancer,” drawn directly (and
recklessly) on the plate, shows a super-
fluity of arms that reminds one of the
crayon picture in “Huckleberry Finn,”
the impression of writhing, intoxica-
ting motion is almost uncanny. The
“Ballet Dancers,” too, pose and pi-
rouette joyously. The chief appeal of

 

Anne Goldthwaite’s etching is this very
quality of joyousness and freedom,

 

   
 

often asserted that his early years dia
not in any way foreshadow his man
hood's creative work. Such an asser
tion, as any reader of tne foregoing
record can see for himself, is not sup-
ported by the facts, In his theories
about the “Yestoration of the theatre
to its rightful place in the national lif
of the people Wagner leaned heavily
upon the Greeks, and he was in manp
ways a _ passionate’ Hellenist. The
father of this man was surely the lit-
tle boy who at the age of 10 translated
twelve books of the Mad from sheer
love of the poem,

At 15 he heard for the first time
the music of Beethoven and determineé
to become a composer. In later life
he wrote a small book on Beethoven, ia
many ways the most profound, com-
prehensive and enlightening study of
the genius of the great symphonist ever
made, On numerous cecasions Wag-
ner proved himself to be one of the
greatest Beethoven conduétors the
world has ever known, His comments
on some of the symphonies are final
they are still utillzed by programme
annotators as the most informing ané
stimulating comments ever made op
these works,

From the suggestions found in the
stories of Hoffmann he became Interest-
ed in the vast treasures of German me-
diwval legend, poetry and song. With-
out doubt his love for Hoffmann fitteé
him the better to appreciate Heine, ané@
it was from the latter's “Memoirs of
Herr Schnabelowski" at Riga In 1839
that he obtained his first knowledge of
the “Flying Dutchman” legend. In Hoff-
mann he first read of the singer's contest
at the Wartburg, and while “Rienzi®
was in preparation at Dresden he reaé
che medieval poem of the “Wartburg-
krieg" and the lyric version of the
“Tannhaeuser” legend. It was Wagner
himself who created the connection be-
tween the legend and the song contest
and put into the mouth of Wolfram {a
that contest thoughts which he after-
ward found in Wolfram’s own epiq
“Parzival,”

Tt was at the same time that he first
obtained some of the materials for his
“Lohengrin,” for part of the tale is
found in this epic. So too he came upos
the foundations of “Parsifal.” And all
this can be traced to his passion for
Hoffmann, In this author too he learned
first about the life of old Nuremberg
and opened the gate which led to “Die
Meistersinger.”

Finally in the restive spirit of the boy,
who would not submit himself to rigid
rules {in musical art but whe strove
to break the bonds and express hime
self in his own way, was ‘there no prom-
ise of the great revolutionary who over-
threw old formulas and who recreated
the methods of harmony so that the
novelties of Strauss, Debussy and
Schonberg became possibilities, And
was not this same youth, finally forced
to master counterpoint, the same per-
son who in maturer years in his ‘Meis-
tersinger" preached the irrefutable art-
istic doctrine that progress is not to be
made by ignoring the fundamental laws
but by advancing from them as the in-
exhaustible base of supplies?

In Wagner the chill was indeed the
father to the man. Since the smoke of
controversial battle has blown away
and we stand in the clear atmosphere
of a peaceful present we are without
question better able to grasp the true
significance of this restive boyhood than
were the biographic advocates of a
quarter of a century ago, And perhaps
