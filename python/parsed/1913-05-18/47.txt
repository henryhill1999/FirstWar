MERICANS have neglected many
opportunities offered them at
international exhibitions, It
looks as if their neglect of such

an opportunity at Ghent, Belgium,
would prove to be the most conspicuous
of all.

The countries, States and cities which
have engaged enough space in the Ghent
exposition grounds to make it eeem to
the director-general worth while to
mention them in the latest

announces

ments are, besides Belgium éeself,
France, England, Holland, Spain, Per-
gia, Chile, Guatemala, Bolivia, Austria,
Germany, Denmark, Italy, Canada,
Japan, Argentina, California and Rus-
aia. The exposition covers more
than 300 acres, of which Belgium
has 40,000 square yards, France 40,000,
Germany 15,000, England 14,000 and the
rest of the list epace in a descending
scale. The United States is classed
among the miscellaneous nations and
communities that are grouped in parts
of buildings. On the other hand France,
Germany, England, Holland, Canada
(with 5,000 aquare yards), Austria and
the citles of Paris, Antwerp and Ghent
have fine structures of their own.

The year 1913 should be one of good
omen for the material welfare of the
Low Countries, for besides the universal
exposition of Ghent there are to be
held no less than thirty local and
regional expositions in Holland in cole-
bration of the centenary of the present
monarchical constitution. Four of these
will take place at Amsterdam; two at
Groningen, two at The Hague, two at

 

 

Arnheim and one each at Baarn, Bos-
koop, Hertogenbosch, Muiden, Breda,
Broek-in-Waterland, Deventer, Gouda,
Haarlem, Hoorn, Leeuwarden, Leyden,
Middelburg, Nimeguen, Sittard, Sneek,
Tilburg, Utrecht, Zutphen and Zwolle.
They will be rich in industrial, sclen-
tife and artistic attractions, Most of
these minor expositions will begin later
and end earlier than that of Ghent, and
their dates are in general so arranged
that there will be little confilct among
them.

of this year will be maritime, relating
chiefly to the eplendid achievements of
the Dutch nation before the elghteenth
century on the high seas; the second
will illustrate the development of fem-
inine activity during the last century;
the third will be representative of the
graphic arts, and the fourth will demon-
strate practical methods of arrangiag a
modern house and garden,

At other places the variety of the
expositions is remarkable: at Boskoop,

roses; at Deventer, flowers and fruits;
at Haarlem, flowers and the history of
the art of printing; at Sittard, manu-
factures, commerce and agriculture; at
The Hague, agriculture, travel and
sports; at Zwolle, manufactures; at Til-
burg, industry, commerce, art and edu-
eation; at Gouda, porcelain; at Middel-
burg, provincial costumes; at Zutphen,
Groningen, Leyden and Utrecht, art,
and at Hertogenbosch, religious art.

Among the fetes that will take place
in the summer are the inauguration of
the Peace Palace at The Hague and the
review of the fishing fleet in the Zuyder
Zee,

Those who visit Ghent for the grand
fair can very easily and at small ex-
pense make an excursion through Hol-
land which will enable them to go to
all or nearly all of the cities above
named,

There is no doubt that unless an im-
portant war should supervene the year
1913 avill see an unprecedented number
of visitors in the Low Countries, In
view of this fact the failure of the
United States to take an adequate part
n the exposition is the more noteworthy,
California, With an eye to the return
that will come to her at her own exposi-
tion in 1915, is less open to this re-

 

 

proach than the country at large. Her
special section will receive great at-
tention,

The planning of the exposition struc-
tures has been entirely in harmony with
the traditions of Flemish art. They are
in the southern margin of the city, in
the Pare de ia Citadelle, in which also
is the Art Museum, and adjoining it the
Horticultural Gardens. The Horticul-
tural Palace shelters the most charac-
teristic modern portion of the display.
Ghent Is famous the world over for the
culture of flowers, This building, which
also comprises the Festival Hall, covers
some seven acres, The Royal Agricul-
tural and Botanical Soclety of Belgium

will hold its quinquennial flower show
there; in August there will be a special
exhibition by the Van Houtte Club of
Ghent; and in October the regular au-
tumn exposition of orchids, chrysanthe-
mums, fruits and vegetables, The an-
cient barracks of the citadel have been
demolished, and the broad gardens, re-
splendent in bloom, make a magnificent
setting for the floral palace. Of rose
bushes alone there are 150,000.

Next in magnitude to the horticul-
tural display is that of anclent Flemish
art. It occupies the new Fine Arts Mu-
seum. Of kindred Interest Is what has
been named “Old Flanders,” presenting
facsimiles of the quaintest nooks, fa-
cades, gables and courts of such towns
as Ghent, Bruges, Ypres, Termonde and
Lokeron. These have been grouped in
such @ manner as to form a tiny city
with its market place, its central square,
its canal, Its old bridges, its belfry, its
open air theatre, its shops and its tav-!
erns and its ateliers In which are arti+ |
sans at work. In the streets people in|
costumes of the middle ages will move |
to and fro. Near the ancient town a/|
large open plain serves the saine pur- |
diversion as did the!

In the agricultural section of the Bel. |
gian portion of the exposition there |
will be a modern village, covering ten |
acres, with several farmhouses and |
dairies, a blacksmith shop, a school and
a church. In the Colonial Palace will
be shown a panorama of the Belgian
Congo,

The Fine Arts Palace bounds the in-
ner side of the Court of Honor, In the
midst of the central basin of this court
is reared a colossal monument in bronze
symbolical of the legend of the Cheval-
fer Bayard. <A water castle adorns a
second basin bearing allegorical bas-
reliefs with figures of Hercules, Beauty
and Wisdom, The grand entrance, im-
mediately preceding the Court of Hon-
or, is flanked by two majestic bulls in
bronze.

Among sporting events will be several
assauts d’armes in celebration of the
300th anniversary of the foundation of
the celebrated guild of fencers, the
Royal and Knightly Confraternity of |
Saint Michael, by the Archduke Albert |

land Archduchess Isabel of Austria.

 

Costly to Die Abroad

It cost Mrs. L. C. Rapp nearly $6,000;
|recently to get her husband's body out
of Spain to the United States, This ex- |
| Penditure, in the main, was all due to
;red tape rolled on huge official spools
| by Spanish functionaries. <A large per-
| centage of the cost, Mrs. Rapp asserted,
| was claimed as graft. And claimed, al-
; most unblushingly, as graft tantamount
| to a perqulsite.
| Rapp was assassinated near Lerida,
; Spain. The graft began when Mrs.
| Rapp tried to get her husband in a hos-
| pital, Numerous papers had to be
| Signed. Money hastened their signing.
| When Rapp was dead, at every stage
lof the journey with the body to Barce-
| lona money was demanded—it was such
an important removal, At the last
jmoment the authorities In Barcelona
| were notified by the Judge at Lerida
that the body could not be shipped to
the United States until he signed re-
lease papers, That meant a journey of
150 miles. More money, and in big
gouts,

Unless it is a Government official or

United States, the cost of removing an
American to his own country after
death {s high, no matter from what in-
land point it has to be transported, In
our own possessions of Porto Rico and
the Phillppines it takes quite a little
penny to have a soldier, sailor or civil-
fan sent home, The casket is expensive,
as the very greatest precautions have
to be taken to prevent Infection or con-
tagion in a warm climate. The body is
enclosed in two or three coverings be-
fore being soldered in the final metal
coffin. If a civilian, the transportation
cost as well as the undertaker’s bill at
the distant point has to be met before
sailing time, and this is no small
amount. In many cases of sailors and
soldiers they are buried permanently in

these distant lands because of the cost |
of bringing them to the United States

and having them sultably received,
transported and buried in a proper .or
chosen spot,

European undertakers—or in fact
those of any city of Asia or Africa
where an American might die—attend
very generously to thelr burial bills,
figuring they may not have so good a
chance in a long while, There is no
community sympathy such as might ob-
tain at home, and consequently the cost
goes soaring from the moment the un-
dertaker is engaged. Differences of
language make protests against over-
charge generally ineffectual, It is high
priced indeed to die abroad and be
buried at home,

French heels, and weighs only |

seventy-five pounds, but the
responsibilities that ave on her spare
little shoulders! the work that has been
accomplished in her slender little throat
in the past four years! For she has
been a principal at the Metropolitan
Opera House for two seasons and has
just written her name at the bottom
of one of Mr. Gatt!-Casazza's contracts
for another.

Her large blue eyes are wide with
wonder like those of a child and her
yellow hair gives her just as much
trouble as the tumbling tresses of a high
school girl. She confesses to elghteen
years,

An interview with her afforded rather
@ queer surprise at the start. It is
strange to listen to the full carrying
notes of a well developed lyric soprano
voice and then see a girl apparently
14 years old emerge from the room
whence the tones came. At first one
thinks that perhaps the lady with the
voice has brought her little girl to the

‘lesson and has lingered for a last word

with the teacher. Then the idea filters
through one's brain that perhaps the
little girl In the simple school frock is
the soprano. And so she is.

When Miss Gascoigne had admitted
that it. was none other than herself
who had been singing and had agreed
to be interviewed she plumped her-
self on a couch and turned with the
alr of one who js prepared to be enter-
tained and amused. But she easily be-
came the entertainer herself and told
interesting things about herself and
her work,

“You see,” she said in a musical
speaking voice which is adorned with a
delightful Hsp, “I don’t know much
about opera because I have only been
working at {it two seasons. I never was
on the stage before. But I love it so
far. It's great to be up in front of such
fine audiences and sing with the great
singers of the day. I have great times
even at the rehearsals, because they are
all so kind and considerate to me.

“And to sing with Mr. Goritz in the
last act of ‘Koenigskinder’ is simply di-
vine. When he picks me up and throws
me on his shoulder while he lets his
beautiful voice go and the great orches-
tra is playing down in front of us—oh,
it’s really the happlest moment that one
could have.

“But I would like to sing other parts
They've promised me that I shall have
some other parts next year, and also
that I shall sing at a Sunday night con-
cert. I want to get out and show the

I know the role of Jane in ‘Germans’

child in ‘Koenigskinder’ so much, but
one has to know a great many parts to
be @ success.: And, do you know, there
are only three of those children in
‘Koenigskinder’ who are smaller than
am?

“I've had some awfully funny exper:
ences with the Children’s Society and
other institutions about my singing ia
public. Once an agent of the society
was going to stop the performance ‘e-
cause I was singing, and we had a
awful time convincing him that [| wes

didn't know anything about voices or
he would have known that mine could
not be a child's voice.

“Another time I went to a lecture up
at the Museum of Natural History and
they weren't going to let me in uni. I
proved that 1 was not a schoolgir!, as
the doorman thought. Finally s me
one came up who knew about m.- «nd
