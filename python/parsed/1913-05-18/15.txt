Inlaid and Figured Cork Linoleum, Reduced

The figured Linoleums in 4 yard width and choice of eight
patterns, including tile effects in greens, browns, white and blues
and hardwood effects in two shades of brown. A very slight im-
perfection in the print, in some rolls, that will not affect the wear.

The inlaid Linoleums in 2 yard width are in brown, tan, white
and heen tile effects, and in ‘‘grahite’ patterns in brown, green
and blue.
