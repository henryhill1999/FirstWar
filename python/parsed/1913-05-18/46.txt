of the year almost three centuries ago,
then the arrival of the Mayflower and
the disembarking of the entire company
—you can see it all,

The Mayflower fades from your
vision, The Boston steamer is coming
in; its plercing whistle brings you back
and sets you down in the midst of the
hurry and babble of the Plymouth ex-
cursionists. Every day through the
summer the swarming multitudes “do”
the town. They come by train, by boat,
by trolley and by- automobile, They
tread upon each others heels up and
down the first street lald tut In New
England, Clams and fish are devoured
under the shadow almost of the canopy
of stone which covers the Rock, upon
which most visitors consider it their
duty finst of all to plant their feet.

The shore of Quincy, stretching from
the river to Neponset, which divides it
from Boston, curves and winds in and
out, making of Quincy the most in-
dented of any town in the State. Up at
its northern end is the peninsula
Squantum, where on the highest point
has been built a cairn to commemorate
the landing of Miles Standish and a
party from Plymouth.
Squantum and Hough's Neck is. the
Mount Wollaston farm, the residence of

ThE House of the Seven Gables,

the late Mrs. John Quincy Adams. But
this is the spot known, wherever the
story of Plymouth is read, as Merry
Mount. It was here that the little
May day opera bouffe was performed.
Thomas Morton sat up his May pole
elghty feet high with a buck’s antlers
at the top, and around It danced that
day in 1627 the band of white men and
Indian women whom Motley In his
“Merry Mount" calls over and over
again “the dark eyed, dusky daughters
of the forest.”

But Miles Standish marched over
from Plymoutth with his well drilled
army of eight men and scattered the
“pagan revellers,” and Endicott sailed
across from Salem and hewed down the
May pole and so the “idol” was de-
stroyed and “Idolatry” was uprooted,

A half mile saunter down hill brings
you to the triangular area in which
stand the Adams houses. In the apex
of the triangle is the Quincy Adams
birthplace, and beyond it and separated
from it only by a narrow strip of lawn
is the older house in which the father
of Quincy Adams was born, One of the
rooms has a concealed niche intended as
a hiding place in the time when peril
was the daily portion of the patriot.
The whole front of the fireplace, from
floor to ceiling, mantel and all, swings
out by hinges. There, at the side of
the brick chimney, !s a recess in which
one might be stowed if he could pack
his limbs in small compass,

Lexington Common, basking in the
sunshine under the deep blue sky of a
day in June, with the blare of an auto-
mobile horn as Its only tocsin and a
legion of smiling sightseers as its only
invaders, is so suave and peaceful that,
but for the tablets and monuments with
their stirring inscriptions and the bronze
figure of Capt. Parker, rifle in hand,
upon the stones, you would suppose it
must always have been a place of un-
disturbed repose. But it was over that
road that Paul Revere clattered, and
from that house a few rods away John
Hancock and Samuel Adams made their
hurried escape. Just here stood the
old belfry from which clanged the alarm
that brought the Minutemen to the
Common, The boulder across there

beyond it is the house to whose door
Jonathan Harrington dragged himself,
sorely wounded, that he might die at
his wife's feet.

At Lexington the associations are al-
most all of war. From Arlington on
the road has been marked by tablet up-
on tablet, each telling some tale of that
great April day in 1775.

Upon entering the bounds of Lexing-
ton, on a slight hill just off the avenue,
shaded by fine old trees, you see the
Munro Tavern, The tablet says that
this simple, square frame building was
erected in 1695, and that Earl Perey
used {it as a hospital and headquarters
at the time of the battle. In the room
at the left of the entrance the wounds
of the British were dressed, and on the
right is the tap room, where the soldiers
obtained a liberal supply of liquor. In
the ceiling Is still to be seen a bullet
hole made by a ball from a British mus-
ket, The room has a wide fireplace and
ancient cupboards, and the timbers,
roughly hewn by hand, seem to run
askew.’ Up the narrow staircase is the
room in which Washington dined in No-
vember, 1789, with the fireplaces, floor
boards and timbers which antedate the
Revolution. In those days the house
| had various extensions and outbuildings
|which are now gone. :

For one hundred and sixty-three years
jthis house was a well patronized inn
|The builder was a William Munro, son

    
   
   
 
 

Salem—<-—

of a William
prisoner in one of Cromwell's battles
and deported to Boston, He belonged |
to the clan of “the fighting Munros,”
who lived ag early as the eleventh cen-
tury on the River Ro in the north of
Ireland, They conquered a large terri-
tory in Scotland, and to this day the
Munro lands in Lexington are “Scot-
land."

A boulder, estimated to weigh fif-
teen tons, hauled by ten horses from
the woods two miles away js another
of the impressive monuments upon the
Green, The front has been cut away
and the remainder left in its rough and
unpolished state. An old musket with
a powder horn hanging from its barrel
is carved upon the smooth face of the
stone and points the direction of the
lineup of the Minute Men. Below are
inscribed the words attributed to Capt.
Parker:

Stand your ground
Don't fire unless fired upon
But If they mean to have a war
Let it begin here,

On the wall of his observatory at the
Wayside Hawthorne placed this line
from Tennyson's “Lotus Eaters";

There is no joy but calm,

To the visitor who learns how the
novellst used that Ine the quotation
will be called to mind again and again
as he goes about Concord. The town
broods and dreams, remembers and
walts. Serenely it cherishes its splendid
past; patiently it bides its time, not
concerned if no great epoch In the future
shall match the glory of the era that
has made it in America almost what
Stratford isin England, It was fitting to
choose from the “Lotos Eaters” a motto
for a Concord study, For the river
“slumbers along” still as when Haw-
thorne came to the old manse with his
bride. The home of Emerson is almost
as secluded as it was when the gentle
seer dally left its door for his walk
among the pines, As you look at the
primitive lMttle building by the Orchard
House the imagination makes pictures
for you of the school of philosophy in
that hillside chapel with the bust of
Plato upon the wall,

It seems a pity that any one living in
Concord should ever be required to earn

a dollar; he should give himself alto-
wether to the coining of idgas. The town,
in spite of an occasional intrusion of
showy modernity, still has the atmos-
phere and many of the features which
won for it the affection of the group
who brought it fame.

With the Revolutionary history fresh
in mind you will wish to see the spot
where was fired “the shot that rang.”
“The rude bridge that arched the flood”
is gone. You are not quite sure that
you like the cement simulacrum which
now spans the stream. You walk across
it Into an oval of gravel and grass shut
in by an iron fence. The road of 1775
fs closed and the turf is defended by
warning signs. But the minute man is
there in bronze, looking across the river
at the red lines of the British cotumn.

Childhood claims Louisa May Alcott
for its own, and such fame as _ hers,
given without guile and worn with honor,
is enough to make the Orchard House |
a world shrine, “Little Women” came in
1868 and rescued the family from pov-
erty. She had to dodge into the woods !

  
   
  
 
 
 
 
 
  
  
 
  
 
 
 
   
  
  
  
  
    
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
 
 
  

  
 
  
 
  
 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 

to escape the multitude who sought out
the writer of a book which had captured
all readers, Can any one understand
how she managed to write the end of
“An Old Fashioned Girl” with “left hand
in a sling, head aching and no voice"?
When her sister's husband died she be-
kan “Little Men” to provide for the
widow and the boys,

Henry PD, Thoreau was born in an
old fashioned and handsome house a
mile from the village which has been
removed from its original site and
somewhat altered, His death took place
in what Is known as the Alcott-Thoreau
house, in the midst of the town, The
projecting ell is the shop in which the
family earned their livelihood by mak-
ing lead pencils and preparing plum-
bago for electrotyping. Louisa Alcott
bought the house in 1877 after the death
of the last of the Thoreau children and
the Alcott family Mved in it for ten
years,

“As ancient is this hostelry

As any In the land may be,

Built in the old Colonial day,

When men lived in a grander way,

With ampler hospitaility ;

A kind of old Hobgoblin Hall,

Now somewhat fallen to decay,

With weather stains upon the wall,

And stairways worn, and crazy doors,

And creaking and uneven floors,

And chimneys huge, and tiled, and tall.”
—Henry W. Longfellow,

There stands the inn to-day, very
‘much as it was when Longfellow made it
the scene of a modern “Decameron,” ex-
cept that the automobiles blaring past
on the oiled highway have robbed it of
much of the “repose” of which the poet
wrote. He described it as

“A place of slumber and of drea

Remote among the wooded hills!"

But In the old days its occupants did not
altogether slumber and dream, Steel
capped troopers used to rendezvous in
its tap room almost two hundred years
ago, Soldiers hurrying to Ticonderoga
stopped here, as did the Minute men from
Worcester on their way to Lexington,
The fine highway of to-day was the
great mall road from Boston westward
and in the stage coach times travellers
well knew “How's Tavern in Sudbury,”
later called the Red Horse Inn,

When Longfellow became acquainted
with the inn be found the red horse
prancing still upon the sign, though
“half effaced by rain and shine.” The
poet made but two visits here, seem-
ingly, stopping, it is likely, as a young
man when on his way to New York to
sall for Europe, and going on an Octo-
ber day twenty-five years later to see
the house when it had ceased to be an
inn, Of that visit he wrote in his jour-
nal under date of October 31, 1862:
“October ends with a delicious Indian
summer day. Drive with Fields to the
old Red Horse Tavern in Sudbury—alas,
no longer an inn! A lovely valley, the
winding road shaded by grand old oaks
before the house, A rambling, tumble
down old bullding, 200 years old.” He
had begun the “Tales” before this, mak-
ing this entry in his journal for October
11: “Write a little upon the Wayside
Inn—a beginning only.”

Restored and solidified, looking hand-
some yet wearing an air of age, the inn
to-day is an attractive hostelry, a
museum of Interesting relics and a gal-
lery of pictures, some having intrinsic
or historic value and all having asso-
clations which make them interesting.

At the right of the entrance is the
tap room, looking more ancient than any

other part of the house, There are
heavy hanging beams overhead and a
worn floor beneath. The bar is in one
corner, surmounted by a wooden lattice
screen which used to be triced up when
refreshments were demanded. They
show you the desk where the score
was kept and the = splintered wood
where was jabbed the bottle opener.
Swords and muskets are crossed above
the fireplace and old prints are hung
about the walls, Sitting here In reverie
it is rather jarring to be brought back
from the scenes to which your thoughts
have travelled by such remarks as this:
“The machine did well this morning.
| I think we can make Providence easily
by 4. Great old place, isn't it?” And
you realize that stage coach days are
ovef and that the motor parties about
you are anxious to have dinner and
fare onward,

More to your liking is the landlord’s
statement that in winter parties of
suests come here, when they can have
the house almost to themselves, and tell
tales and make good cheer in the old
kitchen, where high backed settles can
be drawn before the big brick fireplace
piled high with blazing logs.

Spend an hour in “Old Marblehead”
and you will like it; spend a whole day
in the town, lingering for the sunset
and the moonlight view of the bay, and
you will love ft, For it is a picturesque
and historic hamlet. Queer habits of
speech and life still cling to some of
its people, Its gray houses still huddle
themselves in clusters and hide away
behind the granite ledges to the aston-
ishment of the visitor. Boston's strects
May follow the paths of the Colonial
cattle, but no “calf path” hypothests
can account for the ups and downs
and zigzaggings of the tangle of streets
and squares of this brine drenched vil-
lage. Every fisherman of the early
days surely “did what was right In his
own eyes,” at least when it came to
building his house.

In that war for free trade and “sajlors’
rights,” over a thousand men of Marble-

head had part, 726 aboard privateers
and 120 in the navy. Many Marble-
head sallors helped to man the Essex
on her long and daring cruise. On a
day in 1813 the Ciesapeake and Shan-
non, In full view of the headlands,
fought the battle In which Capt. Law-
rence lost his life. Of the crew of Old
Ironsides eighty halled from the town,
and the victory over the Guerriere
was claimed almost as a local exploit.
It also happened that a Marblehead
merchant was a prisoncr aboard the
English vessel at the time of the fa-
mous duel, The people of the town
again crowded to the headland to see
the great frigate on a Sunday In 1814,
when, with two British frigates in chase,
the Constitution appeared off Marble-
head and Samuel Green brought her
safely In through the channel, At the
end of the war 700 citizens of the town
were in British prisons, 500 of them
at Dartmoor,

For 250 years Gloucester grew very
slowly; since 1875 her growth has been
remarkable, Strange as it may seem
to the tourist who climbs about on the
rocks of the cape, the early settlers
went to farming and it is a curious fact
that in 1727 some of the inhabitants
went to Salem because there were not
enough farms to go around. Then the
people took to cutting wood and sending
it to market In the boats bullt In the
harbor. When the timber supply was
exhausted these vessels were changed
Into fishing boats. The industry was

not very successful, and for some time
the town barely made a living out of it.
But the original families meantime had
married and intermarried. There had
been only slight infusion of new blood.
The Gloucester breed became a race as

 

Te the War of 1812, extremely un-
popular elsewhere in New England,
Marblehead, indoctrinated by Elbridge
Gerry, was thoroughly loyal. Again the house in which Jamee
the hardy seamen displayed their valor,| 2 Fields persuaded him to surrender

rugged as their cape, indomitable and
patriotic. They responded freely to the
calls of war, even though the Revolu-
tion ruined their fishing industry. The
foreign trade left the port as the lum-
ber trade had gone. Then, about 1860,
came the turn of the tide. The de-
mand for fish increaeed. New and bet-
ter fishing grounds were found. Boats
and gear were improved. Men saw their
chance, took larger hazards, and reaped
greater and greater rewards.

The peculiar spell of age and beauty |
can be experienced as thrillingly and
completely in Salem as in any city of
New England. Travellers familiar with
lands across the ocean have found this
ancient town more eatisfying than
many of the show places of Europe.
Great cathedrals and medieval castles
become professionally historic. Also
‘they carry the observer so far back into
the past that he loses the sense of re-
lationship with them. His {magination
does not easily carry far enough on
“the road to yesterday” to link the con-
ditions of thought and life of the times
when men reared those overwhelming
masses of stone with the social condi-
tions and the habits of thought and ac-
tion of to-day.

Salem's witchcraft, Salem’s come
merce, Salem's associations with Hawe-
thorne and Salem's Colonial archi-
tecture—these make the attraction of
the city. Stories of that reign of terror,
the witchcraft era, force themselves
upon the attention. A sinister charm
have the tales of that strange delusion,
when children were divided from pare
ents and husbands from wives by fear
and credulity and innocence was the
last security for the accused. But Gale
lows Hill and the documents and pins
in the Court House stand for a belief
that was almost universal in that day
and show how relentless wag the come
bat fought by the Puritan with that
personal devil whom he feared far more
than any danger of the wilderness.

Salem has no less than elght Hawe
thorne houses, the house of his birth,
the house of his youth, the house of hig

ED

courtship,

the manuscript of “The Scarlet Letter,”
these and the House of the Sever
Gables, the Custom House, and two
other houses in which the writer lived
account for some twenty-five years of
his life. j

The fame of Salem's architecture has
travelled almost as far as has the story
of her witchcraft. Any one may walk
about her streets and feast his eyes
upon her doorways and note the exquis-
ile proportions of her old mansions. The
favored who penetrate to the interiors
will find stairways with = twisted
halusters and newels, carved mantels
and handsome wainscots in their rooms
of state. There were cunning crafts-
men here in the early days and they
wrought with conscientious pride in
their joinery, “The McIntires” were @
family of builders whose skill descended
from father to sons; much of their work
survives, and “McIntire arches” are
sought out by architects from all parts
of the country. In quiet side streets
will be found many gambrel roofs.
Walking In early evening through Fed-
eral street and Chestnut street, it {s not
difficult to dream yourself back to the
time when courtly men and powdered
women here in the fashionable part of
the town made their way at candle
lighting to the assemblies in Hamilton
Hall.

One more house completes the Hawe
thorne list. And this is “The House of
the Seven Gables.” The house s0-
called is in Turner street, close to the
bay. The novelist himself declared in
his preface that he had bullt a house
“of materials long in use for construct-
ing castles in’the air.” But with this
house, then the home of his cousin,
Miss Ingersoll, he was very familiar.
The story runs that on a time she told
him the house once had seven gables
and showed him the beams and mortices
to prove the statement, and that he was
quite infatuated with the sound of the
phrase. He called his cousin “The
Duchess," and to her adopted son,
Horace Ingersoll, he once wrote a let-
ter telling of his going over the house,
making out five gables and learning
where the others had been. This letter,
if authentic, seems to show where the
title and germ of the story came from.

In this house Hawthorne heard from
Horace Ingersoll the story of the Acad-
lan lovers, and he passed it on to
Longfellow, who wove about it his
classic poem “Evangeline.” The ro-
mancers’ “Grandfather's Chair” tales
are said to have been derived from a
remark of his cousin about an old arm-
chair in the parlor.

Strolling about In Portsmouth you
are led to wonder if any New England
town has more gambre!l roofs than you
see here, and you reflect that a gam-
bre] usually means an age of a century
at least. Then there are scores of good
houses whose architecture indicates that
they antedate considerably the period
in which the gambrels predominated.
There is one long street, with a double
row of elms interlacing their branches
above it and bordered with new and ex-
pensive homes, but these houses appear
quite like an anachronism in the quaint
old city. In some sections of the town
the honking of an automobile seems in-
trusive and incongruous. The aroma
of antiquity pervades the place as com-
pletely as does the salt tang of the sea
air that the east winds bring.
