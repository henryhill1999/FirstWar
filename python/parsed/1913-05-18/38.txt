I have met a large number of Mo-
hammedan men from Egypt and Tur-
key who apparently possess a veneer
of culture acquired under Western in-
fluences. Their manners are refined,
their speech in the discussion of varied
topics other than the relation of man
to woman is interesting; but they
have an absolute unanimity of views
and feelings with reference to the stat-
us and function of woman.

They argue that woman was design-
edly created for the reproduction of the
race and for the convenience of man.
They argue that the only right she

which I mentioned is that of adequate
support and maintenance from her hus-
band. She must not see any other man
but her husband and the immediate
male members of the family. She must
not interfere with the relations of her
husband toward other women. She
must not question her husband with
reference to his business affairs. She
must always be cheerful In the presence
of her husband, always affectionate to
him, always obedient to him, always
submissive to him. She must never
question his acts and motives, but she
must always recognize in him a superior
lord and master.

She is but a human animal. She
must eat, drink, breathe, walk and talk
within the limitations precisely laid
down by the man, but she must not
argue, she must not discuss, she must
not think on any subject or question
other than her husband and the man-
agement of the household.

The harem system, as it prevails to-
day in Turkey and Egypt in particular,
and in other Mohammedan countries in
general, is the palpable and visible
expression and sample of the stuff of
which the mentality of the Mohamme-
dan man is made. It spells passion,
pleasure and indulgence in vice. And
in this atmosphere, where the basest in-
stincts of the man find hospitality, spir-
itual and moral life, intellectual devel-
opment and a healthy physical growth
are impossible.

The Sultan with his free privilege to
take unto himself “all the daughters
of his uncles, all the daughters of his
aunts, both on his father’s side and on
his mother’s side, and all other bellev-
ing women who are willing to give
themselves unto the Caliph,” which
privilege he may or may not exercke;
the Khedive with his several special
wives, and the freedom of his life in
London, Paris and Vienna, where he
spends several months of each year;
the Mohammedan prince who exercises
his royal prerogative in the dens of vice
in the gay capitals of Europe; the Pasha
who, seated on the divan, surrounds
himself by a coterie of submissive
women—these men, who scorn the most
elementary principles of morality, who
defy all accepted canons of ethics and
who outrage the inherent and inallen-

Interested in the Unrest Which Per-

able right of the woman to live, to
think and to be free, have pulled down
the foundations of the Mohammedan
State throughout the wor!d and are ab-
solutely and unquestionably responsi-
ble for the disgrace and misery to which
the Mohammedan world is subjected to-
day.

I have been fully convinced that as
long as the social system of the Mo-
hammedan world is noy based upon
mionogamy and the equality of the
sexes is not recognized every Moham-
medan State is doomed to utter failure.

I am in favor of the emancipation of
the Mohammedan woman from the
fearful and hideous bars and disabili-
ties under which she has suffered, con-
scilously or unconsciously, for centuries.
I am in favor of a gympathetic effor
on the part of the great Christian na-
tions so to regulate the internal affairs
of the Mohammedan States as to make
it possible for the Mohammedan woman
to enjoy those privileges that her nor-
mal sisters elsewhere do enjoy without
suffering any harshness and punish-
ment from the hands of the men. When
we remove this one principal bar that
separates the Mohammedan from the
Christian, then we will be able to work
side by side for the betterment of man-
kind.

The woman suffrage movement !s in-
cidental and symptomatic of the un-
rest that is seen to-day throughout the
feminine world and which is intended
to raise the status of the woman from
that of the mere housewife and chattel
of convenience to man to that of a fac-
tor equal in importance to man in every
department of human activity. This is
an offshoot of the feminist movement.

The feminist movement that assails
the old prejudice against the engage-
ment of woman on equal footing with
man in commerce, education and profes-
sion; that aims at securing for the labor
of woman that recognition which is ac-
corded to the labor of man; that points
to certain inequalities on the statute
books in connection with the propri-
etary rights of married women and the
right of the mother to the custody of
her child; that attempts to open all
educational and economic portals and
avenues to the ambitions, aspirations
and efforts of woman, 80 that she may
be able to be a better wife and mother,
a more useful member of society—this
sort of feminist movement is the in-
terpretation of the loftiest ideals of the
most intelligent and sensible class of
women of to-day.

But the feminist movement that tends
to jeopardize and degrade the womanly
traits and charawieristics of the woman;
that challenges her to exercise physi-
cal powers that nature has not endowed
her with; that advocates and necessi-
tates the devising and setting up of
agencies, associations and customs that
would make of her a masculine woman,
that would weaken and obliterate that
esteem and respect that men entertain
toward her, which are at the base of
our present system of home life and our
social conventions, and that would in
any way serve to excite sex antagonism
—this sort of feminist movement is not
in Ine with the best aspirations of the
womanly woman of the twentieth cen-
tury.

The reason for my being out of the
rank of the suffragists is not because
I am not in sympathy with every sensi.
ble movement to bring about the moral,
intellectual and economic uplift and
betterment of my sisters, but because I
am not convinced that suffrage is a

necessary or even a desirable agency
to attain the ends in view. At best, the
vast majority of the arguments here-
tofore advanced to support the demand
to vote are neither convincing nor al-
luring.

In the first place IT do not believe that
the suffrage is a right that every citi-
zen should enjoy. It is a privilege that
the State grants to a class of its citi-
zens in consideration of certain duties
performed and likely to be performed
by them in the future. I mean that
this privilege should be availed of only
by those who are equipped by nature
and invested by conventions to per-
form all the duties that are essential
for the maintenance of government.
After all a political system to command
the respect and obedience of the citi-
zen to its laws and mandates must be
supported by the authority of the
strong arm, This brings us face to face
with the most critical question that has
been a subject of controversy between
the advocates and opponents of the suf-
frage movement.

There t no question that every right
involves a duty and that mo one has a
right to demand recognition in a given
organization or society unless he is
willing and able to comply with the
by-laws and constitution of such or-
ganization or society. I feel certain
enough of the soundness of my premise
not to press home any further this
phase of the subject. What I want to
bring out In connection with this point
is, “Has woman the native power to
comply with the fundamental require-
ment of a political system, which is the
maintenance of that system by force
of arms?"

There have been in the past and there
are to-day women rulers in central
India who have gained ascendency over
men by reason of their superior skill
and generalship. There are women
rulers in central India who lead to
battle troops consisting of men and
women. Here the question of the sex
of the soldier is ynimportant, in eo far
as his or her fighting quality is con-
cerned. She can battle as well, and
quite often better, than her man com-
panion.

TI have seen women in Italy carrying
on their back wood and coal and other
charges that the trained porter can only
carry. I have seen women in Hungary
and Austria pulling ox carts and per-
forming the duties of the hod carrier
without any grumble or hesitation. I
have seen women in the Near East till-
ing the soil, tending to the sheep, herd-
ing the cattle, leading the caravan
through tortuous valleys, precipitous
gorges and rugged mountains. And
these are not isolated instances to prove
the aptitude and possibility of my sex.
I have seen hundreds and thousands of
them. The number of those who per-
form the duties I have named and many
other duties that require the exercise
of masculine physical powers which men
and animals here perform run into the
millions,

However, here is a most striking
distinction: The training and environ-
ment of these women differ radically
from those of the women who wear
the corset, high heeled shoes, tight
skirts, who use powder and rouge, who
have grown to womanhood under the
influences of conditions and = forces
that make for a gentle and delicate
constitution, Our system of life and

the women of the comparatively less
civilized communities cannot exist at
the same time and place. Convention
and nature would militate against such
attempt, if that were ever to be made.
In addition, if we were to go back to
that condition in which the women of
the countries I named are to be found,
a condition that forces promiscuous
association of men and women in every
walk of life—an association that does
not recognize any consideration or claim
of preferential treatment that we the
women of the West do expect from
our men—then we will have ushered
in an era of harsher struggle for the

physical labor such as is performed by oman. It is my belief that the very

moment we alienate the sympathy and
the respect of the man from ourselves
as women, the very moment we part
with that moral influence which we
now exercise on the man by virtue of
our status and position, then we are
bound to be left behind in a competi-
tion that is to be waged on equal foot-
ing.

I do not, however, fear this result,
because I do not believe that it will
ever happen. At worst, if it does
happen, it could not last, because it is
unnatural. There are women scien-
tists, authors, thinkers who are un-
questionably equal to their male com-
petitors. There are fields of activity

 

Oriental Women Do Not. Envy the Women of the Occident

By LADY OONA NAZZITO,
Dean of the Women’s English
School of Tokio,

PEAKING from the standpoint of
the average woman of my coun-
try I cannot say that the aver-
age woman of England is to be

envied. In other words, I feel certain
that the Japanese woman of whatever
class—lady, wife, unmarried female,
geisha or domestic—would not care to
exchange her place (if she might) with
her English sisters.

Not once during my several long s0-
journs in “Merrie England” have I truly
envied the lot of her daughters. In-
stead I quite pitied them as a whole:
the toilless, aimless lives of the great
ladies; the jealousies and strivings of
those of the large middle class; the

hardships and sulferings of the poorer
millions. ,

In England—strange indeed, in a time
so late as to be still but a hand's breadth
from Queen Victoria—the woman of the
castle, the manor, the tradesman's
home or the laborer’s hovel, is ever
second! Her Grace is second, her Lady-
ship is second, Madame the King’s
Councillor is second, the curate’s wife
is second, Mrs. Public House is seconu,
the laborer's wife is second. No firsts,
no equalities, all seconds!

That is why we Japanese women
would not, do not, envy the Englisn
woman. We do not clamor for vetes,
nor assail Prime Ministers. We do not
march as soldiers—though we ofttimes
march with them, and we have no de-
sire for office. But we are first in our
homes, first in the love and considera-
tion of our men, our fathers, brothers,

sweethearts, above all, our husbands,
and we are happy, very happy.

Just so is it in France. I have called
the French the Japanese of Europe, and
the more I see of Frenchmen in the
treatment of their women the more
fitting do I regard the appellation. It
is not their politeness, that so much
appeals to me, though polish and cour-
tesy are indeed virtues, But the average
Frenchman is a true gallant with his
womankind.,

In a sense the Frenchman is a
“woman's man,” but never fs the Eng-
lishman. The woman is his just as he
possesses other property, and as he
owns her he cannot see by what stretch
of law or imagination she may pretend
to be anything other than property:
beautiful, fascinating, useful property.

In Japan the woman is also the prop-
erty of the man, but how different! It

is as if I were making a comparison of;

lawns. They occupy the same place In
relation to the house and the property;
but one lawn js baked in the everlasting
heat of the sun, its grasses are thin and
brown, its flowers awkward and listless.
The lord of the house sees the lawn each
day, but it interests him only as so
much space which of necessity he must
have before his domicile.

The other lawn (the Japanese wife)
is not so conspicuously placed and {s not
seen every time the home fs, for a high
hedge shields it from the world, but
there is no hedge nor barrier on the
house side. Instead there are many lit-
tle pats which might be termed the
roads of love, consideration, unity, and
they are bordered with flower beds and
little fountains. And the pretty lawn,
hidden from the gaze of those who
might only look upon it with curious or

 

unsympathetic gaze, is the pride of the
home, for the master himself devotes
all his spare hours there watering,
watching and tending tenderly each bud
of a smile, each flower of love, each lit-
tle plant of desire and ambition,

But it fs not so in England, I am
sorry to say. The Englishman is an
outdoor man, an away from home man.
The club, the cricket field, the public
house are all in all to him; his home
is the place to which he returns when
he has tired of that which is beyond its
portals. His wife, good, faithful woman
that she generally is, is also his ser-
vant and utensil. He shares with her
his wine or beer, his grouse or cheese,
his bed and board; but the ties of
ever increasing love and respect, those
which alone make for lifelong domestic
peace, if present in the household are
so intangible as to be unobserved,

in life in which women excel mea
There are occupations and duties which
women can perform as successfully as
men. But after all it seems to be only
natural that the market, the officq
the shop and the field should en

the attention of the man and the sway
of the home should belong to the
woman.

You cannot forever deceive and dis-
obey nature with impunity, nor can you
at once serve two masters successfully
and faithfully. True, millions of
women are working to-day in the shop,
in the office, and almost in every trade
and profession; but the natural tend-
ency of the woman is to be attracted
back to the home. The instinct of wife-
hood and motherhood emphasizes itself,
forces itself In the breast of every nor
mal woman. The reason why millions
of women are engaged in commerce
and ‘professions is, not that the nature
of the woman has undergone any radi-
cal change from what it was of yora
but because this happens to be an eco-
nomic necessity of the day. This is
also an eloquent testimony to the ad-
vanced state of our civilization that
permits the unhampered and unmo-
lested participation of women with mes
in the life’s problems on one hand, ané@
of the adaptability and intelligence of
the woman on the other.

I suppose that suffrage will be
granted to women some day. That
day will come when the majority of
women want to have it. The reason
for this desire is very much similar
to the desire of the little girl who pre-e
fers the doll in the shop window to
those she has at home. Better still,
she wants the moon. Once she has
what she wants, the charm and attrace
tion pass away.

But before I leave I want to bring
out two distinct points, one bearing
upon the claim of the suffragist, by
which she asserts that once she has
the ballot she will improve the present
political order, and the other pertain-
ing to the uncouthness of some of the
principles of the advocates of suffrage.

The claim that women, if granted
suffrage, will be able to improve the
present system of government, to proe
mote public and private morality and
to obliterate vice in a larger measure
than man has is on its face an Iil-
logical and extravagant assumption. To
achieve that which the suffragist claims
that she will achieve if she were @
voter she must either have intellec-
tual and executive powers larger than
men possess, or she must point to bad
faith on the part of men, or she must
prove her case by pointing to reforms
that have taken place in communities
where she exercises the right of suf-
frage on an equal footing with the
man,

The very moment the female sex, as
a whole, claims superiority of ability
to man, particularly in the domain of
government, then the point at issue be-
comes a difference in opinion. As for
myself, I do not believe that any sen-
sible and intelligent person would make
a claim to the effect that women as a
class would make abler and better ad-
ministrators and executives than men,

No honest and intelligent woman
would assert that the men who have
charge of the government of our coune
try are dishonest or do not exercise
good faith. Men belong to two classea,
good and bad, able and incompetent, the
game as women do. Is it not true that
by granting suffrage to women we will
not improve the quality but merely ine
crease the number of the electorate?
Good women will then associate with
good men and bad women will ally
themselves with the vicious class of
men,

At any rate, this seems to have been
