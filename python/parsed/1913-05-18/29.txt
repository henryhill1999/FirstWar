The Third Ward Napid Transit League

has been organized by property owners
and residents of that section of Queens,
which includes Flushing, Bayside, Doug-
laston, College Point and Whitestone,
to work for the approval and construc~
tion of the Flushing-Bayside line, whtch |
came up before the Board of Estimate
on Thursday and was put over for two
weeks for further consideration asa to
the cost of the subway through Amity
street.

In order to show at a glance how the
$300,000,000 ,the cost of the dual subway
system, is to be expended and to show
the relatively small amount of money |

 

The above statement of tha coat of
sub Ways in Brooklyn is exclusive of the
three tunnels under the Bast River, esti-
thated to cost 815.000.0000 Tf this amount
was added it would bring the cost of the |
Brooklyn subways up te $54,610,000 }

The league believes that the map and |
the statements made concerning rapid |
transit prove that their section is entitled |
to better facilities and will be given them
when the Board of Estimate gives due
cousideration to the relatively small
amount of money to be expended in
Queens in proportion to the other!
boroughs [Tt is expected that the league

Pwill have 10.000 members within sixty

days, from which a committee of 1,000
Will be selected) each oof whom shall)
pledce himself to work to have the Third |
Nard included in the dual subway system
at the earliest possible moment

The officers of the jeague are Rodman |
Richardson, president; James J. Ryan,
secretary, James HH. Quintin, treasurer

The executive committee is composed
of representative citizens from the differ
ent sections of the ward, as shown by the
following names John W. Crawford,
Frederic Storm, TW. Miller, Frank KE
Knab, William Ko Griffiths, George W
cone COW. Lavington, Thomas R. Prich-
ard, A KB Sholes, Edmond Martin, J
qe Johntra, J. Frank Ryan and tra L.
erry

One of the last official acts of ex-Chair-
man Willcox recognizing that the Third

ard was eMtitled to rapid transit was to
lay out the Flushing-Bayside line with an
elevated road through Amity street

| When Chairman Mecall came into office

he not only approved of the route as laid
out but he went further and substituted
a subway for the elevated through Amity
street The route, therefore, has the
Unanimous approval of the Public Service
Commission and only awaits the approval

of the Board of Estimnate .

 

EASTWARD GROWTH IN BRONX.
Next Fapanston Looked For tn Terrt-

tory Embracing Morris Park.

Expansion of The Bronx has been
governed almost entirely by the exten.
sion of {te transit factiitles, and thoee
who are familiar with the past growth
of the northerly borough look for the
next great movement of population into
the territory east of Bronx Park, at the
southerly limits of which lies the Morris
Park racetrack property

Two years is the tine estimated by
the Interborough engineers for the com-
pletion of the subway extension up
White Plains avenue to Becker avenu:
or 241st atreet, two blocks south of the
elty line. As was the case in the build
ing of the present subway, sections of |
this route are kelly to be thrown open
to traffie as rapidly as they are com-
pleted, so that there is every prospect,
that the southerly part of this territory |
will have a five cent rapid transit ser-
vice to the downtown district in consid-
erably less than two years

A short distance east of this subway |
extension and soon to be connected with
{t at 180th street is the four track New
York, Westchester and Boston Railroad,
now giving a fast service down td the
Second and Third avenue elevated roads |
