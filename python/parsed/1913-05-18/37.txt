“FARMERS, LEARN TO COOPERATE,” SAYS SETH LOW
oe

Shows His Neighbors

in Westchester

County How Science and Good
Business Methods Can Make
Agriculture Profitable

VERYBODY knows Seth Low as] State Agricultural Society at Albany
the former Mayor of New York,| on the subject of “Cooperation,” said:

and Brooklynites know that he

was twice Mayor of Brooklyn
when it was a city. But {t is not by
any means so widely known that Mr.
Low is now a farmer, and beyond all
dse a practical farmer, True, a shrewd
guesser might divine the truth by
Merely looking at him, for he is ruddy
and sturdy, somewhat of
John Bull at his best.
and is

suggestive
He seems to be
physifeally fit, a result no doubt
due to outdoor life,

To become a farmer was long one of
Mr. Low's ambitions. His ancestors as
ewners of clipper ships in the China and
India trade for many years ploughed the
ecean, so why should not he plough the
land? But his life engrossed
with urban affairs that until the end of
his New York Mayoralty term he never
bad time to indulge his rural taste,

Then in 1906 in Bedford Hills, N. Y.,
Qear the New England line, he pur-
ehased two farms having a total of
190 acres. The land was not smooth
and level by any means. It was very
Gilly, it contained thirty-seven acres of
swamp, and the great glacier which hap-
pened along that way about a million
years ago—the precise date unfortu-
gately is unrecorded—left its visiting
eards in the form of great numbers of
Boulders composed of about every
variety of rock to be found between
Bedford Hills and northern Labrador.

The farming custom of the vicinity
& dealing with swamps was to let them
feverely alone. As to the boulders, they
were ploughed around. Mr. Low con-

Was so

&e could better the common practice.

He took counsel in regard to the
twamp. Which was the better means
ef draining it, open drains or sunken
tle pipes? The first cost of the open
drains would be less than that of the
pipes, but the open drains would re-
quire labor each year to keep them free
from accumulations of sand. Also they
would waste about an acre of space.
Tile drainage was decided upon and the
ewamp was drained and planted with
eorn. It is doing well, and in a few
years it will be raising good hay.

As to the boulders, Mr. Low thanked
fhe glacier politely and proceeded to
atilize them. He broke them up and
built house, barn, garage and a mile of
goad out of them and also sold $10,500
worth of them to neighbors. The cost
ef clearing the land was $30 an acre,
which included payment for Mr. Low's
feams, charged at $5 a day. The
Bills are conquered by means of fhe
side hill plough drawn by horses,

It is a dairy form with a herd of
sixty milch cows. These are not fancy
Sut graded cattle such as any farmer
may have. There are also calves and
pigs and there are new orchards of
peach and apple trees, There are 2,200

“When my present superintendent,
;G. D. Brill, a native of Dutchess county
fand a graduate of the four year agri-
cultural course at Cornell University,
came to me five years ago he said to
j met ‘Mr. Low, it will take five years
!to place this farm upon its feet.’ When
| I closed my books at the end of October,
1912, the farm had become entirely
self-supporting, by which I mean that
1 it had earned enough in cash to meet
all charges, including the salary of the
superintendent and of the bookkeeper,
and to pay on account of my taxes,
insurance and painting at the rate of
$360 a year.

“The farm also pays one-half of the
maintenance cost of my electric light
and power plant and of my water sys-
tem, The indications are that at the
end of the current farm year which
with me begins on November 1, the
farm will have begun to pay something
on the interest account. I believe that
it .can be made to earn 5 per cent.
over and above all charges of every
kind on a valuation of $80,000. IT am
not sure that we shall not learn how to
make it pay even more.”

Northern Westchester county, where
Broad Brook Farm lies, is in a transi-
tional stage. About one-half of the land
has been sold to city dwellers for sum-
mer homes, The other half of the land
is still in the ownership of farmers
whose methods are generally slack and
half hearted, so that production has
fallen off. In 1880 there were 3,000
farms in Westchester county supporting
the families occupying them and yieid-
ing a large surplus. The total popula-
tion of the county then was 143,000. In
1910 the county contained 283,000 in-

 

shrunk to 2,000 and the quality of farm-
ing had deteriorated.

Demand for farm products increased
greatly in Westchester county between
1880 and 1910, but in spite of this better
market production languished. This is
explained on the theory that land in
Westchester county has increased 80
much in value that it pays the farmers
better to sell than to cultivate their
holdings. Says Mr. Low:

“This generalization is true only in
part; for every farmer {s not able to
sell his land, and until he does sell it
he ought to be able to use it profitably.
Verhaps he does in one way or another,
for IT am always impressed by the well
to do appearance of the farmhouses in
all parts of northern Westchester
through which I drive. The produc.
tivity of the farms, on the other hand,
speaking by and large, is very small,
and under proper conditions it ought
to be very large. It is intolerable to
believe that the mere neighborhood of
New York city can take 346 square
miles of land out of the productive area
of the State.

“This is the problem that has been
jborne in upon me since I have been
| farming in Westchester county. I have
repeatedly asked myself the questions:
| Why is it that agricultural land, so near
}to a great population, is not profitably
| cultivated; and why is it that this pop-
| ulation is fed from Virginia instead of

unenviable notoriety. I do not want to

not be considered a knock, but there
are points of resemblance,

The number of points did suggest

The step was made,

points of resemolance between the old

the evil life of this city some years be-
fore the beginning of the last century.
The topography of the place has been
changed now so that it bears no resem-
blance to what it was even in my young
days, It was formed by the intersection
of Mulberry, Orange, Worth, Cross and
Little Water streets, Like this centre,
it had not only five points but seven
points, two of which were formed by the
base of a triangle, just the same as two
polnts are formed here by the triangle
on which the Times Bullding stands.

“Mulberry street still retains its name,
but Orange street has become Baxter
street, Anthony was absorbed into
Worth when the latter was cut through,
Cross is now Mission street and Little
Water street disappeared when the Five
Points Mission was built on the site of
the Infamous Old Brewery,

“The old Five Points touched on the
Collect, the pond on which Fitch tried
out his first model of a steamboat, It
was filled in later, of course, but even
after that the name Cow's Bay given to
the spot to which people used to drive
cows to the Collect for water, was con-

‘being fed by the farmers at its doors?

The answer to these questions, in my
judgment, is twofold.

“First, the ordinary Westchester
county farmer, like most of the farmeis
throughout the East, buys at retail and
sells at wholesale. The second reason
is that under modern conditions the

ran an alley, not more than three feet
wide. It was called Murderer's Alley,
both because the people of that time and
place rejoiced in bloody names, and be-
cause a score or more of murders had
been committed in its narrow confines.

cooperation, the second by licensing

“Let me pause here long enough to
say that, In my observation, the ordi-
nary farmer has much to learn before
he can succeed even with such improve-
ment as fs possible in the conditions to
which I have referred,

“It contained 270 rum shops of the
worst character, 1,503 of its people lived
in cellars and 4,807 in garrets. On one
lot 25 by 100 feet there were shanties
sheltering 286 persons. The population
was fearfully mixed, since there were
3,435 Irish families, 416 Itallan families,
393 German families, 210 Russian, 167
American, 112 Polish, 73 English, 70

He Wants All Commission
Men Licensed

Knapp of the United States Agricul-
tural Department used to say that
‘farming is one part science, three parts
art and four parts business.’ The ordl-
nary farmer would do well to increase
his knowledge of the science of farming,
to say nothing of the art. On the side
of business management he needs help
if he is to succeed, for to succeed in
farming it is not enough to produce,
One must be able both to produce eco-
nomically and to sell advantageously.
“It is precisely here that cooperation
is so important for the farmer, for co-
operation ought to do for the small
farmer precisely what he cannot do for
himself, It ought to give him expert
information as to the best crops to
raise and how to raise them; it ought
to enable him to buy what he needs
more cheaply and to sell what he pro-
duces to better advantage; it ought to
be able to help him to keep accounts so
that he can detect waste and learn
how to improve his methods. In a
word it ought to do for him just what

‘he cannot do well for himself.

“It is hard for us in the East, where
the farmers are not used to cooperation,
to learn how to cooperate, for we come
of an ancestry whose great merit It
was that each one of them could stand
upon his gwn feet. But if the Eastern
farmer is again to prosper we must
all of us learn to cooperate with each
other, It may be said, without fear of
successful contradiction, that through
well managed cooperation the small
farmer can get his supplies at least as
cheaply as the farmer with large capi-
tal. Is not this worth while?

“One other thing my experience in
farming in Westchester county has
taught me. I put it in the words of one
of my neighbors who has been growing
apples for a number of years:

“He says that he has made shipments
of apples every now and then to com-
mission merchants in New York. Al-
most invariably the first shipment has
done well, and the second shipment very
poorly. He says that he never has been
able to find how the great city of New
York knew that his second shipment
was not a first shipment! Now, he
says, he never makes more than one
shipment to any commission merchant.
and he begins with A and goes through
the list to Z.

“I am far from wishing to imply that
there are no honest commission mer-
chants; but every farmer in the State
knows that there are some dishonest
commission merchants; and we all
know that, as things are now, we are
practically, absolutely in the hands of
the man to whom we consign. We are
helpless if our shipment {fs reported out
of condition or off in quality. This is
a situation that ought not to continue.

“The State, In my judgment, should
license all commission merchants who
are authorized to deal in farm products;
and the terms of this license should be
such as to protect both the commission
merchant and the farmer from misun-
derstanding and from fraud. I have no
doubt that the commission merchant,
on his side, would be able to bear elo-
quent testimony to dishonest packing

to-day are gentle and refined compared

and clubs, not bullets.

“Now, son, there's a picture of what
the old Five Points was. The place
was known the world over, and was
to New York what Seven Dials and
Whitechapel were to London,

“How about this new Five Points?
There are no gangs up here yet, but
gang work and gunmen are easily
available. Twice within’ the last
twelve months men have been shot
to death within a stone's throw of
where we are sitting, but the gunmen
have been brought here from other
parts of the city; also the victims were

not lured here for the purpose of
robbery.
“It is interesting to note that the

very thing that gave the death blow to
the ald Five Points made this see-
tion of the city possible—light.

In all respects Mr, Low's farm serves
as a practical model for the Bedford
Hills district, and local officials declare
that its influence for good is widespread
Farmers for miles around drive in to see
how things are done at Broad Brook, and
when they depart they carry away with
them many new ideas. After the last
session of the Peace Commission Baron
d'Estournelles de Constant was a visitor
at Broad Brook. He went to the barn
and watched proceedings there for hal!
an hour. Then he reported to Mr. Low

“IT perceive how it {s that this farn
is so successful. Your men jump t
their work. It !s due to cooperation
and organization.”

The Broad Brook superintendent, a:
has been said, was born in Dutches:
county, He grew up on a farm, bu'
took the four years course at Cornel!
and three of his associates are Corne!
graduates who have had abundant farn
experience. So there fsa college atmos

Low sits at table with his alds he feel:
himself very much at home and con
versation is not necessarily confined t
narrow bounds. Unlike most farms th:
working day there is only nine hour:
in length.

Mr. Low thinks that young American:
who have grown up on farms an
shared in farm work and afterward
gone through agricultural colleges
make the best farm managers. The city
boy who goes to Cornell agricultura
college and learns the theory of farm-
ing is prone to imagine that he has
