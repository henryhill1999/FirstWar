it. It is unlike anything you have ever
seen, and as like as two peas to the
thing you dreamed. You buy it, at &
price below what you had planned, and
are ready to go on your way happy.
The story of the necklace is brought up
as you talk with the pleasant shope
keeper. It is the simple old story you
wanted to wind among those lacy petals
of silver of an artist who loved it and
bought it long ago, and just now, when
real art is at a discount and the “mod-
ern” reigns, had sold ft, sold it just
here, for the price of his studio rent!

Truly, it is like the story a popular
lecturer used to tell about the man who
wandered far afield in search of wealth
and returned home after long wander-
ings to find acres of diamonds in his
own backyard! But the saddest part of
all is that the mere fact that you found
what you hoped for will merely make

row Wilson from Tadashige Suzaki, a
Princeton graduate, now at Shiroishbl,
Miyagiken, Japan. Among other things
the alumnus of the big university says:
“I send you my hearty congratulation
for your throne of presidency on this
memorable day. When I knew that
Hon. Wilson was elected Presidency of
U. 8. A., I could not keep a loud hur-
rah.”

While this may seem laughable, it fs
not much better or worse than some of
the glaring errors in orthography,
syntax and prosody discovered in @
number of very vright graduates of our
best universities when occasion came
to test their ordinary scholastic acquisl-
tions. A poor speller at college is taken
as a matter of course in most cases.
It is supposed that if he has advanced
through the high or preparatory school
and has not been turned out a proficient
speller that he is a hopeless case in this
respect and there is no use trying to
improve him. So his spelling is con-
doned and his attention directed to
logarithms perhaps,

A droll story is told of the student
who was turned out the best mining
engineer of his class. A task had been
set him by a professor, He failed to
finish it and wrote to his preceptor:
“I am sorry the work you gave me to
do is not dun. I sprained my ancle.”
The reply sent him read: “If you
sprained your ankel of course that ts
all there is to it. Your work was doo
to be done a week ago, however, and
I'm afraid it is now too late.”
