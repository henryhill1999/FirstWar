10.000 NEW YORK SCHOOL BOYS TO CELEBRATE VICTORY OVER THE
PASSING OF THE JUVENILE STREET GAN

Demonstration by Mem-
bers of the Public
Schools Athletic League
on June 6

Ill! passing of the lawless gang
spirit among New York boys
is to be signa:ized by the Public
Schools Athletic League in a

demonstration with 10,000 boys on June
6 in Central Park which experts admit
would have been wholly impossible ten
Years ago. At that time any attempt
to handle even a small number of
youngsters in a park would have been
fraught with much risk, For ten years
@go the New York boy was largely a law
unto himself. His restless brain and
physical energy for want of any legit!-
Mate application found expression in
@ang warfare between neighborhoods,
fock battles in the streets, persistent
damage to property and all sorts of mis-
@emeanor.

His normal instinct for ball playing
Was made a source of law breaking.
He was prohibited from playing ball in
the streets, but no direct effort was
made to give him any other place to
play. His gregarious spirit, desire for
leadership and instinct to be loyal to
gome activity could find expression only
in de gang. No one tried to supply the
gang with desirable occupation, so {ft
tried its strength on damage to prop-
erty, its loyalty in interneighborhood
@ang battles and its physical skill in
target work on street lights. Gang
leadership largely was awarded as the

knowledge and recollection of these two
Kinds of boys is very distinct, for I
myself was a boy in New York and at-
tended the public schools, I well re-
member my own boyhood in this city,
when there was no league or other
agency which held a brief for a boy's
natural right to play and busied itself
with supplying places and opportunities
for playing without breaking the law.
People in those times did not recognize
nlay as @ natural instinct that could
be capitalized Into wonderful results
for the individual and the city. For
the most part, play was looked upon as
a waste of time and an evil to be
curbed as much as possible. There were
many arrests for ball playing on the
streets, and, as is generally the case,
punishment does little to stop a normal
and really legitimate demand.

“There was little or no organized
athletics in the public schools; there
was no extensive and well governed
baseball league for the little fellows;

ho interschool fleld and track meets
What boyish competitions did take
place were largely vacant lot affairs

and between neighborhoods rather than
for interschool supremacy. These con-
tests were largely expressions of neigh-
borhood gang antagonism; most of them
ended in rows or fights, and final su-
premacy commonly was decided by the
guerrilla warfare and rock fights of
neighborhood gangs. The honor of the
schools never ficured in int rboy con-
tests—the honor of the gang was the

ing rival gangs, so the gang spirit | habits and unhygienic home conditions

found additional expression in molesting
outsiders and damaging private and
public property) The anemie boy had

Rock battles between gangs have given way to athletic contests between schools.

@esult of skill, energy and brains ap-

to destructive channels. Appar-
ently there was nothing wrong in the
dnstincts of these boys—the same spirit
Which led to depredation was the very
@pirit which in other boys resulted in
valuable team and school spirit and led
Doys to seek recognition for their leader-
ehip in entirely desirable fields,

The public schools were giving great
attention to developing the physical
and mental efficiency of the boys, but
all too often the lessons of strength
learned in the school were applied to
@estructive physical activity out of
@chool hours. The Public Schools Ath-
letic League was then founded to coop-
erate with the schools and to give
the boys a direct opportunity to use
the physical training drill for things
@ther than gang escapades, The league
@etermined to capitalize the gang spirit
fnto team and school spirit and to let
the boys let off steam in competitive
faces and jumping and putting the
ehot and playing baseball instead of
testing their strength in overturning
ash barrels or throwing bricks at gang
rivals.

The results in less than ten years
have been fairly remarkable—gangs of
boys and neighborhood rock fights are
@ow the exception. One hundred and
Sfty thousand youngsters who formerly
bad no interest In clean competition
@ow enter into athletics with all the
e@trength and will and enthusiasm they
possess. The neighborhood feud has
been replaced by the school competi-
tion. Fair play has succeeded gang
trickery and guerrilla warfare. Holl-
days find these boys at the parks and

} playgrounds and athletic fields instead

of unhappy and in mischief on the
etreets. Where ten years ago it would
have been impossible to get any two
groups of boys to meet and compete
without wrangling and trouble, the
Jeague can now bring Into competi-

* tion at one time and in one field 200
’ teams of fifty boys each and be abso-

lutely confident that the whole 10,000
will compete in absolute order and fair-
mess for the honor of thelr hundred
‘odd public schools.

Incidentally, the demonstration also

* will make plain to the public how the
\ mew course of study has capitalized the

natural instincts of boys into habits of
health. On the field, the 10,000 boys will
perform all the exercises which are
given to build up their general health
and assure them muscular strength and
@fficiency in useful movements. Adults
who remember their own school days
and how they hated to go through the
@ull calisthenics and dumbbell and In-
@ian club drills will be surprised at the
new movements being taught to chese
young Americans. For the new drills
are made up almost wholly of exercises
which directly help the boys to run,

| jump, throw, play ball and do the things

they themselves like to do. The exer-
cises are largely mimetic—the boys are

) taught the very movements used by na-

tional and world champion athletes in
The boys like them

are great mimics. The purpose of the
exercise, however, is not to make ath-
letes of the boys. The movements
while based on athletic methods really
give the boy all the drill he needs to
develop his general health and the prop-
er functioning of his organs,

Custavus T. Kirby, chairman of the
demonstration committee of the league
and president of the Amateur Athletic
Union of America, In commenting on
the passing of the gang and the chang-
fing of the street gang spirit Into an
orderly athletic ambition said:

“The Public Schools Athletic League
was founded nearly ten years ago to
dea) primarily with two very distinct
@nd at that time very common types of
city boys. One was the type of young-
ater whose energy and gregarious spirit
for want of anything better found ex.
pression and satisfaction in the old time

gangs were not well enough organized
on a war footing to satisfy fully the
natural competitive spirit of the boys.
They couldn't keep busy enough fight-

“But, first, how many people shall we

“Certainly not. Travel in as large a

We sail on a Saturday and land probably

trained his body up to fighting value,
but no one took the trouble to show
him how. Absence of all athletic ac-

ture on that subject.

“As I said before, we ship our trunk to
London, taking our dress suit cases with

We'll spend the first day in Liverpool,
seeing the gallery, where there is a
splendid modern collection. I think
we'll spend the night there.

‘Early the next morning we're off
to Chester, a fascinating old town, We'll
check our bags at the station, walk
around the walls—if you're at all in-
terested in the Stuarts, the King Charles
Tower will thrill you—see the Cathedral,

“We're not going to stay at Leaming-
ton, but at Warwick. We take the
tram out, and sit on top so as to -ee

bethan House, kept by a young Ameri-
can, to which we have written ahead

abundance of energy. In the absence
lof proper things to do he went about
| the streets making trouble either as an

He worried Chinamen, broke street
lamps and windows, overturned ash
barrels and made the policeman’s life
a burden. When not testing his physi-
cal strength in fighting with other boys
he employed it in damaging the first
thing at hand. Not being able to peg
a ball to second base he pegged a stone
at a window or a passerby. Gang
leadership was largely a matter of
bully temperament, brute strength,
fighting skill and unbridled deviltry and
ingenuity in misdemeanor. Membership
in a gang was largely a matter of mis-
guided team spirit. It was the ad-
mirable quality which makes a foot-
ball team or baseball team fight as a

Warwick is a delightful place, Most
people rush through and miss the de-

but a home for old soldiers and their
wives. A whole morning can be spent
there, beginning with chapel, which the
pensioners attend In their gowns and

into the house, where one of the old men
will prove a most entertaining guide.

fell out of the cab the first night when
I recognized the Hons of Trafalgar
Square.” Nora heaved a sigh of blissful
recollection,

“I shall never forget my first day. I
had to have a glimpse of everything.
To be in London, that I'd read of and
dreamed of all my life—it was too won-
derful! We walked from our pension,

citing and burdensome existence. The
“cop” who got along with “de gang” was
either very wise in his own generation
or was a first rate overlooker of juve-
nile depredations. No doubt many of
these juvenile gangsters outgrew this
training and later found valuable fields
for their energies, But undoubtedly
also from these boyish gangs were re-
cruited many of the dangerous gangs
of adolescent gunmen and_toughs
which formed the Gas House and other
groups of American apaches.

“Some of us who still remembered our
boyhood and who had had experience
in athletics and had gained greatly from
competitive sports felt that if we could
give enough boys a normal outlet for
their physical energies and supply them
with adequate competitive opportunity
along healthy lines we might be able

or impose them by authority would be

something so much better from the

he himself would take the initiative.

to the boys: ‘Come on—let’s do it’
The New York boy is decidedly critical
and resourceful. Give him something
a little hard to do, show him its selfish
application and he'll probably find a way
to get results,

“We finally decided to work first on
the individual—to try to develop gang
leaders into athletic leaders and then
after we had made athletic skill and
strength the fashion to extend our work
to the groups,

“The first move was to create ag it
were a health aristocracy. Therefore,
we established our button test. We of-
| fered a handsome badge to any boy who
;could show himself up to a certain
| standard of running ag-inst time, jump-
i ing and chinning a bar. In other words,
we capitalized supremacy in the very
}things the boys themselves were do-
\ing. The test was not too difficult or
;too easy. They had to run sixty yards
lin 83-5 seconds; jump feet and chin

looked awfully easy, but it wasn't
Only a few boys qualified right away
jand the minute these boys got thelr
badges every boy in school wanted one
And they began to work. They thought
they were working for badges—we knew
they were working for their own health

“The button soon began to exert a

to little Mike: ‘Wot's de button Patsy
Murphy got at school for being healthy?
You get busy and get one. I'll not ba
havin’ the Murphys crowing it over
us.’

“And Mike got busy.

“He found that he could not hope to
qualify unless he stopped smoking ciga-
rettes. Incidentally, although Mike did
not know it, the very exercises which
would train him for the button tests
were the best possible ones to mak
him a better student and better boy 49
well as a sturdier one. The tests—and
this is a state secret—were deliberately
planned to give an incentive for certain
work, Soon we had to establish a

higher button in order to keep those
who had qualified working for still
greater physical improvement.

“The button idea was all right for the
individual—it started the young eans-
ster and the anemic boy working, but 't

did not go far enough. It did not s.1)-

team work of the gang. Hence tho
