Up Only After Support Is Vowed,
Members of the Bulldog Breeders Aa-
eoctation held thetr first dinner of the
reason at the Albemarle-Hoffman
Thursday ever ing A representative
gathering was 'n attendance, including the

president, Wrlt®r Gurnes, the vice-pres-
fdent, Alison Lederer, and Mrs, Lederer,
Arnold) Lawson, James Conway, John

A. Rost and many other members and
guests Mr. Vredenbur@h, secretary of

the American Kennel Club, was the guest
of honor,

The presence of Mr. Lawson and his
enthustaetic remarks in the courme of the
evening effectually disproved the truth
of the rumor circulated recently of hts
intended difection from the assoctation
Such rumors are hard to locate; they
simply grow apace,

It was after midnight when the mem-
bers sepnrated, and each man present
had pledged himself to eupport the asso-
elation In {ts shows and to encourage the
breeders to renewed energy.

The famous old Scottish terrier, cham-.

pion, Duneryne, late of the Grafton Ken-
nels, {s no more, His death was not une
expected, for he had passed the allotted

age of dors and his career had been a
brillant one. The stud books and prize
lists tell the story, and he leaves three

champion sons and daughters to carry the

banner. They are Sandown Tartar, Nose-
gay Redbud and Himstead Hellinda,
Duneryne'’s place will be filled, how.

any say in the matter, Last week Al-

The Long Yeland Kanne! Club matches,

which started on @ smal) scale in the club- |

rooms in Hrooklyn !n conjunction with the
rewular mgetings, have become full fledged
dog shows on the roof of the Albemarle-

brought out more contestants and more
spectators than ever before and there were
classes for English, French and Boston
bulls, bull terriers, Alredales, toy spaniels,
Vekes, Pome, Japs, toy poodles and toy
black and tane.

Mrs. Raymo Belmont won the open
competition for the best in the show with
her Pekingese apantel, Cupid of Epping-

C. M. Hodgkina judged the

Otto Stauder had charge of their Eng-
Msh contemporaries and he chose Wee
Nugget to wear the blue, defeating Mrs.
William Drew's Gaby Deslys and Malcolm
Strauss's Winnie. In Bostons Mrs. A. L,
Simpson adjudicated and she preferred W.
Ramsey's Errand Boy to R. J. Cohen's
Whip, which left only a yellow for Rock-
ontan Model. Lady Break, a bull terrier
which won a red ribbon at the Woodmere
show earlfer in the day, appeared again
last night, and this time she waa fortunate
enough to win first prize. Laeay {fe the

property of Mise Ashton Cross, was pol-
soned with aconite
tion.

several challenge cups. <A rich red fn

About two years and three months old, be
was valued at $1,500.

Great satisfaction is expressed
King George V. 18 going tn for
Russian retrievers, a variety resurrected
by Col. the Hon, le Poer French. The
King has acquired St. Hubert's Peter, the
winner of the championship at Croft's
ehow, London, tn February Peter had
been heavily shot over by his late owner,
Col. French, a veteran sportsman.
George will not own anything tn the way
of a sporting dog unless it will work and
work well. His old favorites as retrievers
are of the Labrador or Lesser Newfound-
land breed. d

The success of Amerfean blooded ret-
ters and pointers at the recently held
field trials in England has been pro-
nounced. Dogs that have been bred from
| {mported American gun dog stock have
won all along the line. The old strain, of
course, was sent out from England to,
{t would appear, become more vigorous
jin a new clime. The dogs were hunted
| under wider, wilder and less game hold-
| ing conditions, This gave dogs a habit

 

 

of wider ranging, greater pace, a faculty
for finding game, and, furthermore, 4
keener, intuitive perception as to where
to find game. The last mentioned attatn-
ment fs known as “bird sense’ tn Amer-
{ca. And a combination of these desira-
ble qualities accounts for the prominence
of both American-English bred pointers
and setters in the English Kennel Club
Derby.

Robert Lobban, who will Judge the bull-
dogs at the Ladies Kennel Assoctation's
Show in London in June, last week had
sent out to his order !n New York a very
good miniature bulldog. These small
siged bulldogs are quite popular tn Eneg-
