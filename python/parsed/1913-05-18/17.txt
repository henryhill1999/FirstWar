|EBBETS TALKS ABOUT

HIS $45,000 DODGERS

Came Called Off, We Entertains
Himself and Others With
Interesting Speech.

 

TELLS OF PLAYERS’ COST
Dahlen Spurns Only One Player
Who Proved Able to Stay
in Big Leagues,

 

Brooklyn baseball fans were = disap-
pointed yesterday when the announcement
was made that the game with the St
Louis Cardinals at Ebbets Fleld had been
called off on account of rain. They also
were disgruntled when they learned that
the Glants were playing up in Harlem. It
started to rain in Flatbush at 2 o'ctock,
one hour before game time, andin spite of
the presence of 2,000 person’ outside the
marble rotunda, the Brooklyn Club. offi-
clals said that even if the weather cleared
the fleld could not be dried tn time for
play. The postponed contest, therefore,
will be doubled up with the Cardinals
scheduled game at Ebbets Fleld on Au
must 16.

Up iy the Rrookiyn Club's offices the
success of the Dodgers was the sole top:
President Ebbets proudly discussed
Dahlen's hustlers and told how he got
them by degrees, acting upon tips from
friendly baseball men in Various parte of

!
the country atid leaving the selection to

the judgment of the club's scout, Lar

Sutton, who ts employed tn the compos nz
yoom of a Newark newspaper Ebbets
showed figures fo prove that the present
members of the Brookiyn team were ob

tained either by draft or purchase at an
outlay of more than $45,000 When
lroahlien assumed the manegement in the
spring of 110 he began weeding out the
old material, with the result that Rucker,
Hummel, Knetzer and Wheat are the only
players left of the former line up. Hum-
mel was purchased for $1,600 from Brock-
ton, Mass, in 1905. Rucker was drafted

Augusta in 1907 for $560, while
and Wheat were purchased i)
1909 for $2,500 and $1,500, respectively.
Daubert was placed on first base in
Dahlen’s first year, after he had been
drafted from Memphis for $1,500, In 1911
the Brooklyn ciub secured these men
Miller, from Duluth, €¢759; Ragon, from
Rochester, $4,000; Red Smith, from Nash-
ville, $3,500, and Erwin, from Rochester,
44,500. In 1912 Ebbets obtained Shortstop
Fisher from Newark for $3,500, Kent from
Hirmingham, $1,000; Allen from Mobile,
£5,200; Kirkpatrick from Dayton, $2,000,
Stengel from Aurora, $750; Phelps from
Toronto, $2,500; Yingling from Toledo,
$1,500, Curtis from Philadelphia Na-
tionals, $1,500; Stack from Philadelphia
Nationals, $1,500; Moran from Rochester,
$1,500, and Cutshaw from Oakland, $1,500.
The players purchased for this season
are: Callahan, from Elmira, $2,500; Wag-

| AP RUCKER, who is pro-

pitcher in the National League,
probably draws the top salary from

cost only $500. Pat Donovan,
') managing the Dodgers in 1906,

| Ebbets attended the drafting meet-
| ing in the fall and learned that
| Rucker was bound by a contract
| to be sold to Connie Mack. But
as Mack had put up no money to
| bind the bargain the National
Commission annulled the contract.
Then Ebbets slipped in a draft for
$500 on the spot, being the only
major league magnate, except
larry Herrmann at the meeting,
and Rucker was awarded to him. |

got fourteen hits off Ediund and Acheson,
