Get Dividends With Their Groceries

The Residents of Washington
Heights Have a Co-
operative Store

AVEN'T you been sheared
long enough? Why not
share?"

So asks a circular of the
Community Commissary, soliciting your
trade. It wants that trade not for its
own benefit but for yours, for this is a
cooperative store in which the business
belongs to the buyers, the spoils to the
consumer.

It was started by some residents of
Washington Heights at 558 West 181st
street on October 15 last with 150 mem-
bers, and it has now, in less than six
months, 325 names upon its books. The
receipts the first day were 10 cents; on
@ recent Saturday they were over $100,
At the end of the second quarter more
than $300 was distributed among the
stockholding customers in sums rang-
ing from 8 cents to &8, the divi-
dend representing 10 per cent. of the
trade they had brought into the store.

The commissary is a corporation,
Operated under a charter obtained in

Virginia. Its officers are: Benjamin
Catchings, a lawyer, president; E. J.
. Pickworth, lace importer, vice-presi-
dent; A. W. Gerrard, manufacturer,

second vice-president; Arthur D. Spear,
manufacturer, third vice-president;
Elijah Bates, investment broker, treas-
wrer, and Miss Martha Barry, house-
keeper, secretary. A Doard of govern-
ors, composed of sixteen other stock-
holders, is the managing body. Each
member of the organization who owns
one share valued at $10 is entitled to
@ vote at the general meetings; none
may have more than one vote. Inter-
est of § per cent. is paid on these shares,
quarterly.

“We began with a capital of $5,000)
contributed by 150 members,” explained |
Mr. Catchings.
making enterprise, but only a money
eaving one, we are not running it for
profit, and hence no dividends are ever
declared upon the common stock, The
preferred receives 5 per cent, interest
regularly. To avoid the danger of a
rival buying control the greater part
of the stovk ‘s in the hands of a trustee,
who gives promise to vote it according
to the wishes of the directors of the
majority of the members of the associa-
tion.”

The Community Commissary seeks to
reduce the cost of living for its members
by bringing them Into direct communi-
cation with the wholesale market and
selling gocds as they are—fresh, without
adulteration or substitution and with-
out short weight.

; No speclats to-day,
t Every day is special day here

ea cat

reads a big sign in the Community Com-
missary. By that the manager, Charles
W. Reichey, who has been in the bus!-
ness for thirteen years, means to warn
his customers against putting their faith
in “specials.”

“Bmith & Jones advertise four cans
of a cleansing compound for 25 cents
to-day,” he explained, “They cost them
@even cents each—that means a loss
of course. How do they make {t up?
By selling an inferior quality of butter
er giving short weight on something
else. You must always be ready to suse

t a ‘special.’

ewe eabilah a bulletin every two
months in which we give the full Ist
of articles on hand and the market
wholesale prices. We never = charge
more than 25 per cent. profit on anys)
thing, and some things we sell at cost, |
Butter, eggs, sugar and soap we sell
at cost because the wholesale price is
go high that it cuts out any chance of
making a profit.”

That !s the present scheme—charg-
{ng no more than 25 per cent, profit for
funning expenses and delivery charges

to any buyer, member or passerby and
eiving a discount of 5 per cent, on the
amount of the purchase to a stock-
holder. The discount is paid in cash

with each purchase,
The method the store adopted when
it first opened was complex in com-
parison, Goods were sold at the retail
price charged in other stores and the
member got back the difference be-
tween this retail price and 10 per cent,
added to the cost price. This 10 per
cent, was necessary to pay the ex-
penses of handing; what was taken in
over and above that was profit, and as
euch to be returned to the customer.
‘To iMustrate this simply: You buy a
ten cent loaf of bread; the store pald

ms

“As this is not a money |

the baker elght cents; 10 per cent. of
eight cents is one cent—that goes to
the store for expehses, the other cent
goes back to the customer. For de-
livery they charged 10 per cent. of the
retail price; in this case one cent. So
{f you had your bread sent you lost
your profit.

Have you ever thought that
spend over 5 per cent.
in having things sent home? From
5 per cent. to 10 per cent. for your
grocer’s rent? So the commissary peo-
pic assert.

“The retail grocer doesn't go down to
the market every day to pick out the
things he wants,” says Mr. Catchings.
“Why should the women if they have
a grocer whom they can trust? It
would be interesting to calculate the
amount of time women waste in think-
ing things over while they're in the
Btore and talking things over with the
clerk. His time means money to the
owner and ultimately it does to the
woman too.

“If you have an intelligent man over-
looking your stock, and if you know
that he will get you any brand of
goods you may want, and if you have
pald one visit to the store and know
that things are being kept properly,
why can't you stay at home and order
by mail? Something could really be
accomplished if women were willing to
do that. We could almost sell at cost
then.
“We

you
of your money

are training our members to
plan ahead and order in advance to
}s0me extent. We supply them with or-
j}der sheets and stamped envelopes, we
;Supply them with fresh vegetables only
|if they give us their order two days
in advance, and we send our wagon
out only at stated times. Under no
other conditions can we exist.

“Each week we publish a vegetable
and fruit price list giving the whole-
sale listing. We have made arrange-
{ments with a wholesale dealer to fill our
| orders just as soon as he gets the
merchandise, Because he is assured of
the order he Is willing to break up big
lots and send us only one eggplant or
one cabbage head as we may need it.
The thines are never stored a while
downtown before they come to us.

“Another way we have of teaching
housewives how to economize in time
and money by buying with a plan is to
send our clerk out with the wagon when
he makes his morning rounds for or-
ders, This wagon is fitted with shelves
and boxes In which are kept a supply
of the staple goods of the ordinary
kind which one is apt to need from day
to day—things like sugar, potatoes,
butter, eggs, cheese, bread and canned
goods, This saves a second trip and
brings the store to the housekeeper,

“But not every day does he go to
| Svery customer; he can't do that, there
lare too many. Mondays, Wednesdays
and Fridays he covers the Manhattan
district, and’ Tuesdays, Thursdays and
Saturdays he goes across the Fort
Washington Bridge to his Bronx cus-
tomers, They have learned to wait for
him, and they find that, just as they

can order goods to last from Saturday
to Monday, they can order from Mon-
day to Wedns sday,

“The old fashioned country method?
Perhaps, but just think to what it will
lead! A radiation system of wagons go-
ing out from a central station and serv-
ing thousands of families. Rent to

pay for one shop where there are ten
now. Just look here,”

And Mr, Catchings produced a large
map of upper Manhattan and the neigh-
boring Bronx district on which were
blocked off “delivery districts" in viv-
idly contrasting colors,

“Some day we are going te have a big
automobile dellvery wagon bring us the
produce from the markets downtown to
one little storehouse located centrally.
A small force of clerks there will re-
distribute the stock according to the or-
ders that ‘have come in and send them
out in the smaller delivery wagons that
cover the outlying districts, That plan
js not far fetched; it Is very possible.
It is in accordance with the recommenda-
tion of the New York Legislature. This
small beginning in a cooperative store
is, to my mind, the best way of carry-
ing out that recommendation,

“The experiment is only in its infancy
now. If we could be sure of sales aver-
aging $1,000 a day, ten times more than
they are now, we could be sure of $100
for running expenses, that Is 10 per cent.
Just think what we could do with that
surety! We could buy better, have bet-
ter equipment and give better service.
We could also give our members back
more of their money; we could reduce
the operating expenses to a minimum

and sell practically at our present cost
price.”

“Do you feel confident that you will
get the volume of trade you want?"

“In time we will get it. For the pres-
ent people are still afraid of the scheme.
They don't understand it, they distrust
{t, and then they are impatient for re-
sults. If all the women who began to
be members—they pay $1 down and 50
cents a month until their ten dollar
share is complete, when it pays them 5
per cent. interest—only kept on being
members and gave us all their trade we
could be doing even more for them
now.”

One of the most interesting facts the
account books revealed was that the es-
timated savings of the customers ex-
ceeded the charge for store service.
These figures for the month of Novem-
ber indicate what profit the middleman

makes not giving his customers the
chance to save:

Cost of merchandise sold.......... $678.37
Store service charge.............. 73.19
Estimated savings of customers... 82.43

And yet the store {is now meeting its
expenses,

Modish Balkan Jewelry
On the crest of the wave of Balkan
fashions comes the Balkan jewelry,
One striking necklace shows the un-
usual combination of lapis lazuli and
turquoises; the dark, rich blue with the
lighter shade giving the two toned effect
so much sought just now in fashionable
costumes,

HERE are few women who can-
not make a cake of some kind,
but there is one woman in
America with such a genius for

cake making that it has carried her

name around the globe. This is Mrs.

tor or a painter as a cake maker, but
instead of entering into fields of art
already open she made a new line of
work for herself,

When she sets out to make one of
those Wilson cakes she first bakes a
foundation which js fine and even in
texture, moist but not damp and go soft
that it could be eaten with a spoon. It
is not unusual for these foundation
akes to be a yard square, Sometimes
her bridal cakes, made for wedding re-
ceptions, cover a round dining table
with the exception of a four inch bor-
der left to show the polished wood and
its lace spread. One hundred and fifty
eggs may go into the making of one of
these gigantic c:.kes,

Then having prepared the foundation
cake, Mrs, Wilson proceeds to cover it
with a thick coating of light, smooth,
steamed icing of her own originating.
The whites of twenty eggs, beaten as
light as new fallen snow, are part of the

some necklace with smoked amber and
jade, the deep blue, butter yellow and
dark green forming a typical Balkan
color scheme and one that is extremely
popular over here when seen in small
touches, as in gems. The lapis is in
three flat slabs, with the jade and amber
mounted in the surrounding silver work.

Opaque stones are the favorites in
Balkan jewelry. Other gems used in-
clude garnets from the native soil, to-
pazes, amethysts, opals, rock crystals
found in the river beds of the highlands
and small seed pearls,

A Balkan pendant, containing a
round sun stone, has occasioned much
favorable remark among the lovers of
artistic jewelry. Its quaint setting of
openwork silver is almost black in the
deeper shadows, so dark is its gray
toned patina, and against this the
smooth orange stone forms a fine con-
trast.

The Balkan finger rings in their
numerous distinctive designs make it
possible for your jeweller to give you
something with an original touch suit-
ing your individuality. In one example
lapis lazuli is used—this time in a long,
narrow section, with red coral and
smoked amber in very small pieces
decorating the ring’s shoulders; that is,
on either side of the lapis set bezel,

Jasper is a great favorite with the
Bulgarians. They have jasper set in
necklaces, rings and earrings, mounted
in gold or silver, but their preference
is always for silver—and jasper in sil-
ver is splendid. The four renowned
Balkan colors can best be curried out
in jewelry by using jasper, which gives
the necessary dull red, lapis, smoked
amber and rak green jade; but what-
ever the costume there may always be
found a jewel of any desired harmony or
contrast among the Balkan jewelry,

palette Mrs. Wilson tints the Icing inthe
various hues of the flowers she is to

of linen paper, an aperture is snipped
with a pair of scissors at the point of
the cone and her skilful fingers set to
work.

Then across the face of the great loaf

Nttle tube tea roses as delicately tinted

been dropped down upon the cake. Her
jJonquils in icing carry with them all
the glad rapture of the return of spring;
her orchids breathe of luxury. No
flower grows in garden or hothouse that
does not grow also on Wilson cakes,
Of course her skill Is expensive. Wil-
son cakes sometimes bring as much as
a hundred dollars. Within the last few
days an eighty dollar cake was shipped
to a New York hostess.

Mrs, Wilson is cake maker for kings
and presidents, not to mention mere
governors and diplomats, Her confec-
tions have been served on the royal
table of England and at the court of
Vienna, The last cake shipped to the
German court was a culinary triumph

have become princesses, countesses and
duchesses have introduced her cakes in

Millions of Dollars Spent by
Ranchmen Exterminat-
ing Pests

HOEVER has visited the
Bronx Park Zoo cannot
have failed to notice the
prairie dog exhibit in one of

the fenced in lots near the southwest
corner of the grounds. The enclosure
is dotted with dozens of queer little
dirt mounds, pierced each in the centre
by a craterlike opening. Each mound
marks the entrance to a prairie dog den
or hole,
If it is a fair day Mr. and Mrs. Dog
and from one to a dozen of their prog-
eny are to be seen sitting upright above
their subterranean homes, barking or
yelping at passersby or busily engaged
in extending the cleared areas that
mark their yards. It is interesting to
watch the droll little brown rodents—
for as such they are defined—at work
or at play. Their diligence, activity and
Vigilance and the sleek roundness of
them are all amusing. Harmless enough
they appear in their wire fence pen.
Yet down in the Southwest the
prairie dog has been officially declared
an enemy of mankind and a fierce pest
war is being carried on for his exter-
mination. All over west Texas, Okla-
homa, Kansas and New Mexico men
armed with pails of poison wheat and
cornare going about the mound villages
with which he has dotted the plains and
prairies spreading their kernels of
death. Prairie dog poisoning has be-
come an established business down
there.

Millions of dollars have been spent

by the ranchmen and farmers in their

effort to obliterate the little grass eat-
ing pest. Millions more will be spent
before the fight is over. From all in-
dications it is going to prove the cost-

Europe, while diplomats and consuls
have ordered them for official banquets
in Brazil, Australia, Cuba, Mexico,
Japan, China and the Philippines.

It might seem difficult to ship any-
thing so perishable as a cake decorated
with flowers of icing on a journey of
many thousands of miles across the
seas, but these cakes almost invariably
reach their destination without a blem-
ish to their first delicate beauty. This
is because of the skill with which they
are packed,

Mrs. Betty Lyle Wilson.

First the cake is wrapped in oil paper
to exclude the air, after which it is
glued with icing to the sides and bottom
of a white pasteboard box made espe-
cially to fit it. Next comes a tin box
made of exactly the right size, in which
it is soldered. It is row ready to be
wrapped in express paper and fastened
securely In a@ wooden frame with a
handle, Thus packed {it 1s practically
certain to reach its Journey's end as
fresh as though newly baked.

For the last twelve years Mrs, Wilson
has supplied the White House with its
cakes for special holiday and official oc-
casions, Last Christmas no fewer than
twelve cakes were shipped to Washing-
ton for the White House, the members
of the Cabinet and Washington diplo-
mats. These were suitably decorated in
holly and mistletoe. The White House

> Southwest's Fight on Prairie Dogs

liest pest war ever waged in the United
States. The reason is simple enough.
The prairie dog is the greatest destroyer
of grass and crops that the ranching
West has ever known.

It is estimated that an average of
ten dogs live in each hole, On this
basis the population of this particular
village would be 400,000,000 dogs, and
they would consume every year enough
grass to feed 1,600,000 cattle. That
is only one village. That's why the
region is up in arms against the harm-
less looking prairie dog.

The fight began in earnest about
eight years ago when the Texas Legis-
lature passed a law providing for the
extermination of the pest. Oklahoma
officially entered the lists through legis-
lative action a few years later. Kansas
has recognized the business, and agita-
tion is keen for the enactment of an
anti-prairie dog law in New Mexico.
The whole Southwest is lining up
against the lowly mound builder.

The dog poisoners maintain their own
outfits and work by contract. They
will bind themselves to clear the grass
destroyers on from one to a million
acres—the bigger the plot the better.
They will fix a time limit for their work
of destruction and provide for penalties
and forfeitures for every day elapsing
between the expiration of the contract
and its fulfilment. They will agree
to a refund. of stated sums for every
dog found after their gangs of poisoners
have passed over the grounds. That
is just how certain, stable and scientific
the business has become.

With his contract signed the dog pol-
soner moves into the affected terri-
tory with his outfit and goes to work.
His first concern is to survey the space
to be covered and divide it into dis-
tricts, each embracing suitable pro-
portions for a day's work of the poijson-
ing gang.

The chuck wagon, which carries the

  

 

cake for last Thanksgiving was espe-
clally attractive, being trimmed with a
wreath of Southern pumpkin vine with
little yellow pumpkins.

But cakes are not the only triumphs
that come from Mrs. Wilson's kitchen-
studio, Here are made blossoms of
candy delicately tinted and moulded.
Fruits and vegetables become rare
flowers, Sometimes a wealthy hostess
secures Mrs. Wilson's services to carry
some color scheme and decorative motif
throughout an entire menu. Then even

provisions, tents and bedding for the
members of the outfit, and the pois n
wagon, which carries the munitions «f
war—polsoned wheat or corn—sre
moved to the centre of the plot mark:
out for the day's work and made the
basis for operations. The poisoners, of
whom therc are from five to fifteen or
twenty in an outfit, work in each di-
rection from the camp, scattering their
poison from buckets and returning to
the poison wagon to replenish their
supplies when they have been ex-
hausted.

A spoonful of the poisoned grain {is
placed on each mound. Only a few
grains is needed to cause death, and as
a rule a dog will eat only a few grains
ata time. By the time the poisoners
have reached the boundaries of the plot
there is generally tangible evidence
of their labor closer in to the wagons in
the form of dead dogs.

On the following day the ground is
covered for a second time and new sup-
plies of poison spread for any dogs that

 

may have survived the first day's
rounds. On the third day the wagons
move to the centre of a new plot. Tha

earbon gang is left behind to comp):
the work. This they do by rolling burn-
ing carbon down into the dog holes
to burn up the alr breathed by Mr
Prairie Dog and the members of his
family and suffocate those that escapid
the poison,

After a sufficient territory has been
covered sharpshooters are sent out (n
horseback to hunt for any survivers
When the dog poisoners finally pull up
stakes and move to other fields the po,
ulation of the once prosperous villaces
is scattered indeed,
