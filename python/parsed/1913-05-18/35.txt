Again, the mistake {8 often made of
feeding, even after thirty-six to forty.
eight hours, a too heavy ration. It is

only natural that a weak chick can eel-
dom etand hear feeding when at a ten-
der age. Prevention and net curtng

try raiser, for cent, of all the
{lle of “chickhond’ ean be prevented. Thea
commercial chick feeds that are pur-
chased should be of the best grade and
contain not over 29 per cent. of corn,
The wheat bran, fed at five days of age
in hoppers, should be clean and dry. The
dry mash at ten days of age should cone
tatn the best bran, middiings, ground
oate, mealed alfalfa und beef scraps.
Mouldy corn fn the gseratch feed has often
caused great loss; mouldy bran and mid-
diinga have done the same, and in rare
cases a bad let of beef scraps has caused
a nigh death rate If the chicks get

The dreaded white diarrhea ts often

cured if taken in time, by first re-
moving the cause, cleaning up the
brooder, renewing tlie litter and feeding

do much to ston the diarrhea, Roiled
