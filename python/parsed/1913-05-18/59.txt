whom Paul Jones, even after the cruise
of the Ranger, was only “an inimoigrant
foreigner from the South.” The Massa-
chusetts navy was perhaps the most
efficient of any, but shared the general
fate in losing its best vessels, one of
them, together with one of the New
Ilampshire privateers, in the abortive
expedition of 1779 to drive the British
from Penobscot Bay, which Adams's

They did not much, but thes cast

prevented in by sectional
Jealoustes fa the Continental Congress,
which would have ruined the American
cause if ft had not been so plainly pre-
destined to succeed. Hardly any mem-
her of that Congress was free from
these dehilitating emotions. Some of
the most famous of the “fathers were
the most subject to them. The anna!s
of those times always indicate that
none of the Congresses of the sons was

Kut most of the State navy was sunk
in the endeavor to obstruct the channel
at the time of the second and successful
British attack on Charleston in 1780.
In fact the State navies did not answer
the purposes of their creation, They
did not defend their ooasts. They did
little harm to the enemy. What dam-
age was done was done by the com-
merce destroying of the privateers
which were what their name imported

Nor, tndeed, was the Continental
navy more efficient than the State
navies. Thirteen frigates were author-
ized in 1775. By the end of 1781 they
had all but one, the Trumbull, disap-
peared from the American navy list.
Most of them had been added to the
British navy list, having been caught
and given up for the most part with-
out a struggle, not In a single case with
so much of glory as attended the loss
of the Chesapeake in the next war.
The personnel of the navy was as in-
ferior as its material. There were
captains who showed promise, such as
Barry, Conyngham, Biddle and Nicnow
son, but none of them had a fair chance
to show what he could do, Those who
had such a chance showed that they
could do nothing. There was really
more credit to be got, as well as more
profit, out of privateering than out of
the regular naval service, The ap-
pointments to high rank were mainly
political jobs, Hopkins, the first com-
mander in chief, was the brother of
the chairman of the Marine Committee
of Congress, and highly incompetent, as
he promptly proceeded to show, Silas
Deane at Paris did what he could to
adulterate the navy 4s well as the army
with forelgn incompetents and em-
harrassed Congress In this department
also with his commitments. That ma-
lignant lunatic Pierre Landais was one
of Deane's selections. In the perform-

upon the act of Congress In 1842,
whereby $37,000 was appropriated for
settlement of the demands of Deane's
heirs, with a finding that the audit
tade by Arthur Lee as Commissioner
of Accounts in the eighteenth century,
the cause of Deane's downfall, was “ex
parte, erroneous and a gross injustice

to Silas Deane.” He seems to have
been in truth a very buman person
caught between the upper and the

nether millstones who suffered and was
soured by his hard experience.

Mr. Clark's opening chapters are bin-
graphical, and tell a good story well,
In 1762 Deane, born al®Groton, Decem-
ber 24, 1787, son of a blacksmith, and

fession to mercantile pursuits, began

substance who moulded his Colony’s
policy and course of resistance in the

tary of Connecticut's Committee of Cor-
respondence, and then to the Continental
Congress, where he quickly acquired

 

Some q. oted letters illuminate his gen-

best men of the time.

Practical expression was given to
this high regurd when at the beginning
of the war, with the Colonies utterly
unequipped for a struggle with the
forces of the British Empire, the Con-
sre secking thraugh its Committee of
Secret Correspondence to enlist’ Muro-
pean aid, commissioned the delegate
from Connecticut “to and into Mrance,

Colonies.” The commission carried a
very liberal grant of powers, imposed
# responsibilty and implied a
highly complimentary te the envoy.
It was stgned by Franklin, Benjamin
Harrison, John Dickinson, dohn Jay and
Robert Morris. The appointment was
the opening wedge for negotiations to-
the formation of an alliance
of vital Importance,

After the promulgation of the Decla-
ration of Independence a commission of
three members was sent openly
negotiate for a@ French alliance, and
the original appointees were Franklin,
Jefferson and Deane, who
formed well his secret assignment as a
procurer of military supplies.  Jeffer-
son declined the appointment and <Ar-
thur Lee, sixth son of Thomas Lee and
brother of Richard Henry Lee and
Vrancis Lightfoot Lee, the signer, took
his place, With that) appointment
Deane’s career of service was halted,
theugh for some time not visibly. The
story of the consummation of the treaty
negotiations ts a commonplace of history.

to strike a perfecily fair balance in his

As to Deane himself, he gained such
personal reparation as was possible
through the payment to his heirs in
1842 of a generous allowance for his
claims, The summary of arsuments
for and against his administration can-
not be wholly conclusive; therefore, as
