No series of the stamps of the United
ftates Was more difficult to obtain at one
time than the issue used in paying postage
pn newspapers and periodicals in bulk,
p ent of twenty-five varieties of which
prought $200 a few days ago,

The first series was issued in 1865, being
printed hy the National Bank Note Com-
any of this city, The stamps were rect-
angular, about 2 inches by 8%¢ inches, and
of the danominations of 5, 10 and 25 cents
each. They were hard to obtain by the
collector, and when cancelled, usually
J with a brush dipped in blue or black ink,

were almost rendered worthless for collec-

tion pi ir} 086s

Faw of them are now known in used
collections, The unused specimens are
quoted at $15 for the five cent blue stamp
with the portrait of Washington, $5 for the
ten cent blue green stamp showing Frank-
lin's portrait, and $5 for the carmine red
gtamp with the portrait of Lincoln.

The issue was discontinued in 1869, In
1875 a new series of newspaper stamps
was issued, being printed by the Continental
Bank Note Company of this city, The
siamps were not intended to be sold, but
were sed simply to paste in a post office
receipt book as postage was paid on bundles
of newspapers. Periodically the stubs
got the rec ‘eipt book containing the stamps
were sent to Washington for accounting
purposes then were destroyed.

Twenty-four different denominations
about 1!, by 1 inch were printed, being of
the value of 2, 8, 4, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, 24, 86, 48,
60, 72, 84 and 96 cents and $1.92, $3, $6, $9,
$12, $24, $36, $48 and $60. The first seven
were printed in black and showed the
figure of America after Crawford's statue
on the dome of the Capitol at Washington,
with the inscription “Newspapers” on the
Jeft and “Periodicals” on the right and
*U’, S. Postage” at the top, while at the
bottom corners were the figures of value,
the upper corners containing shields.

The next eight denominations were
printed in pink and showed the figure
of Justice. The colors and figures of the

other stamps were: $1.92, deep brown, vign-
ette of Ceres; $3, vermilion, Goddess of
Liberty; $6, light blue, Clio, the Muse of
History; $9, orange, Minerva; $12, green,
Vesta; $24, purplish slate, Goddess of Peace;
$96. dull red, figure representing Commerce;
$44, light brown, Hebe, and $60, rich purple,
Minnehaha,

All these stampe are now quoted at figures

much in excess of their face value, The
rarest of the fractional denominations is
the nine cent stamp, which is quoted at $10
in unused and $7.50 in used condition. The
higher denominations are held at from 50
to 100 per cent. over face value.

In 1879 a new issue Was made, the stamps
being printed by the American Bank Note

, Company of New York. The same desi
were continued, but the three and nin
cent stamps were discontinued. In 1885 ;
one cent stamp was issued and the three
cent stamp was revived.

The stamps of the 1879 issue are all held
at a substantial premium, the highest
_— being the $96, $48 and $60 denomina-
ions, which are quoted at $30, $35 and $45

‘2 respectively.

In 1894 @ new series was printed by the
Bureau of Engraving and Printing in the
' denominations of 1, 2, 3, 5, 10, 25 and 60
cents and $2, $5, $10, $20, $50 and $100.

. In May, 1897, a lot of newspaper stamps
advertised for sale was seized on the ground

that the stamps had been obtained im-
properly and that none of them should
ever leave the custody of the post office.

Some officials went so far as to assert that
collectors and dealers who held such stamps
did 80 in defiance of the law

Collectors and dealers joined forces in
defence of their right to own such stamps,
and the case was decided in their favor.
*On July 1, 1898, the newspaper stamps

were discontinued. Later 55,000 sete of

stamps which remained on hand and of
reprints were offered for sale to the public
at me rate of $5 a set. There were not
enough of the higher denominations left
mH tomake up one Sa Ae dre nate wore
sccordia made. The reprin were
chiefly of the $5, $10, $20, $50 and $100 values,
and are easily distinguished from the ori
nals by their color, the whiteness of the
paper and the gum. About half the sets
| were sold, and on February 10, 1900, the
remaining seta were destroyed.

The set of stamps referred to as paying
fold for $200 was almost unique. Instea
of showing perforated edges the stamps
are imperforate, with wide margins. They
were part of the collection of Charles Sutro
of San Francisco, and the set was one of the
five known “Probably two sete were de-
stroyed in the San Francisco fire of 1906,
and it is said that the two remaining sete
are owned by the San Francisco stamp col-
lector Henry J. Crocker.

It is not known what was the origin of
these imperforate stamps, but it is sup-
fond that they were made by the American

nk Note Company in 1894 when the Post-
master-General ordered the contractors
P} to deliver certain samples of stamps to

the Bureau of Printing and Engraving as
fuides for color, paper, &c., when the
lovernment took’ up the work of printing
its own stampa. All the guide sheets were
destroyed with the exception of a half
Fheet containing fifty stamps of each value
of the imperforate newspaper and peri-
edical stampa, which it is said passed into
the hands of a private person. Of these
slamps the private owner kept five sete
{n imperforate condition and had the re-
mainder perforated.

The private perforations led to an in-
vestigation, which resulted in the stamps
being seized, but they were later returned
to their original owner. The rare set oom-
Prises all the values from one cent to $69,
and includes the nine cent stamp, which
is the only one of this denomination to
bear the imprint of the American Bank
Note ¢ ompany.

Miraecnions Escapes of Men Entombed In

From Pearaon's Weekly,

A striking example of one among the many
Orange accidents that befall sailors was re-
Ported the other day from Newcastle, New
South Wales

The barkentine Kate Tatham turned turtle
in a gale, and one of her crew was shut up in
her hold. The survivors, who had climbed
on her kee] as she heeled over, @aturally took
!t for granted that he was drowned, What
was (neir surprise therefore presently to
hear faint knockings from beneath their
feet, evidently made by their imprisoned
comrade

ihe ship's bottom, when the man was hauled

COINS AND STAMPS.

T.S. V., New York City It is hard to say which
is the rarest American coin, The costliest \s the
Brasher gold doubloon, struck in this clty in 1787,
& specimen of which has brought 94,20, The
1804 dollar has n record premium of $3,600, and the
five dollar gold piece of 1822 has sold for $2,165.
Yet, notwithstanding the high premiums com
Manded by these coins, they are not the scarcest
American coins, for half a dozen specimens of the |
Orst and the second are known, and there are at
léast three specimens of the 1a22 half eagle

One of the rarest coins of American issue Is un
doubtedly the pattern ten cent plece of the Nova
Constellatio series, struck at the Instance of Gouver-
neur Morris in 1783. There were in the same series |
& plece of the denomination of five cents, known
a8 4 quint, and a piece of one cent. Hut while |
these may be considered among the rarest of the
AMerican coins, the premiums brought by them
at the last time they were offered for sale did not
approach the premium paid for either the doubloon
or the 1804 dollar.

 

|

¥.L. W., New Bedford, Mass.—Most of the eighty
two coins you ask about are common issues. The
collecting of the tokens issued by tradesmen, of
which your list contains a great many, is not fol-
lowed with much interest at the present time.
Very few of the United States bank tokens or those
issued during the civil war, variously known as the
Knickerbocker, Lindenmuller and army and navy
series, are worth more than face value, which
also applies ta the Canadian bank tokens, with rare
eiceptions, one of which Is the sideview Bank of
Montreal token of 1835, which has brought in the
neighborhood of $50, It would be best for you to
submit your coins to a dealer, who could give you
detailed Information regarding their value, as it
is quite possible that they may include a number
of rarities whieh are not indicated by a bare list.

E. J. C., Brootiyn.--The coins described by you
are two specimens of the series known as United
States bank tokens, and have relation to the att!
tude of President Andrew Jackson with respect
to the United States Bank, which was abolished
through his efforts. There are man y of these tokens
and they differ im small detalis, some of which have
great influence upon the value of the coin. Ordinary
Specimens are worth little more than face value
when struck in bronze or copper. When of brass
they have an increased value, which altogether
depends upon the variety. One of the rarest of
the series shows @ Liberty head surrounded by 4
wreath and thirteen stars, above which is the
motto "E Pluribus Unum.” On the reverse the in
scription reads “Millions for Defence, Not Onf Cent
for Tribute.” The error in the spelling of the word
“poe” and other trifling die variations caused this
pleee to bring $90 at a coin auction,

M, FE. B., New York City.—The rubbings for
warded by you represent an English sixpence of
George IV., which dealers sell for 85 cents in fine
and $1 in unciroulated condition. The head of this
plece was the work of the English engraver, WIll
fam Wyon; the Italian engraver, Pistrucel, de-
signer of the celebrated crown of George III.
which has been regarded as one of the most beautl-
ful coins ever engraved, refusing to execute the
work. The second coin is & ten-centesimo piece of
Victor Emmanuel II. of Italy, and the third a ten
centime piece of Emperor Napoleon Ill, The last
two command no premium,

$250 to $100 and upward. The list you enclose em-

The plece bearing the inscription, “Merchants Ex
change, Wall Street, Bullt 1827, Burnt 1888,” belongs
to the Hard Times series of United States tokens,
It Is sold by dealers at 25 cents in good condition
and $2 when uncirculated. The rest of the United
States coins you describe are common dates and
command no premium.

M. M. M., New York city,—Will you kindly tell
me the value of @ bill for $40, entitling the bearer to
receive this sum {n “Spanish milled dollars accord-
ing to 4 resolution of Congress, January 14, 1779."
The seal is “Deus Regnat Eauitet Terra.” The
second bill is issued as Continental currency for $5,
to be paid as above, on February %, 1777

This bill belongs to the last issue of Continental
currency, Ali the denominations now have an
equal value to the collector, and dealers sell a spect -
men irrespective of its printed value, at 25 cents
in fair and 50 cents when in fine condition, Notes
of the issue of 1777 are valued at the same figure as

the others.

B. J. M., New York ctty.—Kindly inform me
what Is the cofn of which | enclose @ rubbing and
its value

It ls a Spanish dollar, or eight real plece, or the
plece of eight, so much referred to in tales of the
Spanish Main, The bust is that of Charles III. of
Spain, and the coin was struck at the mint in the
city of Mexicp, as can be told by the mint mark
“Mo” after the word “Rex.” Formerly this dollar
was held at par value with the American dollar
and sometines was quoted at even a slight premium,
but since the depreciation in the value of sliver it
is worth barely halfas much. It doesnot command
much of @ premium even tn perfect condition.

W. F. L., Providence, R. I.—The list of cents en
closed in your letter does not Include any of the
scarce dates. Very few of the large copper cents
struck between 1818 and 1866, are held at much of a
premium, with the exception of certain varieties
that only an expert can distinguish. There is no
probability that the United States silver dollar
of 1884, struck at the San Francisco mint, will ever
become scarce. There is said to bea trade dollar
bearing the date of 1884, which would command a

quote the half dollar of 1808 at from 75 cents in

good to $1.75 in fine condition. The remainder of
the coins of which you submit descriptions are
held at po premium.

Anonymous, New York city. The plece of which | an

to commemorate the repeal of the Stamp Act of
1785, through the instrumentality of Mr. Pitt in
1766. The medal was designed by Paul Kevere of
Boston, and owing to the lack of small change tn
the colonies at this period, very frequently passed
as currency. The full inscription on the reverse
around the ship reads, “America Thanks to the
Friends of Liberty and Trade” An uncirculated
specimen brought $9.50 at one of the recent colin
euctions.

New Yors, Spring, 1008. Good Se We will Se at the HOTEL
MEURICE, Paris, for some time. Everybody who is anybody
now stays there, You know the old hotel was pulled down
altogether and the new one was opened last May. They say
the old MEURIOE was where the nobility and aristocracy
stayed when in Paris in the old days, and they are coming
back as fast as they can to the new MEURICE. When Mama
and I were there in the Spring, the Princess Henry of
Battenberg, sister of the King of England, stayed there
some time, and the King and Queen of Spain with the Prince
of the Asturias also stuyed there in October, The Hotel is
on the Rue de Rivoli overlooking the Tuileries Gardens, Our
windows had such a fine view of the Gardens and clear up
the Champs Elysees. The view of Paris from the roof garden
is simply grand. I have never seen any other Hotel so
quietly elegant in decoration and furnishing, while the RES-
TAURANT is said to be the best in Paris, and has become the
rendezvous of Fashion, There is nothing in the way of
comfort or luxury that one cannot find at the new MEURICE,.
