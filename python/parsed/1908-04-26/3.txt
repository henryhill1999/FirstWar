Dr. MeMackin and the Rev. J. D.
Lewis, secretaries to the Archbishop; Mgr.
McCready, Mgr. Carney, the Rev. Charles
Cassidy of Staten Island, the Rev. J. V.
Lennon, the Rev. M. J. Henry and Father
dohn Hughes of the Paulist Fathers. Among
the laymen were John Fox, president of
the Democratic Club and chairman of the
reception committees which greeted the
Cardinal; ex-Corporation Counsel John
Whalen, United States Indian Commis-
sioner M. FE. Bannin, Art Commissioner
John J. Boyle and Edwin J. MeGuire, presi-
dent of the Catholic Club

In addition to those mentioned there
were many other clergymen and well known
members of the Church and delegations
from the County Armagh Men's Associa-
fion, headed by their president, Michael
McShane, and of the County Louth Society,
led by their president, P. J. McDonald

The County Armagh men bore a large
gold, yellow and green banner, on which
were pictures of the Cardinal, the Arch-
bishop and St. Patrick's Cathedral, and the
motto: “Cead Miile Failthe,” which may
be translated: “One hundred
welcomes.”
the Battle of Yellow Ford, which was fought
vear Armagh in 1598

The batner and the Irish tunes which
the band from the Mission of the Immaculate
Virgin played kept up the spirits of the
delegation while the Isabel dodged about
in the fog trying to find Quarantine. The
little steamer, with her lrish and American
flags drooping in the mist, tied up at a
Staten Island dock long enough for the

) party to scurry ashore for a bite to eat, and

,

then began cruising around the can buoy
waiting for the fog to lift.

About 2 o'clock a puff of wind parted
the fog curtain and the long ptocession of
boats waiting outside began to come slowly
up to Quarantine. The Lucania was the
Tast of the line and there was another long
delay waiting for doctors and the revenue

titter. The feahe!, with her band plaving
all the catchy Lrish airs, sidled up to the
big liner and Archbishop Farley, several
other clergymen and a hoat of reporters
climbed on board the Lucania by means of
an extemporized gang plank made of a door
and a table lashed together

The Cardinal, a small stoop shouldered
man, whose ruddy cheeks make him look
younger than his 68 years in spite of hia
white hair, stood leaning on the rail. His
face lighted up with pleasure as Archbishop
Farley extended to him the greeting of
Catholic America

A custome officer detailed for the pur-

pose passed the baggage of the Cardinal's
yarty, but it was nearly an hour before the | her fronythe employment bureau
Cardinal was assisted along the improvised } pretty
gangplank to the upper deck of the Isabel,
which meanwhile hung on alongside the

Lucania while the band played “Killarney.”
Accompanying Cardinal
Most Rey. Robert Browne, Bishop of Cloyne;

the Rev. Michael Quinn, secretary to the

Cardinal and administrator of the Areh-

diocese of Armagh, and the Rev. W. F.

Browne, Bishop Browne's secretary

Bishop and his secretary live in Queens-

town, which is the seat of the see

The Cardinal, Archbishop Farley and
the rest of the party after landing on the
laabel's top deck had to make their way
through a narrow hatehway uncomfortably
near the walking bearh,
for some of the clergymen, but they made it
without accident and got safely below.

The Cardinal! was led to the forward part
of the Isabel's upper deck, where he eat

‘down and submitted gracefully to having
his picture taken by a squaa of camera men.
The photographing over, -ardinal Logue
received the priests in the welcoming dele-
gation. Each knelt reverently before him
and kiased the episcopal ring on his left
hand. ; ;

When the Cardinal had received the
homage of the prelates Archbishop Farle
led him to the rail and pointed out the ta!
buildings of the lower part of the city,
which were beginning to show through
the mist as the Isabel steamed around the
Battery and up the North River. His Em-
ineno> expressed polite surprise at the
bigness of things, and remarked:

“I suppose they are a necessity of the
life over here”

In an interview Cardinal Logue said that
he was not greatly im favor of Irishmen
coming to Amerca, or anywhere else, for
that matter He wished they would stay
in Ireland. Asked if there was any tend-
ency toward “moderniam” in religion in
Ireland, the Cardinal exclaimed: “Heaven
be press i, there is not!”

He said that no propaganda was under
way to win over Protestants in Ireland

to the Catholic faith. “The population
of Ireland is about 75 per cent. Catholics
and 25 per cent. Protestants,” said the
Cardinal, “and the proportions have been
practicaily unchanged for some tine,”

Industrial conditions in Iréland, the
Cardinal said, were not of the best. “Al-
though general conditions have improved
somewhat,” he added, “the conditions in
the south are poor. The United States
tariff is responsible. The people cannot
sell what they produce.”

The Cardinal said that the Irish were
not leaving lreland for the United States
in their usual numbers beeause of the belief
that hard times existed over here.

| Kagene Mansell, Worn With Work, Throws
| Himself From Lofty Window.

Eugene Munsell, a business man whose
inte extended to far parta of the world,
killed himself early yesterday morning by
throwing himself from a window of his
| apartment in the seventh story of the build-
| ing at the northeast corner of Seventy-
| second street and Amsterdam avenue,

Mr. Munsell was president of the Mica

Insulator Company, a New Jersey corpora-
tiom, with offices at 68 Church street. The
company is capitalized at $125,000. Mr.

Munsell was formerly in the stove business

at 218 Water street, where he succeeded

his father. He is said to havé been one of
| the first to take a keen interest in a business
way in the possibilities of mica, and he and
his associates developed a business which
| extended around the world. One of his
associates, Frank Brooke, died a year ago
in India, where he and Mr. Munsell were
looking into the company's business, and
the shook affected Mr. Munsell considerably.

Mr. Munsell was 56 years old, To add to the
strain upon him he had been obliged latterly
to look after the company's affairs almost
entirely alone, owing partly to the illness of
the company's treasurer, Lewis W. Kingsley.
When the business panic of last fall came
on he began to wo a t deal and
became a great eufferer from insomnia.
His friends said yesterday that there was
no real cause fot worry over his business,
Which was in ay excellent way.

His cousin, Runyan Pyatt, was quoted
as saying that he knew personally that Mr.
| Munsell's affairs were fo splendid shape

worked himself when so many of the duties
of the company devolved upon him and
had so upset himself that he could not get
enough sleep to preserve his health.
| Mrs, Munsell's wife was Harriet Wheeler,
widow of Alonzo Wheeler, Mrs, Munsell
was sitting up with her husband on Friday
hight. About 8 o’olock in the morning
he asked her to fetch him some milk and
urged her to get it herself, saying it would
taste all the better if she did and that he
didn't want the maid to bring it to him.
While Mre. Munsell was getting the milk
Mr. Munsell climbed out-of a window and
lunged to the sidewalk, seven stories
elow, Me. Munsell and her daughter,
| Margaret Wheeler, were seeking Mr. Mun-
sell in the different rooms of the apartment
and calling his name when his body was
found in the street.

| AMELIA BINGHAM LOSES BUTLER.

Got Him Before She Had Lost

Much Else.

Amelia Bingham, the actress, is looking
fora butler. She had one up to yesterday
morning, when a detective came and took
him away from her. The detective said
that Erickson—that was the butler's name—
was wanted for robbing Mrs. Bingham’s
sister-in-law, Mra. Charles Naething of
267, West Seventy-second street, of a set
of pool balls. Ericson had been employed
by Mra, Naething for exactly twelve hours
on January 4 last.

in Mra, Naething's billiard room there
was a set of ivory pool balls valued at $200
At least the aet wae there when Erickson,
known for the day as Harrison, went to
work. They were not to be found when
some one wanted to Play pool after dinner

neither was Harrison. The wolice were
told about it and ever since they have been
| Jooking for the man.

In the meantime it chanced that Mrs.
Bingham, who lives at 40 East Forty-firat
street, lost one butler and set about look-
ing for another. The one that =~ sent

ooked
ood to her and under the name

of Carl Erickson she took him on. FErick-

son, who is a Swede with only a little over:

a year's experience in America, proved to
be just the kind of man Mrs. Bingham
wanted until Yesterday, when Mrs. Naething
sent her maid to Mra. Bingham with a note,
The maid has a good memory for faces
and she hadn't the slightest doubt that the
smooth faced young man who opened
the door was Harrison. By another strange
coincidence Gallagher, a detective, hap-
pened to be at the front door at the same
time that the maid did. The maid recog-
nized him as the man who had come to
the house when Mrs. Naething sent for
the police

“There he is!" cried the maid and Gal-
lagher gathered in Erickson-Harrison.

jallagher had just learned from the
employment bureau that Mra? Bingham's
new butler answered the description of
the man he was looking for. He was lucky
to arrive at the very moment that Erickson
opened the door for the maid,

About $150 worth of goods was missing
from Mrs. Bingham's house.

“THE MERRY GO ROUND.”

New Show Prodaced at the Cirele With
Mabel Hite.

Gua Edwards, the unidigital Mozart of
the Alley, is the whole thing up at the Circle
Theatre now. He even has his picture on
the fana that are distributed to the audi-
ence. Gus has written all the music for a
new piece called “The Merry Go Round”
that was shown at the Circle last night.
Edgar Smith wrote the libretto. Paul
West wrote the lyrics. He was so proud
of some of them that he had them printed

| on the reverse side of the fans, Mrs. Brown-
| ing used to write some pretty bad rhymes
too
On the program the play was de-
scribed as “Two balmy breaths from Bo-
hemia.” Bohemia is sure a funny place.
Some say there isn't any @uch thing, in
spite of BClub. But here is *The Merry
Go Round” to prove them wrong. hemia
| is a movable spot, sometimes at Mineola,
| sometimes near Broadway and Thirty-
fourth street, and it is inhabited by James
| d. Morton, broilers, chorus men with laven-
| der socks, “the six dancing shrimps” and
| Mabel Hite.

Mabel didn't think it was awful at all,
though. She had a fine time telling about
the hit she made in Weehawken (which
rhymed with “talkin'’ and “walkin'’) and
imitating James J. Morton's story about
the salade. If you go to vaudovilie shows
you've heard about that salade. While
she was on the stage everybody had as good

| a time as she did. They had a pretty good
time also while James J. Morton was on.
He. used to be a vaudeville monologuer
paves he went in for “the legitimate.” He
| is yet.

| But at other times, when Miss Hite or

Mr, Morton were not on view, “The Me

Go Round” revolved at a somewhat tagabrl-
ous pace, while the band sawed at the
mechanical measures of . Edwards's
tunes. However, the show will be better
when it's brief it costa but a dollar;
and you can smok4] Miss Hite comes back

is just in from a journey that included
Columbus, Ohio; Buffalo, Ithaca, Orange,
N. J., and other places where barns are
stormed. Washington and Philadelphia
will see the club next and the “old grade”
will get theirs at Princeton on Commence-
ment day. :

It’s a simon pure college job, is “When
Congress Came to Princeton.” The only
person mixed up in it who's not entitled to
wave the Orange and Black is a chap who
playe the slide trombone in the orchestra,
and even he is getting on. When the com-
pAny opened its road tour at Columbus
this trombone person was inclined to think
there might be such a place as New Haven.
Now he can give the fooomotive cheer on
the slide trombone, and he says the only
real water in the world is in the Carnegie
Lake. ol

A tall young man named Roy 8. Duretine
‘08, was rather the hero of the murical
comedy. Or maybe he was the heroine.
Anyhow he wrote the book and appeared as
Kitty Kirke, the world’s tallest barmaid.
Thaddeus Gorecki, '07, put most of the
music together, while J. L. Scull, 00, acted
as head jinglesmith

It all happened in 1783 in a taproom and
onthe Princeton campus. Gen. Washington
himeelf made a majestic appearance that was
chiefly remarkable for the things he didn't
say or sing. This was just as well
would have been a trifle distressing had
anything like this oocurred:

Gen, Washington (Solus)— Ah, she promised

While [ am waiting [ will ging a little song
entitled “I loved her very dearly, but I
couldn't stand her ma.”

The plot of the show, following the
example of ita author, may be briefly dis-
| missed. It's all about a British apy who
| tries to kill a patriot, a young student who

| fs in love, a number of other students and
several young persons in skirts,together with
Kitty Kirke. Of course there are many
| “stage effects,” and some of them are very
Geative effects. There's a goode night
| song, with many candies and young person
| rons going upstairs to bed,and a first class
| ass Voice outpoured by Mr. Cass, ‘09,
with a great many metrical “good nights”
ooper and
music by

| from the pen of young Mr.
some mellifluous interpolated
A. H. Samuels, '09. ;

But Kitty Kirk and the eight show girls
are the principal pieces of resistance, The
show gir!s aré all robust damsels, but that’s
more or leas the fashion just at present
and football and track athletics do cer-
tainly affect a girl's figure. But there were
three or four shapely ankles in the collec-
tion and it's doubtful if you could see
any nattier lingerie in any white goods
department in town,

They gave D. H. McA. le, ‘08, the
toughest job in the piece. He had to make
frequent love to Brown Rolston, '10. To
be sure, Mr. Rolston wore a Dolly Varden
outfit, hid his face coquettishly behind a
‘fan and pirouetted at appropriate in-
tervals, but it's doubtful if these circum-
stances made it. much easier for Mr. Pyle
to tell Mr. Rolston that his eyes were like
midnight stare and that his mouth was the
abode of Cupid. But Mr. Pyle was game
and Mr. Rolston helpful, and go it all passed
off very well.

As for Kitty Burke, that was different.
Mr. Durstine made her a very pert and
saucy maid and he played her the same
way, only more so. Mr. Durstine in fact
is the possessor of a distinctly droll per-
sonality, and the ability to get it across the
footlights ia also his.

The Princeton collaborators realize the

; value of incidental business quite as much
as any of thé Broadway producers, The

| formula now in vogue in the musical com-
edy business is this: As soon as any of your
srincipals have sung a verse trot out a
Sunch of pretty girls in order totake the
minds of the auditors off the words and
music. All this, of course, means color, life
and action, and all these the Princeton show
possesses in abundance. The music as a
whole is really melodic, the scenery is pretty
and plentiful and life on the road has made
@verything move so smoothly that the
@10w girls will ogle friends in the front rows,
Oh, well —boys will be girls.

Bet ween acts one of the corridors became
a sort of green room, where swarms of the
show girls’ friends assembled to tell them
that they really would never have kaown
them. Encores were numerous, all the show
irls got stacks of flowers and everybody
fad the real good time attendant upon a
meritorious and instructive performance

MODMERS.

Shbew at Duriand'’s With Some Real and
Some Almost Animals.

The Little Mothers Aid Association gave
a circus last night at Durland’s Riding
Academy with many amateur and séveral
professional performers, Then there were
some real camels and a donkey and some
almost lions and a band wagon and a grand
parade and plenty of clowns and a pack
of hounds and Capt. Grimsgaard's high
school horse. The feature of the evening
outside of the. programmé and flower girls
was a half mile race between James P.
Sullivan, the mile champion, and Heather-
bloom, Jr. Sullivan got a handicap of
forty yards and beat the horse by a yard
and a half. The time was given out as
2:05. Then there were steeplechases and
flat races and rou riding and other riding,
and all the time there were the programme
girls in white dress gowns with mauve
sashes and the flower girls in white sailor
suite with red collars.

The seats and boxes were well filled and
a good sized sum was added to the bank
account of the association. And besides
the programme and flower girls there were
i and pink lemonade girls, and then
there were girls who weren't selling any-
thing but who just added to the picture.

to take it for granted that nature has allotted
to thém an extra portion of good weight.
‘They seem to enjoy the extra apportionment
of wobbly, strengthless fat. Asa matter
of fact they don't do anything of the kind.
Most of them would undergo hardship to
train down to a comfortable size and weight
and many of them have attem stren-
uous exercise and diet, but after a brief ex-
perience have returned to the old way. The

umane and modern method of losing
superfluous fat is to improve the asai

Aromatic, and 344 ounces Syrup Bimplen;

before bedtime. good di fill
