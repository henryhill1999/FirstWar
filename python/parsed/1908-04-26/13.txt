positicn ef sho political party now in con-
trol of the knelish Government, and fifa
goneral parliamentary election is in conse-
quence near at band the Brifish markets
will probably to a certain extent be tem-

porarily disturbed. Reporta of the mer-
cantilo agencies for the week made public
after the cloew of business yesterday were
commonly to tae ofect that while business
sentiment in tho country was measurably
improved no direct stimulus to trade was

as yet visible. ‘The weekly bank statement
was almost sensationally favorable. It re-
voaled an unexpected curtailment of bank
loans and an addition to the amount of

bank cash of over $10,000,000, bringing the
total figures of the bank surplus up to
$59,094,750, which is, it is needless fo say,
an extraordinarily high figure. Such an
increase in bank reserves despite the loss
by local institutions of over $6,000,000 in the
week through gold exports is the most
einphatio illustration yet afforded of the
existing plethora of money in the country.
In current expression of opinion credit is
commonly given for the stranger tone and
larger volume of transactions in the stock
inarket this week to the success of a0 many
recent bond offerings, principally the Penn-
sylvania Railroad's $40,000,000 issue, Up
toa little timeago il was practically impossi-
ble for the railroad companies to borrow
money atall Now they are easily negoti-
ating loana upon what is, all things con-
sidered, a very favorable basis ‘True, for
many of these loans security of the highest
class has been offered, auch as, in numerous
instances, either what is absolutely or sub-
stantially a first mortgage, but in many
vases railway notes have (een sold, and
the process indicates that investment of
money in the security market has once

more begun after having been stopped,

for a consiferable period. In the last
three weeks something like $200,000,000
ef new railway securities have either
been actually brought out or it is known
are on the point of being offered; and it
appears that all of these issues have been
readily sold, and in the case of the Penn-
sylvania bonds were heavily oversubscribed
for. This means necessarily that money
that has been resting in places of deposit
will once more be employed in the active
conduct of business operations; and al-
though the funds have not yet been applied
to this end, still the security market natu-
rally anticipates the fact. This tendency of
the stock market to discount a future gen-
eral resumption of business is something
that must not be loat sight of in a diagnosis
of the'Immediate financial situation. Two
years ago at this season there were no signa
of slackening trade, much less of a financial
panic; but the security market began to
give plain indications that .the general
situation was not as it should be. So on
the other hand the stock market will, almost
certainly and long’ béfore the business
world proper begins to feel a thrill of re-
newed life, foreshadow that happy event
by a rise in price# that will seem to guper-
ficial observers to be totally unjustified by
existing conditions. Beneficial as has been
the influence of easy noney in stimulating
investment, a cause of the improvement in
financial affaire equally potent and funda-
mental has been the great decisions of the
Supreme’ Court of the United States in
recent weeke that have made it plain to the
dullest understanding that the high judicial
tribunals of the country can be relied upon
to annul laws hastily passed in defiance of
just property rights. The stand taken
here by the Supreme Court has encouraged
confidence throughout the land in a striking
way. The failure of a prominent Wall
Street commission house, owing, as was
supposed, to lésing speculations for the
decline in values; the liquidation in the
cotton market which must have the effect
eventually of producing enlarged exports
of the commodity; the beginning of gold
shipments, anda rise in wheat prices despite
splendid crop conditions here, based upon
the strength of the foreign markets, com-
prised, with the taking on of new vigor by
the investinent market, what were upon the
whole a series of favorable developments

in Wall Street this week. There seemed to ;

-be less apprehension in the financial dia-
trict too than there bas been at any time
during the year conderning the immediate
course of our national political affairs.
