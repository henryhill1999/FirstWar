the lugher class collateral had been hypothe-
!, and the prospects are hot bfight
for the payinent of any large penentage of
the creditors’ claims. . \

Including the banking indebtedness’ the
abilities will run far in 6xcess of the $1,000,-
oo estimate made on I'riday.
they will amount to $1,000,000 in chims to
eustomers alone, but not even an dpprox-
nate estimate was attempted by te re-
ceivers yesterday, Claims were subnitted
ip continuous succession by personal hiter-
view and messenger, and there were recdved |
a uumber of telegrams and letters fom |
customers of the main and branch offices. |
Many of the customers demanded stocs |
which they said the firm had purchased fq
them or was carrying for their account.

It became known that the firm if?many
cases had gone short of stocks as ite cus-
tomers went long of them. From this fact
there arose a report that the firm had
bucketed orders given by customers for the
purchase of stock. A representative of the
frin denied flatly that there was truth in
the stories of bucketing orders. On the
other hand, he admitted that the firm had
committed a “technical violation” of Stock
Exchange rules in going short of the market
in the panic weeks, when money rates were
very high, in the expectation of buying in
stocks for customers subsequently. This
resource of the panio days subsequently
turned out to be very expensive, for when
stocks advanced one customer after another
demanded his stocks or his balance and the
firm was obliged to sacrifice block after
block of securities to meet its own short
commitments or the claims of customers

\pparently some of the partners, among
thern George C. Ryan of Syracuse, were
ignorant of the methods of conducting
transactions until matters came to a crisis
last week, The assets of the firm had, by
this time become nearly exhausted dnd
the _parieets were called together and
asked to raise additional] capital. After a
bitter altercation some of the partners
absolutely refused to go further and in-
sisted on an immediate suspension. John
4 Melntyre, Thomas A. Mclntyre’s
brother, joined with them in signing the
assignment, it was said, because he was the

lu bility on the firm's contracts

Theodore H. Price,
Thursday to have got the firm into his
recent deal in cotton, is a creditor, not a

debtor of the firm. Theamount of his claim |

is small and it was said that his operations

through the firm were not large at any |

time and that cotton was only in a small
measure responsible for the firm's pre-
dicament. The indebtedness to Cotton Ex.
change brokers will be about balanced by
the value of the exchange seat. The Stock
Exchange indebtedness, | owever, a repre-

sentative of the firm s&id, would prohablvex- |

ceed the value of the Stock Exchange mem-
bership, The amountof stuck bought in for
‘he firm under the rule, he seid, was over |
0,000 shares and the average loss two
points, or a tota] of $12),000 ard uoward.

Friction between Arthur A. Peck, the
awignee, and C. ©. Burlinghem, the re-
cewer, developed in the course of the day.
lt appeared that Mr4 Peck had been ap-
polrted assignee of a firm of five members,
which is the makeup of the Boston firm,
while Mr. Burlingham, whose appointment
as receiver in bankruptcy superseded the
assigiment, was appointed for the New
Yorks frm, which has seven members

Inu the afternoon Weljman, Giouch &
Smyth as ‘attor neys for Mr. Peck, went
before Judge Hough in the United States Dis-
trict Court and settled the controversy by
ening the ppreintqent of Mr. Peck as a
coreceiver with Mr. Burlinghom. ‘Ihe ap-
plication for hia appointinent was mnade on
the petition of three small creditors, Janes :
D. Shields, Charles A. Hubbe gud William |
J White, The attorneys represented to
the Court that Mr. Peck was thoroughly
familiar with the firm's business and that
thev represented Syracuse creditors, in
addition to those named, with aggregate
claims of more than $85,%0. The Syracuse
branch did more business than any of the
other branches, and the losses are heavier
there than in any other city, Mr. Peck was
Counected with the Syracuse branch. |

Neither T, A, MeIntyre nor any of the
other partners was in the office yesterday.
Mr Melntyre was repregented a8 in a con-
dition of complete co!lanse in his apartments
aid denied himself to all caliers except a
few intimates. Many friends sent him
messages of sympathy and profers of as- |

sis‘ance,\but one interesting telegram wes |
of an entirely diterent tenor. This waa
rom Arnold Lawson, who married Lucy

HAMILTON MABIE SO DECLARES
(T ALUMNA LUNCHEON.

 

Lack of Obedience to Parents One Cause,
He Says—Cologes, Especially Those
for Wemen, Ought to Teach Man-
ners—Work Not All in This Life.

Hamilton Mabie was the principal speaker
at the luncheon of the Elmira College Club,
which was held yesterday afternoon at the
Hotel Majestia His object was obviously
to instruct and advise rather than to enter-
tain the alumna, who sat behind of
daffodils, pansies and purple hyacinths,
reverently drinking in his every word.

He smiled pleasantly at them, but he
ddn't mince his words. America, he told
them, was the most lawless country in the
wold,

“% has,” he, said, “fifty times as many
maDaughters every year as bas any other
natio\ which pretends to be civilized, and
the cadition of things in Kentucky is abso-
lutely jrimitive. There are too more rail-
road actdents in the United States than in
any othei country. Why it is more danger-
ous to tr&e] from New York to San Fran-
cisco than \p be on the firing line in a battle.
Statistics prove it,”

This unplegant state of affairs is, he said,
the result of the fact that as a nation we
have no respeq for law.

The divorce ¢urt, he continued, was the
worst form of kwlessness and had a most
deleterious efectyupon the training of chil-
dren. The speak made a few remarks
about the spoiled American child which
caused the mothers present to sit up and
take notice, but he anitted that he thought
the German and Engl) methods of training
were a wee bit severe.

FLOODS KILL TEXAS CROPS,

But Planters and Stockmern’ Had Warning
In Time to Save Much Property.

Avetin, Tex., April 25.—The crests of
the floods in the Colorado and Brazos rivers
are now within 100 miles of the mouths of
these streams. The ample warning that
was given of the coming inundations gave
the planters and stockmen time to remove
much of their property.

The destruction of all the corn, cotton,
sugar cane and other crops which were grow-
ing in the bottoms is severely felt. At
Bastrop, Smithville, Lagrange and other
points along the lower course of the Col-
orado that streath reached high water
mark last night and it is still rising. The
river is falling rapidly at ‘Austin. The

very emphatically that it was al! right for a

“It is not,” he concluded, “the handling
