WORLD'S RECORD FOR DRAY |* OLOSE FINISH AT XAVIER MEET.

E. Gould Takes the Three Mile Ran by
One Foot Margin.

The Xavier A. A, held its annua! indoor
track meet last night at the Twenty-second
Regiment Armory, The best event of the
night was the three mile handicap, Eddy
Carr, an evergreen Xavier favorite, was the
scratch man, and as he sped around he was
cheered to the echo. |The handicaps were
too steep and he gave up after about two
and @ half miles. It proved the most excit-
ing sort of a finish between William E, Gould,
Xavier A. A., who had 60 yards, and W. C
Bailey of the New York A. C., who had 170
yards. Gould had a little more speed when
they straightened out for home, and he beat
the New York A. C, man by a foot.

John J, Hayes, who recently did such good

work in the Boston Marathon, started, but

ave B after a little while, It wasn't’the

ginent to let him start so soon after

the. (rane -five mile gruelling. He should
still be recuperating,

Pemapevpets, April °5.—Michigan run-
pers captared the lion's share of the laurels
at the Peansy!vania relay meet on Franklin
Field to-day, for the Wolverines went West
with the two and four mile tities. The longer
event theg won by default, as no Eastern col-
lege was unearthed with nerve enough to
tackle the Westerners. Inthe two miles Mich-
igan was opposed by Pennsy!vania, Princeton,
Columbia and Dartmouth, and for the first
relay it was a nice even contest, with Penn-

BROOKLYN, 4; NEW YORK (N. L.), 1.

These Brooklyns are no respecters of
persons, Here are our New York Nationale—
due for a pennant winning renaissance,
according to the horoscope, or in any event
to give the team that does win the pennant
a hard chase~—tripped up three times band
running by a team like the Brooklyns, Un-
paralleled audacity! Les& majesté, nothing
leas! Not only did the hardy and irreverent
Brooklyns polish off the New Yorks again
yesterday but again they played rings around
them, More than one honest rooter as he
left the Polo Grounds admitted that the New
Yorks were lucky to win one game of the
four from the epry and alert Donovanites

The Brooklyns went at the New Yorks
with confidence yesterday, ani although
the home tearm scored the first run the visitors
carried the fight to the locals so persistently
that the latter finally broke under the assault
and weakened in the last two innings. An-
other lefthander was in againet them,
Rucker was the man, He wae hit for four
singles in the firet three innings and never
a hit after that. The Brooklyns played a
smashing flelding game behind him, barring
a bad throw by Tim Jordan, without which
the New Yorks wouldn't have scored, Pattee
played brilliantly, He covered ground on
both sides of him in a regular Gilbertian
and Eversonian style, He stole three bases,
made'a run and made three hits.

Viltae pitched well too, but his goprort,
excellent for seven innings. collapsed in the
eighth. Bresnahan and Devlin made wild
throws in trying to fleld bunts that were
costly, The home team fiayge as if in the
air toward the close, and that after having
done some high cless playin up to that time
There was a lot of swift flelding, the Brook-
Ivns in that departinent and in inside work
playing after the manner of champions.

The first inning was one of thrills. After
Pattee had singled and moved up on Maloney's
sacrifice he saw that Devlin was pieying well
in on the eraas and he broke fort Bres-
nahan's throw was all right, but Pattee was
on the bag before Devlin could get back to
it. Devlin's drowsiness didn't cost anything,
as Burch hit a liner to Bridwell, who doubled
Pattee off third. In the second half Tenney
walked and Donlin singled. Both advanced
on Seymour's grounder to Pattee. The New
Yorks then tried some intricate base running
that had a screw loose in the system; either
that or Donlin just simply ran Tenney off. Ten-
ney and Donlin key ot the Prookiya inflelders

ng back and

forth, hut the ball was handled with such

evdid precision by the Brooklyn throwers

ae Tenney finally was collared at the plate,
Pattee to Rucker

Bresnahan singled in the second, was
caught papping by Rucker, but reachéd sec-
ond safely on Jordan's wide throw to Lewis.
He scored on an out and Bridwell’s short
single to centre. The Brook!yns hit the ball
but the flelding was too
enney made a superb play
He batted the latter's scorchin,

The Brooklyne failed to
score in the seventh inning because ghat were
intended for sacrifice hits were tuPned into
forve outs. Bul the Brooklyns were getting
more and more ageressive and in the eight
realized on their pugnacity

Rucker hammered a single to the right
feld fence. Pattee bunted. Bresnahan got
the ball and threw it several rods over Ten-
ney'shead. Rucker scored and the pernicious
Pattee went to second. He stole third and
eame home of Burch’é fly to Donlin, Donlin
made a beautiful return of the ball, but it
hadn't quite the distance to get Pattee. Bres-
nahan laced the ball back to Nicklin and
headed off Burch, who was ying to advance
onthe throwin, ‘The peg aging o both Donlin
and Bresnahan in this incident was fine, e, ape a
triple play came mighty near being mad

oe McGinnity went in the box in the ninth
bis first appearance here this year. He passed
Sheehan, the first man. Hummel bunted to
Devlin, who made aclean pickup and a orazy
fling. Sheehan danced home on Deviin‘s
frenzied throw, and Hummel went to third.
Ritter sent a fly to Seymour, which was so
deep that Hummel came the rest of the route

In a baseball game drawn out for fourteen

In the fourteenth, however, Yale took a turn
at rallying and caught the Columbia players |
sleeping, because although the New Havenites
were able to get only one hit off Lee in what
was the deciding inning they took advantage
