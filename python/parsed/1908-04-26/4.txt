AND CONDEMNS HIS SOUNDING
AN ALARM OF WAR.

 

Battieship Amendment Deféated on a Viva
Voce Vote, but Mr. Piles, Ite Author,
Demands and Secures a Reoonsidera-
tion, and Vote Will Be Taken Monday.

' Wasniwoton, April 256.—The Senate de-
voted another day to debating the naval
appropriation bill, Mr. Aldrich, who was
scheduled’ to open ‘the debate, waived his
privilege, and the battleship amendment
offered by Mr. Piles of Washington was
taken up and defeated on a viva vooe vote

ALDRICH ae

The matter was put through so promptly
and with #o littl ceremony that hardly a
Senator present was aware that the thing
was being done, and yet it was regular.
A moment later Mr, Piles came rushing
into the chamber and entered a protest on
acoount of the summary manner in which
his amendment for two additional battie-
ships. had been disposed of. He demanded
and after some parleying succeeded in
securing a reconsideration of the amend-
merit. The result was an ‘afternoon of de-
bate at times sensational.

Mr. Aldrich opened the discussion by
administering a severe rebuke’to Mr. Bever-
idge on account of that Senator's speech
of yesterday. He condemned the war
talk and declared that in hig opinion Mr,
Beveridge had no authority to speak for
the President in sounding an alarm of
impending trouble with a foreign nation.
Mr. Beveridge sharply resented Mr. ‘Ald-
rich's criticisms und deolared that he spoke
for nobody but himself and reminded the
Seriator from Rhode ‘Island that he was
misquoting him.

Mr, Hale. declared that Mre Aldrich was
right, and in the course of the debate Mr.
Beveridge’s book, “The Russian Advance,”
was referred to to prove that the Indiana
Senator was a poor prophet.

Lodge of Massachusetts followed

Idrich. He condemned the talk of
war as being most likely to precipitate
war. He said he had never as a member
of the Foreign Relations Committee heard
the slightest intimation from the executive
department that there was a single war
cloud on the horizon. He expressed his in-
tention of voting for the additional war-
ships recommended by the President, not
because he thought there was any danger
of war, but as the best means of securing
peace. Messrs. Burrows of Michigan and
McCumber of North Dakota both added
their regrets that Mr. Beveridge had made
such a belligerent speech. The debate
eontinued, Mr. Beveridge frequently in-
terrupting, in defence of himself, until nearly
6 o'clock, when Mr. Hale secured an agree-
ment that an adjournment be taken until
11 o'clock Monday morning and that a
vote be taken before the adjournment on
that day.

Mr. Aldrich opened the debate with an
Qttack on Senator Beveridge on account of
thespeech yesterday in which Mr, Beveridge

' hinted at a@serious situation in our diplo-

matic affairs known only tothe President,
who demanded the intrease in the number
of battleships.

“I deny that the Senator from Indiana
represented the President's views in this
matter,” suggested Mr. Aldrich. Mr.
Beveridge interrupted to explain what he
said yesterday. He declared that the
Congressional Record would not bear out
Mr. Aldrich’s statements.

Mr. Hale oorrected Mr. Beveridge, and
confirmed Mr. Aldrich. :

“here are other Senators here,” said Mr.
Hale, “who heard the Senator from In-

‘Mr. Beveridge subsided temporarily
with the remark that he did not, speak
forthe President or pretend‘ to have any
information from the President other than
was contained in hia message. He said
he would later print in the Record the ut-
terances of Senators on another occasion
concerning the relations of the United
States with a friendly nation which went far

abead of his mild utterances yesterday.
Referring to the 6 h of Senator Piles
yesterday, Mr. Aldrich said that Senator pre-

dicted that the Pacific ¢ Ocean would be the
storm centre of a great war.” Mr. Piles
denied that he said any @uch thing.
What he had said was that in the event of
another war with a foreign country “the
Pacitic would be the storm centre.”

“What | object to is the inainuation that
we are on the verge of a war with Japan,”
said Mr. ee, “4 it ©, shpard to

tinuing he said that the Senator from In-
diana (Mr. Roversaer)f and the Senator
von Ss vom n (Mr. Piles) wanted to try

This statement brought Mr. Piles to his

insisted that he had said in so many words

patriotic in opposing the measure as he

SEVEN REASONS AGAINST TAFT

PUT FORTH BY EX-SENATOR
CHANDLER OF NEW HAMPSHIRE.

SSMS

 

Says Negro and Labor Opposition, Federal
Activity, Use of Money, Obio Revolt,

| Shunting of Reform Legislation and
Racetrack Crusade Here Will Beat Him.

Concorr, N. W., April 25.—®x-Senator
William E. Chandler, one of the leading op-
ponents of a resolution preferring Taft at
the recent State convention, issued a state-
ment to-night giving seven reasons why
he thinks the Secretary of War is unavail-
able a8 a Presidential candidate The seven
reasons are;

*Firat—On account of the hostility of the
colored voters based: First, upon the
Brownsville incident; pecond, upon the
abandonment of the Fifteenth Amendment
the movement for which, made by the
Democrats in the Southern States, Secre-

tary Taft says ‘s in the rs direction, and
third, the exclusion of colored votera from
the Republican caucuses and conventions

in the Southern States, the organization of |

Lily White movements and the practical
destruction of the whole Republican party

at the South ag the policy of the present |

Administration.

*Second—The activity of the Federal
office holders, making the whole Taft move-
| ment primarily a movement of the present
holders of Federa! office, backed by the

Administration and pushed forward by its |

| direction

| *Third—The vast expenditure of money
in carrying on the canvass, largely that of

Charles P.
at $25,000,000, to be increased by large con-

wore from organized wealth, the same |

8s in 1004.

| ** Fourth The troubles in Ohio. In order |

| that Taft might be indorsed by the Republi- |

can State organization the State nomina-
| tions were delivered into the hands of the
loca! bosses in Cincinnati, Cleveland, Colum-
bus, Toledo and Dayton, Such nominations
were made that the Rep» blicans are in re-
volt against them, so that the State ticket
cannot be elected, nor the Presidential
*Fifth—The abandonment by the Admin-
istration of the reform legislation (1) for
| suppressing truste and (2) preventing rail-
| road extortion and crime, This is proved
by the two messages of the President,
one of January 31 denouncing the trusts,

and when that had done its work the mes- |

sage.of March 25 surrendering to the truste
in return for assistance in nominating Taft
and by an analysis of the Hepburn trust
bill (H. R. 10745) modifying the anti-trust
law of 1900 and the anti- pooling bill of 1887

“Sixth—The opposition to Taft of the labor
unions of the country, which seems nearly
universal. It may or may not be just, but t
exists and is ineradicable, and it ig tempt-
ing fate for the Republican party to make
Secretary Taft its one great leader in the
face of the organized labor unions of the
country.

“Seventh—There now comes a new and
special objection to Mr. Taft as a candi-
date, and that is the combination of his
supporters in New York State with the race-
track gamblers ied by William Barnes.
The movement is one toasorems the passage
of the anti-gambling bills,to destroy Gov,
Hughes as a Presidential candidate and to
place Secretary Taft in nomination as the
racetrack candidate for President. This
makes it impossible to New York for
Taft, so@hat with New York and Ohio
hopeless there oan be no reasonable ground
for expecting his election even apeiner Mr.
Bryan, much lees nst Gov. Johnson or
some stronger candidate whom the Demo-
crates of the country may unite upon.”

before adjournment pass a bill placing wood
pulp and print paper on the free list.

The |

ball was started rolling early in the day |

when President Herman Ridder, acoom-
panied by other members of the association,
called on Speaker Cannon. The Speaker

blames Mr. Ridder for most of the sentiment |

' that has been developed in the interest of
a wood pulp and print paper measure and |
* said to be wrothy in consequence. Mr.
Kidder called on Speaker Cannon to have a
conference, and it ia‘reported that it was

; one of the liveliest conferences that have
been held at the Capitol since Congress met
in December.
Cannon made this remark:

It culminated when Speaker |

“Ridder, you have branded me all over the

country as being a faker.
“The be eat Way for you to dispro ve that

inembers of the gaasociation showed up

not prepared forthe emergency.

D). N. D. Norris of the New York Times,
| KH. Boher of the Publishers Association,
Medill McCormick of the Chicago Tribune
} and Frank C, Noyes of the Caoago Tribune,
appeared before the House committee
Mr Norris made an argument on the price
of print paper, referring to conspiracies of
manufacturers. and attacking the poliey
of appointing the select committee at auc
aflate day in Congress as one that would
| result only in Carns the change of “con-
ditions now intolerable.”

Representative Miller of Kansas was
riled by the attack. He said the mistrust
of the committee was something that he
could not understand, and pointed to the
fact that he had said that if given an op-
portunity he would vote for the removal
of the tariff.

Chairman Mann interrupted Mr. Norris's
arguments by saying that the committee
did not want to make a “newspaper” report
to the House that it could contradict the

Finally the committee pinned Mr. Norris
down toa detailed description of what the
IN New York Times pays for its paper. He
said in 1906 the Times made a five year con-
} tract with the International Paper Company
by which it had secured paper for $38 a ton
until last October, Since then the price
had been in arbitration, He believed
| eventually that the Tim:« would have to
pay about $40 a ton, He said at present
publishers cannot get paper for lese than
$50 a ton, and that only on one year con-
tracte. ®
He was asked how much the price to the
publishers would be reduced by the removal
of the tariff. He replied at least $6. The
effect of such action, he said, would be to
ooerem the establishment of new mills
| in Canada to compete with those in the
United States.

“Why don't the newspaper men go into
the’manufacture of paper for themselves?”
Chairman Mann inquired “They seem
well organized.”

Mr Norris responded that

SMALL BOYS IN A FINE DRILL,

 

Appleton of the Seventh Reviews the
Hebrew Orphan Asylum Lads.

‘The boys of the Hebrew Orphan Asylum
murched into the big armory of the Seventh
Regiment last night at 7:30. At that hour |
the armory was already rapidly filling. |
At &:15 promptly, as becomes soldiers, the
boys filed out on the floor and prepared |
for their review by Col. Daniel Appleton. |
They did their best to outdrill their hosts,
and although they failed in this they lived
up to their reputation 8% being the best
drilled cadet corps in the State.

The boys are under the command of
“Colone|" Lionel J. Simmonds, who is the
assistant superintendent of the Asylum.
There were about 400 of them, ranging in
age from 10 to 14, and they made a fine
showing in their khaki uniforms.

The two battalions formed on the right
side of the armory and stoodat attention
while the band played popular airs. Pres-
ently a little fellow with hres white stripes |
on his arm stepped out a few paccsandina
loud voice summoned eight other lads who ,
saluted him with their guns, He then took ;
them around the floor, dropping one at
about every fifty feet until, to his evident
delight, he had to march all alone across
the big floor. Those eight little men tl
audience soon learned were “sentinels.” and
were there to keep peace and order among
the two thousand-odd grownups.

The marching in column formation was
excellent, and as one old Guardsman re-
marked; “Any soldier ought to be proud
to command a regiment like that.”. When
Col, Appleton and his staff inspected them,
which he did very closely, the diminutive
state of the boys was accentuated. The
smaller boys, mere babies, came only to
his waist, while the largor ones reached |
the medals on his chest. |

An amusing incident occurred when the |
boys got the “double quick" order and
passed Col, Appleton on the run. They al!
veoame 60 interested in their alignment
that they would have run him down had he
not retreated a few steps. When the field
music performed one had to leok twice to

see if it were really only twenty small boys
who were making all that noise and making |
it so well. They played as one man, and
when 7 had finished they were loudly |
