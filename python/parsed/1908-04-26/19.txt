The. all white lingerie frock is of course
the most practical of dainty and elaborate
cotton frocks, but while last year’ white
and even batistes had things their own
way, this season a host of fashionable
colorings are displayed in batistes, and
kindred materials and not only the delicate
blues and pinks but deeper tones, such as
raspberry, Copenhagen blue and smoke gray
are made up in batiate and lawn,

Some smart coloresl effects are achieved
also in the dotted swisses, and we havé seen
particularly pretty frocks of this material
in medium dark shades thickly eprinkled
with very tiny dots of:self color, white or
black, inset with clunyvinsertion matohing
the dot and worn over\elips of self color
or white. The straw oolorings, poagese
shades and other light yellow or brown
tones are especially popular in all of the
thin cotton stuffs and are always-cool look-
ing in combination with whtite,

A straw color swiss dotted at rather wide
interval#with wafer dots of' white, trimmed
in cluny and relieved by a knot or ecarf
girdle of gblack liberty and.a tiny cravat
bow of theysame black, was:one of the at-
tractive frocks ready to be sent home by
a fashionable uptown ‘dreasmaker*last Sat-
urday. Another deliciously cool looking
summer frock seen in the same establish-
ment was a very sheer silky tissue, -which

seemed to be one of the more expensive
mercerized cottons, though the dressmaker
alluded to it as a silk batiste. :

It was a cream striped in fine lines of
lettuce and was made over white. Very
narrow hems of plain lettuce green in
silky tissue similar to the dress material in
texture bordered all the edges, and the

| bodice was almost wholly of an exquisitely

fine openwork embroidery on white batiste,
combined with valenciennes, the striped
material being used only as a sort of scarf
drapery, bordered by the narrow green
hems and ornamented on its ends by inset
motife of openwork embroidery and lace.

This scarf ran from the short waist line
to the shoulders in the back, forming a V,
was draped low on the shoulders and then
brought down each side of the front, to
pase under the empire girdle and fall in two
long scarf ends almost to'the bottom of
the skirt on each aide of the front.

And, apropos of summery green and
white, than which nothing looks more crisp
and cool on hot days, we have seen a num-
ber of fetching models in this coloring,
chief among them being certain delectable
creations in sheer white lingerie on silken

tissues made cobwebby with valenciennes | .

and with or without very light touches of
cool green in hand embroidery. For wear
over these were sleeveless coats of the
green in soft silk orsatin, hand embroidered
or braided by hand, and knots of the green
silk were tucked among the lace of the
sleeves and skirt bottom.

The sleeveless coat,in silk, lace embroid-
ered net, or what one will, is to be a pic-
tureeque feature-of many a modish summer

toilet, being added for the eake of its
line and color rather than for additional
warmth, since it leaves the arms protected
only by the filmiest of sleeves,

A French model sold to one of the smart-
eat young matrons in New York was in a
white silk mousseline finely striped with
hair lines of black, and the silk coat was of
a delightful pinkish red somewhere 'twixt
rose du Barry and cerise. This coat was
soutached in self color, but had tiny reverse
of white silk braided in the finest of black
and white braid falling over larger revers
of plain black liberty and black satin but-
tons. A big black hat was to complete the
costume,

Bordered chiffons and mouseelines show-
ing yellowish browns and pinks’ or pink
and faded lavender tones in the bordure
designe are much favored by the French
designers, and these soft bordered stuffs
offer inspiration for experiments with the
tunio effects, which are so steadily gaining
ground and are so hopeless a problem to
the dressmaker who is not an artist. Any-
thing lovelier than the lines of the modish
drapery, provided it is skilfully executed,
it would be hard to imagine.

Even the Greeks themselves, while their
ideals of human form divine may have been
more rational than ours, did not show more
art in the handling of drapery than do the

soured; and yet there is a gracious ripple | Irish, though if women but understood it

and flow of soft, shimmering or fleecy
stuffs, and the fashionable events of the
Parisian season this year will show an
originality and an art value in costume far
beyond that of any recent years.

But these wonderfully draped frooks are
outside the sphere of ordinary dress. Only
the woman who can hire an artist to make
her clothes or buy imported models should
experiment with them; for with all their
deceitful air of simplicity they are mysteries
to the uninitiated or uninspired.

And, fortunately, though these draped
effects are the last word of fashion, it is
not necessary to adopt them in order to be
in step with La Mode. The skirt of un-
broken line is absolutely. correct provided
it has the required olinging lines, the
proper sheathlike moulding of the hips and
soft flowing, unstiffened lines below.

Excellent patterns for the various types
of sheath skirt may now be obtained from
the high olass makers of patterns; and,
by the way, if we may judge by our corre-
spondence, 'there seem to be a host of women
who have not grasped the fact that by
paying a few dollars one can get a carefully
prepared and accurate pattern cut to one’s
measures, and that it is not necessary to
trust to the cheaper patterns in stock sizes,
which may need innumerable changes and

cr

 

alterations. Various firms make the more
expensive patterns, and by their help
an ordinary dreasmaker can sometimes
achieve admirably Parisian results—of a
simple order.

A frock liké the white and black checked
voile of our sketch should not present
great difficulties to a maker, provided
she has patterns for a well fitted lining
and a good sheath skirt. The sleeve is
one already provided for by the pattern
makers and there is nothing difficult in the
construction of bodice and guimpe, yet
the whole frock is eminently chic. The
wide band of taffeta trimming the skirt is
in black, surmounted by a narrow fold of
nattier blue, the girdle is of black and the
fold encircling the guimpe ie of nattier
blue, and the guimpe is of embroidered net.

Upon the guimpe depends the cachet of
many &@ modish frock, and right here, as
bea beon eaid in these columns, the Ameri-
cafi dressmakers, slangily speaking, fall
down. Luckily, however, the vogue of
the fine sheer guimpe has brought about
@ better understanding of the subject, and
the imported models have not preached
their lessons quite in vain, for one sees
fewer of the overelaborated and coarse
guimpes even upon the cheap ready made
frocks, and the higher olass domestic
models aim more or less successfully at a
French sirnplicity.

The manufacturers of fine plain nete
must be having a runof prosperity, for such
nets are used, at least as the basis, in nine
modish guimpes out of ten. The fine
sheer laces are also much used and there is

always a place for the guimpe of real baby

this lace is almost invariably unbecoming
next the face.

For the wash frocks there are, of course,
pretty guimpes of valenolennes, cluny,
batiste, embroidery, but for the sheer
wool or silk, if really fine and handsome lace
cannot be chosen, and dften even when it
can, tucked net is the favorite choice. There
is, of course, a great difference in these
nets and there are innumerable cheap net
guimpes, but the fine nets speak for them-
selves.

 

CHECKERED WOOL AND TAFFETAS.

On the Frenoh frocks’ they are hand
tucked, and the added daintiness obtained
by this extra labor repays one for the
effort and time, but if one is not willing to
bother with hand tucking for an unpre-
tentious frock very fair tucked net may
be bought by the yard. The guimpe and
collar are, of course, fitted snugly over
silk mousseline or chiffon, and the practical
woman who expects to clean her guimpe
many times during the summer will find

that it pays to buy one of the more ex- |

pensive mousselines instead of the cheap
kinds generally selected for the purpose.

There is a mousseline which will even
stand washing and which will go throug!s
many cleanings§without: showing the wear
Some women object to it because it ia a
trifle lees sheer than the cheaper variety,
but it does not look heavy under the net
and ita durability is a decided advantage.

For the finish of the net collar and guimpe
some fine lace is usually needed, but charm-
ing little frocks are made with only a narrow
fold of white or color for a throat finish and
a double plaited frill of the net down the
front of the guimpe. One exquisite French
model in hand painted silk mousseline,
with draped skirt and bodice, had the
simplest of hand tucked net guimpes, the
collar finished by the narrowest possible
frill of real valenciennes.

There was a narrow double plaited frill
of net edged with the valenciennes down the
front, the two frills sewed together in a seam
down the middle, Down this seam were set
very tiny black satin’ buttons in groups
of three, and there was a little square bow
of black satin at the top of the frill. Any
one could make such a guimpe at slight
expense, and yet it was more French and

effective than many a more elaborate |

arrangement. :

A guimpe and collar veyy similar to this
one was of net, but along the top of the
collar and down the tiny hems of the plaited
frills ran lines of fine feather stitch in color,
Such individual notes of hand work as this
are often the secret of a frock’s success ard
yet may be achieved so easily by any one
who oan handle a needle.

The-same is true of many of the net
and lace bows, jabota and frills which are
the rage at the moment for wear with

low cut coats and which if really
such distressing’ sums when bought in
the shops. A little real valenciennes will
do wonders for one of these little accesso-
ries and is not an extravagant investment,
since it stands cleaning or laundering and
may be ripped off and used again and again.

Collar and cuffs of narrow real valen-
clennes insertion and dainty narrow em-
broidery beading set together by hand and
finished by frills of the narrowest real
valenciennes edging will give a certain
French air to the simplest of muslins, and
if a double frill of sheer lawn inset with the
insertion and bordered by the edging,with
a line of the beading to join the two narrow
frills, is added to the front of the tucked
blouse one may have an altogether charm-
ing summer morning frock which any seame
stress should be able to make, Even at
124 or 15 cente one can find charming
sprigged or dotted muslihs for such frooks.

Almost all the cotton and lingerie frocks
are of the one piece variety now, which
means that blouse and skirt, though ott
separately, are joined at the waist line
by some sort of waistband or girdle, the
leas conspicuous the better. In the simpler
frobks a line of embroidery insertion, lace,
beading or even a narfow band of the ma-
terial holds blouse and skirt together.

If lace is used cluny is preferable to valen-

strain. This fashion is, of course, worri- |
some for the laundress, since it is easier
to handle blouse and skirt separately, but
no one considers the laundering nowadays,
and besides many even of the cotton frocks
now go to the cleanser rather than to the
laundress.

For wear with these one piece frocks
slips of lawn or silk are needed, and no
summer outfit is complete without two or
three such slips, the more perfectly fitted
and hung the better for the frocks worn
over them, Such slips may be' bought
ready made in the shops in lawn, India silk,
and soft taffeta, but should be carefully
altered and fitted if one wants to secure
good lines in the sheer frocks worn over
them,

played by underwear in obtaining the
desired lines of to-day's fashions, and a
little more attention paid to the fit of corset,

The petticoats, drawers, corset covers,
&c., carelessly fitted and dragged in to
the required size by draw strings are an
abomination in the eyes of the fashionable
woman to-day, and it is practically im-
possible to wear an up to date frock well
unless one’s underwear fits emoothly.

Returning for a moment to the matter
of the slip for the one piece muslin frock,
some dressmakers avoid the necessity, in the

PLAIN AND STRIPED SILK.

The blue silk self trimmed coat of our
sketch is a case in point, as is the green
tussor braided all over in fine white sou-
tache. This idea of braiding an entire coat
of dark oolor in white or biscuit is popular
with several of the famous Paris makers,
and the reverse is sometimes tried, though
with much less pleasing effect, a costuine
of light colored material having a ovat
entirely braided in dark contrasting color

Combinations of striped and plain ma-
terials, the plain stuff soutached in the oolor
of the stripe, are among the imported cos-
tumes, but are usua'ly more bizarre than
admirable. The blue and white tussor of
our cut with its chains of tussor covered
cording and its Almée girdle was exces-
sively chic, but only the exceptional won @)
would wear it successfully.
