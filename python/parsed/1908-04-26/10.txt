Musurave, who rode four winners on Friday,
handied three More yesterday. His ride on
lack Atkin was a beauty and he came in

ich praise after he left the scales, The
voy also won the fifth race with Sadler and
he sixth with J, H. Reed, both of whom had
# much speed that Musgrave merely sat
will, tle was unplaced with Havre in the
opening event. G. Burns's ride on Rifleman
in the Queens County Handicap ” caused
wme criticisin by those who believed that
te took his horse too far back from the early
mce It is true that the pace set by Spooner,
‘ack Atkin and Restigouche was too fast for

forr

 

Rifeman, but Burns atlowed him to drop

‘ tack to last place on the far turn, and when

be hit the head of the stratch he was probably

a dozen lengths behind the leader, Rifle-

man's subsequent run to the wire showed

hat he had not been underestimated, and

there were many who declared that if Burns

tad made bis run sooner the Pessara colt

pg might have madé it decidedly more intereat-
ng for the winner,

The defeat of J, W. Colt's Thistledale in
the Glendale Steeplechase was an unex-
rected blow for the public. Tbla noted tim-
ber topper carried the crushing impost of
# pounds, and when Stone took him to the
font to make all the running it was quickly
predicted that Thistledale could not stick it
out. He had gone a mile and a half when he
began to show signs of weariness, and when
Sampson cut __Roe ket loose the latter was

odd feature of the betting on this event was

the place odds Thistledale was quoted at
