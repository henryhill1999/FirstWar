SLOW Ay, Bagine CITIZENS.

Government Provides Three Men and They
Can't Handle the Business.

“Why do you let us come to America
if you won't let us work after we get here?”
This and similar questions are put almost
daily to the clerk of the United States
naturalization bureau in this city. Such
inquiries and protests arise from the great
numbers of foreigners now seeking citizen-
ship papers and the small clerical facilities
furnished by the Government to supply

m.

At first glance it would appear to the
uninitiated that it was of no t moment
to the arerem amen to be delayed a week
or two or perhaps even a month in getting

a first papers. :
'o the unskilled laborer delay is not of
so vital importance as it is to the skilled
artisan who wishes to become a member
of a union. fT he first requisite for mem-
bership in a union is citizenship or the
possession of first papers.
For several weeks past the number of
applicants lined up in the corridors before
clerk's office has been steadily increas-
ing, Mr. Donovan and his two aasigtants
take as many in a day as they oan handle.
Only about ten days remain now to
those applying for full papers who desire
vote at the next Presidential election,
¢ law requires ninety days to elapse
a oe re Aye the actual
granting nal papers and the possessor
must hold them three months before he
can vote. For this reason many appli-
cants are in a fever heat to get their papers,
but as the work is being done a large num-
ber are doomed to disappointment.
