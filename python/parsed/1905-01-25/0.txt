NO TRUST GOODS IN ARKANSAS.

| The King Bill Makes It legal to Sell Them

-Hasiness Suffers Already.

Littit® Rock, Ark., Jan. 24.- The King-
Davis-Logan anti-trust bill is now a law
of Arkansas,and the State now occupies
the unique position of being the only State
in the Union with a Jaw so drastic that no
trust goods can be sold inthe State and no
insurance company can do business within
its borders if it is a member of any tr
combination or organization anywhere on
earth to control rates here or elsewhere

One of the first effects of the passage of
the act is the announcement by E, J. Bod-
man, secretary of the Little Rock Furniture
Manufacturing Company, that the
pany will abandon the project for the re-
building of its plant in this city recently
destroyed by fire. The company had a
payroll of about $1,000 a week, and this is
