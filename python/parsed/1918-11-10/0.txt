Reception of Delegates.

Panis, Nov. 9.-—- When the French
command received the German Head-
quarters wireless despatch announc-
ing the start of the armistice delega-
tion the delegates were directed to pre-
sent themselves between 8 and 10
o'clock Thursday night at a certain
point on La Capelle road. The cross-
road was clearly marked by the beams
of several searchlights. At the same
time the order was given in the French
lines that hostilities should be sus-
pended over a distance of several miles
in the region of the meeting place.

The three automobiles bearing the
German delegates arrived at 9:15 P. M.
ut the crossroad, preceded by a group
of German ploneers charged with mak-
ing the shell damaged road passable.
The German delegates were received by
officers whom Marshal Foch had sent

to guide them, ‘These officers got into |

the automobiles, and with the window
curtains drawn proceeded to the Cha-
teau Francfort !n Compiegne Forest, be-
longing to the Marquis De L'Aigle.
Owing to the lateness of the hour
the delegates were conducted
apartments assigned them, where they
took refreshments, The next morning
hey again entered the automobiles and
were taken to the station at Rethondes,
where they found Marshal Foch ‘na
special train in which he has his head-
quarters,

Ersberger Speaks in French.

When the Germans’ credentials had
been opened and verified, Mathias Erz-
berger, leader of the enemy delegation,
speaking in French, announced that the
German Government had been advised
by President Wilson that Marshal Foch
‘was quailfied to communicate to them
the Allies’ conditions and had appointed
them plenipotentiaries to take cogni-
zance of the terms and eventually sign
an armistice,

Marshal Foch then read the terms in’

a loud voice, dwelling upon each word.
The Germans were prepared by semi-

Sclal communications for the stipula-
Hons as a whole, but hearing set forth
n detat] the concrete demands seemed
to bring to them for the first time full
ealization of the extent of the German
defeat.

They made a few observations, merely
pointing out material difficulties stand-
ng in the way of carrying out some
juite secondary clauses. Then Erz-
berger asked for a suspension of hos-
‘lities in the interests of humanity, This
request Marshal Foch flatly refused,

The delegates, having obtained per:
mission to send a courier to Spa and
communicate with that place by wire-
‘ess, withdrew, Marshal Foch immedi-
utely wrote an account of the proceed-
ngs and sent them by an ald to Pre-
aler Clemenceau, who received them at
noon,

The German wireless message received in London this

The German Imperial Chancellor, Prince Max of
Baden, has issued the following decree:

The Kaiser and King has decided to renounce the
throne.

The Imperial Chancellor will remain in office until the :
questions connected with the abdication of the Kaiser, the a
renouncing by the Crown Prince of the throne of the Ger-
man Empire and of Prussia and the setting up of a regency
have been settled.

For the’ regency he intends to appoint Deputy Ebert as
‘Imperial Chancellor, and he proposes that a bill shall be
brought in for the establishment of a law providing for the
immediate promulgation of general suffrage and for a con-
stitutional German National Assembly, which will settle j
finally the future form of government of the German nation
and of those peoples which might be desirous of coming
within the empire.

THE IMPERIAL CHANCELLOR.

Berlin, November 9, 1918.

 

Prince Max Appeals to Germans Abroad.

Just before Prince Maximilian of Baden offered his
resignation as Imperial’Chancellor. he issued an appeal “To
Germans Abroad,” in which he said:

In these difficult days the hearts of many among you,
my fellow countrymen, who outside the frontier of the Ger-
man fatherland are surrounded by manifestations of
malicious joy and hatred, will be heavy. Do not despair of
the German people.

Our soldiers have fought to the last moment as heroically
as any army has ever done. The homeland has shown un-
precedented strength in suffering and endurance.

In the fifth year, abaadoned by its allies, the German
people could no longer wage war against the increasingly
superior forces.

The victory for which many had hoped has not been
granted to us. But the German people has won this still
greater victory over itself and its belief in the right of
might.

From this victory we shall draw new strength for the
hard time which faces us and on which you also can build.

Urges Nation to Be Calm Under Defeat.

In an earlier appeal to the German people, in which he

For more than four years the German nation, united
and calm, has endured the most severe sufferings and
sacrifices. If at this decisive hour, when only absolute
unity can avert from the entire German people great dan-
gers for its future, internal strength gives way, then the
consequences are unforeseeable.

An indispensable demand in these decisive hours, which
must be made by every people’s government, is the main-
tenance of the hitherto existing calm, under voluntary dis-
cipline. May every citizen be conscious of the high responsi-
bility toward this people in the fulfilment of their duty.

A telegram received at Copenhagen from Brunswick, by way of Berlin,
asserts that Emperor William's son-in-law, the Duke of Brunswick, and his
suecessor, have abdicated.
