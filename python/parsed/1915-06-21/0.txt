vost) Put on Train by Authorities—

fessors’ union, formed for the express
purpose of securing to university and
ec olege professors freedom of speech
and of protecting them against injustice
it the hands of unsympathetic boards of
trustees

This association, or union, bears the
name “The American Association ft
University Professors." It was organ-
ized at the beginning of this year In

 

| order to counteract what seemed to be

’ . nee of the counsel he case said Siegel
ing Total for Day | would take hie sentence, |

a dangerous growing tendency toward
ultra conservatism on the part of bodies
eentrolling the financtal destinies of uni-
versities and colleges and powerfully in-
fluential in directing their policies. The
Scott Nearing case in the University of
Vennsylvania, an exact example of what
the association is bound to fight, will
give the organization an opportunity to
display its mettle and test its influence.
It was admitted yesterday by Colum-
bia University professors connected with
the association that an investigation of
the Scott Nearing case cannot be avoided
by the association Its president ts
Prof. John Dewey of Columbia, who has

professors Prof. Dewey said yester-

as to the details of the differences be-
tween Dr, Nearing and the trustees of

{he had little doubt that such an inves-

Investigation Probable.
“I have Just heard of the dismissal
of Dr. Nearing, so I am not faniliar

with the particulars of the case,” said

 

   

Prof, Dewey “IT do not know Dr, Near-

g pers About a year ago l read
some «ar in Philadelphia papers
wich that his views id
methods were not liked by afl connected
with the university Rut I have noe
read oor heard any more tbout the

investigate the dismissal if the case is

man of Columbia, and the matter will

Prof, Seligman is spending his sum-
mer vacation at Lake Placid, N. Y., and
was not accessible vesterday by tele-
graph or by long distance telephone

Most of the Columbia professors in-
terview

 

“l vesterday made it instantly
plain that so
farts they believed a great injustice
had been done to Dr. Nearing personally
and a great blow struck at academic
freedom as well Many of them were
perfectly willing to discuss case with

their opinions me to about this, that
Dr. Nearing had been made the seape
goat by powerful financial and polltieal
interests upon whose good will the Uni-
versity of Pennsylvania is largely de-
pendent They were averse to being
quoted until after alf of the facts in
the case had been brought out by an
investigation

One of the most dist pro-
fessors of the Columbia faculty, one
widely known as an author, said that
it looked to him very much as if the
trustees of Pennevivania had done the
job wrongly It was obvious, he said
that {In the manner of his dismissal Dr
Nearing was not treated fairls There

Professors Entitled to Views.

A professor of a certain subject was

entitled, he contended, to hold the moat
radical and heretical views on that sub-
ject and to utter them freely while hold-
ing his chair That is perfectly consist
ent with academic freedom because, as
he put it, on his particular subject he
would be supposed to know what he was
talking about, Strange and unpleasant
is his views might be the presumption
must be in his favor Rut his specialty
is not sociology, for example; and if he
were to utter stariting and = repulsive
sociological opinions it would be no
breach of academic freedom for the
trustees to eject him from his chair. He
is not supposed to know any more about
sociology than the next man, he ex-
plained

There are many other factora which
require investigation to be settled, he
suid, and no man has a right to play
upon personalities or use improper
methods, for example Now there may
he personal reasons in any case of this
kind which will not appear at first, he
added, and they may be perfeetly proper
reasons too.

Hle said he knew of 2 recent case
where a board of trustees was extraor-
dinarily lenient with a teacher for three
yernrs Then he did) something more
and they beheaded him in a hurry, Now
they were as a matter of fact right, he
contended; but they chose the wrong
time and the wrong method They
ought to have fired him before, and
they ought not to have fred him in the
way they did, he argued
