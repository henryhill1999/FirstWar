The great art collection of Henry
Clay Frick, who died yesterday, to-
@ether with the house at Fifth avenue
and Seventieth street and the art gal-
lery adjoining, is given to the people
by the last will of Mr. Frick, which
will be filed for probate in a few days,

Mrs. Frick is to have the use of the
fesidence and its contents during her
life, and then they and all the noble
assembly of paintings, panels, bronzes,
porcelains ang other treasures will
pass to the city of New York for its
permanent enjoyment. The Frick res-
idence and gallery will become a public
art museum which will continue to
house the collections,

And to perfect’ the gift Mr, Frick
provided in‘his will for a large en-

»dowment, not only, for the mainte-

_ vance of the museum, and its master-

\dleces but for generous additions to
the collection as occasion and oppor-
tunity present themselves,

It is supposed that Mr. Frick spent
about $10,000,000 on the art objects,
which he brought together over a pe-
riod of many years from all parts of
the world. The present value it is im-
possible to estimate now; it probably
has increased.

Gary Tells of Bequest,
?

For several years {t has been he-
Heved that he would make public be-
quest of his art collection at least.
That he actually carried out this in-
tentlon and included his home as well
was made known yesterday by his
friends, Elbert H. Gary, J. Horace
Harding and others.

Mr. Harding supplemented Mr. Gary’s
@tatement by saying that Mr. Frick’s
home in New York, with its wonderful
contents will go to the city “and be
to this country what the Wallace col-
lection is to England.”

The Rev. Dr, Leighton Parks, rector
of St. Bartholomew's Protestant Epis-
copal Church, will conduct a funeral
service in Mr. Frick’s late residence at
6:30 o'clock this afternoon, Only mem-
bers of the family and a few close
friends will be present, Until 5:30 the
body will He in state. At 11:30 P. M
it will be placed aboard a special car
at the Pennsylvania station, to be taken
to Pittsburg, where a larger funeral
service will be held to-morrow morning
ard where the burial will take place.

Mr. Frick had been ill for about three
weeks, but his death, which occurred at
6:25 A. M. yesterday, was not expected.
A few weeks ago he played golf with
his only son, Childs Frick, at Roslyn,
L. IL Not long afterward he had an
attack of what was then thought to be
ptomaine poisoning, He.was seriously
ill, but In the past few days improve-
ment had been noted. Nevertheless he
was under constant observation. On
Monday night Oscar Rodgers, valet, was
at Mr. Frick’s bedside. ‘Mrs. Frick, her
son and daughter-in-law, Mr. and Mra
Childs Frick, and her daughter, Miss
Helen Frick, were in the house.

Asks for Glass of Water.

A little after 5 o’clock in the morning
Mr. Frick, half sitting in his bed, called
to the valet, “Oscar, get me a glass of
water.” The valet got the water, and
Mr. Frick after drinking said, “I think
I'll go to sleep.” . He sank back on the
Ppulow and a moment later seemed so
exhausted that the servant tried to rouse
him. Unable to do this, he called the
family. They summoned Dr. Lewis A.
Conner of 121 East Sixty-second street,
the attending physician. Dr. Conner ar-

rived soon, but Mr. Frick was beyond |

medical aid. Yesterday afternoon the
physician said:

“Mr. Frick for the last month has
shown symptoms of an organic affectior
of the heart, which presumably waa the
late result of the severe attacks of in-
flammatory rheumatism to which he was
subject in earlier life. He died suddenly
in the midst of what seemed to be a sat-
isfactory improvement in his condition.”

To this was added the statement of
John P. Grier, a broker, who was one of
Mr. Frick’s closest friends and who went
to the house in the morning and took
charge of the funera! arrangements.

“Mr. Frick had been {ll about three
weeks,’ Mr. Grier said. “Up to yes-
terday his condition had shown steady
Improvement. He wag sitting up yes-
terday when I talked to him. At the
Outset of his t!lness I think Mr. Frick
and some others thought he had
ptomaine poisoning. However, it was
his heart that gave out finally, and I
think the statement of Dr. Conner about

covers all we want to say in that re-|regard to the Valley of the Saar eight |

gard.”

Expected Turn for Worse,.

That Mr. Grier knew a turn for the
Worse might occur was Indicated by
the fact that he was to have gone to
Long Island yesterday morning, but
stayed in the city in orfer to be near
Mr. Frick. The news of Mr. Frick’s
death was telephoned to friends By his
secretary, Mise Alice Braitdell.
the first callers was Mr. Grier, who ts
a member of the firm of C. D. Barney
& Co. and was an adviser as well as
friend of the financler, Others who
Boon appeared were Dr. Parks, Elbert

Parts, Dec. 2,—Articles by Ray Stan-

by President Wilson at the Peace Con-

among French public men and diplo-

Wasuinocton, Dec. 2.—Within an

hour after Congress had realized that
the President had sent !n his annual
message without even suggesting a
|; course of action toward the German
{peace treaty the leaders of both
Houses were busy with independent
plans to restore the status of peace
by passing a joint resolution declar-
ing the war ended.

Amazement over the President's
omission to discuss the treaty or to
indicate even remotely his attitude to-
ward the existing situation was fol-
lowed quickly by a determination that
Congress must now take the Initiative.
Peace will be declared by legislative
process just as soon as possible, bar-

{ring the possibility that the President
shall veto the resolution declaring the
status of peace,

The President's omission of the sub-
ject was made the more striking because
in regard to the railroad problem he
promised to communicate his views later.
He did not intimate such a purpose as
that in regard to the international prob-

Pierre, 8. D, Dec. 2.——The 1920 na-

day by delegates to State conventions
of the Republican and Democratic
parties, Preferences for the nomina-
tions for President and Vice-President
of the United States were designated
and platforms adopted.

The Republican convention Indorsed
Major-Gen. Leonard Wood for Presi-
dent and Gov. Calvin Coolidge of Mas-
sachusetts for Vice-President. The
Democrats indorsed President Wilson
and Vice-President Marshall for re-
nomination for a third term,

In the Republican convention the
candidacies of Gen. Wood and Gov.
Frank O. Lowden of Illinois caused a
protracted contest. The candidacy of
United States Senator Miles Poindex-
ter (Wash.), who made vigorous ef-
forts yesterday to head off the boom
for Major-Gen. Wood, was not pre-
sented, and the Senator was inactive.

The county delegations cast their vote
as representing their party's voting
strength in the last State election, On
this basis Maj.-Gen, Wood received
28,599 votes while Gov. Lowden ¢ot
16,442. The majority required for a

Skilled Men to Receive $8 a

A plan which alms at permanent
tranquillity in the building industry
and at increased building in this city
was reached yesterday at a meeting
between representatives of the Build-
ing Trades Employers Association and
the New York Building Trades Council
when there was drawn up an agree-
ment fixing the rate of wages for all
building mechanics and doing awa
with strikes for the next two years,

The agreement before it can become
effective will require the signatures of
officials of forty-one labor unions com-
prised within the building trades
council and it is likely that a few
changes will be necessary in the body
of the agreement before al] the or-
ganizations to become a party to it
will be fully satisfied. ‘As it stands,
however, it is the work of a series of
conferences which have had it under
advisement for five weeks and no one
in the building Industry doubts but
that it will go through substantially as
drawn up.

The agreement, which in a preamblo
states that it is to be entered into “to
secure continuity of employment and un-
interrupted production,” sets forth In its
first clause that for the next two years
the working week shall be forty-four
hours long, and in its second quotes the
rate of wages for various mechanics,

Anti-Wilson Article Forbidden,

About the same time the Echo de
Paris had prepared an article giving the
figures of the Congressional elections in
November, 1918, when the Republicans
gainea control of Congress, with the idea
of giving warning to France and her
allies that President Wilson did not
speak with the mandate of his country-
men. The publication of this article was
forbidden by the French Government be-

| cause of @ complaint made by the PreSi-
dent's secretary, according to statements
made very recently to THE SUN corre-
spondent by officials of the French For-
cign Office,

The publication In the Paris Midi
to-day, commenting upon the articles by
Baker, says:

“The writer of these articles under-
takes to demonstrate to his compatriots
the grand role that President Wilson
played in Paris, and upon this point
every Eurorean will agree, but to dem-
onstrate it there is no need to imagine
all kinds of dack plots oer which Presi-
dent Wilson triumphed with a heroism
worthy of King Arthur’s Round Table.
For this, in fact, is what Baker tries to
do in the guise of writing comment,

The George Washington Coup.

“He affirms, for example, and without
laughing, that he knows an official note
wag sent by the French Government to
the French newspapers recommending
that they publish matter from the United
States calculated to weaken the author-
ity bf President Wilson, Everyone, pure
‘ or evil minded, must know that so far
|from attempting this abominable thing

the French Government during the
Feace Conference more often refrained
from giving the least direction to the

 

ess.

“Baker digcovers also a sinister con-
nection between the attitude of Premier
Clemenceau on reparations and articles
which appeared in the Echo de Paris,
| which never could be accused of helping
ithe Government. In April the Tempe
declared that the French no longer
jwiched to annex German territory.
Baker {In his office in the Hotel Crillon
thereupon constructs a beautiful ro-
mance that the French Government had
dictated this article and had done it be-
cause President Wilson had sent for
the transport George Washington to
come to Brest.

“Baker assumes that this order for
the George Washington chained French
imperialism and that without. it all
| would have been lost. This was the
igreat coup of the good Knight of the
iRound Table of Paris. If Mr. Baker
|wil) return here and wishes to know
! some of the real secrets of the confer-
ence we will tell him something to sur-
prise him.” ~~
| ‘The writer in Paris Midi then de “ees
| that France had accepted the decision

 

 

days before the George Washington was
sent for. On other points he calls as
witnesses against Baker leading writers
on prominent papers {n London, Paris
jand New York, including the editor of
| the London Times.

mittee on Foreign Relations met with

whole question, They were in session

two hours.

Senator Moses (N. H.) was delegated
to confer with the Republican managers
of the House regarding the outlook for
passing forthwith a resolution declaring
a state of peace to exist. Tho resolution
comes over from the last session, but
to-day’s consideration determined that
{it should be changed from a concur-
rent to a joint resolution. . This will re-

quire the signature of the President. A
jeint resolution, if passed, vetoed and
then passed over the veto, will have the
force of legislative action, and it was
| deemed best to put it in this form,
The Republican Senators’ conference
}could not reach final determinations be-
cause some members were absent, but
}those who met were agreed that the
| joint resolution should be pressed as
j soon as possible and that both houses
should be put at work on ft. Senator
Moses, after discussing the situation
; with Republican Leader Mondell
(Wyo.), reported that managers there
believed they will be able to pass the
measure {in short order,

 

Cloture Rule to Be Amended,

In anticipation of the need for mea-
sures to force’ quick action proposals
were made to-day for amendment of
the cloture rule of the Senate, The
operation of the present rule during the
last days of the treaty’s consideration
last session was not highly satisfactory
and. to-day Senator Curtis (Kan.), the
Republican whip, served notice that
he will introduce an amendment. This
will provide that after five days debate
on a question any Senator may move
; that debate be limited. If this be
; adopted by a majority vote, not to ex-
ceed three hours additional debate shall
be permitted.

Senator Kellogg (Minn.) {s sponsoring
another plan. After three days of un-
restricted discussion of a question he
would make it possible to adopt a limita-
tion rule by which no Senator should
have more than an hour more on the
question and all amendments to It;
provided also that no single Senator
should be entitled to a total of more
than six hours In the debate both before
and after the adoption of the limitation.

These proposals are in Ilne with the
determination to enable the upper cham.
ber to transact the vast amount of busi!-
ness before It.

ron to capacity at Selwyn Theatre.—adv,

The message was received by the’
Senate in amazed silence. Not a ripple
of enthusiasm or applause was at-|
tempted or apparently thought of even
by the usually Irrepressible galleries.
The Senators sat in stony silence
throughout. In the House a handful
of Democrats tried three or four
times to arouse the House to
applause and cheering and their re-
peated efforts brought out in strong
rellef the complete apathy of Con-
gress generally tcward a message

i covered a variety of subjects, The |
proposed budget system, the railroads, |
taxes, the foreign trade situation, aid}
for returned soldiers, protection of |
infant industries, aid to farmers, po-|
litical unrest, extension of the provie |
sions of the food control act, enact- |
ment of a cold storage law, regulation |
of large profits, a programme for labor
and a warning to radicals of the,
country, were all touched upon.

More of the message was devoted to}
the situation of labor at present than!
to any other single subject. In his'
message Mr. Wilson says that a def-
inite programme to bring about an
improvement in the conditions of labor |
is absolutely essential. Instead of fol-|
lowing this with an outline of his ideas |
which the members had hoped would
be a specific programme instead of a

| repetition of generalities to which Con-:
| Sress has been treated before, |

There was amazement in the Senate!
that the peace treaty was not touched)
upon except very lightly as it affects
the international labor situation. There
was even more amazement thst the}
acute Mexican situation ss not
deemed to be wort' y of a single word
in the President’s communication to
Congress. |

Two reasons were advanced for the!

cold reception Congress gave the mes- |
sage—its specious and general nature,
and a doubt in some quarters that
the President is the author of any
considerable part of it. There was!
no doubt, of course, that the entire
message received the President's ap-|
proval before it went to the printer's,

hands,

Way to Industrial Peace.

All of the demands of labor are eh-
tirely fair, the message said. Then Mr. |
Wilson, reverting to his League of Na-|
tions project, deciared that the principles
laid down there “offer us the way to in-
¢ustrial peace and conciliation.” In Mr.
Wilson's opinion “no other road les open |
to us.”

Taking the other tack, the message
then states that capital Is entitled to the |
protection of the Government in every!
emergency. What was generally inter- |
rreted as a half apology for securing the
injunction at Indianapolis against the
coal miners followed in these words:

The right of individuals to strike is
inviolate and ought not to be inter-
fered with by any process of Govern-
ment, but there is a predominant
right of the Government to protect all
of its people and to assert its power
and majesty against the challenge of
any class. The Government when it
asserts that right seeks not to an-
tagonize a class but simply to defend
the right of the whole people as
against the irreparable harm and in-
jury that might be done by the at-
tempt by any class to usurp a power
that only Government itself has a
eight to exercise as a protection to all.
The President touched upon the rail-|

road problem only to say that it would
be made the subject of a future commu-
nication, His remarks on the advisability
of a budget system have been uttered by
him seyera! times before.

Problem of Taxes, |

Touching taxes, the President appar-
ently has ylelded at last to the indigna-|
tion of business generally at being tied |
up with the complicated tariffs of the
Kitchin Fevenue bill, The message to-
day recommended to Congress that these
taxes be simplified. Amendmentg to
the Kitchin law will be forthcoming!
from the Secretary of the Treasury and
the Commission of Internal Revenue, |
the message said, which have the en-|
tire approval of the President. How-:
ever, the President does not want taxes

Features of Rival Platforms.

The League of Nations covenant was
indorsed in the opposing platforms along
the lines that the struggle over it has
taken in the Senate. The Democrats ap-
proved the covenant as it stood. The

‘Republicans indorsed the covenant, but |
| with reservations

that “will tend to
safeguard the integrity of the nation
and preserve the Monroe Doctrine.”
The substance of the Democratic plat-
form on national issues was an unre-
served indorsement of President Wilson
and his Administration. It voiced a call
for a vigorous policy of Americanization,
The Republicans condemned the Wil-
son administration and raised several
specific issues. The platform denounces
the unreasonable demands of both oper-
ators and miners in the coal strike, asks
for provision for the training of immi-
grants in. American principles, recom-
mends generous compensation for war
veterans, demands the return of the
railroads to their owners at an early’
date and recommends Federal legislation
to prevent speculation In gratin.

Representative Carl W. Riddick of

He said they were beginning to talk
about Presidential candidates in Mon-
tana, but that sentiment had not crystal-
lized on any one man.

“There is some sentiment for Gen.
Wood,” he declared, “and some for Gov.

idea seems to be that we should send
an uninstructed delegation to the na-
tional convention.”

Mr. Riddick mentioned no other can-
didates, although Senator Miles Poin-
dexter, from an adajoining State, fis an
avowed candidate. He was asked spe-
cifically if there was any sentiment for
Senator Hiram Johnson of California.

“We think highly of him,” was the
reply, “but not as @ Presidential candi-

Another clause near the top of the
agreement arranges that there shall be
no overtime work except In emergencies,
and then only by permission of the two
main organizations signatory to the
agreement, The next three clauses deal
with the settlement of disputes between
employers and employees and with the
elimination of strikes:

“The unions as a whole, or as a single
union, shall not order any strike against
a member of the Building Trades Em-
ployers Association, nor shall any mem-
ber of the association lock out its em-
ployees. And should any union or the
members of any union violate this pro-
vision it shall not be cogsidered a coun-

} State. The coal will be billed directly y

of Coldwater, Kan., where the temper-
ature is in keeping with the name of
the town. More coal will be available
for shipment to-morrow and each suc-
ceeding day.

Gov. Allen announced that the coal
would be distributed through the
Mayors of the various cities in the

to the Mayors and sold by them to the
consumers in small lots in an effort
to give temporary relief all around.

On the other hand, it shall be deemed

freight steamship Kerwood, from New
York for Hamburg, has struck a mine off
Terschelling, an island in the North Sea,

 

A Lioyds despatch from Amsterdam

assistance of the Kerwood returned and
reported that she had seen nothing. It
was on Monday that the Kerwood sent
a wireless announcing that she had
struck # mine aad Was In distress,

WOMEN’S VOTE UP IN ITALY.

Modified Bill Is Expected to Pass
New Chamber,

Rome, Dec, 2.—The bill passed by the
Chamber last September granting wom-
en the right to vote and also hold office
became null in consequence of the
closure of the Legislature making the
approval of the Senate impossible.

The bill must, therefore, be again pre-
sented to the new Chamber and go
threugh all the different stages of par-
lMamentary procedure. It is probable It
will be notified, with the result, that It
will perhaps grant the women the right
to vote but not to hold office.

not members of 4a/ first coal before the picks of the vol-|

 

northeast of Pittsburg, yielded the:

unteers. The first pick was struck at.
9 o'clock !n the morning and from that!
time on the work continued without}
abatement. The weather was miser-
able enough to have closed the pit in}
ordinary circumstances, for a pit mine’
isa disagreeable place to work at any |
time,

 

‘Let's Got” Their Slogan,

But the volunteers were not discour-
aged. It was their first night for sleep-
ing In tents, and they washed their faces
this morning in ice cold water, ate}
breakfast bundled up in overcoats, ol
muffs and gloves and shouted out the
slogan; ‘Let's go.”

The men went into the pits under al-
most insurmountable difficulties. The;
dirt walls of the pits were frozen solid.
At the bottom were treacherous reaches
of ice and thinly frozen pools of water.
There was only one way to get from
top to bottom—sit down, slide and pray. |
More th&n one of the workers reached |
the pit bottom miore on his head than
his feet, but he came up smiling.

The men couldn't use the shovel for
a couple of hours. The pipes were frozen
stif? One crew of workers built a fire,
uncolled the pipe and unfroze it, length
by length. Another group grabbed picks
and shovels and walked to the furthest
corner of the pit.

“Let's go, gang,” called Lewis A,
Hasty, a Wichita lawyer and ex-Captaln |
in the army. “Let's go,” the gang re-|
sponded, |

A moment later shovelsful of coal, the!
coal that Kansas needed, were rattling}
in the bottoms of the dump cars.

 

 

Action Is Untechnical,

One dump car was filled and pushed
out of the way. Another was started
on. Then the work of the men attracted
the attention of the pit boss, who has |
had years of experience in strip pit min-}
ing. The boss regarded the ction a

 

Hasty’s crew as enthusiastic but un-
technical.

“Retter walt until we get the shovel |
working,” he cautioned. “We can go?
faster then.”

“Wait nothing,” the workers replied.
“We can keep warm this way. It all
helps that much.”

The boss admitted they were right.

“Gee, though, boys,” he sald, “they
don’t do things that way in the union.”

While two or three gangs of men
were at one end of the pit digging coal |
other crews were getting the shovel in
shape, getting the tipple running, get-
ting everything set to push some finished
cars of coal out of Pittsburg to-night.
Their spirit was unbertable

It is army life that the volunteers at
the Wilson mine are living, but the)

Special Despatch to Tun Sun,

Wasuinoton, Dec. 2.—Bunkering of
all foreign ships in American ports is
to be stopped at midnight on Friday
and passenger train service on rall-
roads is to be curtailed as necessary
measures to consefve the nation’s.
scant fuel supply.

Further restrictive measures are to
be put into effect as rapidly as be-
comes necessary to save the American
people from physical suffering. It wag
stated to-day that an encouraging re-
sponse has been received from the ré-'
quest issued last night for a stoppage
of all non-essential uses of heat, light
and power,

Through the West, where thé pinch
of acute coal famine is being felt, local
committees and municipalities are put-
ting into effect a stringent conserva-
tion policy. In some communities the-
atres, schools and churches have been
closed to save coal,

Response in Eastern communities has
not been so prompt, but Federal officials
directing the situation are prepared to
walt a reasonable time for voluntary
compliance with the request before is-
suing rigid orders to be universally ap-
plied. Such orders are to be avoided if
possible because of the hardships
through. inequalities they worked dur-
ing the war,

Confusion Over Garfield Order,

Some confusion has arisen as to the
application of the statement fssued by
Dr. Harry A. Garfield, the Fuol Admin-
Istrator, through dts publication in sev~-
eral papers as an order. Interpretation
Wag. asked. All interpretation ts to be
leit to the various communities of the
country and the statement expressly in-
vited local authorities to take charge,

Regional directors of railroads and
their distribution organizations will con-
tinue to furnish coal only for essential

uses, Utilities are warned that they
will get only sufficient fuel to generate
heat, light and power for essential uses,
Unless they cooperate with their patrons

and cut out non-essential uses they will
find themselves without fuel or only suf-
ficient to heat places of abode and to

furnish transportation, street lights and
essential industries or Institutions,
Representatives of the national asso-
elation of the motion picture industry,
under the wing of Ovcar A. Price, for-
mer assistant to the Director-General of
Railroads, conferred with Director-
General Hines and urged against the
closing of the theatres of the country.
Mr. Price said the theatres were a

mighty Influence for good in the present
state of unrest and afforded a whole-
some gathering place for the people of
every community of the country.

Theatres, he pointed out, were
economical fuel users, as fires were not
made until noon and were banked at 6
o’clock, great audiences serving to heat
themselves. He expressed the belief
that it would be a mistake to close the
theatres and huddle the people of the
urban communities tn their homes.

The fullest cooperation of all motion
picture theatres and producers in put-
ting forth the conservative programme
was pledged. Slides will be used to
educate the public and illustrate meth-
ods of fuel saving.

Not to Close Movies Yet,

Mr. Hines assured the motion picture
men that no action by the Federal! Gov-
ernment to close the theatres was con-
templated at this time.

Mr. Hines issued his statement to-
night:

With a view to the further con-
servation of coal regional direce
tors of the Railroad Administration
have been instructed to review the
situation carefully and have been
authorized to eliminate passenger
trains that can be spared with the
least inconvenience to the public,

This means a curtailment of service

In all regions through the consolidation
of trains. Commuting service will be af-
fected, it is said, only where consolida-

tion will not reduce accommodations
below the necessary margin. It is pos-
sible that some through passenger trains
may. be consolidated, particularly on

runs like that between New York and
Washington and New York and Chicago.
