JOCKEY MCTH FATALLY HURT,

Thrown at Aqueduct by Lady Ellison and
His Skull Fractured,
The sport at Aqueduct yesterday was

marred by What was probably a fatal accident
in the seeond race, William Muth, a four-

teon-year-old boy, weighing 89 pounds, was |

thrown from the back of C. R. Ellison's mar
lady Ellison, and was taken to St. Mary/s
Hospital, Jamaica, Where he was said to be
at the point of death, suffering from a fracture
of the skull. The race was for jockeys thai
had never ridden a winner and a green lot of
youngsters climbed into the saddles,

Muth, who had been riding now and then
to gain experience, was rushing along with
lady Ellison near the front, when the mare

| suddenly crossed her feet and fell headlong.

Muth turned a double somersault over her
head and struck the fence rail with terrific
momentum. He fell apparently lifeless to
the track, while hundreds of women cried out
in alarm and turned away faint and weeping.

| Stable boys hurried to the spot where the

little fellow lay and @ hurry call was sent for
the Blarter’s wagon, which was driven at full
speed across the infleld. When Muth was
picked up he was bleeding from several gashes
on the face and head, and was in such a dan-
gerous condition that he was driven post
haste to the hospital, where the physicians
said last night that there was little or no hope
for him.

Thes) races for “maiden jockeys" have
been regular features at all of the metropoli-
tan tracks, the idea in putting therm on being
that they would afford chances for inex-
perienced boys to become good jockeys.
But, as a matter of fact, they have not been
fair betting propositions and have really
been amenace to the lives and limbs of the
youngsters. Another boy, Krause, who rode
Jane Holly in this unfortunate event, had a
narrow escape when his mount jumped on
the heels of a horse in front of her, then
stumbled and finally bolted to the outside
of the track. Zeigler, who rede the winner,
Yorkshire Lad, is the midget who was put up,
on Israelite by Boots Durnell the other day,
when that horse, a prohibitive favorite, was
left at the post.

John W. Gates paid a visit to the track and

“

 

 

found picking winners a most difficult task. |

He began by dropping a fat Wager on Platoon,
but got his money back, and some more to
boot, on Yorkshire Lad in the second event,
Ile was reputed to have bet on both Kinley-
dale and Flip Flap in the third and took Eu-
venia Bureh in the fourth. Gates backed
faxnar,in the fifth, and wound up by drop-
ping $4,500 on Proposer in the last .

‘Tne Schatfer-Meyer confederacy had a
killing framed with Elie, a four-year-old
gelding by ot. Carlo—Jude, in the secoad
event. They got some 50 to 1 at the start and
by the time the horses got to the post, 10 to 1
was the best price offered, The confed-
eracy also bet extensively on the erratic Pather
Catchem in the Babylon at 30 to 1, but the
colt, after showing a world of easy speed,
stopped.

Frank Tyler will leave for a trip to Texas
on Sunday,and during the rest of the Aque-
duet meeting his brother, “the Colonel,”
will handle the slate aud the chalk as the
leader of the non-members in the front line,

Bob Smith and his friends cleaned up
handsomely with Cambridge in the last race,
The Star Shoot colt was backed from 8 down
playing
But the winnings
on Cambridge made up for the money lost
ou Maxnar, who was badly beaten in the
Smith colors in the fifth event,

A manu who refused to give his hame, came
within a few inches of being kicked to death
by Ormonde's Right in the paddock before
the fourth race, The man was standing
close to the Ormonde colt's stall when the
horse suddenly let fly both heels. One of
them grazed the man’s elbow while the other
barely touched his watch chain, It is need-
less to say that the man hurried from the
paddock without further delay.

Flip Flap was picked by nearly all the

handicappers to win the Babylon Handicap, |

| ag she was in receipt of nineteen pounds from

Jacobite and five from Kinlydale. Flip Flap,
it will be ramembered, was oue of the choices
for the Futurity. She was bumped about
at the start which may haye been the means
of causing her defeat, as she was less than a
Jength and a half behind the winner when
the wire was reabhed. Previous winners
the Babylon were St. Finnan, Reveille
and Oxford.

Free Booter, owned by Johnny Payne of
Lexington and trained by Frank Weir, was
a tip in the firet race, the odds droppin
from 20 to 12. James Robertson had a sinal
bet across the boards on his Clifford colt,
Col. White, at 50, 20 and 8, while a number
of the paddock sharps played the colt to
show.

Andrew Miller and his club house asso-
ciates did not bet on Incantation, the winner
of the first raee, the price receding from 5
to 1 to 10. =

William Cahill had a good bet on Yada,
who has been a_ profitable bread winner
for the blac ksmith this fall.

Latonia to-day. Cherlpe was practically the only
favorite to win. The Rennert Handicap was won
by Bobble Kean, a second choice. At the drop of
the barrier Crimmins plied his whip and sent the
Kean horse to the frortt, and although Wishard
tried hard with Peter Paul, the favorite, the lead

was too great and Bobble Kean won by three

BAD NEWS FOOLS THE TALENT,

ELECTION DAY HANDICAP
AT ODDS OF 20:-TO 1.

WINS

 

Kinley Dale Takes the Babylon for Paget
~—Ineantation and Yada Come Home
at Long Odds—Big Crowd at Aque-
duct Sees Four Favorites Defeated.

A crowd that Jammed both grand stand
and clubhouse and swarmed all over the lawn
attended the races at Aqueduct yesterday,
where favorites were beaten with painful regu-
larity and long shots held a carnival. An
excellent fleld went to the post for the Election
Day Handicap, for allages, one mile anda fur-
long. Eugenia Burch, the top weight in
actual pounds, was made alukewarm favorite
at 14 to 5, and with better racing luck and a
more vigorous ride from O'Neill she could
not have lost. As it was, after getting away
80 poorly that she seémed to have no chance
in the first three-quarters of a mile, she came
on through the long stretch and ran second
to Bad News, a neglected 20 to 1 shot, who
beat the famous mare by a length in 1:54.
Bad News, according to the sharps, could not
go the distance with 116 pounds on his back,
but he fooled them all by running his best
race of the season. Burch, under a flerce
drive, managed to take the place from Miss
Crawford, 7 to 1, the early pacemaker, who
was ridden in a hustling manner by Miller
from start to finish, Coy Maid was a length
and a half away, with Alma Dufour, a good
thing, under a fruitless whipping for the last
quarter of a mile, coming home in fifth posi-
tion. Sidney C, Love was the leader at the
last furlong pole, but he backed up; so did
Ormonde's Right, inthe Paget colors, and St.
Bellane,@ho had too much of a burden.

The Babylon Handicap, tor two-year-olds,
six furlongs, went to Sydney Paget's Wiuley-
dale, who was coupled with Jacovite, the top
weight, at4to 5, Jacobite was always back
in the ruck, but Shaw put upa magnificent
ride on Kinleydale, and took the race by a
head from Tony Aste's Hooray, 12 to 1, with
J. A. Bennet's Flip Flap, 3 to 1, third, a length
back, Hooray set a lust pace, attended by
Father Catchem, a 30 to 1 shot, who died in
the mniddle of the stretch, This duel took
enough stamina out of Hooray to enable
Kinleydale to nail him when Shaw cut loose,
The race was run in 1313 4-5.

With the publie and all of the big bettors
backing Plitoon, 8 to 5, favorite, in the first
race, for three-year-olds, six furlongs, Miller
surprised the talent by scoring with Andrew
Miller's Incantation, a 10 to Lb shot, who fairly
walked home a halt a dozen lengths bei
James Robertson's Col. White, 59 to 1, with
Platoon, three lengths away, just beating
Belle Stromea head torthird money, Platoon

 

 

got off poorly and had too many obstacles to
contend with to be successful, The time was
1°18 2-5.

Jockeys that had never ridden a winner
had the mounts in the second race, for platers,
a mile and a@ sixteenth, Yorkshire Lad,
7 to 5 favorite, came home on the bit, with
Zeigler up, while, eight lengths behind, The
Huguenot, 16 to 5, took the place from Elie,
backed from 50 down to 10, by four lengths.
Jane Holly was interfered with on the back
stretch and Lady Ellison fell on the far turn,
The race was run itt 149 2-5.

The smart players entirely overlooked
William Cahill’s Yada, at 15 to 1, and this

ood three-year-old was victorious in the

fth event, at a mile. McDaniel rode him
in brilliant style, Yada passing the judges a
length in front of William Astor Chanler's
Novena, also 15 to 1, Norbury, 7 to 1, was

 

third, and then ran away for two tniles,
Maxnar, the favorite, was shut off in the
early scramble, and go Was Subtle. Cannon

Ball led for a half a mile, The race was run
in 1:41.

A barrel of money was lost on Sam Wag-
ner’s Proposer in the last race, for maiden
two-year-olds, six and a half furlongs. He
was off poorly and never made up the lost

round, R.A. Smith's Cambridge, backed
down to 4, landed the coin in handy style
by a length and a half, with Billy Banastar,
7 tol, beating Isadaisy, 15 to 1, by two lengths
for the place, The time was 1:22, bour

IN THE FOOTBALL WORLD.

TOUCHING ON THE QUESTION OF
WHO 18 THE BEST PLAYER.

 

 

Close Race for the Honor Between Shevlin
and Eckersall—Columbia Denies the
Charge of Rough Play in the Gamo
With Wale—Practice of the Elevens.

Who is the best football player in the
country? One way at which to arrive at an
opinion on this subject is to consider which
man playa his position best; another, to con-
sider Which combines to the most extent foot-
ball brains with the necessary physical quall-
ficaffons; still another, to deal with the ques-
tion from the standpoint of the greatest all
f@round ability. And the question of the
player's value as a unit in team work cannot
be overlooked, Football brains, or instinct,
or whatever one [sa mind to call it, the knack
of being able to cope with emergencies on
tho fleld and if necessary assert individuality
and get away from the requirements of a cut
and dried policy, are mental qhalifications
without whioh no footballist could ever be
considered in the best class. One difficulty
{n arriving at,a conolusion is that much of
the very best work in football is done in the
line, Where it does not come under general

observation, as does the work of the backs, |

who'sometimes get all the glory when the
forwards do all the work.

Shevlin, the Yale end and captain, comes
pretty near being tho best football player
in the East. Blessed with a physique that
makes him not only very strong but very
fast, he is also a player who tises his head
to good purpose, He has shown ability
aga leader, and while sensible enough to follow
out the polley of the coaches and advisers,
has just the right amount of self dependence
to make whatever departures are neces-
sary to deal with situations that cannot pos-
sibly be foreseen, In short, ho has football
instinct\is not so well pleased with himself
as not to abide by the advice of older and
wiser heads, but yet has enough assertive-
ness to handle situations when they are up
to him. Defensively and offensively he is the
best end in the country and by his individual
ability is conspicuous in every game. Te.
knows when to take a chance and when to
cling religiously to orthodox tactics, He is
one of eleven or an individual as the occasion
roquires, In addition to all this he comes
as near being an all around player as any
football player. He has played tackle and
fullback with success and is heavy enough
to play guard or centre in a pinch. Then
again, his all around ability in his position
is equalled by few contemporaries, whether
they be ends or what not. Whether carrying
the ball, breaking up plays, tackling or gevting
down under kicks he does them all well,

Hurley, the Harvard halfback and captain;
Cooney, the Princeton tackle and captain;
Stevenson, the Pennsylvania quarterback,
and Eekersall, the Chicago quarterback, are
other players whose work makes them worthy
of consideration Hurley knows the vame
from A to Z, plays the halfback position
first-class style, is thoroughly game and ine
as much out of his position as any player inthe
country, Cooney, like all of the other men
mentioned, is greatly in evidence in gates,
and that because his high grade play ar-
rantsit. Heisa fighter, like all of the oth 7
and aman whose natural attaininents on the

   

  

checkerboard jake him an inspiration for
others to do their best. He may not be as
good an all around man as some, but his spirit

and his proficieney as a tackle put him in the
first rank of players

Stevenson is @ great plaver in his position.
His generalship, betokening instinctive Knowl-
edge of the game, and his individual prowess,
making him at all times dangerous to the
other side, and his ability to get work out ot
put him in the top notch class
needs to acquire
better control of his feelings before he can be
classed as the best. Eeckersall, while a small
man, i8 as good a quarterback as football
ever produced, if not the best. He is a won-
dertul kicker, swift runner, fine dodger, good
general, sure tackler. ‘To call him great is
not layingit on too thick. Heisanimportant
factor at all times, as much so as any other
one man in football, despite his ecom-
varative small size, and it is close between
nim and Shevlin as to which is the best player
in the country.

The Columbia football players rested yes-
terday and as it was a college holiday there
were few of them at the training Quarters.
Such of them as heard the stories from New
Haven that Yale would not play Columbia
again because of deliberate rough work by
the local eleven in last Saturday's
said that they did not believe that ar
eharges ever came Trom the Yale of
themselves. They declared that there nad
been no such dirty play and that Columbia
had few opportunities to make resistance of
any effectiial kind against Yale's attack.

The players will resume work this fternoon
and all are in good condition, ‘This is cred-
ited to the fine work of Trainer Webb, who
hus brought the squad through flye succes-
sive hard games in good shape. This is the
first season that Columbia has had a first class
and effective trainer, and there is more than @
little satisfaction with “Mother” Webb.

The Boys’ High School of Brooklyn yes-
terday at Washington Park defeated Erasmus
Hall High School bywa seore of 88 tou. By
the saaitlt of this game Bova’ High is entitled
to meet “Poly Prep.” on Thankégiving Day
for the championship of the Long Island
Interscholastic League, The victors, who
have been coached by Ferner, centre of the
Dartmouth team of last year, gave the Fras-
mians nochance. Inthe first half the winners
scored only 5 points, but in the concluding
period they broke through the weak spots
in easy style and rolled up 28 points.

 
 

 

 

 

New York University beat Rutgers by ascore
of 10to7 yesterday, The New York team was
vastly superior to the visitors, but its score
was kept down by frequent fumbling, Both
of Rutgers’s scores came asthe direct result

of poor passes by Centre Rabenold of New |

In one case Rutgers got the ball on
and in the other Wilson had
to fall on the ball behind his own line, New
York's scores came as the result of terrifie
line bucking in the second half, the tandein
formation being used,

New Haven, Nov. 7.—On acenint of the
crippled condition of many of the Yale varsity
football squad to-day the practice in seeret
was not long nor was a great deal of scriminag-
ing done, Some new formations were worked
out and they seemed to “go” in a mater
satisfactory to the coaches,

No agreement has been reached by Yale
with Princeton over the selection of officials
for the game on November 18. The prelimi-
nary lists offered by the managements lust
spring were pnveclag to in part by both, and
as vet no time has been set fora meeting to
settle the matter, As yet neither Princeton
nor Yale has protested any players onthe
lists submitted to each last week, and as the
time init for such objections ends to-morrow
none is likely.

 

 

CamBripGE, Nov. 7.—After an easy after-
noon's work yesterday to get over the effects
of the Carlisle Indian game, the Harvard
varsity eleven was put through a hard, stren-
uous practice this afternoon, There
another such to-morrow, and then the men
will rest easy until the game with Pennsylva-
nia on Saturday. For forty minutes divided
into two halves the varsity was sent against
the second eleven, and things went as well
ak they have ever gone this season, It was
impossible for the second to stop the varsity's
onslaught, the first string men getting six
touchdowns, four in the first half and two
in the second, More attention than usual
was given to the defence, and in this the
varsity showed great improvement over the
work against the Indians,

ScnENECTADY, N. Y¥., Nov. 7.—The poor
showing of the Union eleven last Saturday
may be explained by the fact that the team
is Undergoing a slump that comes to most
teams once @ Beason. An old football player
who saw the game was of the opinion that
the team was overtrained and lacked anap.
Another source of weakness was the fact
that the two regular halfbacks, Harvey and
Moore, were Out of the game, Which alone
would account for the reversal in form, It
is expected that both these men will be back
in time for next Saturday's game with Roch-
ester, ‘The team will have very little work
this week except signal practice, in order to
give the hospital men a@inple time to fully
recover, Ut Was rumored to-day that Hobart
College had cancelled her game with Union
here on November 18. If Such is the case
an effort will doubtless be made to secure
another game with Hamilton for that date,

PHILADELPHIA, No ~The Pennsylvania
varsity team was sent ‘through a light day's
work yesterday at Franklin. Field, which
consisted mostly in running through forima-
tions with lightning speed. In this work the
varsity worked steadily, getting their plays
off without a hitch for over thirty minutes.
The largest squad of coaches that has
appeared on Franklin Field thus far this
year were present Hard work was in order
for the varsity, but the coaches, thinking
possibly that the intended trip to some rest-
ing place may not be realized, owing to faculty
estrictions, did not send the men into any
Bard scrimimaging.

has been putting in the hardest kind of prac-
tice all week in preparation for the game at
Fordham this afternoon with the Univer-
sity of Maryland. Fred Smith, Fordham's
former couch, has been assisting Coach
Magee, The team has been practising several
new trick plays. Fordham relies on these
and on the speed of her backs to win out
against the heavier Maryland line,

PRINCETON, Nov. 7,—The Tigers had secret
practice this afternoon. One touchdown was
scored by the varsity in the léng, hard prac-
tice through which the coaches put the
squad, Special attention is being paid to the
furnbling which was so costly to the Tigers
in the Dartmouth game on Saturday. Twice
in one half of that game the Princeton eleven
lost the pigskin at eritical points and this,
together with frequent offside play, went
quite a way toward giving the visitors the
game. This fault of getting into the attaek
too soon is causing the coaches lots of worry,
and an effort will be made this week to steady
them up in this respeer in preparation for the
game with Cornell next Saturday.

BERNIN DRIVES FAST.
Makes Good Time In Exhibition on Half

Mile Track,

Ten thousand persons turned out yesterday
afternoon to watch the automobile events

! on the half mile track at Waverly Park, N. J.
| There was no admission fee, as the course is

in a public park, and the presence of Barney
Oldfield, M. G. Bernin and Mortimer Roberts
served to attract the immense crowd whieh
covered the little hills that encircle the track,
The star of the afternoon was M. G, Bernin,
who made five miles in 5 minutes 9 seconds,
which would be very fair going, even for a
mile course. He drove the big Renaul
racer With which he competed in the French
eliminating trials for the Bennett race, and
the odd looking car excited much comment.

Barney Oldfield gave a two mile exhibition
with his Peerless Green Dragon, and Mor-
timer Roberts drove three miles against tine
with the [Th omas racer that was a candidate
for the American team inthe Vanderbilt race

Most of the races were exciting for a few
miles, as there were five or six starters in
each. Inthe majority of instances, however:
the winning car had a lead of 100 yards or
more at the end of the race, H. 4. Koehler
of Newark captured three races with a buick
and was second from scratch in the five mile
