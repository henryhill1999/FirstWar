PHILADELPIIA, Nov. 7,-Mayor Weaver
has won out in his fight against the Dur-
ham-MeNichol machine, The City party,
composed of Democrats, Prohiblitionists
and Republicans, has triumphed over the
organization

For years the gang has swayed the munici- |

' pal destinios of Philadelphia, It has gar-
~ nered in that time millions of graft and
by means of its police, its firemen, its gangs
of repeaters,its ballot box stuffers, its phan-
tom voters and its padded assessment
lists it has practically disfranchised the

citizens, ’

By ith own methods, enlarged and em- |
bellished by its own police and firemen,
by every device by which for ten years
it has held sway over the voters, the ring |
to-day was downed in its own strongholds,
But the fight was close. |

By a majority of 25,000 the City party
carried the election. Every one of its cans |
didates was elected, Wilson H. Brown,
Sheriff; Jolin M. Rush Jermon, Coroner, and
Edward A. Anderson and Rudolph Blacken- |
berg, County Commnissioners,

The two Judges of the Common Pleas
Court, Morris Dallett and Craig Biddle,
were on both City party and Republican |
tickets. There was no fight upon them.

Not only is the old ring smashed in Phila-
delphia, but in the State as well, It is
the knell of the Quay dynasty and it is
the knell of United States Senator Boies
Penrose, who tried to take the “old man's”
place and whose record is one of consistent |
blundering and failure. With Durham and |
MeNichol, Penrose passes out of political |
leadership. There will be no place for
him in the councils of the new organization,

The wisest politicians here to-night
predict a Democratic Governor for Penn-
sylvania and perhaps a Democratic Legis-
lature before the new Republican machine
can get its grip on affairs. William H.,
Berry, Democratic candidate for State
Treasurer , has swept the State with far
larger majorities than the fusion ticket
in the city could command,

The fight was the bitterest ever seen in
Philadelphia, Almost the full voting
strength of the city, 300,000, was brought
out, and the ballots cast before noon ex-
ceeded in number those cast all day at any
previous election,

In the suburban wards and in West Phila-
delphia the flood of City Party votes began
early. In Germantown and Tioga the pro-
portion of reform ballots to organized votes
were 10tol, In West Philadelphia a slightly
smaller percentage was recorded,

In the central wards, the Delaware River
wards, the downtown and the Kensington
and Northeast mill sections the police were
busy all day.

In City Hall three Common Pleas Judges
gat from 7 o'clock in the morning until 7
to-night in extraordinary session to adjust
election difficulties. The full force of thirty
oommitting magistrates were in action all
over the city.

By 9 o'clock the room at the central
police station in City Hall was jammed with
prisoners who were being brought in by the
wagonload from all parts of the city. The
prisoners were locked up a dozen toa cell,
and the officers refused to permit any one
to see the slate bearing their names and
the offences with which they were charged

By 1 o'clock the great courtyard was
seething with people, with the police making
lanes through them, and by noon the public
buildings resembled the Bastile on the day
it fell. Shrieking, cussing mobs besieged
the entrance, and the plaza was filled with
men and women, some with bruises and torn
clothing.

In the corridors and court rooms, ward
leaders, both city party and machine,
struggled and fought and cursed and ap-
pealed. Lawyers tried to see their clients
and couldn’t. Men appealed for liberty
and tore at cell bars, ‘The whole place was
a bedlam.

First among the ward leaders to be ar-
rested was Harbor Master Samuel Maloney
of the Fifth ward, a stronghold of the
machine. Maloney stopped at the Fin-
letter Club all night. He was afraid to go
out, Promptly at 7 o'clock Rough House
Tommy, with a squad of fifteen police,
went up to the clubhouse, broke in the door
and nabbed Maloney. They say they found

 

 

flags in the cellar. Maloney says he licked

seven before he gave in.
Anyway, the Harbor Master, followed.

“Dunno,” the policeman would reply
“he's simply slated as arrested,” :

Sometimes “John Jones” would be dis-
charged, some times he would be held for
another hearing and sometimes “Bill Smith,”
seeing a chance to get away, would say,
“I’m John Jones,” and off he would go.

Hundreds of cases were reported where it
was self-evident that the arrest had been
made simply to get a worker out of the
way until the polls closed. Lawyers fought
for releases, but it was uphill work,

Patrol wagons moyed in and out of the

' court yard in a continuous stream, deposit-

ing prnonern. Automobiles would dash up
filled with Machine and City party leaders
Oe prisonera, The police, when they
wanted to keep a man away from the polls
would arrest him, lock him up and then
keep moving him from station house to

| paven house, 80 his friends couldn't find
' him.

Sometimes the police would get a
srisoner so wel lost that they couldn't find
iin themselves when they wanted to.

Early in the day Assistant Director South
received word that a fireman in the Sixth
ward was working for the machine ticket.

He sent a runner to tell him to quit, “He
won’t quit,” the runner reported by tele-
phone. Then South sent Chief Baxter of
the Fire Department after him. “He says
you go to hen” reported Baxter. South
called up the division police booth.
“Mackay's not a fireman!” he yelled, “He
was fired two minutes ago. Smash_his
| face and arrest him for assault.” They

did it.

In the Eighth ward polling places were
shut up ri st and left, and the division
where the Belleyue-Stratford and the big
hotels are located was closed for hours.

The methods of the police in the Fourth
ward resulted in the closing of the polls
in the eighth division for the greater part
of the day, thus depriving 200 voters of
their right of franchise.

Be in Dave Martin's ward, Dave Martin,
leader of the “Hog Combine,” which gave
way before Durham ten years ago, and
who handled the defeated boss's fight for
him to-day, money poured out like water,
In some divisions the workers about the
polls received as high as $20 to desert Mar-
tin. Leaders in a carriage went from
polling place to polling place all during the
day to see that the police were actively
working ..~ the city party.

But in the suburban wards and in West
Philadelphia it was different. There the
best elements rallied to the support of
the city party.
and the majorities ro
the reformers were tremendous. Workers
in carriages and automobiles went from
house to house drawing out the vote.

The unusually heavy vote cast in the
rural Thirty-fifth and Forty-first wards
was one of the surprises of the day, The
interest in the election was so great in this
section that there was a constant proces-
sion of farmers’ wagons waiting in line in
front of each polling place at Holmesburg,

Tacony, Foxchase, Bustleton and Bybarry. |

Down in the centre of the city and in
the tough wards there were some signifi-
cant sights, showing how deeply the elec-
tion struck. Dr. W. W. Keen, the famous

surgeon, was a City party watcher in the |

ninth ward. Keen doesn't like blacks
at all, but he stood up all day challenging
votes with blacks to the right of him, to
the left of him and all around him. Scores
of the biggest men in town worked at the
polls for reform, side by side with thugs
and negro rowdies. Scores of equally
eminent men stood shoulder to shoulder
for the organization.

When the polls closed to-night the police |
were used for the last smashing of election |

law of the day. In violation of the ex-
press provisions of the “Bullitt bill,” they
were ordered by Mayor Weaver and Direc-

tor Potter into the polls, there to supervise |

the counting of the ballots. This was ex-
cused on the ground that it was feared that
there was a Republican plot to stuff the
ballot boxes at the last minute.

One mounted policeman at Sixteenth
and Lombard streets rode his horse up the
steps and into the booth of the Fourteenth
division of the Seventh ward, which is ex-
Ross Durham's ward. There he gat and
supervised from on high the counting. He

was drunk, but he typified the election in |

the machine strongholds. It was the man
on horseback and the man with the club
who carried the election for the City Party.

The old machine is smashed forever and
the new one has begun to form. If its
actions to-day can be used as a basis for

rophesy it is going to make the Durham-

JceNichol ring Took like a suckling babe

These telegrams were sent from the City
party headquarters at 11 o'clock to-night:

ton, D. C.

THE PRESIDENT VOTES BARLY

MAKES A FLYING TRIP FROM
WASHINGTON TO OYSTER BAY.

lage by Appearing Before 9 o' Clock
Shakes Haads All Around and Chats
About His Beoent Southern Trip.

President Roosevelt made the quickest
time on record in getting down to Oyster
Bay and back yesterday to vote. He
voted there before 9 o'clock, before many
of his neighbors had had their breakfasts.

The President left Washington at 12:30
yesterday morning, reached Jersey City
at 7:15, Oyster Bay at 8:50 and was back
on his train at Jersey City again at exactly
10:55 A. M., making the round trip between
Jersey City and Oyster Bay in 3 hours and

The President, as usual, was accom-
panied by Dr. Rixey, his physician, Secre-
tary Loeb and Secret Service men Tyree
and McGinnis, Nothing unusual occurred
on the trip to Jersey City. The President
was up before 7 o'clock and had breakfast
on his private car Rocket by the time twelve
Jersey City policemen had arrived to act as
his escort. There was a crowd of several
hundred early travellers waiting to catch a
glimpse of the President as he came down |
the platform surrounded by the police.

They saw him in rather unusual attire.
He wore a long slack raincoat and a black
In his hand he carried a bundle
of papers and a book. The book was “The |
Simple Life.” He seemed to be in the
best of health, laughed and talked with
some of his escort, and when he got on
board the tug Lancaster went up and
shook hands with the pilot. Then he sat |
down and rca the newspapers until Long |
Island City was reached. There was & crowd |
of 500 waiting at the station at Long Island |
City.

President, who travelled in the private car
of the president of the Long Island Rail-
road. Noah Seaman, the caretaker of the
President's house at Sagamore Hill,
had a carriage waiting at the Oyster Bay
station, the President jumped in and the

volling place in Fisher's Hall was reached
f less than a minute.

They were not expecting the President
there quite so early, but there was the
usual group of old citizens on band.

“How d've do, Mr. President,” thev said
as he jumped ont, and then all bands had
to troop up the stairs after him and see him
vote. \e poll clerks and inspectors always
jump up when the Chief Magistrate of the
pation comes into vote at Oyster Ray. He

After he voted he drove over to the Justice's
court, where Secretary Loeb voted. While
Mr. Loeb was inside, Oyster Ray neighbors
got about the President's carriage and
chinned with him about his Southern trip,
The President drove right back to the
utation and was on tho train at 921. The
tug took him around the city again, the
President standing on the deck and enjoy-
ing the early morning sail. Pie

in the Pennsylvania train shed when he

acknowledged a lot of cheers by raising his
