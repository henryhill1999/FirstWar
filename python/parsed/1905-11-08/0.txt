‘

George B. McClellan was reelected Mayor
’ of this city yesterday, but William R, Hearst
gave him a closer run for it than any suc-
ovesful candidate for Mayor here |! as had
in late years, The Mayor's plurality in
the whole city is only 3,600, Two years
ago it was 62,681.

The fluctuations of the vote yesterday
were remarkable, Hearst and MoClellan
alternately leading, with a difference be-
ween them of only 20 votes on more than
two-thirds of the city. William M Ivins,
the Republican candidate, was in the rear
from the start, except for a hopeful quar-
ter of an hour of his over the first returns
from Brooklyn.

Manhattan Island elected McClellan,
Richmond aasisting. The other boroughs
were the Hearst strongholds.

Control of the Board of Estimate remains
with the Democratic administration. Even
were Hearst Mayor-elect it would still be
lodged there, 9 to 7.

But the Board of Aldermen has passed
out of Tammany or Democratic hands, the
Republicans and M. Q. men controlling it
bya large majority. It has been threatened
that the Legislature will restore to the
board the power over franchises which
was takon away last winter and conferred
solely on the Board of Estimate.

The vote for Mayor, with a few missing
districts, is:

Ivins, McClella

McClellan over Hearst, 3,649.
Metz, Dem., is elected Comptroller.

The Tammany candidates for President
of the Board of Aldermen and for Presi-
dents of Manhattan and The Bronx are
all elected,

Coler, M. O., is elected President of
Brooklyn; Bermel, a Democrat, running
on the Republican and Municipal Owner-
ship tickets, is elected President of Queens,
defeating Boss Cassidy, and Cromwell (Rep.)
is reelected President of Richmond.

In the Board of Estimate, in which the
Mayor, the Comptroller and the President
of the Board of Aldermen have three votes
each, the Presidents of Manhattan and
Brooklyn two votes each and the other
Borough Presidents one vote each, the
voting strength will be: Democratic votes,
12; Republican and Municipal Ownership, 4.
At present the Board stands 15 to 1.

Tammany elected 20 of the 44 Aldermen
voted forin this county, In 1903 it elected 33,

The voting strength in the next Board,
unless later returns alter it, will be:

Tammany elects 87 of the 35 Assembly-
men in New York county. Last year it
elected 26, John M. Quinn (Tam.) is elected
State Senator in the Sixteenth district.

Even John T. McCall, the Tammany
leader of the board, was beaten by 58 votes
by Hubert Slattery, Republican and Mu-
niclpal Ownership, in the Thirtieth, and
with six election districts missing the Forty-
second district is a tie.

The loss of Tammany Assemblymen and
Aldermen was the fruit for Odell of his
alliance with Hearst, There are nine
purely Municipa! Ownership Aldermen
elected,

The Tammany couhty ticket, barring
Osborne for District Attorney, is elected
by pluralities which show a great falling
off from 1908, when they ran about 50,000.

CASSIDY’S RULE ENDED.

The Citizens of Queens Repndiate Him
and Elect Jeseph Bermel.

 

The good citizens of the borough of |

Queens rose up in their might yesterday
and gave Joe Cassidy a mighty swat. Bor-
ough President Joe went down with an
awful thud, and Joseph Bermel, the fusion
candidate, won by 5,986 majority. Bermel
received 18,651 votes and Cassidy 12,665,
That the vote yesterday is a direct repu-

diation of Cassidyism is shown by the |

| freakish manner in which the Democratic
| vote came in,

While Hearst has carried the borough
| for himself by a small margin, Metz and
McGowan, respectively the Tammany can-
didates for Comptroller and President of
fhe Board of Aldermen, were accepted by
the Democratic voters of Queens. They
ran far ahead of Cassidy and the others
he placed on his local ticket,

trict Attorney, has probably defeated Cas-

same thing has happened to his Coroners,
The Cassidy candidates for Assemblymen
in the First, Second and Third districts ran
away behind their fusion opponents and
will no doubt be defeated. The same cone
dition applies to the candidates in the four
Aldermanic districts.

HEARST SAYS AR WAS ROBBED |:

 

CHARGES ILLEGAL VOTING AND
HOLD UP OF BALLOT BOXES,
—A__e
Take the Matter to the Courts
—fays Tammany Held Up the Count
in Murphy’s and Oakley’s Districts
Until It Was Seen What Was Needed.

William R. Hearst and his managers
claimed at midnight last night that he had
been robbed of the election by Tammany’s
work in this borough. The indications
were then that on the face of the returns
McClellan would have a plurality of about
3,000 votes.

Mr, Hearst and his friends gaid that these
figures were fraudulent, that ballots were
being deliberately destroyed and that 262
ballot boxes in this borough, principally
in the Eighteenth, Fourteenth and Sixth
districts, were being held up by Tammany
work in order to see how many votes Tam-
many actually needed to win.

Standing in his room in the Hoffman
House surrounded by his managers and
friends, Mr, Hearst, who was pale from
indignation at the reports he had been
receiving from his lawyers, said;

“We believe we have been robbed of this
election. I don’t give a damn about being
Mayor, but I am going to see that every
man’s vote is counted and counted right.
We shall contest this election in every
district. I shall go to the courts to-morrow.
They have cast 50,000 illegal votes to beat
us and even this hasn't been enough, and
now they re holding up the ballot boxes
in Murphy's and Oakley's districts to see
how many more they need.

“They have resorted to bribery, intimi-
dation and fraud. I shall leave no stone
unturned to see that the people of the city
of New York get a fair count of the vote.
It is not that I wanted personally to be
elected Mayor, but the rights of honest
citizens in having a fair and honest elec-
tion have been trampled on.”

At midnight Wiiliam R. Hearst gave out
this formal statement in addition to the re-
marks he had made to the reporters:

“We have won this election. All Tam-
many’s frauds, all Tammany’s corruptions,
all Tammany’s intimidation and violence,
all the false registration and illegal voting
and a dishonest count have not been able
The recount
will show we have won by many thousands
of votes. I shall fight to the end in behalf
of the people who have cast them.”

Max Ihmsen, Mr, Hearat’s campaign
manager, said to the reporters in Mr.
Hearst's presence

“They have resorted to bribery and
intimidation and they have voted repeaters
and mutilated ba!lots. In Mr. Oakley's
district we have affidavits to prove that

stuck a knie through them. Our men

“Judge Palmeri was shot at and after-
wards assaulted, and is now in the hospita!,
Morgan's men have been assaulted and so
have Jerome's. Mr. Jerome's reports will
bear this out. Mr. Hearst has carried this
city by an overwhelming vote, but has sim-

work in the Second, Third, Fourth, Fifth,
Tenth, Eighth, Twelfth, Sixteenth, Eight-
eenth and Twentieth districts.”

Mr. Ihmsen got a telegram at midnight

from the Brooklyn leaders to the effect that |

the returns in the river front districts were

| being held for the purpose of doctoring re-

sults and that the McCarren men were
openly boasting that the figures would be

made to show that McClellan was elected.

At midnight Mr. Hearst had sent for Bird |

Coler, who had been elected Borough Presi-
dent of Brooklyn, and all of the Brooklyn
members of the Law Committee. <A call
was sent out for every lawyer in town on the
list of the Law Committee. They came in,

theatres.

that they have been killed politically.

' people moving on the sidewalk,

' packed to the doors and did nothin

with bruised and bleeding faces. One man
came in witha broken arm and another with
his head cut open so badly that Mr, Hearst
had him put to bed in the hotel. They were
telling stories of being thrown out of polling

places in the Eighteenth, Fourteenth and |

Sixteenth districts and of being assaulted
by Tammany gangs.

The Hearst lawyers announced that they
had affidavits from a lot of men, one of
whom had his finger chewed off and another
his eye gouged out, According to John

McAvoy of the Hearst law committee in |

the Second election district of the Sixth
Assembly district, the inspectors

and made affidavits that they were thrown
out of the place. Men were bringing
similar reports from the Fourteenth dis-
trict.

“They bought up our captains in all
parts of the city,” said Mr. Ihmsen, “and
we have been busy filling their places all
dav.”

Mr. Hearst, it was said, intends to hire
some of the:biggest lawyers in the United

States to-day to undertake the work of con- |

testing the election. One of his advisers
in conference with him early this morning
was Col. Alexander S. Bacon, who helped to
prosecute McKane,

Charles A. Walsh and A. M. Lawrence of

the law committee said that they nad gone |

to Commissioner McAdoo yesterday after-
noon and informed him that a police official

had told them that a certain inspector was |

in collusion with Tammany and at the
closing hours of the polling places would
see that the men stationed at the polls
would not interfere in anything that hap-

pened.

The only
way we could induce some of our men to

with enough men to back them up in case |

The Hearst managers heard at 10 o’clock
that ballot boxes were held up in Murphy's
and Oakley’s districts and started out
lawyers and workers in squads with in-
structions to see that the votes were prop-
erly counted. They also called upon Mr.

Dore to the reports at Hearst head-
quarters, Michael Cody and Judge Palmieri
wore assaulted in front of 289 Madison street
after they had been around in several dis-
tricta putting up “a plant.” The “plant,”
the Hearst people announced, was in plac-
ing Hearst watchers who were approached
by Tammany men and bribed to desert. It
was said that in three places where this was
tried money was actually passed and marked
by the Hearst men, who are to make affi-

of the row, was seen talking to several men

* Sir

r, Hearst received the returns last night
in a room in the Hoffman House with Max
Ihmsen, Arthur Brisbane and a few of his
rsonal friends. No one else was allowed
n the room. Reporters who tried to see
him were told that he wasn’t in the hotel.
Upstairs in another room the returns were
coming over a wire and around this were
G. Follansbee, Henry Seigel, Calvin
Tomkins and A. M. DeBeck of Mr. Hearst’s
finance committee. The Hearst people had
no experienced tabulators and, in fact,
did not attempt to tabulate the returns or
make any estimates. They depended on
news bureau reports chiefly. Now and
then a Hearst leader called up and an-
nounced the vote of his district.

Throughout the afternoon the Hearst
péople had been rather gloomy, but they
cheered up a bit when the first returns
came in, The first received was a district
in Queens, which gave Hearst 271 votes
to McClellan’s 71. Few returns came in
from Manhattan, but the Brooklyn reports
were all encouraging, and soon the room
was ringing with cheers at the vote being
viled up in Brooklyn, One of the first
Manhattan districts to come in was the
Thirteenth Election district of the Sixth,
which gave Hearst 121 to 175 for McClellan,

“We have cut the ‘lammany vote to
pieces,” shouted the Hearst men then, and
with the reports from Brooklyn they fig-
ured out for a while that Hearst would
surely win. Another big cheer came at
640 when the Eagle conceded Brooklyn
to Hearst. Mr. Hearst received a telegram
from one of his friends at 7 o'clock an-
nouncing that if the proportion kept up he
would win and that McClellan was falling
behind steadily. Pretty soon returns from
The Bronx came in showing a big Hearst
lead and also returns from Queens to the
same effect.

Later on the Hearst people heard that
McClellan's election had Leen conceded by
some of the newspapers opposed to him
and a great gloom settled on the crowd.
Then Mr. Hearst's vote began forging
uhead acain and all was excitement. ‘There
were times when (he figures at tho Hearst
headquarters showed a lead of severa
thousand for Mr. Hearst, and then he would
go down again and McCleilan would regain
the lead. ‘The Hearst people were raised

i from the depths of despair to a sort of

ecstasy only to Le depressed again.

Ato o'clock, whena bulletin came in that
Hearst would win by 4,000, everybody was
joyful, but the Manhattan districts kept
taking the plurality sent over fromm Brooklyn
steadily down. At 9 o'clock Manager Max
Ihmsen made formal announcement to the
reporters to the effect that Mr. Hearst b id
been elected by 40,000 plurality in the greater
city.

“JT guess that's a joke of Max's,” some of
the Hearst people said. A conviction grad-
ually settled on the crowd that the returns
wera bound toshow McClellana little ahead,
and indignation begen to be expressed.

“We have been deliberately robbed,” said
John Ford, and there were cries of “Shame”

Wird S. Coler, the successful candidate
for Borough President in Brooklyn on the
Municipal Ownership ticket, came over
from his borough to tte Hoffman House
early this morning and was greeted by
William R. Hearst, Judge Seabury, Arthur
Bris! ane, Max Ihmsen and the mem! ers of
the Municipal Ownership law committee.
Mr. Coler was warmly congratulated,

The congratulations were very brief, for
all hands became serious ani soon were
in conference behind closed doors. Before
they retired the Hearst crowd were loud
in voicing their opinion that they had been
robbed. i
Seabury came out of the conference for
a few moments and approaching the wait-
ing reporters said:

“You can state that we will carry this
thing to the highest courts, but we don’t
think that will be necessary.”

MAYOR MAKES A PLEDG

TO CARRY OUT EVERY PROMISE
~PRAISES JOHN O'BRIEN.
Hears the Returns at the Bartholdi With
Metz and MoGowan—Belleved That
MoClellan Will Haye Nine Votes Out
of Sixteen in the Board of Estimate.

 

Mayor McClellan, with Mrs. McClellan
and his campaign manager, John H. O'Brien,
together with Corporation Counsel Delany
and candidates McGowan and Metz, re-
ceived the returns in private apartments in
the Hotel Bartholdi. The Mayor's seore-
tary, Thomas Hassett, and very many
others were there during the evening, and
all heartily éongratulated Mayor McClellan
on his victory, who said just before he
returned to his home just before midnight:

“The result of the election shows me more
plainly than ever my duty to the people.
With God's help I shall discharge it to the
best of my ability. I shall keep overy pro-
mise made before my election”

Mayor McClellan said that he wanted
to add a personal word concerning the
work of Campaign Manager O'Brien. “I
cannot speak too highly of the services of
Mr, O'Brien,” said Mayor McClellan. “He
has been reserved and resourceful. He
has been a tower of strength. I not ofly
owe him the sincerest gratitude, but I be-
lieve the people also owe him a debt for
the manly and efficient labors that have
engaged his attention almost every hour
in the day since this arduous’ campaign
began.”

Mayor McClellan, of course, was the hero
of the occasion last night with the gather:
ing at the Hotel Bartholdi. He received
hundreds of congratulatory messages by

telephone and telegraph, and before going |

‘any further he did not forget to thank all

| cerning the vote of Metz in the borough |
and the borough of Queens. |

At 1 o'clock this morning Judge |

who had contributed to the victory. Many
kind words were said of the Republicans
who were patriots in this election.

Some likened it to the national campaign
of 1896, when the Gold Democrats went to
the rescue of McKinley, and again went to
the rescue of Mckinley and Roosevelt in
100. Some very important Republicans
in New York and Brooklyn called to con-
gratulate the Mayor on his victory,

Some were inclined to be critical con-

of Brooklyn

but the wisest in the throng at the Hotel

Lartholdi decided that hasty judgment
should not be taken and least of all should
anythin severe be said before the vote

on all ti candidates is analyzed in all of
the boroughs.
Mayor McClellan himself had no criti-

cismas toutter at this time of any man. It

was a great source of congratulation thag |

the Borough of Richmond came up 80
strongly for the Mayor.

Concerning the vote in the Board of Esti-
mate and Apportionm/nt, it was believed
that the Mayor would have at his back

9 of the 16 votes, All at headquarters said

without reserve that the election showed |

that the eople had been thoroughly
aroused and had spoken in no uncertain
tohes. 4

and Odellism was signally manifested to-day
when a plurality of over 10,000 was given
in the county for George H. Fitts, the Re-
publican candidate for Supreme Court
Justice in the Third Judicial district.
jamin B. Odell, Jr., when Governor, refused

to appoint Mr, Fitts as a Supreme Court |

| Justice to filla vacancy from Albany county
| when D-Cady Herrick resigned from the

bench to become the Democratic candidate

| for Governor last fall.

A CONTEST. |

until after 1 o'clock this morning. At that |
| time he refused to make any comment on

the result of the voting, , It was explained

for him that as the polling was so close |
he realized that a contest would’be made, |
and that while he was confident that the |

ultimate’ decision would be in favor of

Mayor McClellan, he thought it would be |
' and the other candidates on the Republican

out of place for him to say anything.

That a contest will be made was clear
from Mr. Hearst's announcements. A pre-
liminary to this contest will be the official
canvass of the vote by the Board of Alder-
men. The board will have to make a per-
sonal inspection of all the ballots cast and
its report will be passed upon by the courts,
It will be late in December before a contest
can be settled.

ln the early part of the evening, when
the indications

| the four districts in the county,

Mr, Odell's refusal to consider Mr.
Fitts's name was because of the fact that
Wm. Barnes, Jr., chairman of the execu-
tive committee of the Republican State
Committee, refused to attach the Albany
city and county Republican machines

to the ;ersonal, volitical and financial for- |

tunes Odell, Odell then threatened
through State Fiscal Supervisor Harry
}i. Bender to come into Albany and dis-
pute Mr, Barnes's leadership.

Mr. Barnes's response to this threat
to-day, was the rolling up of a big plurality
for Albany county , largely rivalling the
Democratic majorities in this former Dem-
cratic stronghold, Mr, Barnes also secured
for \tayor Gaus, wh» was up for reelection,

ot

anging from 7,300
to 8,000, Mr. Barnes accomplished more
than this to-day. His organization elected
a Republican Assemblyinan from each of
even from
the third district, which normally is 3,000
Democratic. In addition the Albany
county board of supervisors and the Albany
city. Common council are almost unani-

President O'Donnell of the tax board,

the city sat in a far corner of the com-

returns as they came in over a special

Murphy ,

was being congratulated by those who ;

gathered around him, At that hour the
indications were that Mayor McClellan
had been elected by a large plurality, but
Mr. Murphy was not taking things for
granted,

“Wait,” said Mr. Murphy, to those around
him, “until we get the final figures.
early returns may be upset.”

As the might wore on and it became more
and more apparent that McClellan and
Hearst were running a neck and neck race

came a very sober and intently calculating
throng.

How Mr. Murphy was impressed by the
uncertainty of the situation was apparent
from the fact that from before 7 o'clock in

! the evening until nearly 1 o'clock in the

morning he never once moved from his
chair. He was short—almost  surly—in
his greetings to those who sought to talk
with him,

GEO, B, COX, PREMIER BOSS, QUITS,

Cincinnat! Republican Leader Announces
His Retirement From Polltics.

Crncrnnati, Ohio, Nov. 7.—George B
Cox, the veteran Republican leader, to-
night gave out the following statement:

“Now that the election {s over and the
people have signified their preference for
city, county and State officers, and I sine
cerely trust they have selected wisely, I
wish to announce to the publio that from
this day, after twenty-five years of active
service in the ranks of the Republican party,
| my personal activity in politica shall cease,

“I will continue to vote the Republican
eer but others must bear the burden
of future campaigns. To the local Re-
publican organization and the many friends
| that have stood with us in the past I tender
| most grateful thanks for their unswerving
| loyalty and support. I hope for their
|
{

 

 

future good will.”

Thus George B. Cox’s Republican machine,
the most perfect in the country, many
think, went the way of similar organiza-
tions in Philadelphia, Milwaukee and St.
Louis in to-day’s election. The Demo-
crats, backed by the United Reformers
of this city elected E. Dempsey Mayor
and their entire ticket by overwhelming
majorities.

It was a bitter campaign and the reformers
etruck hard and often. ‘heir first gleam of
hope came when Secretary of War William
H. Taft gave his now famous speech at
Akran, in whieh the Republican municipal
ticket in Hamilton county was denoun-
ced. It was pointed out that President
Rooseveit was probably behind this.

Later Goy. Folk of Missouri was brougpt
to the city, and he preached reform, asalso
did Gov. La Follette of Wisconsin, who ad-
dressed a non-partisan gathering of insur-
ance men,

Prominent and wealthy citizens formed
an “honest election committee,” which
relentlessly hunted down illegal registra-
tion and voters.
| Both sides entered the day confident, but
| by 7 o'clock in the evening the Republicans
| had given up hope and deserted their head-
quarters, while Chief Cox conceded the day
to Dempsey and reform by 15,000.
| The city is mad with excitement to-night
and women even are in thestreets rejoicing
over the fall of the great Cox organization.

Gordon, the defeated candidate for Mayor,
is a native of Kansas, but during his years
in Ohio has held office almost the whole
time, being at different times Lieutenant
Governor and Vice-Mayor. He attributed

been sweeping over the country.”

SAYS HEARST 18 ELECTED.
The

 

“American” Declares That He Will
Yet Be Sworn in as Mayor.

W R. Hearst's American in its earliest
| edition says that Hearst has been elected
| Mayor, but does not give any figures further
than to say that “the Tammany claim, re~
duced to 4,000 at 11 o'clock, was still di-
| minishing at midnight,” and that gross
| corruption prevailed.

| The American prints an editorial article
'

|

|

 

| which concludes; ‘William Randolph

Hearst has been elected, and William Ran-
| dolph Hearst will yet be sworn in as Mayor
of New York.”

OSBORNE UNDER COVER.

drew Statement Full of Promises.

Tammany Hall last night to receive the

he had a telephone wire stretched into a

deserted during the
whole evening. It was not generally

known that he was in the hotel, and the
few callers who visited his headquarters
left when they found that they were unable
to see Mr. Osborne.

In the early part of the evening, when
his election seemed certain, Mr. Osborne
prepared a statement promising to do
many things in the way of “equal justice
to the poor and rich, to Republican, Demo-
| crat and Independent.” When later it was
found that the first indications were
knocked sky high the statement was with-
drawn.

The vote for District Attorney, with 86
was: Jerome, 114,170;
Osborne, 101,091; Shearn, 68,882; Flammer,
12,436. Jerome’s plurality over Osborne;
13,079.

In spite of the fact that Flammer had
withdrawn as far as he possibly could
from the contest, his name remained in
the Republican column on the official ballot)
and he received something like 13,000 votes}
practically all of which would have gone
to Jerome if the Gruber-Odell crowd had

‘not forced the Republican county con-

vention to keep his name off the ticket.
As it was, Mr. Jerome was elected by @

| comfortable margin, with Osborne second

and Shearn third. Jerome's plurality was
three times as great as the Mayor's. _The
District Attorney's vote was late to bg cane
vassed, and the detailed figures did not
come in until long after midnight.

The returns from the first ten election
districts indicated the election of Osborne
by a plurality of 42,200. From that period
on, however, Jerome began to show & won-
derful gain in the count, all of which went
far to cheer the hearts of his friends.

One hundred and fifty districts indi-
cated a lead of 30,000 for Osborne and 200
districts gave him a@ lead of but 26,700.
When the returns from 250 districts were
received Osborne's indicated plurality had
dropped to 21,400, and computing on the
returns from 350 districts his lead over
Jerome was only 11,700. Figuring on 450
districta it had been further reduced to
9,800,

When returns from 600 districts, or half
the county, came in they showed that
Jerome was still gaining fast, as Osborne's
indicated plurality was then but 65,700.
Wher the figures for 610 districts were
added up the friends of Mr. Jerome let out

|a great shout, for they showed that the

District Attorney had passed Osborne
and was 350 votes ahead, which indicated
a plurality of something like 500 for him.
Another shout went up, a big shout that
sounded throughout the town, when re-
turns from 640 districts indicated a plurality
of 1,800 fof Jerome.

About this time news began to arrive

' from The Bronx that showed that Jerome

was running ahead there. Sixty districts
above the Harlem gave him a plurality of
430, and Tammany politicians admitted
that it was about time to throw up the
sponge.

Three hundred districts complete gave
Jerome, 98,476; Osborne, 90,816, and Shearn;
60,996. A table of the county, with 846
districts missing, indicated that Osborne
was 45in the lead. Most of the missing dis-
tricts were Jerome strongholds,

In 1901 Jerome received 167,960 votes
against 149,784 for Unger, Tammany. In
that year he was running on the fusion
ticket, headed by Seth Low, and much of
the credit for the fusion victory was given
to Jerome on account of the magnificent
campaign work he did. His speeches
stirred the town as it never had been stirred
before, especially when he laid bare before
the people all the horroreof the red light
district.

Jerome announced in August last that if
2,000 voters would come to the front and
nominate him he would run for reelection
on an independent ticket. He said he
wanted to be absolutely free from the
dictates of any party or boss. He was
nominated by petition and the RK gpublicans
wanted to indorse him, but the Oc#ll district
