TELEPHONE GIRLS HAVE THEIR
ELECTION, DAY GOOD TIME,

shy on Men but Long on Gooti Looks,
, Flowers and Campaign Buttons— Cote
mittee to Award Beauty Prize Takes to

the Woods A Gagsolene Two-Step,
The Lady Violeta gave their annual
glection diy dance at Lyric Hall yester-
day afternoon, and as Kathleen of Gramercy
gigeled to Susie of Cortlandt it made James
dance look like an

flazen Hyde's violet
East Side wedding.

The Lady Violets—if you didn't know
it-are {he telephone girls, the happy hello
sisters, Who breathe softly from the Bat-
tery to Lhe Bronx “Number, please,” and
never, never fay “quit shaking that hook.
Don't you Suppose us girls have feelings
in our curs?” ‘The violet is their emblem,
and most of therm are members of the hello
girls’ club, the Lady Violet Club.

The Lady Violet Club has survived the
frowning displeasure of the telephone com-
pany managers. There was a time when
the Violets went to Lyric Hall with thick
veils over their pretty faces, glancing fear-
fully along the street as they slipped into
the hall. There was a time when it was
pretty nearly worth a Lady Violet's job
to dance at the Lyric. Mean persons who
sneaked into the hall went out and told

fibs. In particular, there waa a chief opera- |

tor wall flower, a regular Amazon of a chief

operator, who yvarned about the Violets |

and made trouble with the bosses. But
the club won out, and the girls dance nowa-
daya without fear.

Yesterday's was a “violet”dance. When
the door of the hall was thrown open by
the gray haired old man who has looked
after ten generations of telephone girls
the atmosphere took on a violet tinge.
There were telephone girls in violet from
head to foot, violet princess gowns fittin,
them so that they looked as if they ha
grown up in the gowns; telephone girls
in violet. shirtwaists, girls who wore big
violet colored plumes in their picture hats,

Most every girl carried the badge of the |
a buneh of violets—and yiolets at |

club
$1.25 a bunch at that, ;

Refore the grand march the girls talked
politics Most every girl there had an
inside tip, “a perfect secret,” drawn out
of the receiver from folks in the know.
There were about 100 girls in the hall and
about three-fourths of them were rampant
Jeromeites, A little red haired spitfire
of a Tammany girl pean got her hair
pulled for saying she hoped Jerome would

et beaten, A Jot of the girls wore Hearst
vuttons and the amiable face of Ivins was
whirled hither and yon to the joyful strains
of “Everybody Works But Murphy.”

[There were to have been prizes for the

prettiest girl, the sweetest voiced girl and |

the wearer of the handsomest violet dress,
put the committee on awards struck a snag
tefore the dance had been on long. The

committee waa made up of one newspaper |

man. It retired to a corner and tried to
dope out just and equitable decisions. It
was pursued into the corner by thirty-eight
girls and adjourned sine die. “Paris himself
would have been up a Hellenic stump at
Lyric Hall when it came to handing out
beauty apples.

There was one thing regrettable about the
dance of the Lady Violets; it was shy on
boys. Several rude persons who imagined
because they could josh a little over a phone
that they could butt in and as" a girl to dance
with them got snubbed. So the girls danced
with each other pretty much.

The dance wound up about 6 o'clock with
& gasolene eee en a new one composed
by a girl from the Madison Square ex-

the chorus ran:

STaMFonD, Conn., Noy, 7,-Misaé Florence

ll, a pretty granddaughter of Andrew J.
Bell, the patriarch of Stamford and one of
the town's wealthiest men, was twenty-one
years old to-day, but the anniversary was
not pleasant for her, Inatead of “coming
into her own," as she had expected, pape re
were served on her in a suit for $4,000
brought by her grandfather. Mr. Bell
seeks to recover for alleged lodging, clothe
ing, medical services, &c., given, he claima,
by request of the defendant,

The suit has caused a sensation in Stam-
ford lecatise of the prominence of the
parties. Miss Bell was educated in the
Convent of the Holy Innocents. Her
father, the plaintiff's son, died a! out, five
years ago, leaving two daughters, one of
whom is the wife of Dr. G. H. Borden, City
Health Ofleer in Stamford. In January,
1903, Andrew J. Bell deeded to his two grand-
daughters each a half interest of a bhrown-
stone Llock in Bell street. Miss Florence
was at the convent at that time. Her in-
terest in the residence is estimated to be
worth ahout $4,000,

After leaving the convent the girl failed
to conduct herself as some of her relatives
desired, and she left them and took up her
residence in a Stamford hotel. Recently
she went to New York to live, It was while

alleged services were rendered by her
grandfather.

exciting time at the polls in the First ward

Ward Republican Club. Mayor Henry S.
Clarke and a lot of Republican

They refused to open the door and the
sleuths put their shoulders to it and pushed
it open.

A scuffle followed, in which Mayor Clarke,
who has a record as an athlete, grabbed

door on the sidewalk. The other detective
fled. The Mayor's followers cheered him
when they heard what he had done. He
said afterward that he considered the club
the same as his private office and that no
one had a rightto enterit without his
pormgiagion. ‘The detectives were looking

general strike of housesmiths on all the

tration, the board of governors f the
Building Trades Employers’ Association
| will act on the strike to-day, All the fifty
buildings affected by the strike are to re-
' main tied up, according to the officers of
the union, until the American Bridge Com-
pany discharges a number of non-union

pany, the officers of the union insisted
yesterday that Post & McCord is in the

The board of governors, after hearin
the case, will refer the matter to the genera
arbitration board of the employers and
unions, Which will again order the union to
declare the etrike off at once pending arbi-
tration, [f this is disobeyed the union will
not be recognized, and it will remain for
the board to declare a general lockout of
the 6,000 members of the union orfor the lron
League to declare for the open shop, The
latter course was taken in the case of the
recent strike of upholsterers. i

| agent” is made responsible for ungatis~
| factory conditions in the old and time hon-
ored profession of bookmaking, and of
| which tho final conclusion is that through
commercialism literature has fallen to a
lower estate than it has known for genera-
| tions. The priest who entered the temple
| with bowed head and under the vow of
| poverty has been replaced by the man with
| the yacht and the motor car. Unsuccessful
! authors are ina larger majority than ever
before, and successful authors would seem

have degenerated to commercial practices.
Literature has resolved itself into a business

| become a hazardous gamble, involving large
' risks and small margins of profit.

appropriated by the department stores and
is managed by ordinary salespeople with
an instinct for “best sellers.” It is also

Mirth,” has exhausted three editions and
the fourth printing of 20,000 copies already
on the press is heing taken up rapidly by
orders and reorders. The title of the book
“The House of Mirth” is derived from the
took of Ecclesiastes, “The heart of the
wise is in the house of mourning; but the
heart of foolais in the house of mirth.” The
London Spectator says that with this book
the author has “inconteatably challenged
comparison with the ableat of living Ameri-

««For the growing slums
in great cities, for the
millions of lives there with-
out light hope or oppor-
tunity, tor colossal fortunes
and rear tenements, for the
multiplying millionaire and
the multiplying pauper, for
the crue] and insatiable
avarice of capital and dark-

nessof drudging labor, —
What cure?

* The greatest social revo-
lutions have resulted from
the darkest and most mis-
erable conditions. Charles
Edward Russell in Man's
Struggte for Equality (be-
ginning in November
Everybody’s) dramatically
pictures the wretched and
awful condition of the poor
in other countries, and
like an astute philosopher
heshows the value of the
reformation into which
these conditions have led.

Worth reading — for
pleasure, anyway ; and es-
pecially for their real deep-
down value to you.
