sO

slowly last night to Mr, Jerome's head |

quarters at the Gileey House, that by 10

o'clock he began to suspect that somebody |
| ais holding back the ballot boxes in these

districts.

He organized a force hurriedly to make
an investigation, as there were reports
that ballot boxes were being purposely
held up. Mr. Jerome sent his chief of staf
with seven men to the Sisth, and Assistant

District Attorney Miner with a force of
county detectives and workers into the
Righteenth They hustled out as fast as

automobiles and cabs could take them,

Mr. Jerome also sent word to Superin-
tendent of blections Morgan. Mr. Morgan
suggested over the telephone that the
Jerome people should at once get in touch
with the Hearst people and that both should
send watchers to the suspected districts.
The Hearst folks hustled out their watchers
as quickly as the Jerome folks did

Then Mr. Morgan communicated with
Inspector Brooks at Police Headquarters
and demanded a quick investigation by the
police.

Inxpector Brooks also hustled out special
policemen. ‘Then Mr. Morgan got busy with
his own stall. Hesent twenty of his depu-
ties to the two districts in automobiles with
instructions to say to the election officers
that holding back returns was a felony, and
with instructions also to make arrests of

election officers if there was any evidence of |

the wilful holding back of the returns

At 11:30 P.M. Mr. Morgan had wore that
the votes in all the districts of the Sixth
Assembiy district had been counted and
certified to, except the Twelfth and Figh-
teenth Election districts, and the constitu-
tional) amendments and votes in the Nine-
teenth Flection district.

In the Eighteenth Assembly district he
had word that the votes had been connted

_and the returns mace to the police from the

First, Second, Third, Fourth, Ninth, Tenth,
Eleventh. Twelfth, Bighteenth, Twenty-
second, Twenty-third and Twenty-fourth
Election districts.

Mr. Morgan declined to say whether he
thovght there wis a deliberate attempt
to hold back the returns, but said he would
leave nothing undone to find out and would
take drastic action if it had occurred. He
said Inspector Brooks was cooperating
with him. Up to midnight there had been
no arrests.

At midnight State Superintendent of Flec-
tions Motgan gave out a statement in which
he said that the number of fraudulent votes

cast was greater than in any two recent ,

years. He said that the fraud this year
took on the phase of voting on reputable

persons’ names and that this kind of fraud |

was very extensive, but that he could make
public no estimate of ite exient until to-day.
He received numerous complaints during
the day from persons who were deprived
of their franchises by fraud.

Mr. Morgan said that about 80 per cent.
of the warrants he had secured for floaters
were not served because the floaters bee
came frightened, As it was, there were
more than twice the usual number of arrests.
Mr. Morgan also said that a large number
of arrests were due to the incompetence
of election officers, and he added that he
thought that New York would soon realize
the necessity of having election officers of
ordinary human intelligence. He de-
elared that his bureau had never done more
efficient work than it did yesterday.

Thieves Get Away With Harburger’s 8900,
Saved for Contingencies.

Julius Harburger, Tammany leader of
the Tenth Assembly district, went to bed
on Monday night with $900 in his trousers
pocket. It was $900 which he had savéd
after paying his election district captains,
The $900, Mr. Harburger said, was for con-
tingent expenses yesterday.

About 2 o’clock he woke up. So did his ,

—ight Vote Polied.

Omauna, Neb., Nov. 7.—~The Republicans ,

carried Nebraska in to-day's election by
from 19,000 to 25,000. The only State offi-
cers to be elected were one Supreme Judge
and two Regents of the State University,
Two years ago Republican Regents were
elected by 34.000. To-day’s | lurality for
the same cffices is about the same as two
years ago The vete was much smaller,
however

In Omaha only county offices were voted
for, and the entire Republican ticxet was
elected by from 500 to 5,000 plurality. Jules
Lombard the “singing Democrat” running

“tor police judge, was defeated by union

labor votes.
From returns at 10:50 to-night it appears

very few Democrats were elected to county
or city offices anywhere in the State

WADOO REJOICES.

 

Suys the Mayor Was Reelected on the Plat+
form of His Record.

Police Commissioner McAdoo, sure of
Mec(Clellan’s election, gave out this state-
ment at 11 o'clock

“It is, of course, unnecessary for me to
say that the result is gratifying. Mayor
MeClellan nas gained the victory through
the merits of his administration and his own

lendid personality. His record was his
platform and his candidacy was fair and
clean. The people of the metropolis have
made no mistake in reelecting George B.
McClellan.”

Among those who attended the recention
the Commissioner held at Police Head-
quarters while the returns were coming in
were Justice Gildersleeve, Attorney-General
Mayer, David McClure, W. G. McAdoo,
A. F. Beale and Theodore W, Morris.

HEARST AND MUNICIPAL OWNERS |

hut of the most enthusiastic managers of |

the Hearst campaign. ‘The result of the
election is nothing short of a political revo-
lution in the big sister borough, even old
party lines being more terribly shattered
than in the memorable Schieren campaign.

All the way from Rei Hook Point to
Newtown Creek and from Fulton Ferry
to Barren Island the regular Democratic

forces were cut to pieces, and even Senator |

_ MeCarren, the leader of the Democratic
organization, only managed to capture the
Fourteenth Assembly district, his own
bailiwick, by a paltry plurality of 257,nearly
as poor a showing as in the 1803 campaign,
when he was himself bowled under by
George B, Owen.

Yesterday he carried his own election
district for McClellan by a plurality of
only 43. Similar conditions prevailed in
all the other strong Democratic Assembly
distriets, even the Second, hitherto sure
for a aweeping party majority of from 3,000
to 4,000, giving a plurality of only 705 for
' MeClellan.
| The Republican districts furnished almost
‘like results, the accustomed majority of

from 1,200 to 1,400 shrinking to less than

R00. The wholesale desertion of Ivins

for Hearst by the Republicans in their

own strongholds was equally as pronounced
as the slump from the Democratic hosts
in the same direction.
The Democratic managers and assembly
district leaders who collected at the Thomas
Jefferson were fairly dumfounded soon after
the returns began to pour in, and long before
midnight abandoned al! hope of saving @
remnant of their county and borough ticket.
Senator McCarren did not put in an appear-
ance at headquarters, remaining’in seclu-
sion at the Clarendon Hotel,
At Republican headquarters all hope of
carrying the county and borough tickets,
| with the exception of Joseph A. Burr, the |
candidate for the Supreme Court, was |
early abandoned, and Lieut.-Gov. Timothy
L. Woodruff left early for Manhattan. |
The only consolation to the Republican
| managers was in their gains in Assembly-

men and Aldermen. Justice Burr, who

ran both on the Republican and Municipal
| Ownership tickets, and who also had the
backing of the Prohibitionista and Jeffer-
sonians, has the most unexampled majority
in the history of the borough, reaching as
it does to 70,000 or more.

The vote in the other nine counties in-
| cluded in the Second Judicial district will
| awell it several thousand more. Samuel 8,
| Whitehouse, his Democratic competitor,

who made a stubborn but unsuccessful
| effort to keep Burr ff the Hearst ticket,

was fairly dazed over his tremendous
defeat. He had many other companions
in his political discomfiure, notably

Jimmy Riigway, the discredited oandi-

bowled over by Bird S. Coler by a plurality
probably exceeding that by which Hearst |
It is the opinion of |
some of the most important Democrats
that the nomination of Ridgway for the place
as first citizen of Brooklyn was the real
cause of the most ignominous overthrow
in the history of the Kings County Demoo-
racy. The resurrection of Ridgway after
an inglorious retirement of nearly twenty
years by Senator McCarren was in the
estimation of the people in general a polit-
ical blunder of the first magnitude. |

The defeat of Ridgway and all his asso-
ciates on the local ticket and the installa-
tion of Rird S. Coler and his fellow victors
as the administ’ators of the borough and
county administrators will, it is certain,
have, far reaching political consequences.

The firat news that carne in was that the |
race was remarkably even in Brooklyn |
among the thrée leading candidates for |
Mayor, while New York county was promis- |
ing MoClellan a'thumping plurality. This
was about what Tammany had forecasted.
Presently Hearst and, Ivins began to nese |
saw as leaders in the Brooklyn vote, Then
Hearst took the lead definitely and Ivins |
fell back to third place.

In Manhattan Ivins was a hopeless third
from the start. The McClellan plurality
in the county, indicated at first at 50,000,
began to recede rapidly as the Hearst vote
in Brooklyn mounted and as Hearst began
to show ahead in Queens and in The Bronx.
President Cassidy ‘in Queens and President
Haffen in The Bronx began to have cold
chills,

Presently it began to look very uncom-
fortably close on the Mayoralty, with in-
dications that Mayor McClellan had less
than 10,000 votes margin, or less than 2
per cent. of the expected total vote. The
Hearst men began shouting when a police
computation of pretty nearly all the Brook-
lyn districts and not so large a share from
Manhattan showed him ahead of McClellan.
At 9:30 o'clock 1,650 districts out of 1,648
showed McClellan only 20 ahead. But
this condition did not last long.

It was about this time that Jerome's
vote began to top Osborne's after a pre- |

  

 

 

 

 

cipitous descent in the latter. Altogether |
it was a wonderfully unconventional per- |
formance that the returns went through. |
