-A book publishe! by the Equitable Life
surance Society a few years ago con-
mins some things which, in the light of
ecent events, are interesting.

The book includes, among other things,
the tributes paid to Henry B. Hyde, the
founder of the Equitable, by ex-President
lames W. Alexander of the

fe, President Richard A. McCurdy of
he Mutual, President John RK. Hegeman
pf the Metropolitan and Senator Chauncey
fd. Depew. of the
delivered at the unveiling of
B. Hyde statue in the main corridor
he Equitable Builcing on May 2, i901
Mr. Alexander in his reminiscences said
hat Mr. Hyde, instead of being, as many
beople imagine all corporate officers to
be, one who was disposed to use the in-
itution for his own benefit, was just the
averse. Many instances, Mr. Alexander
id, had come under his observation in
vhich Mr. Hyde had risked his entire for-
une for the benefit of the Equitable.

“Very early in my career,” said Mr. Al-
xander, “he urged upon me the principle
hat I should never do myself what 1 could
get some other man to do as well.

tributes
the

were

of

some

atters of the greatest importance, That
ought has been useful to me all my life,
nd it is one of the elements of executive
bility.”
Mr. Alexander further that the
remarkable svstem by which the officers
f the Equitable keep daily check on every
Hepartment of its affeirs and know precisely
hat is going on by means of statistical
eports from the various departments”
as invented by Mr. Hyde. Mr. Alexander
dded that the systern needs litle amend-
ent; that whoever is at the head of the
uitable is able, by
, every day to know “exaculy how faith-
ully each man in the office and in the field
yerforming his duties.”
fr, Alexander could see that as a result
f Mr. Hyde's strong character there “pre-
ades the administration of the society's
ffairs a spirit anda habit which are unique
their excellence.”
President McCurdy of the Mutual gave
as his opinion that the success of the Equi-
‘ble wag due to the “ phosphorescent genius”
Mr. Hyde. President McCurdy ends his
bute with this quotation:
‘om age to age some soul divinely great
‘ounts o'er the level of our poof estate,
d, mindless of the confluent tides that gave
is grand preeminence to that crowfAing wave,

fe inark its period, and redate old time
y the accession of that force sublime,

President John A. McCall said:

} He builded not for his life, but for all time,
and the great trust he embellished
by his name and personality, enriched by his
fevotion and integrity, will be secure in the
bands of those who were his friends as well
gs his associates and who, honoring him in
ife, will perpetuate unsullied
nm death.

President Hegeman’s remarks are more
bommonplace. Here are sume of them:
He opened the throttle from the start, and
he had no use for air brakes. He was an in-
mrnate automobile: he could charge himself
rom within himself, independent of exterior
forces. He necded no power house; he was his
wn dynamo. His capacity for work was a
marvel. He was a veritable “galvanic bat-
ery in breeches.”

Senator Depew, who delivered the ora-
on at the unveiling of the Hyde statue,
prefaced his remarks with the assertion
hat “the springs of human action are
hecessity or ambition.”

Mr. Depew said that Henry B. Hyde, if
he had directed his energies und genius
o his private fortune instead of to the
ociety, might have left to his heirs a sum
t aoe to the $306,000,000 held by the Equi-
apie.

“I know of no more startling contrast,”
id Senator Depew, “than this $05,000,000,
f devised to a single family, with all the

~He Was Running to Catch a Train
and Crossed Track in Front of Another
—Friends Saw Him Ground to Death,

steeplechase rider and polo player, was
killed by a train at 5:15 o’clock yesterday
afternoon at the railroad station at Great
Neck, L. I, Young Fitzgerald, with W. K.
Vanderbilt, Jr., P. F. Collier, W. R. Grace,
Jr., Perry Belmont, J. Temple Gwathmey
and others, attended W. Gould Brokaw’s
annual steeplechase and pony races at Mr.
Brokaw’s estate, Nirvana, at Great Neck,
in the afternoon.,

He rode intwo of the races his horses
Crusader and Tiger Lily, with both of which
he won at theracing meet given on last
Saturday by W. R. Grace, Jr., and J. P.
Grace, at their estate, Graceland, near the
Brokaw place, Yesterday afternoon he
finished unplaced with Crusader, and in the
fourth race Tiger Lily broke a leg and was
killed. Mr. Fitzgerald narrowly escaped
injury when the horse fell.

After the races Mr. Fitzgerald, with a
friend, drove from Nirvana to the Creat
Neck station in a high cart. He was anx-
ious to catch a train for New York as quickly
as possible. He didn’t take time to change
his riding clothes. As thécart neared the
station Mr. Fitzgerald saw the New York
train just about to pull out. He jumped
out of the cart and ran for the train.

A train from New York was approaching
the station on the track nearest the plat-
form. Either Mr. Fitzgerald did not see
it or he thought he had time to get across
the track to his train without danger. He
ran across the platform through the crowd

10 HELP JEWS IN RUSSIA.

HEBREWS ORGANIZE A RELIELE
SOCTETY - 837,000 SUBSCRIBED.

Strong Protest Against Helping Sufferers |
Who Aren't Jews, but a Broader Sentl:
ment Prevalls- J. HW. Schur and 0, 8,
Straus the Leaders of the Movement, |

The meeting of Hebrews in the Temple
Emanu-El yesterday afternoon, called by
Jacob H. Schiff and presided over by Oscar |
S. Straus, ex-Minister to Turkey, was per- |
petuated into the “Hebrew-lussian Mas- |
sacres Relief Association,” It was decided |
that a committee of fifty be appointed to |
receive subscriptions and take charge of |
the distribution of funds. The sum of
56,800 was subscribed on the spot.

Contrary to the announcément made at
the Sixty-seventh street synagogue last |
Sunday night that a big mass meeting was |
to be held, only the rabbis and heads of He-
brew organizationg and prominent Jews
were invited, but before the meeting was |
over the temple was crowded. It was a |
very stormy meeting and had it not been |
for the wisdom and coolness of the chairman, |
with the aid of the conservative element,
the meeting might have broken up in dis-
order.

Religious sentiment ran high, evidently
a@ great many of those present laying the |
vital cause of the massacres to the intoler-
ance of the Christians. When Mr. Schiff
declared that it semed to him right that the
money subscribed should go not only toward
alleviating the miseries of the surviving
Russian Jews, but should also be applied
to all sufferers, Jew or gentile, a storm of
protest arose on all sides. The principal
purpose of the meeting was sidetracked |
and Mr. Straus had the greatest difficulty |
in recognizing the speakers who bobbed up
all over the hall.

 

Prof. Gotheil of Columbia University
was the first on his feet and said: “IL en- |
tirely disagree with the motion. We did |

not come here to open subscriptions for the |
Russian people; our prime duty is to be!p |
our suffering brothers. I should feel that |
the meeting had gone entirely astray if our |
efforts are dissipated in the helping of |
others.” Applause followed Prof, Gotheil's |
remarks and others voiced the same senti-
ments,

Marcus Mark endeavored to stem the tide
inalongsnpeech, “I donot agree with the
previous speaker,” he concluded. “Let
us curb our narrowness. We are not here
only as Jews, We are here in the interest
of humanity)” Mr. Straus managed to
getina word here, though half the audience
were clamoring for recognition, He said;

“Gentlemen, don't let our passions run
away with us. Don't do anything you will
be ashamed of afterward.”

Then Hernard Drachman got the floor
and was roundly applauded when he said:
“Christian students fought for our _un- |
fortunate race in these massacres, They
died for them, As 1 give tiny mite to this
cause, I give freely to all classes.” |

the discussion was finally brought to a
stop when Dr. Magnus, just before the
ithe meeting, asked the Chair to
give a definite answer as to how the money
would be expended

Dr. Magnus said that 500 Hebrew societies,

SCHMITZ AGAIN ELECTED,

Labor, Saloon and Sporting Votes Keep
Him Head of San Francisco.

San Francisco, Nov. 7.—Eugene
Schmitz has been elected for the third time
as Mayor of San Francisco by a majority of
13,000, This heavy vote for the head of the
ticket will elect the whole Union Labor loc@l
ticket including the Board of Supervisors.

The result was due solely to the combin-
ing of the union labor vote with votes of the
saloon and sporting clement. Union labor
voted as one man for Schmitz because
prominent members of the Citizens’ Alliance
were behind John S. partridge, the candi-
dete of the Fusion Party.

James W. MeCarthy, Republican, was

the city.

The independent voters of both parties
rallied to Mayor Fagan’s support and gave
him a very complimentary indorsement of
his administration, During the day many
of Fagan's campaign advisers were in the
dumps, but the Mayor never Jost faith in |
the result for a moment. He said he knew
that the people of the city would stand |
