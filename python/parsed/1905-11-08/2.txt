Madison Square must be sunk about six

see how any part of the earth could hold

on its out-
skirts, and it was hard shoving to make
a way even through the very centre of that
mob, This part seemed to be there on
serious business. The gayest, and the
maddest, and the happiest whirled and
rolled about that patch of Broadway where
the lights are always brightest—Longacre
Square --or about Martin's.

It was just 8:30 when a mounted police-
man came riding full gallon eastward on
Twenty-ninth street. He struck the crowd;
his horse reared on its haunches and
cleared a space. The mounted policeman
was yelling something, but the crowd could
only see his mouth open and shut. ‘the
foot police saw, however. ‘Chey fell in and
began to beat a lane, just as a fire engine,
a Fook and ladder and two trucks swept
around the corner of Sixth avenue and
into T'wenty-ninth street.

The lane was a narrow one, but the driver
of the engine took itfullspeed He swerved
a little fortwo girls, who scurried out almost
from under the wheels, just missed the
wheel of a hansom, so that his own wheel
seraped the curb, and broke out, running
easy, on the other side of Broadway. It
was a protty piece of work, Chief Croker's
buggy, although helped by three mounted
men, had a harder time making the passage
on Twenty-sixth street.

When Longacre Square really got tuned
up nothing could hold it. Along the west
side of Broadway- for some reason by far
the livelier side—the boys lined up in solid
rows, tickling every girl who took their
fancy. The air

The poison in coffee does not always |

work its mischief swiftly sometimes it
fastens its hold upon the victim by slow
degrees that are not noticeable for a
while. But once it begins, the day will
surely come when the coffee drinker will
| be “up against it” and must have relief.

“A lady writes from Cal,:

“We were great coffee drinkers in our
home, using it at every meal and fre-
‘quently drinking it in the evening with
; friends, and it was not until after the
| lapse of years that we began to realize
| that it was doing us harm.

“My symptoms were not so bad, al-
| though my health suffered in many
| minor ways, but my husband became

afflicted with a most painful stomach
; trouble. He could not assimilate his
'food properly and everything he ate
gave him great distress. We were slow
to suspect the truth, but we now see that
it was caused by the use of coffee.

“At last he determined to quit using
coffee altogether, and like a good wife |
did so, too. We worried along for a
month without any hot table beverage,
till one day a friend happened to say to
me, ‘J am using Postum Food Coffee now
and feel so much better for it.’ I told
her that we had tried it and did not care
for it, and She said it must have been
| because it wasn't properly prepared. So
I] bought a package and prepared it
strictly according to directions. We
were astonished and delighted at the
| result,

“We have been using Postum Coffee

for a year, now, and I rejoice to be able
| to tell you that it has cured my husband

 

of his dyspepsia. Thik is a statement

that does not seem to have the signifi-
| cance it ought to have. If I could make
} you understand how intense his suffer-
ings used to be, you would realize what
a deliverance Postum wrought for him.
| “My own health has also greatly im-

proved and the credit for all must be

given to Postum.” Name given. by

There's a reason.

isaued because of mistakes of polling clerks.
Many of the prisoners were men who had
lived and yoted for years from the same

addresses, and they expressed their opinion
in no uncertain language touching their
arrests. At one time the proceedings re-
sembled a farce comedy.

For the first time in the recollection of
Essex Market court habitués, there was
not a single arrest of any one charged with
fighting. Neither was any of the prisoners
charged with repeating or voting on dead

nen’s names. : ,

* The prisoners held were Mike Tuibel of
57 Sheriff street, James Dewey, clerk of
the lodging house at 271 Bowery, and John
Floyd of 453 West Sixteenth street. euOy uy
it is alleged, tried to induce a number o
men to vote illegally, and he said that Dewey
had given him the list of names.

Only thirty-six cases materialized before
Magistrate Whitman
ae Fifteen men were held in $500 bail
each for examination; one case was ad-
journed, one was held in $1,000 bail for
trial, and nineteen men were discharged.

Many cases came to court only because
of reckless affidavits. Many keepers of
boarding houses swore previously that the

| defendants had no such residence as they

alleged, only to state in court that they
had known the defendants for years. In
each case they had known the man only

| by sight.

Seventy-one men were arraigned in the
Wert Side Court. All but seven prisoners
were discharged at once by Magistrate
Walsh, and three of these were subsequently

released after their casees had been in-
vestigated, .
Joseph Mullane tried to vote from

Amsterdam avenue. Investigation showed
that no such man was known at that ad-
dress and he was put under $500 bail for
examination on Thursday.

A man tried to vote as Benjamin Thomp-
The real

who was arrested is but 23. He was also
mixed as to the address, giving it as 273
Columbus avenue. He was held for ex-

Thomas McCabe of 231 West Sixty-sixth
street was held for trying to vote on the
nume of Thomas Connors of 161 West Sixty-
sixth street. He was arrested at the poll-
ing place at 145 Amsterdam avenue; he
insisted on voting after being challenged.
He also was put under $508 bonds for ex-
amination.

REPUBLICANS WIN IN CHICAGO.

Drainage Canal Commiasioners and Judges
Voted For.

CnicaGco, Nov. 7.—The Republicans tool:
most of the offices in to-day'’s election
Right trustees of the Sanitary district,
having control over the Chicago drainags
canal, were voted for, as well as five judges
of the Superior Court and one judge of thy
Circuit Court.

The race between Frank Wenter, Domo:
crat, and Robert R. McCormick, Republi
' ean, for President of the Drainage Board
| was exceedingly close, and the official count
may be necessary to decide it, although
the indications at a late hour are tha‘
McCormick has been elected, and that all
the Republican candidates for trustees will
pull through.

Judges Joseph E. Gary, Willard M
McEwen, Marcus Kavanagh and Farlin Q
' Ball, Republicans, were reelected to the
Superior bench, Merritt W. Pinckney,
Republioan, was elected to the Circuit bench.
Major ar B. Tolman, Democrat, ap-

ra to have been elected to the Superior
udgeship, but the offigial count may give
| the office to his Republican competitor.

The referendum increasing the term of
the Mayor of Chicago to four years was
carried, a8 was also the proposition to create
a “forest pfeserve district” for a system
of outer belt parks. The vote was remark:
ably light.

and good hick, and will say that it has

pleasant expressions of esteem that all you

Mr. Ivins had Senator Elsberg and Horace
E. Deming with him as his chief companions
for the evening. Senator Els erg brought
out the returns to the good sized crowd in
the ante-room. He didn't seem much de-
pressed, Ex-Senator Slater was in and out
from time to time. His face showed taat
he expected no other result as one of the
Ivins campaign managers. There were
many expressions of disappointment over
the showing that Mr. Jerome made early in
the evening, and when there seemed some
indication that Hearst would win there was
a general desire shown for his victory,

Along alout 8 o'clock the news was’
brought to Mr, Ivins that the reform ticket
had carried Philadelphia.

“That's pretty poor comfort for me,”
wae his response with a grin,

One of the visitors to Mr. Ivinse's head-
quarters was Edward Lauterbach. He
wasn't depressed a little bit. He was more
anxious about the Republican nominees
for Assembly and Alderman in his district
than anything else. When the learned
by dint of much telephoning that they
were Prepay, elected he smiled and
seemed to be satisfied,

Mrs. Ivins called in a carriage about
9 o'clock and Mr. Ivins went down to the
side entrance of the Breslin to greet her
for a few moments. It was shortly after
that that Mr. Ivins announced that he
was going home to go to bed soon.

Mr. Ivins said privately that he was glad
the campaign was over. Now that it is
ended he made no secret that for the last
