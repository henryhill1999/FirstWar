Joy Rider Arrested tn Jeracy Pays

Rioarwoop, N. J., Dee. 31,.—The “joy
riders” who raced through town early yes-
terday morning in a touring car were
three young men led by John F. Ryan,
who sald he was a son of Thomas Fortune
Ryan. The ride wound up in a partial
wreck of Ryan's big car and later a fine
for the owner.

Policernan Matt Orr heard the machine
coming down Franklin avenue. There were
no lights, according to him. He planted
himself in the road and ordered the driver
to stop,

The machine lurched forward, bumped
over the Erie tracks and made for the
summit of Chapman's Hill. But Orr got
the number, 21621, N. Y. A little later
there was a report like the explosion of a
young cannon. Orr found an automobile
backed up against a tree on the lawn of
P. A, Touhey, near the foot of Franklin
avenue. The occupants were missing. Orr
found them in a garage near the Hrie
They said the gasolene had given

Special Cable Despatch to Tne Sux

LONDON, Jan 1.--George Bernard Shaw
greets the opening of the new year with a
panacea, for international and, after a
fashion, European war. ,In the course of
a long article in the Daily News Mr. Shaw
says:

“International warfare is an unmitl-
gated nulsance. Have as much character
building civil war as you like, but there
must be no sowing of dragon's teeth like
the Franco-Prussian war. England can
put a step to such a crime single handed
; easily enough if she can keep her knees
| from knocking together in her present
eee: fashion.”
| “How?” one might ask. Here is Shaw's
answer;

“By politely announcing that war
ltweeg France and Germany would be so
jinconvenient to England that the latter
country is prepared to pledge herself to
|defend either country if attacked by the

The order for the removal of Mr. Waldo |
became effective at 11 o'clock in the morn-
ing, or one hour ahead of the time set j
by him for his resignation to become ef-|

fective. He was displaced for insubor- |

dination on two counts.
Mayor Kline accuses Waldo first of
having issued an order practically dis- |

mantling Police Headquarters of all the!

perts in different lines. Secondly, he

Gaynor, which administration it had been
my hope to hold together intact until the
end of the year. Tiat I have been unable
to realize that hope is due alone to the
action of Mr. Waldo, whose conduct I am
utterly at a loss to understand,

“Until last Monday morning I had sup-
posed that Commissioner Waldo was sin-
cerely desirous of serving the best inter-
ests of the people of this city. I had
trom the first moment of my entrance
{nto office treated him with the utmost
consideration and courtesy, and felt that
at least he would treat me in the same
manner. I hud at the outset of my ad-
ministration resisted powerful pressure
from citizens for his removal, but f felt
that if it were possible to do so I should
not disturb the appointments made by the
late Mayor. Commissioner Waldo had
shown an apparent disposition to coop-
erate with me in every way in the man-
avement of the Police Department, and
| was therefore amazed last Monday
morning to learn that he had issued a!
sweeping order, without consultation with |
me, transferring out of Police Headquar-
ters all of the experienced men and
experts engaged In conducting the routine
business of the bureaus at Police Head-
quarters and in carrying on the work of
the special staffs engaged in the investi-

ati of crime,

“Amazed” by Waldo’s Conduct,

“This action, so entirely without prec-
edent in the department, amazed me, and
4mmediately upon reaching my office I
telephoned inetructions to Commissioner
Waldo to rescind his order and bring back
10 Headquarters every man he had trans-
ferred, He insisted that he had trans-
ferred these men away from Headquar-
ters in order to give the incoming ad-
ministration a free hand, This reason |

cousidered entirely unsatisfactory, since;

etroke of his pen transfer any or all

Harry W. Watrous, secretary
the National Academy of Design, said
last night that the little bronze duck
had been purchased a few days ago by
Arthur Davis, an artist. He said that
every effort will be made to restore the
stolen piece and that if this cannot be
done the academy will be forced to make
the loss good.

“The little bronze duck was stolen some
time Tuesday night or Wednesday morn-

small thing and could have easily been
slipped into some one’s coat pocket. We
will do everything possible to find it.”

FRAT’'S PAJAMAS ANNOY HER.

Woman Netghbor of Phi Gamma
Delta Seeks Injunction.

Supreme Court Justice Gavegan heard
argument yesterday on an application
by Mrs, Nellie L, Vought, who lives next
door to the chapter house of the Phi
Gamma Delta fraternity of New York
University on Andrews avenue in Tho
Bronx, for an injunction restraining the
fraternity men from making unneces-
sary noises and otherwise disturbing Mrs.
Vought's peace of mind. The court said
he would probably grant the injunction,

Counsel for Mrs. Vought said that she
was not only disturbed by the singing of
the fraternity men, but that they had a
way of airing their pajamas on their
rear porch which annoyed Mra, Vought
and her two daughters.

The application was opposed by coun-
sel for Mrs. Bliss, wife of the profes-
sor of engineering in ene university, who
owns the fraternity house. The lawyer
said the members of the fraternity were
all away on their holiday vacations and
that it would be unfortunate if they
should be without a home on their return,

“I'll have to compel the boys to stop
dancing, holding smokers and hanging
their wash out until the matter can be
tried,” said the court.

“If we are asked,’ continues the play-

}tion is really the aggressor we can reply
that we shall take our choice, or when

the problem is unsolvable we shall toss:

up, but that we will take a hand in the
war anyhow,

No Security Against War.

“If we are asked what we will do if
France and Germany punish our. pre-

| we can reply that we have no security
against their doing so now at any mo-
ment and that we are and always have

; “One must be ready with answers ty

He shows how he believes the plan would
work out regarding disputes with other
nations and asks triumphantfy :

“Can anybody suggest an alternative
policy?”

He declares himself in favor of big
armaments, ‘but,’ he continues, “let us
| get the value of our money in strength
and influence instead of casting every
hew cannon in an ecstasy of terror and
then being afraid to aim it at anybody.”

“T like courage (like most constitution-

Chance to Halt Armamenta,

The Daily Chronicle publishes an inter-
view with Chancellor of the Exchequer
Lloyd George on the subject of arma-
ments, Deploring the “overwhelming ex-
travagance through which no country has
guined any advantage, all being now rela-
tively where they were before,” the Chan-

cellor sald:
“The present moment is most favorable

in twenty years for overhauling the ques-
tion and starting retrenchment.”

He formulated three reasons for this
view, first, that Anglo-German relations
are definitely more friendly than they
have been for many years; second, that
the Continents! nations are directing their
energies more and more toward strength-
ening their land forces; third, the spread
of the revolt against militarism through-
out the whole of Christendom,

Dealing with the second question, Mr.
Lloyd George remarked about Germany's
obvious danger through being flanked by
France and Russia:

“She has nothing like a two Power
standard army and has therefore become
alarmed recently and is spending huge
sums on the expansion of her milltary
resources, If she ever had the ldea of
challenging our sea supremacy the ext-
gencies of the military situation must

head. In these circumstances we can
afford quietly to maintain our present
naval superiority without feverish efforts
to increase it.”

Industrial Classes Oppose War.

In regard to the third reason the
Chancellor of the Exchequer said; "The
common sense of the industrial classes,
both capital and labor, has risen up
against this organized insanity of war,
especially in western Europe, This new
temper, he went on, Is a fundamental
consideration for the Liberal Government
to take into account and act upon. This
fy the right moment, added the Chan-
cellor, and it is imperative in the high-
est interests of civilization to seize it.”

He reiterated his views on woman suf-
frage, which he believes to be a prin-
ciple seizing firmly some of the best
minds {n the country. He added:

“I firmly believe that but for the disas-
trous setback inflicted by militant folly
the Liberal party would have been by
now committed to pressing this great ro-
forin.”

“Milltancy alone holds it back, Unti) it
ceases I despair of success.”

looked were informed that the “discov.
