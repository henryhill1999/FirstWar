Picketed by ten armed men to a block,
Broadway in the hotel and theatre zone
was the scene of last night's continua-
tion of the draft dodger man hunt. In
the afternoon the racetrack crowd at
Belmont Park was raided and two
truckloads \of suspects were hauled to
Brooklyn for examination in thé Twenty-
third Regimeng Armory.

Big hotels 6f Fifth avenue and the
cross streets, including the Plaza, St.
Regis, Ritz-Carlton, Waldorf, Biltmore
and Vanderbilt, also were visited, but
the raiders confined their attention to
kitchen crews, bellhops and upstairs
help. Public rooms were not invaded,
nor were the guests or diners questioned.

By 9 o'clock last night nearly a thov-
sand men had been taken to the West
Forty-seventh street police station from
the Broadway district above Forty-sec-
ond street. The majority of them were
able to get credentials, but automobiles
and trucks manned by sailors were
steadily conveying to the Sixty-ninth
Regiment Armory suspects of whom fu:-
ther proof was demanded by the De-
partment of Justice.

Great crowds watched the roundup,
and here and there a spectator was
plucked out of them and compelled to be-
come a principal in the performance he
had been gleefuliy watching.

'

Taxicabs Are Held Up.

An assortment of large sized soldiers,
gailors, pollee reserves and Américan
Protective Leaguers, accompanied by
police detectives, swarmed up and down
Broadway.

Crowds in hotel and theatre lobbies
were’ searched and taxicabs, touring
cars and street cars were held up. Ina
few doubtful cases of registered men
who had negfected to provide themselves
with classification cards the men were
seized and sent to the West Thirtieth
etreet police station for examination by
Capt. John C. Hammond of the American
Protective League, who maintained a
headquarters there. A number were
sent to the armory for final disposition.

Pr. S. W. Wexler of the Twenty-third
Precinct police reserves picked up
James Kelly, no home, in the raid. He |
had not registered and evaded the doc-
tor’s questions, He was taken to the
armory and ticketed out last night for
the army camp.

Most persons accosted in the street
fer cards or information as to their age
were more than willing to furnish both.
Two young men, however, who had been
polishing their insteps on the brass rail
in a restaurant—and bar—all the eve-
ning showed a disposition to be trucu-
lent when questioned by two plain
clothes men. Three sailors from the
sunken transport President Lincoln de-
cided the air outside was better for ar-
gument and used their own methods,
which were not exactly rough, but frm,
to carry their decision into effect. With
the debating gentlemen backed up
against a convenient taxicab, one un-
comfortably near the exhaust, their
case was decided—that they go to the
station and talk it over with the cap-
tain.

It was a common thing to see young
men walking Broadway with their pre: |
cious blue registration cards and ire. |
classification cards pinned to a coat lapel
or sticking out of their hat bands. They
had been stopped so often that this made
the weeding out process easier for both
themselves and the raiders.

Naval Reserve men “filtered through |
cabaret restaurants, lunchroome, cigar |
stores—everywhere, in fact, except bar- |
rooms, where their presence is prohib-
ited. But these latter were attended to
by members of the American Protective |
League. Off Times Square soldiers or |
sailors with rifles and bayonets were
on duty in cross streets to seé that no
dodger got out of the net in that neigh-
borhood,

 

Sailor Gets a Drink.

One man from Ohio who was dining
with a woman in Lorber's got so ex-
cited when asked for his card that he
neglected to finish his drink before ris-
ing from the table to accompany a sailor. |
The temptation was too great. The sailor |
finished the drink-—-with the authority
of Mr. Hoover, if not Mr. Daniels. It
was the first he (the sailor, not Mr.
Daniels) had had since he joined the
navy a vear ago.

Two alleged slackers were picked up
while they were reading’ the war news
on the bulletin hoards. Now they are
going to make war news, Jack Ham-
mond said.

A young appearing man, with an elas-
tle step, who was evidently going some-
where, was stopped. The soldier nearly
keeled over when he looked into the out-
utretched hand. A geal old fashioned

POLICY

District Boards Will Have
Many Industrial Advisers
and Wealth of Data.

Special Despatch to Tue Sux.

WASHINOTON, Sept. 4.—President Wil-
son has approved the regulations which
are to guide the draft and district boards
in the task of selecting from the 13,000,-
000 men expected to register September
12 those who are to make up the new
armies of the republic.

Provost Marshal General Crowder Is
expected to announce and explain some
of the new regulations to-morrow.

There {s no disposition even at the
White House’ to underrate the impor-
tance of the duty confronting the draft
boards... The ‘problem wes. gone over
again to-day by the President and his
advisers making tp the war cabinet. -

Policy to Be Follewed.

In a general way the policy to be fol-
lowed will be this:

First, while allowing control abso-
lutely to remain with the district boards,
so far as exemptions go, to supply these
boards with indystrial and economic ad-
visers and with facts and figures based
on a nationwide survey Of conditions
made by the War Industries Board, the
Labor Department and other central
agencies.

Second, to see thaf no man is taken
from a place when he cannot be spared
from the standpoint of national welfare
eveh though no application for exemp-
j ton is made by the fndividual in ques-
tion,

Presentation of the industrial needs
of the country upon which this policy is
based will be entrusted to a committee
on the relations between the miltary
and industrial requirements. This com-
mittee already has headquarters here
and t headed by Charles B. Neave. On
it are representatives of the Provost
Marshal General and the War Labor
Administration,

This central committee is to have a
representative to act as an adviser for
each of the district boards of the coun-
try. It will be these district boary
that will exempt men for industrial as
well as social reasons.

Cornerstone Already Laid.

The determination of the essentiality
of industries and occupations has al-
ready been made in a general way by
the War Industries Board, This will
be the cornerstone for the plan for in-
dustrial exemption, Sixty-nine groups
of industries deemed necessary are
comprised in thie plan which will be
announced next Monday.

These groups dre again divided into
four classes with respect to the relative
importance of their products. The groups
comprise indugtries whose continuation
; throughout the period of the war is
deemed essential. There are in addi-
tion some 6,600 industries having a
temporary status as essential due to
their execution of certain war orders,

This status may be changed at any
time, however, but while it remains their
labor needs will be taken care of by the
district board. Included in the essen-
tial groups are many industries not en-
gaged in turning out war supplies, but
whose maintenance is essential to the
needs of the civil population. News-
papers, for example, have been deemed
essential to the public welfare and have
been placed in the fourth class of es-
sential industries,

Determining Factor.

Mere employment in an industry com-
ing within any of these groups will not
of itself be sufficient cause for exemp-
tion from military service. The essen-
tlality of the services of the individual
to the maintenance of that industry is
to be the determining factor. Employers
will be expected ti fille requeste for ex-
emption for those regarded ag indispens-
able to the conduct of their business.

The exemption of the highly trained
officials of banks, trust companies and
other financial institutions from military
service on the ground of their employ-
ment in essential industry will be pos-
sible under the War Department's in-
terpretation of the modifications written
into the mas power law.

Many other occupations and employ-
ments not heretofore regarded by local
boards as warranting deferred classifi-

« Cnicaco, Sept. 4.—Four persons—one

done to the Federal Building and sur-
rounding skyscrapers this afternoon at
8:09 o'clock when a bomt exploded in
the Adams Street entrance of the struc-
ture.

A few minutes later—even while the
injured were receiving first aid treat-
ment at the scene of the blast—the police
and Department of Justice’s machinery
was put into motion. ;

In the excitement wild rumors were

circulated ag to the source of the bomb,
but ‘gradually the idea gained ground
that it was the work of the Industrial
Workers of the World in retaliation for
the sentences recently imposed on ninety-
five members of the organization by
Federal Judge Kenesaw M. Landia.
‘ The “bomb squad” of the Police De-
partment said the bomb was the most
powerful ever used in this city. They
base this declaration on the violence of
the explosion.

Thousands of persons were in the im-

the explosion took place. Within a
stone’s throw women and children were
buying war savings stamps, hundreds of
clerks were sorting mail and other hun-
dreds were passing in or out of the
entrance which crumpled under the force
of the biast.

Three of those killed were passing
when the bomb went off. They were
the sailor, the young woman and the
letter carrier. The explosion blew in
the wall separating the corridor from!
the general delivery room. The wall fell
on the aged department foreman who

had been in the employ of the Post
Office for 35 years. He was killed in-
stantly.

The explosion rocked the entire build-
ing. Fire broke out and all lights were
extinguished. Through the _ flames,
smoke and dust raised by the falling
plaster, men, women and ehil-
dren fied in terror. Parts of the dome
in the center of the immense structure
fell, showering persons in the rotunda
below with glass, plaster and stone.

Bomb Behind Radiator.

The bomb apparently was placed be-}.

hind a radiator just inside the entrance.
So terrific was the blast that the radia-
tor Was blown through a door and into
the street. The ffre department and po-
lice reserves cleared the block, which
was then roped off and patrolled by sol-
diers and sailors with drawn bayonets.
Secret service operatives guarded all en-
trances to the building and none was
permitted to enter and none granted exit
without satisfactory explanation.

One woman was arrested as she at-
tempted to flee the building.

“It is too bad it didn’t kill you all!"
|; She screamed as she struggled with an
officer and several secret service opera-
tives.

The first act of the police and secret
service was to conduct a hurried raid on
the 1. W. W. Headquarters here. Nine
men were arrested. Svores cf others!

building trying to arrange bond pend- }

Outrage Followed Order to Ar-

French Subjects.

Special Cable Despatch to Tum SuN and the
Public Ledger.
Copyright, 1918; all rights reserved.

Lonpon, Sept. 4.—The British Govern-
ment has -made a drastic demand on
the Bolshevist Government of Russia for
reparation and prompt punishment of
the perpetrators of the brutal outrage
when Bolshevist troops attacked the
British Embassy in Petrograd Saturday,
forced an entrance and killed Capt.
Franeis Cromie, the naval attache,
whose body afterward was barbarousty
mutilated.

The attack followed the publication by
the Soviet Government August 29 of a
decree ordering the arrest of all British
and French subjects between the ages of
18 and 40,

At the same time the British Govern-
ment has placed under detention M. Lit-
vinoff, the Soviet Ambassador to Great
Britain, and his staff, holding them as
a hostage until the British representa-
tives are released.

Protest of Great Britain,

The protest of the British Government
reads;

We demand immediate reparation
and the prompt punishment of any
one responsible for or concerned in
this abominable outrage.

Should the Russian Soviet Govern-
ment fail to give complete sat'sfac-
tion, or should any further acts of
violence be committed against a Brit-
ish subject, his Majesty's Government
will hold the members of the Soviet
Government individually respons!ble
and will make every endeavor to se-
cure that they shall be treated as
outlaws by the Governments of all
civilized nations and that no place
or refuge shall be left to them.

You have already been informed
through M. Litvinoff that his Majesty's
Government was prepared to do
everything possible to secure the im-
mediate return of the official repre-
sentatives of Great Britain and of the
Russian Soviet Government to their
respective countries,

His Majesty's Government has
therefore found it necessary to place
M. Litvinoff and the members of his
staff under preventive arrest until
such time as all British representatives
are set at liberty and allowed to pro-
ceed to the Finnish frontier free from
molestation.

Kills Three Before He Falls.

Capt. Cromie made a gallant attempt
to defend the embassy. He killed
three Soviet soldiers with his own
hands before he was struck down, and
his corpse was treated with the worst in-
dignities, Permission to say prayers over
the body was refused to an relish
clergyman. The embassy papers were
ransacked and wholly destroyed.

It is feared now that a similar at-
tack will be made on the French Em-
bassy and the necessary defences have
been prepared. The bulldings occupied
by the French military mission already
have been forced, but the papers pre-
viously had been sent to a place of
safety, Some Frenchmen were put gin-
der arrest,

The Bolsheviki are inciting the pop-

ulation to massacre both British andj

French subjects. It is believed that
there are about 200 British subjects in
Bolshevist Russia, The London Times
says editorialiy: ‘It is not likely that
so audacious a crime was planned and
committed by a mere band of uniformed
brigands.”

“ALLIES ON THE LAST LAP.”

Great French General Says Win-
ning Post Is in Sight.

Lonpon, Sept. 4.—Paris newspapers
printed to-day the following semi-of-
clal statement:

“The hour seems close at hand when
the superb efforts of the AlHes will be-
gin to bear fruit,” one of our great
chiefs said yesterday, ‘We are on the
last lap and close to the winning post.”

With THE British ARMY IN FRANCE,
Sept. 4.—-The Germans to-day are not
standing to fight. Almost without op-
position our line south of the Scarpe
has been pushed forward two to four
miles further east than it was yester-
day morning. There are now no Ger-
mans, except prisoners, from the Sen-
see River, east of Ecourt-St. Quentin,
to the neighborhood of Hermies, a
front of ten miles.

We have left the old battlefields of
Arras behind us. While in the north
we are breaking so far into new terri-
tory that once more we are recovering
civilians trom captured villages, in the
southern part of our advance we are
still fighting on the grounds of the
Cambrai offensive of last year, except
that in places, as between Inchy and
Moevres, we have penetrated further
than then.

Canal Line Covers Cambrat,

Whether the enemy intends to attempt
a stand on the line of the canal is yet
to be seen. He can hardly give up the

out surrendering Cambrai aleo. Qn the
left, to fall back much beyond the wired
defences behind Vitry would be equally
dangerous to his hold on Douai. The
fact that the Germans have dammed the
Scarpe and the Sensee somewiere about
Zcluse to flood the ground would seem to
indicate that they plan to stand on these
lines.

The Germans have fallen back behind
the canal with dramatic suddenness, and
although the final filght was so rapid
that we had difficulty in catching up our
first blow was so shattering and our
pres#Gre since has been so continuous
that in three days we have taken on this
narrow front 16,000 prisoners, making a
total taken by the British armies alone
since the beginning of August of more
than 70,000.

The German official declarations are

WITH THE FRENCH Army, Sept. 4 (2
P. M.).—In spite of the violent artil-
lery reaction of the enemy's batteries
the French advance and the German re-
treat still continue. The two points at
which the French lines were most hotly
bombarded are south of the Aifjlette

River, on the Terny Sorney sector front,
and Venizel, three miles east of Sois-
sons.

The three sectors, where we are most
definitely gaining ground are north of
the Mise. between the Canal du Nord,
and the Noyon—Gulscard-Ham road; |
north of the Allette and northeast, of |
Soisgons, and the entrance tothe Vregny
plateau. Shortly we shall be ad-
vancing north of the Vesle, where in-
cendiary fires and other signs of im-
pending retreat are observed and where
several

There has been a rather long pause
in the advance on this last sector of
the front since the German retreat from
the Marne. It now looks as if the
enemy is on the point of again falling
back without the application
pressure on our part. [Other despatches
report that the German retreat already
| has started north of the Vesle.])

The French and British advance along
[ene Aisne, Ailette. Olse, Somme and
' Scarpe rivers is producing the inevitable
| eftec st. It becomes dally more risky for
the Germans to think of maintaining
their positions between the Vesle and
| the Aisne. They have got to get out to
get from under.

Meanwhile to the west and the north
the armies of Gen. Mangin
‘Humbert are steadily pegging away.
!The entrance to the Vregny plateau now
cuts across the middle of the Cuffics-
Laffauz ravine in a straight line from
'Terny Sorny to Cuey-de-Long, which
our troops entered, Between these points}
the French have taken Clamecy-Ferrier-
Efarm, which is the ledge of the plateau
door and which ts now wide open. The
+ Soissons corner, three miles behind this
| line, ts now entirely freed of the pres-
yetine of the enemy.

North of the Ailette Gen Mangin's
jme n also got still closer to Coucy le
Chateau and crossed the Coucy road,
and reached Jumencourt, a mile north of
the canal and the river.
| North of the Oise Gen, Humbert's
| troops are five miles north of Noyon and
thave taken Busy Bois de Chapitre and
| have got nearly to Crisolles, while lower
'down they cleared Champ de Manoeuvres
and established footings in Hill 103 on
the Ham road. Better still, his cavalry
are within half a mile of Guiscard,

Gradually, therefore, the French are
etting around Chauny and Noyon Mas-
sif, pushing forward in the south to the
still more important position of St. Go-
bain Forest.

Every 500 yards for eix miles along the

WITH THE AMERICAN ARMY ON THE
Ves.e Front, Sept. 4.—A German with-
drawal from the Vesle has begun, Com-
bat patrols of Americans and French
are close on their heels to the west of |
Bazoches and eastward to a point be-)
yond Fismes.

Smart machine gun resistance is be- |
ing encountered. By all indications the
Germans have withdrawn their main
hodies to the north, possibly preparatory
to crossing the Aisne.

Light forces of Americans have ad-
vanced their lines some distance north
of thé Vesle. |

It became more apparent to-day that
the Germans had given up the struggle |
to maintain a foothold north of the Vesle ;
American and French artillery continued ;

City, but Find No Germans
Remaining There.

NvdON, Sept. 4.—While the Brit-
tie continue to push forward on
their part of the battle front in west-
ern France, crossing the Canal du
Nord and the Tortille River on a
wide front north of Moislains, which
is about three miles north of Peronne
and occupying a considerable number
of villages, among them Moeuvre,
which is only six miles west of Cam-
bral, the great movement in the south
now apparently is under full head-
way. The French to-day scored big
gains northeast of Noyon, forcing a
general retreat of the Germans, who
are closely pursued by French and
American forces,

The greatest gains were made
north of the Vesle, which has been
crossed on a front of nearly twenty
miles, This retreat, which bids fair
to open the flank of the powerful
Chemin des Dames position and to
enable the French to turn the Hin-
denburg line at its southern end,
thus disorganizing the entire German
position in this region, is likely to
have the most far-reaching results,
including as a possibility in the not

! distant future the German evacuation

of most of the territory held in north-
ern France, following a prior retire
ment for temporary defence, to a
line running from Valenciennes to
the Meuse, far in the rear of the
present front.

In fact the Germans are giving
way and in slow retreat on the entire
line from Ypres to Rheims, a front
of more than 150 miles. The move-
ment was most rapid in the north up
to to-day; now the south is pushing

{It closely for speed.

Flight Is Precipitate.

The retreat of the Germans north
of the Vesle is hasty, almost precipi-
tate. All to-day large convoys were
seen moving to the rear and bridges
are being destroyed.

The Allies’ advanced guards in the
pursuit of the enemy north of the
beyond Libermont and

reached the outskirts of Esmery-Hai-

lon and also have occupied the Bois
de l'Hospital, Further south the line
extends along Freniches, Guiscard,
Grandru and Appily.

Crossing the Ailette the French
{reached Marizelle,enortheast of Mani-
camp. North of the Aisne Bucy-le-
'Long and Moncel have been taken.
After crossing the Vesle the French
aavanced beyond Chassemy, Brenelle,
\auberlin, Vauxeere and Blanzy and

gained a footing on the northern crest
of Baslieux. This represents a pene-

tration of about three miles. To the

     

 

 

 

north of Novon the Germans were
pushed back to the east of the Canal
du Nord
The Americans who are operating
with the French, are apparently on
‘the eastern end of this sector, from
east of Fismes to west of Bazoches,
en the Vesle River, which they crossed
to-day at both places in hot pursuit
