“WE WILL OBEY THE DEOISION
OF TUE COURT,” SAYSJ.d. HILL,

 

 

General Beller te That Hach Share of
Northern Securities Stock Wil Be
Given Up fer @ Pro Rata Allotment
From the Company’s Combined Assets,

Officers of the Northern Securities Com-
pany were ip consultation all day yesterday
at tho offices of the company, 26 Liberty
street, with directors and lawyers who
bave represented the company in the various
stages of litigation. Among those who
called for consultation with James J. Hill
were former United States Attorney-General
Griggs, Daniel 8. Lamont, John 8. Kennedy
and Col. W. P. Clough, general counsel to
the company, who returned from Wash-
ington on Monday night, Col. Clough eaid
that be had not been able to seoure a copy
in full of the decision as yet and James J.
Hill made the following statement:

*Anide from the statement that the North-
ern Securities Company will obey the de-
cision of the Supreme Court, there is noth-
ing tosay. Until full copies of the opinion
and decree of the court have been received
and our attorneys have had an opportunity
io advise Us es to our course of procedure,
the officers of the Northern Securities
Company can make no further announce-
ment.”

Despatches from Montreal yesterday
said that a corporation known as the
Northern Securities Company of Canada,
organized under a charter given by the

Dominion Government in 1902, would take
the place of the ne Ni ern Securities
Company as g company for the

Great ped Northern Pacific roads.
\ hen this report was brought to the a tten-
ion topes ny ne per

“We have as muci notion of incorporating
a company in Mars or the moon as in Canada.
4\| such repotts urd, We intend
10 conforma to the law.”

The annual meeting of the stockholders
of the Northern Pacific Railway, which
has been adjourned from time to time in
anticipation of the Northern Securities
decision, was ain adjourned yesterday
until May 17. No action will be taken by
the stockholders, represented in large part
hy the Northern Securities Company, until
the text of the merger decision and the
decree which it confirms have been read
and construed by the counsel to the North-
ern Securities Company and a way has been
found for the distribution of the Northern
Pacific and Great Northern stock held by
the Northern Securities Company.

Although the ruling interests in the
Northern Securities Company have not
as yet divulged the way in gest i this dis-
tribution will be carried out, it is believed
that it will be done through &@ pro rata
Re over of the stocks, This method
was used by the Standard Oil interests
npon the liquidation of the Standard Oil
trust, each stockholder receiving his pro
rata share of the stock of each CRApe ying
company irrespective of what stock he
deposited. In this way the control of each
pt the subsidiary companies remained in
the hands of the controlling interest, as
would be the case if a similar ractice was
purs rsued in the liquidation of the Northern

urities Company.

It was pointed out yesterday that there
poveriee cally 3,650,000 shares of Northern

ties outstanding and that each share
of Northern Securities in a@ pro rata dis-
tribution of assets would receive about
183-865 of a share of Northern Pacific, the
+t ck of that road held by the Securities
(@nopany being $153,000,000, and 92-365 of a
share of Great Northern, the Securities
Coss reg helees about $92,000,000 of Great
In addition, holders of
Nerdiera nana would receive about
$1.12 in stocks of other companies and 25
cents incash. The Union Pacific's subsid-
lary lines hold about $82,000,000 of Northern
Securities stock, which is deposited as se-
curity for Oregon Short Line participating
4 per cent. co tera] bonds.

Northern Securities stock on the curb
yesterday opened at 86, an advance of %
of a point, and early in the afternoon ad-
vanced to 88%. It closed at 89 on a fifty
share transaction after sales of about 3,600
shares during the day. The extreme ad-
vance was 3 oints. In the general mar-

THE READING AND THE B. & O.

The Northern Securities Decision Doesn’t
Affect Them, It Is Said.

BALTmMoRE, March 15.—In Baltimore
and Ohio Railroad official circles here the
Northern Securities decision is not regarded
as bearing upon the relations existing be-
tween that company and the Reading or
the relations between the Pennsylvania
and the Baltimore and Ohio. An authority
in the cor. fidence of the management said
this evenin

“The decision does not touch upon a
ownership of securities by one road in
another where the authority is given in the
company’s charter. In fact, the Govern-
ment disclaimed any intention of question-
ing such ownership. Its case rested upon
the claim that the Northern Securities
Company was a device to evade the Sher-
man law, and that it was brought into ex-
istence for this purpose.

“The Baltimore and Ohio opnership fn
the Reading is for the pu f preventing
it from being shut out of New York. WwW ithe
out this ownership there was always danger

 

 

of some one getting control of that propert
and breaking up the  thrcugh servi rvice ofthe
Baltimore and Reading

connection and ‘nok a patie of tae
Baltimore and Ohio.”

DIVIDEND PASSED.

Cern Products Common Reaches a New
Low Point at 12 1-4.

’ The directors of the Corn Producta Com-

pany met yesterday and passed the divi-

dend on the $45,000,000 of common stock

of the company, declaring the regular divi-
dend of 1% per cent. on the preferred, The
common stock hag been receiving 4 per cent.
but there have been rumors recently that
the dividend would be and the stock
has been breakin y for several weeks
and touched a new low record at 12% yes-
terday. The secretary of the company
issued a statement after the meeting con-
taining an estimate of $5,000,000 as the total
earnings for the year and announcing that
from this there tnd b been nicty: $420,000
for interest on bonds and sree? for re-
building and remodelling p! In view
of the large expense ts incurred for improve-
ments during the past year the statement
added, no action was taken as to the divi-
dend on the common stock.

GOSSIP or WALL STREET.

The optimistic reception of the Northern
Becurities decision in London made a consid-
siderable impression upon’ sentiment here.
ae stocks in the London market were

at advances of from X to 1 per cent.
over Monday's closing prices when Wall
Street opened for Pianos yesterday morn-
ing, and in the course of the forenoon the in-
ternational houses bought between 25,000
and 90,000 shares of stock on orders from
the other side. The bulk of this buying
‘was supposed to be for short account. The
heavy foreign buying of Erie was thought
to be rather algnificant. London has had
excellent information on Erie at times.

“I think,” said one of the best informed
operators in Wall Street yesterday, “that
the situation has been greatly cleared by
the Northern Securities decision, You will
prohably see one crowd after another come
out of hiding and resume operations. I’m
not looking for a big bull market, but I do
expect to see closer attention given to the
facts of the situation, which are not as bear-
ish as many have supposed them tobe, When
the Street is bearish you get nothing but
bear talk; it would be all the other way if
sentiment should develop a bullish bias
tn the next few weeks, We might learn, for
example, that the increased value of our
cotton exports for two inonths would more
than equal the Panama payments, whereas
only a few days ago we were disturbed lest
the Panama transaction upset our money
market. We might also be made to realize
that the increased value of our cotton crop
a good deal more thangays for the Baltimore
fre. With the Northern Securities decision
out of the way the other factors in the situa-
tion fall readily into their proper perspective.
Various matters of bullish consequence have
been held back because the financial com-
munity was unresponsive to good news
while the Northern Securities decision was
hanging over the market. Now that that
has been got out of the way we may be able
to get some good news, You will recall that
a great to-do was made over the drought
in the Southwest and conditions elsewhere
not altogether favorable to winter wheat.
Well, crop conditions, especially in the South~-
west, have greatly improved, and perhaps
a may find time to give some thought to
that.”

A loan for one year is reported to have
been made in Wall Street at 44 per cent.

The statement by Attorney-General Knox
that the Administration would not “run
amuck” was widely quoted in financial circles
yesterday.

The sharp recovery in the price of Northern
Securities stock on the curb yesterday had a
very tmportant effect upon sentiment. Clark,
Dodge & Co. were said to be the principal
buyers. They were the largest buyers on
Monday, taking etock freely on the decline
that followed the announcement of the North-
ern Securities decision.

It was the observation of specialists {n all
of the active stocks yesterday that the buying
was largely for ahort account. The extent
of the short interest had evidently been under-
estimated. The market's exhibition of
strength on the opening nonplussed the bear
element, but the disposition of the room
crowd all through the forenoon was to resist
the advances. Prices hardened steadily in
spite of professional selling. By noon trading
was at almost a standstill, the London buying
having by that time ceased. Some of the
best floor critics thought at this hour that the
market was likely to sag. The bear con-
tingent evidently thought so. The bull
crowd seemed indifferent. It was the heavy
buying of Erie from 234 up to 25% that started
the shorts on a pell mell retreat. To find
a parallel for the covering movement that
ensued one would have to go back to the be-
ginning of one of several bear panics last
year. Yesterday's bear scare could hardly
be called a panic, but the buying in the last
hour was of an extremely urgent character,
and at the close the bear contingent was more
nervous than it had been at any time in several
months.

On the violent advances in the late trading
Western houses appeared to be selling the
market rather freely, but it was a question
where their selling was of long stocks or for
the short account. Gates & Co., who were
reported in the forenoon to be ‘buying the
market, were said in the afternoon to be sell-
ing stocks. Gates & Co. and Wrenn Bros.
were perhaps the heaviest sellers of Erie
above 25.

There was a smaller borrowing demand
for stocks in the loan department yesterday
afternoon than on Monday, and a good many
borrowed etocks were returned. The oom-
parison, however, is made with a demand on
Monday of unusually large proportions.
The borrowing yesterday afternoon would
be considered large under norma! conditions.
Penneylvania was etill being heavily bor-
rowed, the short interest in that stock having
diminished less than the average. There
was alsoa fairly active demand for Metro-
politan. After Pennsylvania, the railroad
stocks in greatest request were Union Paciflo
and St. Paul.

The buying of Erie was easily the most
prominent feature of the market in the after-
noon. The scarcity of offerings caused the
price to advance very abruptly on what
brokers described as good buying. London
began it. Hallgarten & Co., Halle & Stieg-
litz, Ladenburg, Thalmann & Co. and Worm-
eer were said to be the heaviest buyers on
the rise. The rumor was revived that Erie
would somehow fit into the “alternative plan’
of those who ere responsible for the Northern
Securities Company. It did not transpire
during the day what basis, if any, there was
for this rumor, but it has been believed for
some weeks in various Wall Street quarters
that something is about to be done with
the Erie property. The recent trading in
Erie issues has given the impression to close
observers that they were being accumulated
for some particular purpose. The first trans-
action in Erie firet preferred on Monday after
the announcement of the Northern Securi-
ties decision was at an advance of 1 per cent.
Erie has been bulled so many times before
on rumors of an imaginary deal that the
Wall Street community is naturally sceptical.

The Wormsers appeared to be supporting
Metropolitan yesterday. There was also
some Philadelphia buying. It was asserted

that the stock to be liquidated had al) been
ot

There are intimations of another bull cam-
fn Brooklyn Rapid Transit, based

upon valuable privileges which, it is alleged,
the company js to receive from the city. The
stock was very strong yesterday on buying
of a somewhat miscellaneous character.
Hallgarten & Co., E. C. Potter & Co. and
Halsted & Hodges appeared init rather promi-
nently. There isenid to be an abiding political
interest in the stock.

The increase of legitimate commission
business yesterday was something nominal.

This, so far as is known, will be the first
appearance for 1904 of the late Daniel Drew’s
sagacious injunction: “Don't sell the market
short when the sap is running up.” In the
forty odd years that have elapsed since Mr,
Drew delivered himeelf of this piece of wis-
dom it has never failed at the proper season
to ornament the writings of optimistic Wall
Street commentators. It is, perhaps, the
best known and most respected quotation
fn the spring stock, and to use it first without
using ‘it too soon has long been a point of
rivalry among financia) writers. It appears
this year to have been almost forgotten,
The middle of March is unusually late for it,

The governors of the Stock Exchange have
been petitioned by the members to close the
{nstitution on Good Friday, which falls on
April 1, and also dn the following Saturday.
It is customary to close the exchange on
Good Friday, Only once in recent years
have the governors refused to do so. That
wes in 1808, when the strained situation be-
tween this country and Spain made It seem
advisable to remain open. The governors

will act next Wednesday on the petition
presented.

to 188 shares Lackawanns broke 9 pointe in
venday’s session. Yesterday on transac-
tions of but 400 shares it advanced 13 points,
