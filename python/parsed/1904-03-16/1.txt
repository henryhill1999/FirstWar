Admiral Makaroff left Port Arthur after
the fight last Thursday and sailed in the
direction of Vladivostok in an endeavor
to effect a junction with the Vladivostok
squadron,

1¢ le recognized that {f the fleet has suc-
coeded in getting out of the port and man-
ages to evade the Japanese & new andserious
situation will be created. Thé reports are
doubted.

However, it is belleved that Admiral
Togo is aware of any moves of the Rus-
sian ahips, and if they are outside he is
keeping in touch with them to compel
an action which, it is hoped, will be de-
olsive. That .idmiral Makaroff should
make an attempt to get out is not regarded
ag improbable, as in the event of the Port
Arthur fleet reaching Vladivostok the
largest vessels could dovk and st would
have a base possessing sufficient defences.
Such a forlorn hope might conceivably
@ucceed, while the keeping of the fleet

* at Port Arthur is viewed as hopeless, in-

volving its certain loss,

In unofficial quarters, where there is &
diaposition to believe Admiral Makaroff
got out last Friday night, it is said that
the Vladivostok squadron also put to sea
to meet the Port Arthur fleet, and news
of @ great battle is hourly expected. It is
asserted that Admiral Togo has not divided
his battleship squadron, He is resolved
to keep six of his battleships together.

STORY DOUBTED IN LONDON.

Lowpow, March 16.—The rumor of Port
Arthur’s fall has followed that of the Japa-
nese occupation of southern Manchuria
into oblivion, and it is predicted here that
the story of Admiral Makaroff’s dash out
of Port Arthur will prove equally false.
If, however, it turns out that the Russians
have chosen this desperate move in prefer-
ence to the apparently inevitable loss of
their vessels at Port Arthur, it is assumed
that Admiral Togo will easily catch them
long before they can reach Vladivostok,
which is more than a thousand miles away.

It is regarded as incredible that the Rus-
sians could have slipped out without the
Japanese knowing it, although it is sug-
gested that they would be allowed to steam
outaide the protection of their shore bat-
teries before they were attacked. Against
the report that the Russians got out on
Friday there is a report of an engagement
on Sunday, in which the cruiser Diana
was damaged. This report is not cone
firmed, and no details are given.

OUR COLORS PROTECTED THEM.

Amerioan Refugees From Northern Corea
Were Well Treated.

Special Cable Despatch to Taw Sux.
CuEMULPHO, March 15.—The United

States cruiser Cincinnati arrived here
to-day from Chinnampho. She brought
twenty-two women and three men from
the northern missions and mines. All
are well. They journeyed to Chinnampho
in carte and palanquins bearing American
flags.

The party from the mines were escorted
to Ping Yang. They met near Anju two
amall parties of Cossacks, but were not
molested. The Japanese at Ping Yang
requested the refugees while they were
there to wear bands on their arms made of
American oolors. This was done and the
Americans were allowed to enter and leave
the town as they pleased.

While going to the coast from Ping Yang
they were stopped and questioned five
times by Japanese, who treated them cour-
teously. The Japanese were everywhere
in great force.

The refugees warmly praise the officers
ofthe Cincinnati for the treatment ac-
corded them. The officers gave up their
cabins for their use. An American miner
who was returning to the mines from Ping
Yang was arrested as a Russian spy, but
was soon released.

Wasninaton, March 15.—Commander
Newton G. Mason of the cruiser Cincinnati
pl ie the Navy Department from
Chern: , Corea, to-day that he had
returned there from Chinnampho, where
he went to get Americans. He said that
he brought away twenty-five refugees.

. PROTESTS FROM NEWCHWANG.

Americans Object te the Withdrawal of
the Gunbeoat Helena.
Spectal Cable Despatch to Tam Sun.

Yuoraxow, March 15.—The residents of
Newchwang are indignant over what they
regard as the hurried withdrawal of the
American and British gunboats before the
treaty port rights and consular jurisdiction
are nullified or even actually imperilled.
The Japanese handed over their consulate
and other interests to the British, and the
Russians did the same to France. Thus
all intereste at the port are neutralized,
and none is threatened.

It is complained that a premature aban-
@onment of the protection to which the in-
habitants are acoustomed is inexcusable
neglect, inviting depredations against for-
eigners, especially the Americans and
British. An official protest has been sent
to the United States by the Americans.

 

 

taken the protection of the railroad and
that ite abandonment will probably lead
to its destruction by the Russians if they
retreat. ;

 

Commander Sawyer of the gunboat

Helena was ordered to leave Yingkow as
eoon as the oe would permit and report
to the Admiral of the fleet at Shangha!.

SKIRMISH AT THE YALU.

Rasstans Report Hepulse of Japanese
Mounted Foroe.
Spectal Cable Deopatches to Tas Sux.

Lompon, March 15.—A telegram from
Port Arthur, dated yesterday and sent
via 8t. Petersburg, says that in a skirmish
between Russians and Japanese on the
banks of the Yalu the horses of the Japan-
ese were killed by the Russians’ fire, and
the Japanese cavalry had to flee on foot,
A second skirmish is reported near Anju.
The Japanese were driven back.

Lawpor, March 16.—The Tientsin corre-
spendent of the Siendard says that the
Chiness Board of Foreign Affairs has re-
ceived @ Chinese official telegram report-

 

 

 

ing an encounter between the Russians and
the Japanese at Fengwangcheng last Thurs-
day, resulting in favor of the Japanese.
The story is discredited by military ex-
perts,

GRAND DUKE CYRIL THERE,

Member of the Impertal Family Joins Port

Special Cable Despatch to Tux Sun,

Sr, PeTerspura, March 15.—Grand Duke
Cyril has arrived at Port Arthur. He was
received with the customary solemnities
bestowed upon members of the imperial
family.

Three torpedo boat destroyers which will
have a speed of 28 knots are being built
at the Nikolaleff works, and a swift cruiser
is being built at Kagoul, Two battleships
will be commenced soon at the Nikolaieff
works,

 

AMERICAN PROPERTY SEIZED.
Trading Company’s Buildings at Newchwang
Commanudeered.

Special Cable Despatch to THe Sun.

Lonvon, March 16.—The Newchwang
correspondent of the Express says that the
continued seizure of neutral property at
that place by the Russians has caused the
consuls to protest in the strongest terms to
Admiral Alexieff. The buildings and mer-
chandise of the American Trading Com-
pany were commandeered on Sunday.

The despatch adds that a renewed out-
break of lawlessness on the part of bandits
in Manchuria is causing an exodus of the
inhabitants. There is a stream of refugees
moving south,

RECALLS

Japan Orders Them Back to Seoul From
Northern Corea.
Spectal Cable Despatch to THR Stn,

Srovun, March 15.—The Japanese have
withdrawn the permits they recently issued
allowing correspondents to go to the front.
Those who went to Ping Yang and Anju
have been ordered to return to Seoul to
await tho issuing of other permits.

This is interpreted as meaning that secret
movements are impending.

INCIDENTS OF THE BATTLE,

Survivors Tell How One Jap Leaped on
Russian Ship and Killed Commander.
Special Cable Despatch to THE SUN.

Toxio, March 15.—A steamship bringing
the dead and wounded from the fight at
Port Arthur last Thursday has reached
Sasebo. The survivors relate an exciting |
story of a personal encounter between a
Japanese sailor and the captain of the |
Russian destroyer Stereguschtchi. When |
the Japanese destroyer on which the sailor |
was closed with the Russian vessel, the |
Japanese sailor sprang aboard and met
the commander emerging from his cabin.
They sprang at each other, and the sailor
brought his cutlass down upon the head
of the Russian, felling him. He endeavored
to rise, but the sailor kicked him over-
board and he was drowned.

The report of the death of Engineer
Minamisawa, the hero of the fight between
the Russian and the Japanese destroyers,
is premature.

The survivors of the Port Arthur en-
counter between destroyers say that the

|

NEWSPAPER MEN.

Stereguschtchi and another Russian de-
stroyer were surrounded by four Japanese
destroyers, which kept up a continuous
fire upon them. The Russians fought
with the utmost bravery. Their captains
tried to make a running fight, break through
the Japaneee cordon and reach the harbor.
One of them succeeded, but the Stere-
guschtchi became hopelessly damaged and
at the mercy of the Japanese.

The Japanese accounts say that only the
dead were left on board the Stereguschtchi.
The Russians fought bravely, and when
escape was impossible leaped into the sea.
The vessel was shot as full of holes as a

wasps’ nest. Over twenty dead bodies |
lay on the bridge

The London Daily Mail's report of the
virtual destruction of Port Arthur is dis-
credited here. Six battleships circled five
times. The range and aim were effective,
but comparatively few shots were fired.
They were all 12-inch shells.

JAPAN'S NEW WAR TAXES.

Americans Interested in the Tobacco
Monopoly Part of the Plan.
Speciai Cable Despatch to THe SUN.

Tox10, March 15.—-A special meeting of
the Cabinet was held yesterday, and it de-
cided the final form of the financial measures
previously reported. The added revenues
are to come from three sources—increased
taxation, public loans and reduction of or-
dinary expenditures.

From the first source, taxation, 65,000,000
yen is expected, as follows: From land
tax, nearly 26,000,000 yen; from income and
business, each over 5,000,000; from sugar,
over 7,000,000; from silk cloth, 4,000,000; from
woollen cloth, 2,000,000; from kerosene,
1,000,000; from the salt monopoly, nearly
8,000,000, and from the manufactured to-
bacco monopoly, 4,000,000 yen. These items
will net the Government, because of the

of the revenue establishment |
which must be deducted this year and here-
after, 60,000,000 yen, and other similar |
sources of revenue will net 8,000,000 yen.

From the second genera! source of rev-
enue, the public loan, 100,000,000 yen will
be derived. The Diet will be asked to ap-
prove the loan just issued and authorize a
further one.

From the third source, reduction of
ordinary éxpenditures, from 50,000,000 to
80,000,000 yen will be obtained by administra-
tive reforms and the postponing of public
works,

Large American interests are involved
fn the manufactured tobacco monopoly.

The Jiji Shimpo says the whole scheme
is to put the greatest burden on the greatest
number, but there are fears of opposition
from certain classes to the smaller items
and to the salt tax. Instead of trifling,
harmfu) taxes, says the paper, the Govern-
ment should inorease the land tax, though
the Government probably thinks it would
be opposed in this by the lower house.

The Jiji Shimpo thinks the tobacco
monopoly unpopular. It was once before
proposed and failed to receive the Diet’s
approval.

JAPAN'S SPIES IN RUSSIA.

2,800 Educated Men Volunteered for the
Dangerous Service.
Spectal Cable Despatch to Tue Sux.

Lonpon, March 16.—The St. Petersburg
correspondent of the Hzpress says that
Japan has organized a wonderfully com-
plete system of spies throughout Russia.
They are etationed at St. Petersburg,
Moscow and Odessa and along the Siberian
Railway in various disguises.

It is stated’ that 2,500 educated Japanese
volunteered for this dangerous service,
fully aware that death was inevitable if
they were discovered.

TRLL OF RUSSIAN FRIENDSHIP,

CASSINI’S KINDLY LETTER TO A
NEW YORK CLUB.

 

 

Backed Up by Speeches From Her Consul-
General and Vice-Consul—All at a
Russian Evening at the Waldorf
—Woman’s High Power in That Country

The Cooperative Entertainment Club,
which aims to give unusual entertainments,
had “An Evening in Ruseia” at the Waldorf-
Astoria last night. Dr. George Donaldson
presided, and twenty Russians, led by Alex-
ander Trofemovitch of the choir of the
Russian Orthodox Church of Bridgeport,
Conn., sang Russian folk songs before the
speech making and in the intermissions.

Count Cassini, the Russian Ambassador,
had been invited, but instead sent a letter
of regret to Mrs, Roswell D. Hitchcock, the
president of the club. The letter, which
was read, was as follows:

I wish I could make you know how keenly
disappointed I am that my official duties ang
my physician have conspired to preve
my accepting your very tempting invitation
for to-morrow evening. I should thoroughly
enjoy a journey in thought to my home coun-
try under your sympathetio and skilful guid-
ance. Moreover, I should Uke to show by
my presence at your gathering how very
deeply I am interested in this effort of your
club to bring more of your countrymen and
country women toa fuller knowledge and to
that keener appreciation which knowledge
gives of Russia‘and the Russian people, and
of the sentiments of friendship which ever
existed between the two peoples.

Accept mv warmest thanks for the very
cordial invitation and for the welcome which
I realize awaits me. In your efforts to bring
closer together your people and mine in tha’
broad sympathy of thought and action which
is the strongest bond two nations can have,
you and your associates are performing the
nighest and noblest mission intrusted to se
diplomat—the maintenance and cultivation
of friendliness between his own and the
country to which he is accredited.

Wishing you and your associates the best
success in your splendid work and thanking
you for your words of friendliness and cor-
diality, believe me to be, my dear Mrs. Hitch-
cock, sincerely yours, CASSINI.

Oliver G. J. Schadt, president of the
People’s College of Philadelphia, opened
the oratorical batteries. For twenty years
Mr. Schadt was tutor in the family of a
member of Alexander II.’s Cabinet in the
civil war. Mr. Schadt said that we owe
a great debt to Russia and at this time
we should show our gratitude. In the civll
war, he said, Russia sent her fleet to this
country for no other reason than to pro-
tect this country from the eucenh Powers.

William Everett Hicks @ speech
along similar lines and there was some
enthusiasm. He was followed by more
folk songs and stereoptioon pictures of
Ruasian scenes. ‘

Baron Schilling, the firet Vioce-Consul
of Russia, then spoke. In part he said:

You are aware of the attitude which a part
of the American press has taken against y
country. .This is a non-pollt evening
and I therefore do not wish to speak of the
misrepresentations whic to have
misled some of the American newspapers.
But does this attitude of certain organs just]
express the sentiment of this country

ardly!

I never have believed it, nor do I expect
to have to change my opinion, and I am Se
to say that to-night ] am more convinced than
ever that it would be wrong to judge of the
genera] sentiment by some utterances of the

ress, and I base my opinion on the firm be-

ef that the American people cannot forget
an old friendship which never was clouded;
and knowing the American character, I may
be permitted to say that every true American
who has his heart in the right spot will never
forget his friends! And that I am right in
saying this, your presence, ladies and gentle-
men, is a proof.

1 regret not to find the right words to ex-
press our thanks for all your sympathies as
sincerely a8 my countrymen here present
and | feel it. But, more Crpet aly 1 wish
to thank the president of the Cooperative
Entertainment Club, to whose work an
efforts the success of this evening is chiefly

due.

But if there were some difficulties, a ree
dent of this club did not meet any In the
main point, namely, in findin friends”
of Russia, to which your presence here, ladies
and gentlemen, so courteously testifies,

The last 6 er of the evening was
Nicolas F peereke the Russian Con-
sul-General in this city,

The Russian Consul-General began by
impressing on his hearers the fact that
Russia “is a great Christian nation,
designed by the Almighty to accomplish
a great Christian mission on earth.” en
he said that to understand Russia, one must
understand that her most characteristic
feature is “the general unquestioned and
unquestionable recognition of the noble
réle of woman, of the exalted power of the
mother, the bride, the sister and the daugh-
ter, through the whole wide domain of life,
in family, in seciety and in State.” In
concluding he id:

I need scarcely explain that being self
brought up in the covpene regard to a most
sincere recognition of the blessed power of
woman in the life of family, of nations a:
all humanity, and witnessing this evening
that the Russian Christian cause in America
is now being taken up by distinguished Ameri-
can ladies, I believe and hope that by mea:
of your moral (non-political) sympathy, the
Christian cause will advance.

Now, I venture to assure you that this
evidence of your moral sympathy, when dul
hown in my country, will be received wi
deepest gratitude. It will be oensidered as a
new page in the glorious history of 130 ye

of American-Russian friendship.

Begun by Washington and Catherine the
Great, continued by all their successors, this
friendship had one of its culminating pointe
in the of the ninetewath century,
when President Lincoln and Emperor Alexan-
der II. simultaneously holsted the standard
of liberty. abolishing slavery here and serf-
OOP it not a mont isnreesive Metorical

sit not a most impressive rical event
that both these benefactors of humanity
should by their innocent b Re have paid for
the freedom they gave to millions? And I sug-
& n this case
you that “blood is t

has cemented forever the traditional friend-
ehip between America and Russia.

TROLLEYS OVER NEW BRIDGE,

5 CENTS FROM EITHER BOROUGH
TO ANY PART OF THE OTHER.

 

 

Metropolitan and BH. BR. T. Agree te &
Joint Use, the Manhattan Cars to Ran
to the Brooklyn End, the Brooklyn Cars
te the Manhattan End, by July 2.

After a conference of over two hours
yesterday with the Mayor, the Metropolitan
company and the Brooklyn Rapid Transit
Company agreed to cooperate in operating
cars over the Williamsburg Bridge. The
conference was attended by Comptroller
Grout, Bridge Commissioner Best, Presi-

dent A. E. Orr and Chief Engineer Parsons |

of the Rapid Transit Commission, President
Winter of the Brooklyn Rapid Transit
Company, President Vreeland of the Metro-
politan company, and Chief’ Engineer
Nichols of the Bridge Department.

The conferencé ended in the submission
of this agreement by Messrs. Winter and
Vreeland:

Hon. Georne B. McClellan, Mayor of the etly
of New York:

Dean Sir: In compliance with your [ =
uest that we work out some plan by which
the surface lines may be connected with,
nd operated over, the Willamaburg
ridge at the earliest possible moment wit
a view to meeting the public demand for
transit facilities over that bridge, we now
beg to propose the following plan, which,
as to most of the connections involved, can
be put Into operation by July 1 provided
the work in charge of the Commissioner of

Bridges is completed in time.

Arrangements offered by the Brooklyn
Rapid Transl Company.—The cars from ye
system of that compuny will, be operat
to the New York terminus of the mare.
where passengers will be received and
livered. No additional fare will be charged
for carrying Brooklyn Rapid Transit passen-
fers over the bridge to and from the New

ork terminal.

Arrangements offered by the New York
City Railway Company operating the Metro-
politan system.—The Metropolitan System
will be connected with the bridge and the
Pietropoliten cars will be operated to the
Brooklyn terminal of the bridge and there
receive and deliver passengers. No addition-
tional fare will be charged for carrying Metro-
pobtan passengers over the bridge to and
rom the Brooklyn termina).

Local Bridge Service.—Bridge cars will
be operated between the Brookdyn and New
York terminals of the bridge for a fare of
three cents or two tickets for five cents.

Recognizing your desire that arrange-
ments for the traffic over the bridge be com-
pleted as promptly as possible, we are pre:
pared to take up at once with the municipal
authorities the working out of the detalles of
this plan, provided it meets with your ap-
proval, Yours very respectfully

; WINTERS, President.
H. H. VREELAND, President.

New York, March 13.

The effect of the agreement is that the
two companies will each use two of the
six tracks on the bridge for the ca ng
of their passengers to the opposite b cee
terminal, while the remaining two tracks
will be used for the running of shuttle

e care, The power for t shuttle
cars will be supplied by the two companies.
Terms satisfactory to the two companies
are yet to be fixed by the Bridge Com-
mission. Mayor McClellan anticipates that
there will be no hitch in arranging terms.

If the scheme Aree through Mr. Vree-
land promises to have electricity installed
on the Fourteenth street line from Second
avenue to Avenue B and down Avenue A
to the bridge by July 1. He will also ex-
tend the electric power on the Eighth street
and East Broadway lines by that time and
will have Grand street in readiness to con-
nect by the fall.

Comptroller Grout is very much pleased
at the proposition of both companies to
go over the bridge. It is what he has ad-
vocated all along and it was at his sug-
gestion, so he said, that the interests pects
sented by Mr. Vreeland were induc to
consider the Williamsburg Bridge proposi-
tion at all. One day Mr. Vreeland was in
his office on other business and the Comp-
troller asked him why his company did
not try to get the franchise over the Wil-
liamsbur, rage, He held out the pogsi-
bilities o! err ng the big working clase
district of Williamsburg, all the population
of which by this scheme will now have
access to all Manhattan or all of it reached
by the Metropolitan's cars for five cents.
Mr. Vreeland agreed that it would be a
good business proposition.

$200,000,000 FOR RUSSIA.

Plan of Securing Money Abroad Said to
Have Succeeded.
Special Cable Despatch to THE SUN.
CoLoGNE, March 15.—A despatch to the
Cologne Gazette from St. Petersburg says
that a financial paper published in the Rus-
sian capital asserts that a group of interna-
tional financiers ha: undertaken to obtain
for Russia $200,000,000 for war expenditures,
conditionally on repayment after the war.
The loan will take the form of consolidated
stock. The Government will take up the
loan only when its existing resources have
been exhausted, a contingency that cannot
arise for a considerable time.

Can't call it a comfort.

Haven't you felt a cold
shiver when black - daubed
hands turned up your trou-
sers?

And when you've paid

dime for a sticky coat

of turpentine and lampblack
you can't feel that your shoes
are clean.

The “convenience” is a bit
doubtful, too.

Takes ten minutes at least.

A three-minute session at
home with Regal Shoe
Dressing will give you a real
shine; a smooth, clean, dura-
ble, satiny shine for some-

under a cent.

(incidentally a shine that
dresses the leather—makes
it pliant and supple.)

At all Regal Stores—25 Cents
