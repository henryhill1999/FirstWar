NOIAL AND COMMERCIAL.

Tuxspay, March 15.

A rally in prices in the stock market
to-day was due upon any theory of market
action and reaction and probably could
not under any ordinary circumstances have
been long postponed. It was, however,
directly to be accounted for by the results
of the more or less careful study by the
financial community of the opinions handed
down in the Supreme Court yesterday
and it was a sharp lesson to those specu-
lators who are in the habit of making market
ventures upon hasty deductions drawn
from “rushed” news bulletins. The publi-
cation by piecemeal summaries yesterday
afternoon of the sweeping views set forth
by the Justice of the Supreme Court who
handed down the majority opinion in the
Northern Securities case presented a dire-
ful appearance “to the pronouncement
of the court and led to not a little selling
of short stock in the security market, The
facta that prices did not break under all
this and that net changes in quotations
at the close of the day were trifling were
pretty strong proofs of the liquidated
character of the market and indicated even
to inexpert observers that something more
than the announcement of a legal decision
that everybody expected was needed to de-
press prices further. But to-day Wall Street
discovered that the so-called majority
opinion in the Northern Securities case
was not really the majority opinion at all.
Four Justices concurred in the opinion
rendered, four others dissented and the
Justice who cast the deciding vote against
the Northern Securities Company explained
that he did so because of reasons that af-
fected the Northern Securities Company
purely and simply and not because ofcon-
currence in the vehement and compre-
hensive legal generalizations made by
the Justice writing the majority opinion.
Beyond all this, the Justice casting this de-
ciding vote made the important declara-
tion that in setting the great precedents
that it did in the previous decisions under
the Anti-Trust law, namely, tkat all con-
tracts in restraint of trade, whether reason-
able or unreasonable, were illegal, the
Supreme Court had gone altogether too
far. In making these rulings this Judge
had himself borne a part, and, as among
the minority Justices in the present case
were two members of the court who in the
Trans-Missouri and other Anti-Trust cases
previously decided held to the broad con-
struction of the Anti-Trust law there given,
the fair presumption is that these Justices
share with Justice Brewer the opinion
that the definitions of the law then given
were too extended and drastic. It must
be considered in other words, by every
one who familiarizes himself with the text
of the opinions rendered in the Supreme
Court yesterday, that the force of the de-

cision rendered was directed solely against
the Northern Securities Company and that,
moreover, the light thrown upon the present
disposition of the court indicates a desire
there to take much more conservative
action than it has hitherto regarding the
Anti-Trust law.

It must, therefore, be held to be alto-
gether doubtful if blackmailing lawsuits
against corporations, whose possibility
has been contemplated in Wall Street ever
since the attack by the Government upon
the Northern ‘Securities Company, and
assailing, for instance, the Pennsylvania
Railroad’s purchases of Norfolk and Wes-
tern, Reading, and Baltimore and Ohio stock,
the Union Pacific’s purchases of the South-
ern Pacific shares and similar acquisitions
of the stock (less than a controlling or
majority interest) of one corporation by
another corporation, will stand any chance
of success whatever. It was this truth
whose great meaning slowly became more
and more emphatic in Wall Street as the
day progressed and it resulted in arecovery
in stock market prices running in someof
the most active stocks to nearly 3 points.
There was again practically little talked
of in the financial district except the North-
ern Securities case. It was generally
recognized that the probability was of an
early dissolution of the Northern Secur-
ities Company, a matter which concernsa
comparatively small number of people
and which, although it may be a compli-
cated matter of bookkeeping, can result in
no pecuniary loss, inasmuch as it is well
known that the present selling price of
Northern Securities stock represents a very
low quotation for the shares of ite constit-
uent organizations, the Great Northern
and Northern Pacific railway companies.
The idea that the NortMern Securities Com-
pany will seek to organize as a Canadian
organization is, of course, extremely ridic-
ulous. London was a fairly heavy buyer
of stocks here throughout the session and
the market closed exceedingly strong and
active at the highest prices of the day.
