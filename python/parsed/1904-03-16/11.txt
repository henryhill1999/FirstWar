WT, SINAI'S NEW HOSPITAL,

THE TEN BUILDINGS ON A CITY
BLOCK DEDICATED.

 

 

Gov. Odell Talks About the Need of Private
Ald to the State's Efforte—New
Plant Has in All 456 Beds—The 80
Patients Are to Be Moved In on Monday

Mount Sinai Hospital’s new home, oocu-
pying the entire block bounded by Fifth
and Madison avenues aad 100th and 101st
streets, was dedicated yesterday. In the
the course of the day and evening 10,000
Invited guests visited the buildings and
saw allths latest appliances for the healing
of the sick,,

, The formal part of the exercises and the
transferring of the keys were held In the
board room and were private. After ex-
prereing his regret that lack of room made
it impossible for all the friends of the in-
Ktitution to attend the exercises President
Isaac Wallach called upon the Rev. Dr.
Schulman for the dedicatory prayer.

Coy. Cdell then said in part:

Mu. Presipent AND Dikectors: It is a
great pleasure to me to meet you at this
family gathering and to rejoice with you
over the magnificent success of your plans
und covgratulate you on the completion of
this new home

The three principal human attributes are
faith, hope and charity. It is to them that
your courage to do this work for others is
due

Cur great State has expended time and
money for the alleviation of human suffer-

ing No appeal to the Executive or to the
legisluture for aid in work of this kind has
been denied. But while the State has ac-
complished much, our efforts would have
failed had they not been BUD Pe en ree by
the services rendered by such institutions as
Mount Sinai

I reud that the average length of human

life has been increased by the progress of
the lust twenty years in medical science.
That in itself is something to be proud of.

1! have no doubt that in this inetitution,
devoted t9 the alleviation of human quder ing
regurdless of creed or nationality, there will
be found an immense field for effort and
snerifice. But [ know the generous im-
pulses of your race too well to fear that any
opportunity will ever be lost for adding to
your usefulness and efficiency

Jcseph Fox of the building committee
then surrendered the key to President
Wallach, who, in accepting it, said:

“This key, which will open wide the
pertals of this temple, symbolizes the broad
charity cof the Jews of this great city, who
lave unselfishly furnished the means to
extend its healing, life saving services
without distinction to the suffering of all
creeds and classes.”

President Fornes of the Board of Alder-
men congratulated the directors in the
1ame of the city, and Edward Lauterbach,
counsel to the board of directors, told of
tLe growth of the institution from its small
beginning, in 1855, when it occupied its first
quarters in Twenty-eighth street, between
Seventh and Eighth avenues, down to the
present occupancy of the new $2,500,000
group of buildings. :

The clcsing devotional exercises were
conducted by the Rev. Dr. F. de Sola Mendes
and the Rev. Dr. Jeseph Silverman.

The thirty patients remaining in the old
}uilding, at Sixty-seventh street and Lex-
ington avenue, will be transferred on Mon-
day in ambulances to the new buildings.

With its enlarged facilities the hospital

“will be able to do a share of the city’s emer-
gency work and will ask that its ambulances
lhe assigned to a district.

The new hospital is arranged on the
pavilion plan, except that the ten buildings
are connected by their ground floor oorri-
ders. Five of these, the medical, surgical
and private hospitals, the children's and
the isolating pavilions, are for the housing
ef patients and contain 456 beds. On the
roof cf each of these buildings is a glass
inclosed solarium for convalescent patients.
In the remaining buildings the central, or
administration building, the kitchen and
laundry, the pathological building, the
dispensary and the nurses’ training school,
reasonable provision has been made _ for
the standing needs of progressive medical
5 jence and hospital administration.

Fach building has an independent ven-
tilating svstem; the air is drawn from well
above the street level into the cellar, where
it is filtered, warmed by contact with radi-
ators and driven by a large fan through
conduits opening into the wards and rooms
near the ceiling. The vitiated air is ex-
hausted through openings near the floor
ly means of a fan under, the roof.

A synagogue, having a seatin
cf about 200, occupies a purt o
floor of the aiministration building, the
remainder of which, as well as the fourth
floor, is devoted to apartments of the resi-
dent medical and ny officers of the hos-
pital, a reference library and a reading
room.

On the fifth floor is a group of operating
reoms, with a central theatre, dedicated b:
Benjamin Stern to the memory of. his
brother, Bernard Stern. This operatin
theatre is to-day the finest exposition o'
modern as°ptiec operating room_construc-
tion. Except for its large window panes
and its non-absorbent floor of vitreous
tile, it is built throughout of Italian marble:

Among the benefactors who have al-
ready endowed beds or wards in the new
buildinys are Max Nathan, E, Asiel, Miss
We Prelit r, Jocl Goldenberg and Isaac
Blumenthal

‘the five story private pavilion fronting
on Fifth avenue was dedicated by mem-
beis of the Guggenheim family in memory
of Barbara Guggenheim, and Henry i.
Einstein gave the four-story children’s
pavilion in memory of his son Lewis.

Adolph Lewisohn has endowed the
pathological department.

CROW COLONY IN THE PARK.

The Billy MeGee McGaw Chorus Rises
to a Roar at Night.

For a week past a large flock of crows
has been roosting in the tall trees in the
Ramble in Centra] Park. Tho birds begin
10 congregate about nightfall, coming from
all directions until the trees are black with
them, When disturbed the flock rises and
gyrates through the air like a swarm of
great bees. The crows make a great noise,
sometimes a positive roar, until darkness
sets in, when they quiet down for the night.
At daylight they begin to fly away in small
numbers in search of food. They don't
stay in the Park very long, as the food
they want is not abundant there, yet the
visits of crows have not been unusual in
former years.

Texas Wes Never So Rich or Growing So
Fast—President Jeffery Says the Pes-
simism Here Doesn't Get West of the
Mississippi or South of St. Louls.

George J. Gould was at his offices yester-
day after a trip, lasting nearly five weeks
and covering 10,000 miles, over the various
lines of the Gould system, including the
Missouri Pacific, the Iron Mountain, the
International, the Texas Pacific, the Denver
and Rio Grande and the Wabash. Mr. Gould
said that he was thoroughly pleased wth
the condition of the lines and the country
which they serve. President E. P. Jeffery
of the Denver and Rio Grance, who is one
of Mr. Gould's chief advisers and who ac-
companied Mr. Gould on his long tour of
inspection, made this statement of the
results of the trip:

“We went from New York to Buffalo and
from Buffalo over the lines of the Wabash
to St, Louis. From St. Louis the trip was
made for the purpose of inspection over
the new low grade route of the Iron Moun-
tain down the west bank of the Mississippi
River. We found the road progressing
well and believe that the traffic to come
over it will justify the heavy expenditures
on it,

“We went to New Orieans and from New
Orleans into Texas, spending a day in
Galveston, where Mr. Gould secured a tug

Use it this way: wet the wash; rub on Miller's Soap; roll up,

and inspected the harbor of Galveston,
which has been develo splendidly since
the disastrous inundation. We were par-
ticularly Jimpressed with the splendid
sea wall under construction to prevent a
repetition of this disaster. We travelled
over the International and Great Northern
to San Antonio and over the lines of the
Texas Pacific to various points in the State,
and were amazed to see the growth of the
cities and the material development of
Texas territory.

“The great cotton crop of Texas and the
high prices obtained have put the people
in possession of greater wealth than they
have ever known before, and they show
the possession of it in the development of
their cities, in the ddornment of their
pene and even nee ~, for every-

“From Texas we went to various points
in Arkansas, including Texarkana and
Little Rock, and Mr. Gould made a thorough
inspection of the-White River Rauway,
a low grade line h Arkansas on which
we spent over $3,000,000 last year and from
which we looked for great returns.
Arkansas, like Texas, is prosperous, and this
prosperity is not confined to any one pro-
duction of the State, but is general, and has
fully justified our expenditures on the
White River the expenditure of
some $2,000,000 on the Little k and Fort
Smith road.

“We went to Los les and San Fran-
cisco over the lines of the Southern Pacific.
In the West, on the Coast, we were asked
by every one what we had to do with the
Western ific Railway, a line projected
to run from San Francisco to Salt Lake City,

Waltresses of Smith & MoNell’s Say They
Were Misrepresented.

Since the day after the ball of the Jolly
Forty at Murray Hill Lyceum, last Thurs-
day, there has been unceasing turmoil
among the young women employees of
Smith & McNell's Hetel. On that morning
there was printed an account of the ball
which the members of the association
resented as utterly misrepresenting the
spirit of the occasion and themselves.

The voung ladies attribute the disagree-
able features of the story of the ball to
the efforts of some of their own number.
They belicve that through these the news-
papera were informed that many of the
most répresentative members of the asso-
ciation went to the ball on a butcher's
truck; that none of the girls was capable
of blushing; that intoxication prevailed
and the like.

Several indignation meetings have been
Held by the young ladies and committees

have demonstrated their ability to explain

Stetson’s $6 |
“Clear Nutria”
Derbies |

Best Derby Hats in the!
world, and the aristocrats of
the Stetson factory. Only
the favored few, among the
skilled workmen, are allowed!
to touch them during the,
process of manufacture, from|
the ‘combining’ of the She
fur used in making them, to)
the forming, pouncing, trim-|
ming, and so on.

The result is the very finest!
workmanship that can be’
bestowed upon a hat—and|
these “Clear Nutria’”’ Derbies
show it plainly in every line.

The Spring styles are here
— several very handsome
blocks, each in a full line of
proportions of crown and
brim, to suit every man’s
build.

Six dollars, in black only.
Shall you join the ever-in-
creasing number of wearers,
of “the best Derby in the
world’?
| Other Stetson hats in
Spring styles are ready—|
Derbies, flexible and feather-
weight, at $3.50 and $0;
Soft Hats, from $3.50 to|
$15—the whole Stetson line,|
in fact, which can be found,
in no other store in New)
York. Second floor, Ninth st
