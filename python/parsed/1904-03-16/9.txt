ATRIUMPH FOR THE TALENT,

,FOUR FAVORITES AND A SECOND
CHOICE SUCCESSFUL,

 

 

Bookmakers at New Orleans Receive
Thetr Worst Drubbing of the Season
—Lev Dorsey Wins Good Race in the
Handicap—Killing Falls With Arden.

New Onimans, March 15.—The talent had
the better of it in the battle with the book-
makers this afternoon at the Fair Grounds.
Four heavily played favorites with a second
choice managed to get home in front. It
fe said that the ring experienced the worst
day of the present season.

Quite a killing was planned with Arden
in the closing event. Opening at 10 to 1,
Arden was played down to 13 to 5, Through
the heavy plunge on Arden the backers of
Tancred, the ‘legitimate favorite, were able
to get their money down at the good odds
of 2to1. After permitting Arden to cut out
a killing pace until well in the stretch, Tancred
came on. and won ino gallop by two lengths
from John Coulter. Arden was beaten a
nose on the post for the third money. Had
Arden Won, the local ring and every poolroom
in the country would have been hit hard.

The mile and a sixteenth handicap was
put down as the day's feature, Only four
paraded to the post, but it wasa good betting
event as three of the four starters were well
supported. Lev Dorsey was the favorite
at 8 to 2, while Iwralighter was the second
choice ana neld at 9 to 6. Kthics was the
good thing of the race and was played from
eights to fours. Hymettus was the extreme

Outsider at tens. -
It was a raco from start to finish. The

fleid was wen bunched all the way, scarcely
two lengths separating the quartet from be-
ginning to end, ev Dorsey was the pace-
maker and won by a length trom Luralighter,
with Ethics and Hymettus fighting it out
for third place. The former secured the
position by a very scant neck, The victory
of Lev Dorsey was a vary popular one.

, .A speedy bunch started in the fifth, a purse
affair at a mile, in which J. J. McCafferty's
New Mown fay was favorite, Scotch
Thistle, the colt who beat Rainland last
Thursday, was the second choice, at 14 to 5.
It was a three-cornered race throughout.
New Mown Hay. was the pacemaker, with
Katie Powers and Scotch Thistle in hot pur-
suit, while the others were strung out. The
finish saw New Mown Hay a length tothe good.
It was a question as to who was seconc be-
tween Scotch Thistle and Katie Powers.
The judges gave it to the former

BASEBALL IN THE SOUTH,

Firat Practioe Game by the New York
Americans,

ATLANTA, Ga, March 15.—This morning
Manager Griffith put his New York Ameri-
cans through a long batting drill, and this
afternoon the first practice game of the season
was played, The batting drill in the morning
was confined mostly to the regulara, with
Bliss and Thoney pitching to them and Grif-
fith oversecing the work from back of the

pitcher's box,

The men came to the plate in the order
with which the pennant season will probably
be begun, Griffith believes he has bunched
a quartette of very skilful place hitters and
run getters in Conroy, Fultz, Keeler and
Elberfeld, Inside teain play was practised
in thh morning and then came 4 schooling
for all hands, pitchers and everybody else,
in bunting, which ranged from good to poor.
Thoney came in very handy in the box as
his arin {8 in great condition and he served
up speed to the batters, |

Colneident with the bunting was practice
for the pitcher and catcher in flelding bunts,
Be ville fh particular coming in for ¢ rifith’s

 

In the afternoon, the two teams

coaching,
lined up as follows:

First Team—Conroy, third base; Fultz, centre
field; Keeler, right feld: Elberfeld, shortstop;

Anderson, left field; Willlams, second base; Ganzel,
first base; McGuire, catcher; Grifllth, , plicher,
Second Team—Thoney, third base;’ Bean, short
stop; Ungloub, first base; Hughes, meht feld;
Putmann, left feld; Powell, centre ficld; Bilss,
second base; Beville, catcher; Wolfe, pitoners z
First Team. .iccscseseeeeee? © 2:0 :0 O-4 6 2
Second Team... ccs. s0: 20100 0-8 7 2

Hughes captained the scrubsand made a
atar play, doubling up a runner at third

after takne a lon fly. There were four
double plays in all, of which the regulars
made three. The fielding, especially the
handling of the ball and getting it
away, Was aninpy.

Pitcher Wolfe is in pretty good anare and
sturted to send in speed in the second inning,

but Griffith ordered him to ease up. Unglaub
did good work on low throws at firet Ane,
and Williams’ activity at second was an en-
couraging sign for the season

Much of the hitting being along the ground,
the outflelders had not a great deal to do.
In the morning, big John Ganzel sent a pro-
fJectile shrieking over the left fleld renee
a drive about equal to a wallop over the righ
field fence in the Brooklyn grounds

 

Fast Practice by the New York Nationals,

BIRMINGHAM, March 15.—If the weather
continues as favorable for spring training
ne it has been since John McGraw brought
his baseball tossers here, the New York Na-
tionals will start the pennant season In the
pink of condition.

The air has been warm and balmy and
they have had the glad sunshine on the field
each day. Mac's charges have advanced
so rapidiy in slugging, fielding and running
that he began to go deeper into the progress
of training to-day. i =

Special attention was given to “inside
playing, such as base stealing, bunting,
sacrificing, the hit and run scheme, &c,
McCormick, the new centre fielder, found
these stunts developed to a much_ higher
degree of intelligence than he had seen them in
the Eastern League, where he played last
year, but he was not slow in finding what is
required of him.

MecGraw’s infield let cut to-day for the first
time, and the speed it displayed kept the
spectators cheering. Dahlen and Gilbert
work like old playmates around second base,
and Bresnahan and McGann complete the
circuit of an ideal infleld.

Dahlen and McGann, the older players of
the quartet, say they are feeling in, better
trim than they ever felt before in the
spring. ited.

HARVARD OUT OF BASKETBALL,

   

 

 

Dropped From Intercollegiate Associa
tlon—Columbla’s Champlonship.

Delegates from Coluinbia, Cornell, Penn-
sylvania, Princéton and Yale met yesterday
at the Hotel Imperial, in the regular meeting
of the Intercollegiate Basketball Association,
The most important affairs transacted were
the dropping of Harvard from the league and
awarding the championship for 1903-04 to
Columbia, together with a banner and indi-
vidual medals indicative'of the victory.

A motion was made that inasmuch as the
Harvard athletic committee would not permit
the basketball team to play more than three
out of town games in a season, which would
entail the forfeiting of two games to other
colleges, 1t was not exactly fair to the other
colleges in the league that the Crimson should
continue in it, and that Harvard should be
dropped. This was adopted. Harvard fin-
ished last in the league this season, with one
*% ame won and nine lost. Of the defeats,
threo were forfeited games. The first game
of the season, against Cornell at Ithaca, was

not played and both the contests with Yale
wore also defaulted by the Cambridge five.
It was decided to impose a fine of $75 on
any team that forfeited a game, and in case
it was deemed best, to expel the team which
did so. The meetings hereafter are to be
held at Columbia, and the Aba ger of the
Columbia team is to be keeper of the minutes
and of the constitution of the league. All
the delegates reported that they had had very
successful seasons and that basketball was
increasing in popularity in the colleges.

 

Flushing Girls Win at Basketball.

FLusHiInG, March 15.—Playing one of the
best games they have put up in their brilliant
season, the Flushing High School girls’ basket-
ball team, led by Miss Wilhemina Harper,
to-day vanquished the Lawrence High Schoo)
girls’ team of Lawrence, L. i The play was
altogether too fast for the visitors, who were
blanked in each period. In the first the
Flushing girls made two points, Miss Ada
M. Dixon, the manager of the team, scoring
a basket on a pass from Capt. Harper,

In the final period the Flushing girls scored
two goals from the field, on a from Miss
Bowne to Miss King, and by Miss Dixon again
from a scrimmage. The final score stood:
Flushing High School Girls, 6 points; Law-
rence High School Girls, 0.

The Columbia Grammar School hockey team
met the Berkeley School seven in St. Nicholas

nk last night in the Interscholastic League
ries. The game was bouy contested, the

OCEAN RACE FOR SMALL BOATS.

Manhasset Bay Yacht Club Will Not Manage
Contest for Lipton Cup.
The Manhasset Bay Yacht Club has de-
cided that it will not manage the ocean race
| for small boats for which 3ir Thomas Lipton
has offered a cup thoinus Fleming Day,
who has been interested in sinall boat sailing
for many years, thougbt of having a race for
small boats over 4&0 ocean course, and he
succeeded in getting Sir ‘Thomas Lipton in-
terested in the race,

Mr. Day worked out the details of the race
and corresponded with several ne eee
who, as 600n as they beard of the idea, agreed
to enter their boats The course for the race
was to be from Sandy Hook Lightship to Nan-
tucket Shoals Lightship and then to Marble-
head, a distance of 320 miles. Mr. Day is a
meniber of the Manhasset Bay Yacht Club
and for that reason he offered the Lipton
oun to that organization

The Manhasset Bay Yacht Club has Its
house at Port Washington on the Sound.
The trustees ut the last meeting considered
Mr. Day's proposition and decided that as
the club was 8o far froin the starting point
of the race, Sandy Hook, it would have to
decline the offer. Secretary MacLellan 60
notified Mr. Day yesterday.

‘This, however, will not hurt the contest
in any way. Mr. Day said yesterday that he
had bevn approached by other clubs who
were willing to hold the cup and manage the
race, but that he had not yet decided which
club he would give it to. It is possible that
some organization having headquarters on
thle lower bay might be selected, or some
Boston Club might get It. In the event of
its going to Boston, the course would be
changed .

It is expected that there will be at least
ten starters in this contest, and several yachts-
men who do not bow own boats that would be
eligible are looking around to purchase boats.
No boat can be more than 40 feet over-
