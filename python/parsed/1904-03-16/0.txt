THOUSANDS MORE OUTOR WORK

BRICKLAYERS’ STRIKE HAS LEFT

 

THE IRON WORKERS IDLE.

Up—Ne Action by the Employers Yet
—Talk, Though, of the “Open Shep.”

The housesmiths, who settled down to
work only recently after a long spell of
job again through
the strike of the bricklayers., Between
500 and 1,000 iron workers were laid off
vesterday, as the building laws allow them
to work only three stories above the fire

The strike has now completely tied up

these buildings:

The Women's Hospital in West 110th street;
bulldings at Thirty-fourth street and Fifth
avenue; Thirty-seventh street and Fifth avée-
in Thirty-first street near Broadway,
and Thirtieth street near Madison avenue;

a building at Twenty-ninth street and
Broadway and one at William and Pine streets.

The housesmiths are idle also on a num-
ber of buildings where complaints have
been made that the building laws are vio-

ing statement was made yesterday on
behalf of the Mason Builders’ Association:

The mason builders rescinded this notice
absolutely and unconditionally last Thursday.
It is still rescinded. ‘The laborers, in accord-
ance with an agreement reached between the
Mason Builder's Association and & representa-
tive of the brichlayers, were to return to work
pending aribtration of all differences, and
their differences were to be arbitrated on
March 18. Instead, they remained on strike
to enforce a new demand for an agreement
for a year, and the bricklayers, notwithstand-
ing theprevious action of their representative,
have broken the arbitration agreement by
striking in sympathy.

The mason builders say they do not
want “open shop” work and will observe
the arbitration agreement, but if the open
shop comes it will be the fault of the unions,

Benjamin D, Traitel, chairman of the
industrial improvement committee of the
Employers’ Association said to a Sun re-
porter:

_ “If any organization of employers or
employees believes that it acted precipi-
tately or mistakenly in making any move
and rescinds ite action that ought to leave
matters as they were. Three unions not
long ago- violated the arbitration agree-
ment by strikes, but the matter was arbi-
trated when this mistake was seen. That
‘ended the trouble. Now if the open shop
issue, which we do not want at all, is forced
upon us, the unions will be responsible.
Tt will not be the fault of the employers.”

Mr. Traitel said that the aims of the
industrial improvement committee of the
Employers’ Association were not aggressive.
Its chief aim was to bring employers and
employees into closer relations, here and in
adjoining States.

Robert E."Neidig, president of the finish-
ers’ branch of the iron workers union, called
at the Building Trades Club yesterday.

“This strike is rough on the iron workers,”
he said.

Strikes have stopped work upon a num-
ber of new achool buildings ard menace
many more.,The trouble at Publio School
106 lies at:the door of the carpenters; and
the masons’ laborers are responsible for
the conditions at Schools 62 ard 165. At
the building department of the Board of
Education it was said yesterday that trouble
was expected to begin at any moment at
many other places. Not only are the
buildings now in the course of construo-
tion threatened with delay, but the pos-
siblity of entering upon new work is be-
coming elighter daily.

The arbitration board of the Employers’
Association met last night at the Building
Trades Club. The only action it took was
to direct the Mason Builders’ Association
and the bricklayers’ unions to comply with
the agreement reached last week by which
the strikers were to return to work and all
differences were to be arbitrated.

HOUSE WRECKERS ON STRIKE,

Won't Renew Last Year's Agreement--Non- |
Union Men Attacked. |

The House Wreckers and Building Ma-
terial Handlers’ Union tried its hand at a
strike yesterday, 500 of its members quitting
work in the yards of Meyer Hellman, the
§.W. Seagrist, Jr.,Company and the D. W.
Grean Company, all in the neighborhood
of Eighteenth street and Avenue B. The
employees demanded the renewal of an
Agreement made last year providing for
A union scale and a nine hour work day.
The strikers refused to renew it.

The usual tacties were uged by the strikers
to keep non-union workers away from the
yards, They stayed around in gangs and
pulled two non-union men from one of the
Seagrist company’s trucks. The yards will
be guarded by police to-day.

MUSTN'T GAMBLE AT LAW SCHOOL.

Expulsions Threatened if the Cloak Room
Games Don’t Step.

At a meeting yesterday of the sénior
class of the New York University Law
School, to which juniors were specially in-
vited, T. C. Hartman, president of '04,
warned his fellow students that the
gambling which has been going on in the
cloak room lately had become a public
gcandal and would have to stop. He said
there would be expulsions if it didn't.

It was the understanding that President
Hartman's warning had been inspired by
Dean Ashley, who wished to avoid, if possi-
bie, taking official cognizance of the matter,
which would mean an investigation and
possible expulsions.

A student who didn’t want to be quoted
said last night that pitching pennies and
craps went on all: day long. in the cloak
room betwéen lectures.

Supt. Crockett said that there had been
no complaints of gambling to his knowl-

Postmaster Warfeld Tella Why He Paid
J. W. Pettit an Increased Salary.

BALTIMORE, March 15,.--For the first time

 

since the discovery that John W. Pettit ;

had been carried on the Baltiroore Post
Office peyroll for four years, without ren-
dering service for the salary he received,
Postmaster S$. Davies Warfield made a
statement to-day, explaining ais conneo-
tion with the case. Mr. Warfield'’s bonds-
men are now being sued by the Post Office
Department for the money paid Pettit.

“The circumstances connected with the
payment of this money to Pettit are theee,
said Mr. Warfield: “In a letter signed by
Perry S. Heath, First Assistant Postmaster-
General, under date of July 14, 1898, I was
notified that the salary allowance for the
Baltimore post office had been increased
by the Depattment $600 a year, this sum
to be paid to John W. Pettit. In my answer
to Mr. Heath I forwarded the regular

mental blank with the name of

ettit thereon, as ordered in the letter,

writing thereon that this was in accordance

with his letter of July 14, 1898, instructing
me 80 to do.

“I never felt it incumbent upon me to
inquire whether my superior officer had
placed Pettit on special work outside the
post office. Mr. Pettit’s salary was increased
by the Department without request from
me, and I was instructed to pay such in-
crease. To Mr. Pettit was paid all the money
for which I am now sued, and the payments
were proved and accepted by the Govern-
ment in each and every quarterly return of
my office for four years.”

Vardey McBee, who lives with his family

made to Goy. Aycock several propositions to
lease the road about a month ago. The
Governor refused to allow the State proxy

a quorum, and no proposition of lease could
be considered.

About this time K. 8. Finch of New York

it in the United States Court in this city,
Thereupon Judge Purnell issued an order
that put the road into the hands of McBee
as receiver.

No order to show cause why a receiver
should not be appointed was served on

EMERGENCY BOND ISSUES.

Bill to Allow the City te Spend 62,600,000

the New York city Board of Estimate and
Apportionment to issue emergency bonds
for $2,000,000, instead of $1,000,000 a year.
Senator Dowling says the additional money
is needed this year because many of the

the Low administration having deen prolific

WOMAN FARO DEALER,

That's the Pelice Version of the Business
of Elizabeth Routten, a Prisoner.

The first woman faro dealer caught in
thie city, according to the police, was a
prisoner in the Mercer street station last
night. She is Miss Elizabeth Routten,
30 years old.

The police say that she not only deals
faro, but also owns a gambling house in
the basement of 178 Sullivan street.

The place was raided by Capt. Tighe of
the Mercer streot station last night. In the
front is a restaurant of which Miss Routten
is the proprietor. Capt. Tighe and a couple
of detectives broke into a room in the back
of the restaurant, andcaptured Miss Rout-
ten and twenty Italians. They also
got $6.

Mise Routten wasn't dealing at the time
but the detectives pay that she had been a
short time before.’

TWO MORE ATTACKS REPORTED,

Japanese Fleet Bombarded Saturday and
Sunday, Say Yingkow Reports.
Spectal Cable Despatches to THR SUN.

Lonpon, March 15.—A foreigner, who has
arrived at Yingkow from Port Arthur, re~
ports that a short engagement was fought
there on Sunday, in which the Russian
cruiser Diana was damaged.

Lonpbon, March 16.—A Yingkow despatch
to the Telegraph says that the Japanese
made another attack on Port Arthur on
Saturday as a challenge for Admiral Maka-
roff to come out and fight. During a heavy
bombardment the Japanese were in a posi-
tion where the forts could not train their
guns on them, though they were plainly
visible.

The total Russian casualties were over
300 killed or wounded. The correspondent
says this is authentic.

He adds that little damage was evidently
done to the Japanese ships, for the forts
made only a feeble reply to their fire.

Another Yingkow despatch says that a
new battery composed of the guns from the
Russian warships Tzarevitch and Retvizan
now commands Pigeon Bay. During the
bombardment of March 10 the Japanese
shells nearly reached the Russian fleet,
many of them falling in the basin. The
Retvizan was not much damaged by the
fire. The cruiser Pallada is still in dock.

PRESENT GARRISON MUST HOLD OUT.

A despatch to the Daily Mail from New-
chwang says that Admiral Alexieff has
telegraphed to Gen. Stoeasel, telling him
that he must hold Port Arthur with the
present garrison.

The Berlin correspondent of the Erpress
says that Count Ostensacken, the Russian
Ambassador, has communicated to the
Foreign Office a formal Russian note an-
nouncing that Admiral Makaroff has laid
a complete system of mines around the
Port Arthur peninsula, extending seaward
for three miles. Neutra] ships must hencee
forth hoist their national flags five miles
off shore and signal their destination, when
they will be taken into port by Russian
pilots. Russia repudiates liability for the
safety of any vessel not observing these
precautions.

MAKAROFY REWARDS THE BRAVE.

A despatch from Port Arthur says that
Admiraj Makaroff visited the torpedo boats
that were in Thursday's engagement and
warmly thanked the officers and men. He
distributed St. George crosses to those who
distinguished themselves most in the fight.

It is reported from Port Arthur that the
escape of one Russian destroyer in the en-
gagement on Thursday from the fate of her
companion, the Stereguschtchi, was owing
to the daring bravery of Midshipman Pal-
ovsky, who when the steersman was shot
seized the wheel and piloted the boat away
from four Japanese destroyers toward
which she was drifting. Bullets whistled
harmlessly round Paloysky, who alone
among the. survivers did not seem to lose
his head.
