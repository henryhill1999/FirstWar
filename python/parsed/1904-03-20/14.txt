New Mattings : : : The Opening Sale.

Mattings ave going to be high—-that’s evident to you, of course. Japanese are too busy now to make them; too busy fighting for
a pew and broader national life. And China is affected, too—such a nearby disturbance is bound to hurt trade for a while. Mattings
nist be higher—are higher already. Of unusual importance, therefore, is this announcement that the new Japanese and Chinese Mat-
tings are here in the broadest and finest assortinent we ever had, and—ing this opening sale that starts to-morrow—

THAT IS AN EFFECT OF THE WAR
IN THE FAR EAST.'

 

 

Japan's Control of the Trade—Atiempts
te Grow Camphor Trees Here Promise
Well—Many Uses for the Gum, Ranging
From Smokeless Powder to Medicine.

One would hardly expect to find even an
@ho of Old World politics in so peaceful
& spot as a Gotham greenhouse. But in
ne of the domed departments of the half-
mile of glass roofed buildings in The Bronx
Rotanical Gardens, there isa group of rather
Insignifloant looking shrubs, which, since
'he hostilities began in the East, have come
in for an unusual share of popular atten-
tion and have served as text for countless
inimated discussions of international
‘fairs. These are the camphor trees of

camphora,

It is not without material reason that
‘hese shrubs are objects of present interest.

world. Of her annual export, upward of
three anda half million pounds, about one
million is consigned to the United States.

Camphor is an important ingredient
in the manufacture of smokeless powder,
celluloid, various materials used in the
arts, India ink, &c., and, of course, in
medicinal compounds. There is no wholly
adequate substitute for it, though a “syn-
thetic camphor,” obtained from oil of tur-
pentine by a process of oxidation, is now
on the market and bas been used with a
degree of success in gunpowders, &c.

A camphor famine would be felt all along
the line of everyday living. For one thing,
the ubiquitous moth, 80 soon to be up and
doing in its field of action, would hold high
carnival this summer.

The acquaintance of the majority with
camphor is usually limited to the occa-
sional purchase of a few ounces of the pun-
gent, translucent crystals, Yet the bio-
graphy of any grain of this would be as
interesting, in ite way, as that of the Mikado
himself. For the history of camphor is the
history of Eastern Asiatic and American
commerce, plus the story of countless
individual lives cast into the caldron of

It was first subjected to refining processes
by the Venetians, and a little later by the
Dutch, who long held a monopoly of tne
trade, and only within few decades has
this refining business been more generally
known, Even now, a camphor refinery
is closed to the public, There are but five
of these establishments in the United States
in San Francisco, Boston, Philadelphia,
Jersey City and New York.

It is calculated that the Island of For-
mosa, which passed into the posseasion of
the Japanese at the close of the Chinese
war, Will be able with the aid of the foreats
of Japan proper to supply the world for
more than the next half century, at the
present rate of consumption. This island,
whose name was originally Tai-wan (Ter-
raced Bay) and later, Yiha Férmoso (the
Portuguese for “Beautiful Island”), is still
comparatively unexplored territory.

It is divided almost longitudinally by a
range of mountains, of which Mount Mor-
rison, 1,200 feet in height, is the crowning
peak. On ita western shore something
like 2,000,000 Chinese still tend their patches
of rice and sugar,

On the eastern slope there are numerous

converting the camphor trade into a, Goy-
ernment monopoly, regulating the out-
put, and thereby establishing a certain
stability as to price. Permits are granted
to a limited number of individuals or com-
panies to exploit certain districts, with the
proviso that tree for tree shall be planted
as the work of destruction goes on.

The entire product of each season's
activity is purchased by the Japanese
Government at a fixed price, and resold to
representatives of foreign markets. It is
shipped to this country in so-called tubs,
blocks about the size of a half barrel,
wrapped in a sort of plaited, pliable grass
matting, and bound with coarse grass
ropes.

In this shape it goes to the refineries
here, where, roughly speaking-—each firm
has its chemical secrets—the purifying
process consists of an admixtureof quick-
lime, a sand bath under high temperature,
and then recondensation.

Since the looming of the recent war
cloud camphor plantations have been
established in California, Louisiana and
Florida, the young trees having been ob-
tained from Japan's Department of For-

The presence of a single drop of oil at
once mysteriously arrests the activity of
the whole tiny flotilla. Camphor has de-
