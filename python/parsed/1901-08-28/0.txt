day Argument in the Scannell Case.

Tietriet Altorney Philbin made a« field
day of \t yesterday. In the Scannell case
he lad for Richard Croker with his right and
(> the Diamond case he came pretty near
eaving that the stay business had travelled

otende the Code of Criminal Procedure
In fact, he said that he had intended putting
the Thamond case on the General Sessions
alendar for pleading to-day, in spite of
Justice Dykman’s stay, and he inquired of
Justice Glegarioh if this would be ‘contempt
of two Bupreme Court Judges at once ”
Hie didn't put the case on the calendar,
@ruch

Qoker came into the Scannell case argu-
ment on the theory that he has more “tn-
fuerce” than William L. Marks, accused of
eon«piring with the head of the Fire Dhe-
partment to make the city pay extravagant
prices for supplies, 36 per cent. or 6o going
to Marke. Mr Philbin said

*I) hie humble capactty of a private
citiren, Marks has made $50,000 a vear
Be can imagine what might be the profits
of an unofficial citiven with great political
power He could acquire millions, eo many
that it would be congenial to him to eeek
the atmosphere of royalty in preference
te the democratic air of this country. *

Mr Philbin said this in Justice Gilder-
seeve's court in resisting a motion to quash
the indictments against Scannell and Marks
and in urging that there should bea fair
ipvewtigation of the charges at a trial
He came into the argument at the end,
“amuel H Ordway having put the People's
caee and Mr. Nicoll having rephed

Op the point that Mr Ordway had been
improperly in the Grand Jury room, not
being a sworn assistant connected with the
o of the District Attorney Mr Nicoll
that without doubt this invalidated
hretrnenta In the proceedings
the late John Y. MeKane, Cen
Tracey and Fdward M Shepard were es-
pecially engaged for the people The
question arose whether they could appear
before the Grand and on reference
to the Justices of the Supreme Court in
Brooklyn it was decided that Tracy and
Shepard must firat be «worn in aa Special
District Attorneva. They were

Lawyer Vorhaus that the District Attorney

The District Attorney said that he had
read in the newspapers that Co! Hender

this was not true He said that a similer

Justice MoAdam in the case against Corm-

the attorney in the oase, did not want the

American Har Associauien In Denver

‘The Only Kepublican Member ef the
Committee Net Present When the
Demeocratio Semater Was Voted Out.

Danven, Col, Aug. 27.—Congresaman
ldttiafield's attack upon the United States
Supreme Court for ite deciaion in the ineular
cases was not the only inte a feature
of the meeting of the American Bar Anso-
elation in Denver last week, although it
was the most widely reported

The really sensational incident of the

the order to show cauee why there should | meeting was the biackballing of United

States Senator Thomas M. Patterson for
membership in the Bar Association. The
local committee that passed upon hie appli-
cation was composed of seven members of
the Denver bar, six of them being Demo-
crate and one a Republican. This tnember,
however, Mr. Valle, was not present at
the meeting, as he ia in Europe. The report
accompanying the recommendation that
the application be denied was not made
public. It is generally admitted thet it
must have dealt with other than his legal
qualifications, as bis standing as a lawyer
Mr. Patterson had some
notoriety as a lawyer in Indiana long before

Dr he took up his residence in Colorado

It is @ most unusual thing for a lawyer
of reputation to be blackballed by the
American Har Association, and ite meme-
bers are anxious to know the cause for the
action in Senator Patterson's case, which
is ali the more remarkable in view of the fact
that the newspaper of whieh he is the pro-
prietor contained an editorial the day
before the vote was taken highl¥ eulo-
gizing the American Bar Association and
welcoming its members to Denver

TILLMAN'S EVE INJURED.

Cinder From «@ Lecomotiv an
Operation Necessary
Caanteeton, 8. ©., Aug 27 —-Senator

Renjamin Ryan Tillman, who went to
Spartanburg yesterday to attend a political
meeting, was forced this morning to leave

| for home on account of the serious condition
of his eye. The Senator has only one good
eye. On the way to Spartanburg yeater-
day he ocoupied @ seat in the day coach,
which is his habit when travelling in South
Carolina, and « hot cinder flew in through
the window and lodged in his eve There
was a emarting 6ting, and Senator Tillman
endeavored to have the cinder removed
He failed in this, however, and last night
euffered a great deal The eye was in-
flamed and it was found necessary to per-
form an operation.

Hie friends are alarmed for fear that he
may become blind, although the Senator
is hopeful that the trouble will disappear
He returned to his honw at Trenton, where
he will reinaln in a dark room. Before
leaving Spartanburg Senator Tillman gave
out a statement in which he spoke of tus
adherence to the Democracy. He was
opposed, be said, to the Cleveland brand of
Democracy, and claimed the credit for
eaving South Carolina from the Populists
in 1802

Tillman aleo touched on his recent speech
about a probable cotton-mill strike. He
said the operatives were en(ided to every
consideration and that any attempt to
coerce them into voting for Mclaurin
would result in much harm and internal
troubles for the mill magnates
