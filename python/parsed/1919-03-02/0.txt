Bpecial Despatch to Tur Bux.

‘Wasninaron, March 1.—Republicans
of the Senate conferred for an hour
and a half this evening to try to agree
on @ programme for the last few days
of the session. After a stormy meet-
fmg, which came perilously near to
Jeopardizing the chances of Repub-
licans organizing the next Senate, it
‘was voted, 15 to 12, not to conduct an
organized fight against the bill to au-
thorize the issuance of $7,000,000,000
in notes to heip finance the Govern-
ment.

Senator Lodge (Mass.), the Repub-
Tigan leader, and many of the cooler
heads urged strongly that there be no
filibuster against the bill. They were
willing that fights be made to amend
the measure, but said it would be short-
sighted to give the President a chance
to blame the Republicans for any
financial calamity incident to failure
to get the bond bill through.

On the other hand, there were Sen-
ators who declared strongly and posi-
tively for fighting. They pointed out
that if the President failed to call a
special session to have the bond Dill
passed, providing it was blocked at
this one, the blame for anything that
happened properly could be put upon
Mr. Wilson. ‘ Sheitieeds sn sil

Could Lay Blame to Wilson.

With the enormous amount of re-
construction legislation still awaiting
Congress action as well as ordinary rou-

tine’ supply bills for the Government,

which are- nevertheless absolutely es-|
sential, they declared it could be made
plain to the country that any financtal
cainmity which might oecur was entirely
due to the President failing to call Con-
gress in an extraordinary session imme-
diately in order golely to postpone a8
long as possible the almost daily criti-
cisms to which he and his course have
been and may be expected to be sub-!
fected.

Senatcr Lodge and others, though,
were afraid of the effect of blocking the
note bill. Others were so extreme and
80 anxious to “call Wilson's bluff''—
they firmly believe the President would
not have the courage to wreck the
finances of the country to gratify a per-
eonal wish and prevent criticiem of him-
self and his actions abroad—that they
wanted to filibuster against the note is-
tue bill and everything else.

As a matter of fact a good many
measures are dead and buried so far
as this Congress ts concerned. The
naval eppropriation bill carrying the
camouflage building programme to be
used ae 4 club in trying to compel Great
Britain to agree io a limitation of na-
tional armaments is gone by the board.

Naval Bill a Dead Iasue.

The Senate and House conferees on
this bill were in session to-day, Re-
publican members, when the conference
ended, said the bill was a dead issue.
They will not put into the hands of
the President the power to say whether
@ programme for building sixteen capi-
tel ships shall be started. The next
Congress with a Republican majority
certainly will do no such thing, they
edded,

The maddest man in the Senate to-
night was Senator Sherman (IIL). He
left the Republican conference white
with rage when he saw that majority
sentiment was against the party con-
ducting an organized filibuster against
the note issue authorization and every-
thing else.

“tt you won't fight,” he declared,
his voice actually shaking with rage,
“there will be an empty seat in the
next Senate, I won't come back here.’

If Senator Sherman carries this threat
through it would mean cutting the ex-
tremely narrow Republican majority in
the next Senate to the very bone, where
the least slip out of line by any one
Senator would put control in the hands
of the Democrats. As elected the next
Benate stands 49 to 47. If Sherman
stays home the Republican majority will
be cut to one.

Some Bills Will Be Blocked.

There is not much opposition to let-
ting the general deficiency bill or the
eundry civil bill go through this Con-
gress. However, in the uncertain tem-
per of come Republican Benators some
measures, If not all, will be prevénted
from going through. In a nutshell, the
situation now ts thts:

The Republican party will not filibus-
ter; it will try to amend the bond au-
thorization bill so that the Secretary of
the Treasury will not have the broad
euthority over the proposed note issues
embodied in the bill, including the right
to fix interest rates; it will not fill-
buster aguinel (he genera! Aefictency bill,
which carries the new revolving fund of
$750,000,000 for the Rallroad’ Adminis-
tration; however, a few Republican
fenators acting independently may block ;

Special Despatch to Tur Scx.

Wasninoron, March 1.—In an ad-
dress which riveted the attention of
the Senate and subdued by its serious
import the recently excitable galleries
Senator Philander C. Knox (Penn.),
Secretary of State under President
Taft and Attorney-General under
President Roosevelt and recognized as
the highest authority on international
jurisprudence in Congress, condemned
to-day the proposed constitution of
the League of Nations as drafted by
the Paris conference as invasive of the
sovereignty of the United States of
America.

Senator Knox put forward a con-
structive programme for world peace
which he asserted would not be open
to the charge that it abrogated the
Monroe Doctrine or surrendered the
vital sovereignty and nationalism of
the American Republic.

Stiffens Opposition.

The effect of the Knox address on
the Republican members of the Senate
and the little group of wilfully patri-
otic Democrats who are prepared to
stand back of them in combating the
League of Nations programme in-
dorsed, commended and set above the
Federal Constitution by the titular
head of the Democratic party in Amer-
ica was instantly good.

The voice of Senator Knox carried
conviction which even the graceful
elegance of Senator Lodge (Mass.),
the rounded phrases and sublime pe-

smashing condemnation of Senator
Reed Smoot (Mo.) and the rugged ora-
tory of Senator Poindexter (Wash.)
had not attained.

Within an hour after the speech the
indorsement of the pronouncements of
Senator Knox had expanded to a point
where the opponents of the Wilson pol-
fey of surrendering America’s sover-
eignty had selected it for the rallying
argument, the “talking point’ in the
campaign to defeat the un-American
programme of the American peace del-
egates. The Knox address, it was ad-
mitted, furnished the bag!s for the whole
campaign.

Why Indecent Hastet He Asks.

And this indorsement sprang not from
an individual or a selected group of
partisans, it was the spirit of the entire
opposition.

In his address Senator Knox demanded
to know the occasion for the indecent
haste displayed in high quarters for the
speedy acceptance by the United States
of the league plan for which the Presi-
dent in his discussions with the mem-
bers of the Foreign Relations Commit-
tee of the Senate and the Foreign Af-
fairs Committee of the House had
claimed an aimost sacrosanct character
and against the amendinent of which
he had inveighed bitterly in his die-
cussions with friends, on the ground
that it would tend toward a ,condition
of chaos in international affairs.

Senator Knox held that the constitu-
tion of the league, instead of forbidding
war, left wide the door to future wars
as the outcome of failure of negotia-
tions under its complicated prescrip-
tions for compounding the peaceful ad-
justment of international disputes.

“It (the league constitution) does not
abolish or prevent wars and it does
ganction and command them,” said Sen-

HITS LEAGUE AS |IRISH PLEA IS

UPTO CONGRESS

Resolution Urging Action by
U. S. Peace Delegates Will
Get Right of Way.

GOFF AND COHALAN WIN

President Will Meet Justices
and Others of Committee
Here Tuesday.

Wasuincton, March 1.—The delega-
tion of prominent American citizens
of Irish descent appointed at the recent
Irish race convention in Philadelphia
won its fight to-day for action by the
House Rules Committee to give right of
way in Congress to a resolution in-
structing the American delegates at
Paris to urge Ireland's cause before the
Peace Conference.

After hearing the delegation, which
was headed by Justices John W. Goff
and Daniel F. Cohalan of New York, the
Rules Committee agreed to report out
a rule making the resolution in order
in the House before adjournment,

Later the delegation, which arrived
in Washington Tuesday, called at the
White House to see President Wilson
and personally present to him resolu-
tions and memorials adopted at the
Philadelphia convention. They failed to
see the President, but were told that he
would receive them in New York next
Tuesday night after he speaks in the
Metropolitan Opera House on the League
of Nations.

Efforts for Ireland Expected,

John YT. Grace, former Mayor of
Charleston, S. C., and a member of the
delegation, gave out to-night a state-
ment saying:

“All during the war it was pre-
sumed that among the small nations
America was fighting to establish
in security was surely Ireland, to
which, as Washington and the pa-
triota of Amertca acknowledged they
owed more in the fateful hours of
the Revolution than all other foreign
Powers combined; but when the
committee from the Philadelphia
convention got to Washington it met
with a strong series of forbidding
difficulties,

“Twenty-one men from as far
west as the Pacific coast and from
New England and the South sol-
emniy left thetr important affairs
and arrived in Washingtori Tues-
day night according, as they sup-
posed, to an appointment at the
White House on Wednesday to ce-
ceive them. Wednesday passed,
Thursday passed, Friday passed and
practically the whole of Saturday
and they have not seen the Presi-
dent yet. They had great diffi-
culty even in seeing his secretary.

“Word had come to them through
many supposedly authentic channels
that they would be seen at this hour
or that hour, or on this day or on
that day. They approached the sub-
Ject througn Senators and attaches
of various degrees of importance at
the White House and elsewhere, but
there was an impenetrable barrier.

“At last the committee, in indig-
nation, made up its mind that dig-
nity, if nothing else, required a
showdown; either the President,
through his buffers, was trifling
with the time and the rights of
American cifftens, or some one was
failing properly to put the matter
before him. W®atever was happen-
ing, days were passing and he was
about to sail for Europe, with the
case of Ireland absolutely untouched,

Two Reports Differ,

“\feantime the press carried re-
ports that at the White House din-
rer he had excluded Ireland from
the programme. This was speedily
denied by Mr, Tumulty, but at once
reaffirmed openly on the floor of the
Senate,

“The committee went to the White
House at 12:30 to-day. Received
by Mr. Tumulty, it was told that
the President was a very busy man.
Judge Goff said that of course he
knew this, but this was a tremen-
dous issue for those interested.

“Mr. Tumulty said he was as
much Interested in the issue as any-
body. But that did not get the com-
mittee anywhere. He said he had
been pressing the matter to the
President's attention and expected to
hear from him almost any moment.
Judge Goff said that he could wait
no longer, but that, ag a matter of
courtesy, the committee would re-
turn at 3 o'clock for a definite an-
swer,

“Meantime Mr, Tumulty had the
fact communicated to the commit-
tee that if it returned at 8 o'clock
it would be informed that the Presi-
dent weuld receive !t not in Wash-
ington but on next Tuesday night
in New York, after his speech at
the Metropolitan Opera House. The
committee, nevertheless, went back
at 8 o'clock to be assured in person
of this fact. »

Indorsed by Democrats.

“The National Democratic Exzec-
utive Committee, at its session this
week, had unanimously indorsed the
position of the committee and Chair-
man Cummings had an earnest in-

By the Associated Press.

Beruin, Feb. 28 (delayed). -— Gen.
Maercker, commander of the troops
guarding the National Assembly at |
Weimar, was attacked by a mob in|
Erfurt to-day and robbed of a portfolio
containing important documents bear-
ing on the plans of the Government
for dealing with the strike situation in
central Germany.

The General was attacked in front
of the barracks in Erfurt and was
beaten severely before he could be res-
cued. The shoulder straps were torn
from his uniform by the mob.

The strike situation tn central Ger-
many was unchanged up to 8 o'clock
to-night and Government troops had
entered Dusseldorf. Minister of Labor
Bauer is conferring with the strike
leaders in Leipsic and Halle. Berlin
newspapers report that attempts are
being made by Spartacan leaders to
have a general strike proclaimed in
Greater Berlin, where 200,000 persons
already are idle.

Soviet Proclaimed in Brunswick.

CorpENHAGEN, March 1.—A Soviet re-
public has been proclaimed in Bruns-
wick, according to a despatch from Ber-
lin under date of yesterday.

Representatives of all the Spandau
State establishments have decided upon
a general strike on March 5 as a demon-
stration against the Government and in
sympathy with the movement in central |
Germany, the despatch adds. These rep-
resentatives demand the establishment |
of a communistic State and that all the!
State churches be thrown open for meet-
ings.

Railroad Paralysis Increases.

The paralysis of railway transporta-
tion in Germany is growing continually
worse. All communication with Halle,
even by telephone, was completely in-
terrupted Friday. No trains left Berlin
for Leipsic late Friday, but it is. still
possible to communicate with Leipsic
by telephone.

Few trains are arriving in Berlin
from southern and southwestern Ger-
many. The regular evening train from
Munich did not leave for Berlin yester-
day.

Muenster Government troops entered
Dusseldorf on Friday and occupled the
railway stations and public buildings.

Spartacan leaders escaped and the town
is quiet.

Five thousand Government troops are

According to the Gazette's Berlin cor-
respondent, more than 180,000 volun-
teers have enrolled throughout Germany
to ald the Government.

Congress at Munich has declared mar-
tial law for all of Bavaria, according to
a Zurich despatch to the Matin.

The German internal situation ts com-
mented upon by many of the Paris
newspapers to-day, the attitude of the
Scheidemann Government in connection
with the spreading Spartacan agitation
being closely analyzed.

Some of the newspapers raise the
question again whether this agitation is
not being encouraged purposely, or at
least not being repressed by the Gov-
ernment just at the time when the Allies
are to present their bill to Germany.

Their conclusion is that the Spar-
tacan, or Bolshevik, movement is being
used a® a weapon by Germany to
threaten the Allies whenever they begin
to speak of exacting reparation.

 

Ry the Associated Prasa.

Wertman, Feb. 27 (delayed).—Al-
though the Government has officially
announced it !s not worried by the strike
situation at Halle and Leipsic, and ex-
pects soon to see the end of the trouble,
a member of the National Assembly said
to-day that he “sees a black future.”

Even if the strike at Halle has not
received official recognition there are
strikers at other places where there are
no Government troops The atrikers
have declared they would encircle Wel-
mar and cut it off as far as possible
from the rest of Germany. They have
partially acoomplished this purpose by
delaying and to some degree stopping
the mall trains. But for the aerial

LONDON, March 1.—Bellef in Presi-

| dent Wilson's ability to swing the,
the |

behind him on
League of Nations plan is waning in
England and on the Continent. Even
those who a:e most anxious to see the
President's ideals succeed take a
gloomy view of the situation.

The Manchester Guardian, which has
upheld consistently the American
viewpoint with its liberal teachings,
Says to-day:

“When President Wilson returns
a fortnight hence he will know
what he can do and what he can-
not and will inform the Allies of
the limits of his authority. He
will tell them that he can sanction
on behalf of America no annexa-
tions of territory on the plea of
military security and can take
part in the establishment of no
buffer State to the west of the
Rhine or elsewhere unless at the
express unfettered desire of the
inhabitants of the proposed buffer.
“If that !s so, which we believe,
he will be bound to tell them that
if such arrangements should be
made it will be impossible for Amer-
ica to guarantee them, or, !f chal-
lenged, to defend them; that would
mean the collapse of the league.
. Whatever America will accept other
States will accept; if she is not a
party to the league there will be no
league. If the league is weakened
as to power, unable in the last re-
sort to appeal to combined, over-
whelming force, every State which
believes itself to be threatened will
have the more reason for resorting
to the security of the old, well ac-
customed armaments, strategic fron-
tlers and separate alliances.”

Boston Speech Criticised.

Even the weekly journals take issue

with President Wilson, espectally as to |
his statement in his Boston speech that |
the peoples of the world, not their Gov-
ernments, have set their hands to the
task of building the league.

in an editorial article says:

The Nation

“President Wilson must know bet-
ter than any of us that the will of
the peoples of the earth does not
enter into the groundwork of this so-
called league; the Governments
alone are represented. The fatal
flaw In the foundation of this struc-
ture fe Its complete autocracy. The
centre of vast power is vested in a
self-constituted autocracy of five
Ministers, who control all determined
Judgments and actions of the league.

“If the league ts permi™ed to take
this form it were bette. for the
world if it had never been conceived,
for it would make the world safe not
for democracy but for a new and
stronger despotism. Every demo-
eratic organization in the political
and industrial world should make a
concerted and vigorous endeavor to
rescue the idea of the League of
Nations from death. We urge the
people to the necessity of saving for
mankind the greatest experiment for
jts government that ever has been
made,”

The Saturday Review to-day printa a

denunciatory article in which it says:

“There {s an unctious, arrogant
rectitude about President Wilson's
Beston oration which is displeasing.
He says that America is the only
Gaiptorested nation, that the Ameri-
cay unlike fne other soidig’s, had a
vision; they dreamed they were
fighting and in the dream turned the
whole tide of battle. As a matter
of cold fact, the Americans did little
fighting; what they did was bravely
done, but no one detected any
dreaminess about their operations,
except perhaps in the work of their
General Staff. Happily this does not
represent the mafgority of American
opinion. Tue Suw strikes a not of
sanity when it says the American
people never will agree that they
went into the war to save them-
selves and the Allies

“By the draft of the covenant of
the league nine Powers in executive
counci!! will settle the size of the
British navy and the French army
and call upon these organizations to
go to war whenever the council
chooses. Does any one seriously
think that the British and French
will submit to this?

“All this insincere rhetoric has
been dictated to us by an Amertean
idealogue, whose fourteen points we
swallowed without examination on
the eve of a crushing military vic-
tory. Wilson has come between us
and the fruits of war on the field
and tn the conference chamber."

Predicts Ruin for League.

The weekly journal Common Sense
mays:

“The league is based upon force.

seemingly determined to impose
their will upon the world and alter
historic landmarks in accordance
with their own ambitions. How can

New Complication in Italian
Jugo-Slav Dispute Is Loom-

Special Cable Despatch to Tae 8U™%
Copyright, 1919; a rights reeerved.

Paris, March 1.—Rasing its action
upon President Wilson's fourteen
points, Bulgaria is about to spring a
new complication fn the Itallan-Jugo-
Slav dispute,
been heard of this plan in that birth-
Place of trouble, the Balkans. It is a
;movement in Bulgaria for immediate
close relations and ultimate reunion
with Jugo-Slavia, thereby increasing
the population of the latter by some
5,000,000 and giving Jugo-Slavia tH
great advantage of extending from the
Adriatic to the Black Sea.

Such a project will greatly increase
the alarm of the Italians, who already
are worrying about the Jugo-Slavs,
and they are expected to contest the
expansion of Jugo-Slavia more flercely
than ever, adding more fuel to a fire
already dangerous.

Tt is remarkable that the Bulgarians
Plan to present to the Peace Congress
their claim to the greater part of
Macedonia, which means practically the
southern half of Serbia, now the domit-
nant element in Jugo-Slavia. This aston-
ishing situation In which a nation which
fought the Allies as part of the German
coalition and was decisively beaten
presenting territorial claims to the
victors has its origin in President Wil-
son's fourteen points and has been en-
ccuraged by Americans in Bulgaria.

——

Macedonia Long a Sore Spot.

The Bulgarians claim that Macedonia
always has been the sorest of all the
Balkan sore spots and was inhabited
mainly by Bulgarians before the war,
although it has been so devastated that
there {s little population of any kind
now. After the fourteen points had been
‘promulgam@t. Bulgartsog asked Amert-
cans in Bulgaria !f President Wilson
meant that Macedonia might become
Bulgarian, and when they received en-
couragement this view became wide-
spread. This accounts partly for Bul-
garia's capitulation in September.

Acting on this supposition, the present
Bulgarian Government has drawn up a
full statement of !ts claim to Macedonia
and expects to have an opportunity to
present it to the Peace Conference,

The Bulgarians have worked out thor-
oughly their plan for a union with the
Jugo-Slavs, although so far it has not
been made public. Its chief feature is
the deposition of Prince Alexander of
Serbia and the establishment of a re-
public consisting of Jugo-Glavia and Bul-
garia united,

 

 

Seeking Union of South Slavs.

The basis of the Bulgarian claim ts
that all the south Slavs shovld be
united. The Bulgarians are Slave just as
are the Serbians, Croats and Slovenes,
They are not willing, however, to accept
the sovereignty of the dynasty, the

Karageorgevitch, which they have fought |

so bitterly. Boris, the present King of
Bulgaria, is said to be ready to abdicate
if a republican union with Jugo-Slavia
can be consummated. The Bulgarians
are prepared to pay indemnities to Ser-
bia and Greece for war damages and
intend an international inquiry into the
charges of atrocities, ag they did after
the recent Balkan wars. ~

Some time in the future of the Peace
Conference, there !s good authority for
gtating, the whole Macedonian question
will be considered with a view of ascer-
taining if that indeterminate region can
be distributed according to the principle
of nationality or else made dutonomous

Lloyd George's plans which require
; him to return to England about March
|22. The decision to land at Brest
| Means that the President will have to
| Postpone for ten days his visit to Bel-
| sium and the devastated regions.

The President, it appears, wished to
| jana at Antworp on his return and go
| thence to Brussels, motoring from there

to the devastated regions, Lille and
then to Paris. He planned to spend |
| five days in this way, but the plan had
jto be changed to-day when Premier!
Lloyd George wired from England that
jhe was anxious to confer with the
President on the peace treaty as soon
as possible after the President arrived
in France on account of the later en-
gagement the Prime Minister had in
England.

Progress Made on Treaty.

The President is now due in Paris on
March 14; between that date and the!

outline of the treaty that can be agreed |

;Prime Minister ts expected, so that by |
the time the latter leaves for England
the date for the appearance of the Ger-
man representatives before the Peace
Congress can be fixed. In that event
the President will leave for Brussels ar
the same time that the Prime Minister
departs.

The great progress that {s being made
upon the treaty is indicated by th2
presentation to-day of the complete
military and naval terms for the ap-

the report of the Committee on Repara-

Panis, March 1,—Despite the clouds
overhanging the Peace Conference.
such as the Jugo-Slav dispute, there
are the best of reasons for the belief
that the German delegates will be
in Paris early in April, and the im-
pression Is growing !n all circles that
the peace treaty will be signed early
in May at the latest.

Andre Tardieu and other
French members of the conference
now hold firmly to this view, which
regarded as significant, for the
reason that the French reservations
and objections have seemed to some
to be the chief obstacle to early sign-
ing of the treaty.

But fresh evidence is afforded
every day now that the French, ae
well as the others, intend to yield
many points in the Interest of a
speedy peace, which there is a gen-
eral disposition now to regard as
vital to the preservation of civiliza-
tion and social order.

the

League to Wait Treaty Draft.

It {8 possible now-to forecast to
some extent the procedure connected
with the appearance of the Germans
at the peace table, which undoubtedly
will mark a dramatic stage in the
conference. The arrival of President
Wilson in the middle of March will
be followed immediately by the most
important meetings yet held by the
council of ten, inasmuch as sum-
maries of all reports must be laid
before the leaders, with the possible
exception of that on the respons!-
bility for the war, which may not be
made until later. These committee
reports will not be made to the con-
ference, but to the council, and will
not be made public until the treaty
has been drawn.

The leaders, in a series of meet-
ings to be held during the last two
weeks in March, will outline the
peace treaty, appointing a drafting
committee to work out the ideas in
detail. The latest date now set for
the completion of the treaty is the
first week in April. The League of
Nations will awalt the drawing up of
the actual peace treaty and later will
be made a supplement to ft, provided
the conference adonts the covenazt.

Chief Featnres of Treaty.

The most important features of the
peace treaty will be:

1. Boundaries of new Ger
many, which will show a tre-
mendous shrinkage, as East
Prussia probably will be neu-

tralized, while Posnania, part of
Silesta and possibly Danzig will
be severed on the east; on the
west the Rhenish provinces wil!
he neutralized temporarily and
Schleswig will be severed en-
tirely.

2. The disarmament features,
as drawn up by the commission
under Marshal Foch.

3. Amount of damages
many will be required to pay
and the terms of payment. The
distribution of this sum will be
left to the Allies

4. The economic conditions
under which the blockade will be
lifted and German trade may he
resumed,

(er.

5. Acknowledgment by Ger-
many of her culpability and the
fixing of responsibility, morally

at least, on the authors of the

war.

Payment for Inatallments,

Regarding economic conditions there
is now a general agreement to require
of her a series of payments to cover
many years. ©n the hig pointe of
