Rebels Have Set Fire to Half of O11
Tanks, Says Report.

WASWINGTON, May 1.—Tampico has
suffered great damage through the re-
newed fighting. between the Constitu-
tionalists and Federal forces there-
about, according to despatches, un-
official but of an authorative character,
received in Washington late to-night.

It is reported that the uninterrupted
fire from both sides, coupled with the
entire disregard of the protestations of
foreign owners of the great business in-
terests of the Tampico region, has set
fire to more than half of the oil storage |
tanks at and near the port. There are |
stored at Tampico more than 8,000,000
barrels of oil, mostly owned by American
and British concerns, and the pes- |
simistic account of the situation re- |
cites that probably all of this most |
valuabie property will be destroyed if,
some results are not quickly obtained |
in the efforts to stop the fighting. '

It is believed that under the circum. |
stances, further representations will be
made soon to the State Department !
which will compel the United States to
take steps to protect its own and the |
property’ of European Governments.

Further, it is reported that the cas-
ualties on both sides in the recent bat-
tles have been numerous and it is also
indicated that there have been a few
