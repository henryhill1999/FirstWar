Loxpon, Oct. 5.—The railway strike
has been settled. The men will re-
sume work forthwith. <A feature of |
the settlement is that the Government |
guarantees there will be no wage re-|
duction whatever before September,
1920, -That is an extension for a six
mouths period of the present sched-
ule beyond the previous offer, |

In view of the unlikelihood of aj}

next autumn the adjustment is con-
sidered a victory for the Government
as well as for the strikers.

 

By the Associated Press.

Lonvon, Oct. 5.—With dramatic sud-
denness in the quiet of the London
Sunday afternoon it was announced to
a knot of people waiting in Downing
street that the great railway strike,
which appeared to have brought the
almost to the brink of revo-
lution, was settled and that the strik-
ers would resume work as quickly as
possible.

The terms of the settlement are in
the nature of a compromise. The Na-
tional Union of Railwaymen agrees to
call off the strike and the Government
consents to a renewal of the negotia-
tions, the continuance of the existing
wage scale for another year, instead of
six months, as previously offered, and |
the establishment of a minimum wage |

51 shillings ($12.75) while the cost
of living is 110 per cent. above the
pre-war level,

The eettlement was the result of a
long conference to-day between a trade
delegation, including representa-
the railway men’s union, and
fremier Lloyd - George and’ Andrew
Bonae Law in the famous conference

By Staff Correspondent of Tne Sux.

Boyton, Oct, 5,.—It is probable that
Albert of Beggium never heard of the
Boston police strike, At any rate he'll
never believe that this city has ever,
since the days of William Lloyd Gar-
rison, indulged in anything more un-
conventional than’a good lusty cheer,
and that in a moment of forgetfulness.

King Albert, Queen Elizabeth and
Prince Leopold entered Boston at 10
this morning and left before 8 o'clock
this evening. In its best clothes and
equipped with umbrellas, galoshes and |
mackintoshes, for the day was damp |

and gloomy and rain impended,,
the city fared forth to do the
visitors honor. The crowds were
of good size but repressed. They
clapped their well gloved. hands and
waved their handkerchiefs, Now and
then the younger folks cheered, but,
ty be wholly accurate, the crowds were
silent.

It wasn't because Boston was not |
glad to see the stalwart monarch who
gave the Kaiser to know that Bel-;
sium was a nation and not a thor-j
oughfare. Far from that. But by no
stretch of the imagination could the
reception be called enthusiastic. It is
quite likely that it was as King Albert ;
wished. He is not given to effusions
himself. However, everybody seemed
to enjoy himself except perhaps the
photographers. The photographers ;
were thrown out of more places than
ever. Virtually everybody in Cam-
bridge took a shove at a photographer
just before the ceremonies at Harvard
Univesity. )

Guests Have Busy Day.

The King and Queen, under the chap-
eronage of Mayor Peters, crowded more
into the few hours they were in ‘town
than the ordinary individual would in al

month, They were a bit late in getting |
here. ‘ |
Directly from their private train

they were escorted to the Cathedral of
the Holy Cross. It is quite impossible
to set on paper the beauty of services
that followed. The great church has a
capacity of 4,500, and it was thronged.

Cardinal Mercier, Cardinal O'Connell,
the King and the Queen, ovcupied
thrones. The solemn faced astripling

who is heir to Belgium’s crown sat quite
alone behind his parents, The solemn
tigh mass was celebrated by Mer.
George J. Petterson of St. Vincent's.
Cardinal Mercier, who has been Boston's
guest since yesterday, delivered an ad-
dress and prayed for President Wilson.

“Tribunal Superior to Govern-

and Even Death.

 

Special Despatch to Tak Sux.

WASHINGTON, Oct. 5.—Drastic laws to
prevent “organized intimidation” by
labor, groups or any other body were
advocated to-night by the Republican
Publicity Association. Violent resis-
tance to law, impairment of interstate
commerce, destruction of life or prop-
erty and similar actions must be dealt
with now on the theory that an ounce
of prevention is better than a pound

A statement was issued, which said
in part:

“Government fails in its dut® and lib-
erty ceases to exist when it les within |
the power of one man or group of men
to deny to any other man or group of
men the right to seek and accept such
employment as they desire. It follows,
therefore, that it is the duty of the Gov-
ernment to enact effective laws for pre-
vention “of violence or threats vio-
lerice which will interfere with the\indi-
vidual’s right to work for the support
of himself and those dependent on him.
The police power of the Government in
iis broadest sense must rise superior to
the commercial force of society, either
inevitable result
must be overthrow of Government,

“Never in the history of the world
Was there greater nee® for useful pro-
duction than there is to-day. There
must be uninterrupted and unimpaired
production of the necessities of life or

widespread suffering must ensué.

“From the general welfare standpoint,
therefore, an honest day's work is no
less essential than an honest day’s pay.
From failure of an honest day’s pay only
the individual suffers. From a failure
of an honest day's work the entire com-
munity suffers because of the resultant

derproduction, the scarcity of com-

odities and the lowering of the plane
of physical, mental and moral develop-
ment. In the exercise of his personal
liberty any employer should be free if
he so desires to employ only members
of a labor organization. He should also
be free to employ men who are not mem-
bers of any organization,

“Whenever the Government througn
any of its agencies or by direct or in-
direct exercise of any of its powers }
limits employment to the members of
specified labor organizations it violates
that section of the Constitution which
assures to all persons within the juris-
diction of the Government the equa!
protection of the laws, Whenever a
labor organization by any means what-
ever #.able to bar any person whatever
from employment there is set up in this |

 

 

j country a tribunal superior to the Gov-

ernment whtth makes hon-membership |
a crime and condemns the non-member
without trial to the punishment of un-
employment, with consequent want, suf-
fering and even death.

“This nation is now confronted with
the question whether the Government
can protect its citizens in the enjoy-
ment of personal liberty or whether is |
mus: acknowledge the superio, juris-
diction and power of the labor unions,
composed of the small minority pf the

Paris, Oct. 5.—Conferences which
have followed the letter of Premier
Clemenceau asking President Wilson
| to call a meeting of the League of
| Nations by November, which, although
| written to Col. E. M. House on Sep-
tember 4, was made public only yes-

| terday, have established the following
| points:
First—That President ‘Wilson

now intends to issue the call for
the first meeting of the league
and by this is meant not only the |
Council but the Assembly, imme-
diately upon the ratification of the
Versailles treaty by a third allied
Power.
Second—If
power

 

| the third ratifying
is the United States the
| meeting, according to the under-
| standing reached here, will be held
| in Washington, as the plan pro-
| Vided originally, but if that power
should be Italy or Japan, the United
States not being a member of the
| league when the call is issued, Pres-
ident Wilson in all probability will
designate a meeting place in
Europe, probably Paris.

Third—In order to make it pos-
sible for the meeting of the league
to be held in Washington through
ratification by the United States as

the third power efforts are being
made by Americans who say they
are close to the President to pre-
Pete Italy from ratifying the treaty
by royal decree and to encourage
the Japanese to delay action.

Paris, Oct. 5.—Col. E. M. House left
Paris to-night and is sailing to-morrow
from Brest on the Great Northern for
the United States. Naturally his de-
parture fs being connected here with
the illness of President Wilson,
though the Colonel denies this and in
fact is leaving without the knowledge
of the President, who, when the Col-
one} still was in England, suddenly or-
dered him»to return to Paris and join
the American mission, of which he
still is a member.

From all indications this order from
its nature nettled Col. House greatly
and he remarked to friends that it was |

al-

the firet real order that he ever had |
received from President Wilson. Since |
his arrival here he has attended only |

one meeting of the commission and has!
shown no interest in the proceedings. |
Now, coincident with the President's
illness, he seems to have taken things
into his own hands, He is going directly
to Washington, which has created the
impression here that it is in his mind

to take hold of the treaty situation

touch recently with his chief, still is
using every effort to obtain for his work
and for the league the unqualified ap-
proval of the American Senate, and in
the last few weeks has been trying to
get the French to help him.

That the Clemenceau letter was writ-
ten with this design is not doubted here,
but back of it also is the desire of the
French, with so many interests at stake,
to demonstrate as speedily as possible
whether the league scheme is workable
or not. This they think can be done only
by having a meeting of the league im-
mediately, at which they will press their

Special Despatch to Tnk Sex,
Wasuinoaton, Oct. 5,—President
Wilson had a restful and fairly com-
fortable day. The day’s developments
Were encouraging, but it was empha-
sized that the danger is by no means

| passed and that no definite statement

indicating complete recovery can be
expected within the next few days.

Even under favorable conditions
progress will be slow and there must
be continued anxiety for some time
Tt is a question of restoring
nerves, and this process cannot be hur-
ried, it is explained.

3ut Dr. Grayson feels that he ts at
least making some progress by hold-
ing the ailment in check. The Prest-

} dent was cheerful to-day and his ap-

petite was rather better than since he
was taken seriously ill. His pulse
and temperature have been normal,
The oppressive heat still bothered him
and left him somewhat depressed at
intervals, but otherwise he was fairly
comfortable and took several naps in
the course of the afternoon and eve
ning.

Checked by Dr. Grayson,

This morning the President sur-
prised Dr. Grayson by calling for his
stenographers and explaining that he
wanted to dictate. But this fs Sun-
day, Dr. Grayson explained, and no
good Presbyterian works on Sunday,
The explanation satisfied the Presl-
dent.

Mrs. Wilson is holding up well un-
der the strain and is with the Presi-
dent much of the time day and night,
The President still makes frequent in-
auiries as to State affairs and is par-
ticularly concerned about the coming
industrial conference, it is explained,
but every effort is made to keep all
discussions of national or international
matters away from him. In response
to an inquiry as to whether the Presi-
dent might take a trip later to some
quiet place or leave Washington in a
few days, it was explained that this
idea was for the out of the
question. The impression was clearly
given that the President's condition is
too critical to permit serious considera-
tion of such a plan.

Council to Be Formed,

At this meeting Secretary Tumulty

him before the breakdown

Messages expressing sympathy for
