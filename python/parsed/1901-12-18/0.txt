aay from Scranton were Samuel Gom-

d Frank P. Sargent.
vairman Osear 5. Straus
to Turkey, introduced E D. Durand
of Washington, Secretary of the Industrial
Commiseion. Mr. Durand said that one
ef t'e things that was necessary (to (1.6
tment of labor difficulties was organi-
zation on both eides—organization of em-
and of employers. The latter,
e said, bad been slow to organize, but
their organization was @ heoessary pre-
liminary to conferences which should
settle the two great classes of
between capital and labor, One of the
classes was the general question of hours
and wages and the other, and more trivial
pertained to rules and other matters
minor detail. The firet clase should be
adjusted by representatives of both or-
gonized employers and organized em-
| ‘ees Tie second should be settled
~ the individual employer and the in-
dividual employee or group of employees

We must not at

some such result, a ow any
retrogra e movement. We must keep to the
front. It means constant attention. t
means giving in in many cases

We have all got to be willing to compromise
to a certain extent, and Oo not mean by
that that either side will have to sive up any
rights; there is to. be no bep g of the kn
but both the laborer an employ’ r mus
come with well-defined rights which, pies
careful discussion, have been so well pla
before both sides that each side will eay when
the decision is arrvied at, “Well, that is the
best we can get. and we must be thankful.”

I do not believe in coddling men. 4
dea of giving them things outside which

rings about a certain amount of obligation
on their part is all wrong. you have
anything to give them, give it to them in
money. They don't care for the outside
things

Samuel Gompers said:

There is in our time, if not a harmony of
interests, which T shall not attempt to dis-
cuss at this time, because there is a divergence
of opinion upon that subject, but there i
certainly a community of interests _ tha

as the “trusts.” is their attempting to inter-
fere with the political affairs of our country
applause], and pParttoularly the judicial,

am speaking of them from an industrial
standpolnt and from a commercial view
John Mitchell, the smooth-faced, clerical-
looking head of the great Mine Workers’
Union, spoke briefly. “To me,” said he,
“the solution of the problem of labor is not
a difficulg one. It is not one that requires
the intFoduction or consumption of
Utopian ideas. To me, and with my ex-
perience in the movement, having taken
part in about as many labor strikes as any
one of my age, it seems that what
men want to do is simply to reason to-
gether. If tae employers of labor and the
representatives of the labor unions can
meet in honest conference, if when they
meet they will tell one another the absolute
truth, I daresay that the days of strikes
and lockouts shall be over.”

YALE CLUBEN-BUTLER STARVING,

Left Behind tn the Club's Old Buliding,
and Has Lackcd Food and Fuel.
The attention of the Tenderloin police
was called last night:to the destitution of
Parker Learned, who for many years was
butler at the Yale Club's old building at
17 Fast Twenty-sixth street,! but who has

nearly starved to death recently

When the Yale Club moved into new
quarters in West Forty-fourth street lest
May, Learned was not taken along. Mra,
MeCoon of 144 Seventy-
second street, who owns the old building,
permitted him, however, to stay in the base-

Cornelius Sest

 

ment with bis wife and little boy. The
rooms upstairs have not been occupied
since the Yale Club moved out and the
ainily has had no means support.
Learned is now advanced in years
Yesterday afternoon he becaine ill in
Texington avenue near 124th street. It is

supposed that he had been to ask Assistance
from a physician who had befriended him
and that he had walked up to Harlem in
the snow. He was carrled into a saloon
and there was recognized by Milton Barber,
a cerpenter of 2024 Lexington avenue.
Rarber put the old butler in a cab and took
him home. When he reached there he waa
uneonscious and his wife, thinking him
dea’, fainted

An ambulance was called from New York
Hospital. Dr. Chittenden, who came with
it, was so touched by the wife's assertion
that they had been witheut food and fuel
for four days thet be gave her $1.50, all
the money he happened to have. Barber
ev the cabman a dolar to pay for the ride
downtown, but the cabman «aid he didn't
need the m ney so very much and handed
it over to Mrs. Learned.

Learned was taken to the hospital. There
it was sald that he had apoplexy and was
very weak from lack of nourishment

Next door to the old Yale Club building

SAMPSON IS CRITICALLY ILL.

ABUSE HEAPED UPON HIM DAILY
BY PARTISANS OF SCHLEY.

 

 

For a Year He Has Hardly Been Cognizant
of Developments in the ‘‘Controversy”
and Has Taken No Part in Them, Yet
Even New, When He Will Probably
Never Leave His House Again, Every
Mall Brings Insults—His Counsel to
Object to Dewcy’s Opinion —Schley Bilis

Wasnrnaton, Deo. 17.—Admiral Samp~

son is critically ill and will probably
never again leave his house, 1613
New Hampshire avenue. Every pleas-

ant day since the Admiral and his family
returned from the mountains, at the end
of the summer season, he has been able
to take an afternoon walk. Sunday he
was out for the last time, but found him-
self 60 weak that ho was obliged to return
to the house without finishing his walk.

It was learned to-day that Admiral Samp-
son has not been cognizant of the various
features of the so-called Sampson-Scl.iey
controversy for a year or more. Until
recentiy he has known in a general way
what has been going on, but has taken
no personal interest in the case, not even
while the Court of Inquiry was in session.
He has displayed no iiuterest whatever in
the findings. Admiral Sampson's family
and friends are made painfully aware of
the bitterness of the controversy by the
receipt in almost every mail of abusive
letters from hot-headed and unthinking
achley partisans in various parts of the
United States.

Stayton and Campbell, the New York
law firm retained by friends of Rear-
Admiral Sampson to represent his interests
before the Schley Court of Inquiry, will on
Thuraday lay before the Secretary of the
Navy a statement containing citations from
the court’s record to show that Admiral
Dewey, in holding that Admiral Schley
was 1n absolute command of the American
forces in the naval battle of Santiago,
violated his own rulings as President of the
investigating body

The letter on the subject, to which refer-
ence was made in THE Sun's Washington

despatch last night, wes signed by W. H
Steyton of the law firm, and requested
permission of Secretary Long to present
the statement showing A cmircl Dewey

to have been inconsistent in his separate
memorandum appended to the court's
report. Secretary Long granted Mr.
Stayton's request and gave him until Thurs-
cay morning to present his bill of excep.
tions. Mr. Stayton will probably present
it personally. He wanted to be beard
orally, but Secretary Long will not listen
to any other than written arguments

At the solicitation of Adnural Schley and
his advisers, Senatur MeComas of Maryland
saw Secretary Long to-day for the puryx
of inducing him to grant more time for the
presentation of Adniral Schley’s petition
the court's condemnation of his con-
duct be not approved. Mr. Long had given
Admiral Schley until Wednesday evening to
file the petition, but after talking with Sen-
ator Mc( omas he consented to extend the
tline to 4 o'clock Thursday afternoon

The litue game of politics which is being
layed with Admiral Schiey'’s misfortunes
« already developing difficulties for those
who are taking pa in it. Through the
irony of fate, Admiral Dewey, himself a
;roneunced candidate for the Presidency,
has furnished the rallying ery of the Schley
causes in the opinion expressed by him that
Admiral Schley is the real victor cf San-
tiago. Of course there are people who
ecntend that Admire! Dewey was incon-
ristent in giving Schley credit for the victory

after having agreed with the strictures of
the court on the famous loop, but Admiral
Schley’s political henchmen are willing \o
overjook that and even promise Dewey
second lace on the Schley Presidential
ticket if we will sick to lis expressed
intention not to open bis mouth in ex-

lanauon of what Le meant and what
f, did not mean But it is ob

Sciusey boom too quickly may bring ts
eater! There are some who think that
Gen. Felix Agnus made a mists Ke in sta ting

Admiral Dewey w« uld resent being side-
tra: ked in hie ambition to attain the Preel-

dency by a candidate of lis own making,
and the wiser plan would have been to
have given Admiral Dewey the chance t

announce iis withdrawel fiom tie race
before Schley's candidacy was announced
Theat would have saved the emharran-

ment of a conflict of interests» However,
the Sehley boom is wide awake, while
Dewey boom elumbers, and Aduura,

Amest! Run Down by the Isle of Kent OIF
Cape Cod—Crew Saved.

Boston, Dec. 17.—The Spanish steamer
Amesti, from Bilboa, Spain, for Philadelphia,
was run down and sunk 828 miles east of
Cape Cod early on last Saturday morning
by the British steamship Ide of Kent. The
crew of twenty-nine men were rescued with
ciMficulty and lost all their personal property.
The Kent was bound from Savannah for
Bremen with a cargo of cotton, and her
bows were so badly smashed that she came
into this port to-day for repairs,

The vessels were in collision about 3.30
A. M., when the weather was clear. The
Spanish steamer was ‘ring a course
across the Kent's bow when her lights were

 

et

sighted by the latter
but the Kent's bow crashed irto
the Amesti amidships and cut her down to
the water’a edge

Newarg, N. J., Dec. 17.—While a stage
containing about twenty men, including
several Newark Aldermen, was descending
the hill from the City Home at Verona to
the trolley terminal, where the party was
to board a special car, the horses ran away.
At the bottom of the road the stage upset
and the occupants were piled in a heap
or scattered along the road. The polo
snapped and the team ran on.

Aldermen Horace Holcombe, Elmer Hor-

 

ton, Frederick W. Kroeger, George L.
Robenstein, Val Baunach, ex-Alderman
Herman Schmidt, Christian Sehmidt

and Olif Scharin, all prominent Newark
business men, were badly hurt. The in-
jured were carried back to the city home,
where they were attended by Drs. White-
house, Bond and Chapman. Later Hol-
combe, Kroeger and Horton were taken
to St. Michael's Hospital The others

STARTLED ITALIAN CHAMBER.

expelled Member Smashes Glass Door and
Pokes His Head In.
Spectal Cable Despatch to THE Sun.

Rome, Dec. 17.—The partisans of Signor
Ferri, who was expelled from the Chamber
of Deputies yesterday for refusing to with-
draw insults he had levelled against the
southern provinces, tried to-day to obtain
an annulment of his expulsion. The dis-
cussion ended in the rejection of the pro-
posal,

The Chamber was sbortly afterward
startled by a crash of glass, and as the
members turned they saw Ferri'’s head
sticking through a hole in a glass door,
through which he had smashed his fist.
Ferri was excited]? waving a paper and
shouting: “Down with the Parliamentary
Camorra!"

This comparison of the Chamber of
Deputies with a criminal society of Naples
resulted in an uproar of mingled anger
and amusement.

"PRICE TWO CENTS.
WILL PUT UP PALACE HOTEL,
DR. W. SEWARD WFEBR HEADS
SYNDICATE OF RICH MEN.

 

The New Structure Will Be on the Paran
Stevens Estate Froperty on Fifth
Avenue at Forty-fourth Street—To
Be One of the Finest tn the World.

New York is to have another magnificent
hotel. It ia to be erected on the southeast
corner of Fifth avenue and Forty-fourth
street. According to the statementa of
those interested in the venture it is to be
the most beautiful and complete hotel on
the continent. With Delmonioo’s on one
adjacent corner and Sherry's on the other,
the hotel will try to outshine ite neighbors
in up-to-date appliances. Just what the
cost will be ia not yet determined, but it
was sald yesterday that no expense would
be spared and the expenditure would be
in the millions.

The syndicate that is to build the hotel
is composed of wealthy New Yorkers,
headed by Dr. William Seward Webb,
son-in-law of the late William H. Vander-
bilt. The site selected extends 90 feet
along Fifth avenue, and 160 feet along
Forty-fourth street. It is owned at present
by the Parau dievens estate, of which there
are thirteen heirs, some in England aad
some here.

The Stevens estate was so tied up that
the heirs could not get possession of it until
the youngest became of age. The prop-
erty in question has been leased to a map
who has a butcher shop on the corner in @
one-ttory building, and to another tenant
who keeps boarding stables on the re-
mainder of the property. It brought in @
rental of only $5,000 a year, so the P.
children, to whom it was willed b a
Stevens, put the property on the market.

The syndicate formed in Wall Street to
build the hotel got an option on the prop-
erty for $125,000 and now has decided to

buy it. The property also includes the
old Fifth avenue avern’ known as “The
Willow,” which is marked by the only

willow tree on Fifth avenue. If adjoini
property can be obtained it is oroponel
to have the building extend along the entire
Fifth avenue block from Forty-third to
Forty-fourth street

It will be a skyscraper and will have at
least 400 rooms for the accommodation of

guests. It will be a model from an archi-
tectural siandpoint and absolutely fire-
proof. It will be a d versified and pict-

uresque structure, abounding in loggias,
balconies and gables. If the expectations
of the promoters are realized it will be the
tallest hotel in New York. The main floor
will be finished in onyx, mosaic and narble.
The priv nd banquet rooms will
be furnished in gorgeous style with every.
thing that money can buy to make them
attractive and comfortable

The claim is made that the building will
be unequalled in the nurnber and spacious.
neas of its corridors, Every column and
beam will be of The partitions and
arches between the floor beams will be of
burnt terra cotta. It will have wonderful
sculptured ceilings and walls of Indiana
