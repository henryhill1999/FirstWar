LIT HIS CIGAR WITH ORDER.

WARDEN OF THE TOMBS DE-
FIES DEPUTY COMMISSIONER.

It Appears That Mr. Fanning Had No Power
to Suspend Him—Dispute Between
Tombs Clergymen Origin of Complaint
-~The Rev. John J. Munro Complainant.

When Warden James J. Hagan came
down to the Tombs Prison yesterday morn-
ing he found on his desk the document
quoted in yesterday's S0n which peremp-
torily suspended him from “all duties as
Warden of the City Prison pending the in-
vestigation by Commissioner Lantry of
statements this day submitted in writing.”
This document was signed by N.O. Fanning,
Deputy Commissioner of Correction. Mr.
Fagan also found on his desk a box of
cigars left there by a friend from Colorado
who had dropped in to see him. Mr. Hagan

opened the cigar box, selected a cigar from

the top row, and cut off the end of the cigar.
Then, with the cigar in his mouth, he took
Mr. Fanning'’s letter suspending him from
office and tore from it carefully a wide
strip which with much pains he folded into
a lamp lighter. This he applied to a gas
jet and lighted his cigar with it. When this
was satiafactorily done he threw the re-
mains of Mr. Fanning's letter into the fire
and took up the routine of his prison duties.
He continued to administer the affaires of
the prison all day and expects to resume
the same functions at his regular hour this
morning.

In other words he did just
what he eald he was going to do when he
was informed by a Bun reporter late on
Saturday night that Mr. Fanning had sus-
pended him.

“Why should I pay any attention to

's letter,” he said later in the
aay. “With Commissioner Lantry right
here in town Mr. Fanning had no author-
ity to suspend me. He went altogether
beyond his jurisdiction. Under such cir-
cumstances I would pay no more atten-
tion to an order suspending me that came
from him than I would to a similar order
coming from you.

*The whole affair is the outgrowth of
petty pique on the part of Mr. Fanning
toward me because I refused to obey a cer-
tain order of his about an utterly trifling
matter here in the prison. Last Thureday
Mr. Fanning called me up over the tele-
phone and asked me if I were going to
do as he directed. I teld him that under
the circumstances I was not. The next
1 heard was from Commissioner Lantry
who told me to do the thing Mr. Fanning
had ordered, This order of the Commis-
rioner’s I, of course, at once prepared to
obey. I do not care at this stage of the
proceedings to say what the particular
thing in question was, except that it had
nothing whatever to do with politica, noth-

ing whatever to do with prisoners or their

treatment and nothing to do with prison
discipline.

“The next I heard of Mr. Fanning was
cn Saturday whem he came to the Tombs.
I thought his manner was a littl reserved
toward me, but he said nothing whatever
about any complaint or statement adverse
to my management having been made.
I suppose that in addition to his personal
ri ue he is making a grand-stand play

» kept in his slae as Deputy Commis-
Gene T have not heard a word Trans Com-
missioner Lantry to-day, although I under-
stand Mr. Fanning reported to him last
night.”

ar the Mohican Club yeeterday afternoon
Commiasioner Lantry seemed more dis-
posed to la’ at the ‘whole matter than to
treat it yusly. He sustained Warden
Ha an in refusing to pay any attention

Mr Fanning's order of « nsion

“l have no doubt,” he d, “that Mr
Fanning thought he was justified in doing
«hat he did, but he was over-hasty, When
! am away and have delegated my authority

»him he has full power to act. But when
faro right bere and within reach 60 rericus

RAILROAD WRE cK IN “MACON, GA.

Open Switch Derails a Train--Two Dead
and Forty Persons Hurt.
Macon, Ga., Deo. 8.—In a wreck on the
Central of Georgia Railway on the out-
skirta of the city at 3:45 o'clock thia morp-
ing two negro women, bodies unidentified,
were killed and forty persons more or
less seriously injured. Among those hurt
were J. W. Blount, travelling paseerger
agent of the Georgia Central Railroad;
W. C. MeMillan of the Georgia Railway;
James Freeman of the Southern Railway;
Lewis C. Fletcher, Atianta, special agent
of the North British and Mercantile In-
surance Company; James Berger, Cin-
cinnati; Miss Emily Terry, Chicago: Judge
Kelly, Opelika, Ala.; twenty-five men.bers
of the Walter L. Main show, whose names
cannot he ascertained,
The train, in charge of Conductor Beach,
was entering the city and had crossed the
high trestle over the Ocmulgee River
when the engine plunged into an open
ewitch, derailing the cars and overturning
them and hurling them down the embank-
ment. The coaches were quickly set on
fire by the live coals from the stoves. The
inflammable material of which the cars were
constructed served as food for the flames.
The firemen worked heroically in the battle
with the flames, but their efforts to save
them were futile. Of the eight coaches
mak up the train, the Atlanta sleeper
and the day coaches were completely
destroyed, while the Macon sleeper was only
partly burned.
The injured are seane in the city hos-
ital. condition of Judge Kelly, who
internally injured, is precarious and
doubta are expressed at the hospital as te
his recovery. Re. crew of the train eecaped
injuries. of the Walter L. Main
Circus, mi Pal of whom were in the
smoking car, were injured. Having entered
the city Engineer Ewing at the throttle
had not the slightest warning of the im-
pending danger. hts of the city
were before him when, with a sudden cras
the entire train seemed to leave the track
at once. The only theory that can be ad-
vanced by railroad men is that the switch
bar at the bridge had been tampered with.

SOUGHT CASH IN NAGLE'S NAME.

Nice Young Man Met a Detective at Sul-
zer’s Park and Was Locked Up.
Ernest Sulzer was called up on the tele-
phone at Sulzer’s Harlem River Park yester-
day afternoon.
“Sulzer,” said a man’s voice at the other
end of the wire, “this is Street Cleaning |
Commissioner Nagle. I want to get some |
money this afternoon and have a check
for $50. If I send it over will you cash it?”
Sulzer replied that he would. Detective
Meehan of the East 126th street station
happened to be in Sulzer’s office just then,
and Sulzer mentioned the matter to Meehan.
“Nagle doesn't do things that way,” said
the detective. ‘I'll just wait here and see,
I think some Confidence man Is"trying to
work a game on you.”
A few minutes later a nicely dressed
young man walked into the office and said
he came in response to Mr. Sulzer's talk
with Mr. Nagle. Meehan stepped aside and
let the young man talk. He Sulzer a
few compliments, thanked vim for Mr,
Nagle in advance and then presented a
check for $50 on the Fulton Market National
Bank, made paypbie to ae Kennedy,
and indorsed vd. J.t
As Sulzer moved to gett Ne money Meehan
stepped out from a closet. When the youth
saw the detective he became very nervous
indeed. Meehan asked him where he got
the check, and he said that a man gave it
to him at 126th street and Third avenue
and told him to bring it to Bulzer's and qe
the cash for it. The man was to give him
$1 for his errand, the voung man said
Meehan locked him up on @ charge of
attempting to pass a worthless check. He
said hie name was William Borden, 21 years
old, of 282 Eaat ith street

BURGLARS PLUNDER SEIZED.

-_--—

| senses FIND $5,000 WORTH OF
LOOT IN BROOKLYN FLAT.

Whereabonts Revealed b} a Girl Burglar
Who Was Captured in Mount Vernen
—Four Arresia In the Case-—Some of
the Swag May Bolong to Clara Morris.

Mount Vernon, N. Y., Dec, 8.—Through
a confession secured by Chief Foley of the
Mount Vernon police from Mary Elizabeth
Thompson, a seventeen-year-old girl burg-
lar who is locked up in this city, a large
fence representing $5,000 worth of plunder
was unearthed to-day in Brooklyn and
two men, believed to be confederates of
the girl burglar, were arrested. The plun-
der covers a dozen burglaries in Mount
Vernon, New Rochelle and Yonkers. It
was found in the flat house at 2008 Fulton
street, Brooklyn, by Detective William
Lynch of Mount Vernon and two of Capt.
White’s men from the Sixty-eighth pre-
cinct.

To-morrow a party of suburbanites
whose houses have been robbed will go to
Brooklyn to look over the booty which con-
sists of silk dresses, men's evening suits,

opera cloaks, silk hats, furs, overcoats,
silver and jewelry. It is believed by the
police that some of the plunder may belong
to Clara Morris, the actress, whose home
at Yonkers was robbed several weeks ago.

The Thompson girl, who is a creole, was
arrested on last Friday night on a Mount
Vernon trolley car while making off with
a sealskin sacque and a silk dress which
she had stolen from the home’ of Mrs. Sam-
uel Hettinger of New Rochelle. Sheentered
the Hettinger house in daylight by the
way of the basement, and finding the fam-
ily not at home smashed the door leading
to the kitchen and ransacked the house.
The girl when arrested declared that she
was innocent and the police could get no
information from her.

Chief Foley finally resorted to the oli
ruse of putting a decoy in the cell with her.
He employed a bright colored girl, who
was landed in the cell with great exertion
on the part of two policemen. After the
decoy was locked up she gave vent to her
feelings by abusing the police and won the
confidence of the other girl, who, it is alleged,
told her of the fence in Brooklyn. Accord-
ing to the story of the decoy, the Thomp-

son girl said that the fence was in the Fulton |
street house and that it was run by her | Mean

husband, Louis Prior, and his brother,
Robert Prior, both colored.

The prisoner, it is averred, stated that |

ahe and several other young women were
| gent to the suburbs to rob houses, They

| usually selected places where the owners |

were not at home, and entered thera in the
manner that sho employed in getting into
the house in New Hochelle. Chief Foley |
sent Detective Lynch as soon as poesibie
to Brooklyn.

The detectives arrived just in time at
the Fulton street house to capture the
occupants and plunder. Prior had evi-

dently suspected “his wife's arrest, for he
ae the goods all packed and was petting
ready to move when the detectives arrived.

The plunder was in trunks and big dry-
goods boxes and the detectives say that
there is enough of it to fill a couple of fur-
niture vane. Fourteen pawn tickets were
found on Prior and his brother and they
were locked up, while one of Capt. White's
men was left to guard the house, until the
arrival of the identification party from the
suburbs to-morrow.

Another young colored woman has been
arrested in New York in connection with
the robberies on a technical chargé. The
police will not disclose her name. The gir)
burglar who is locked up in Mount Vernon

| is alleged to have told the decoy that Friday

was her day for operating in Weatchester
county, but she now believes that it proved
her “hoodoo,” as she was
locked up on that day.

The flat in which the p ~~ found the loot
and arvested Prior and his brother is hand
somely furnished and consists of five roome
In it were found #ix dry goods bores, con

pastor of the Methodist Church, The

at Anniatun last week and Mr Bradford
was sent back to Brookside.

To-day at Sunday school he addressed
his congregation, saying he was pleased
to be back. He said it was not his custom
to preach the first Sunday on his return
from conference, but he desired to take
this opportunity of expressing the hope
that the coming year would be a prosperous
one, and he said it would be if such men as
Coffman were kept out and so prevented
from “lying on the church and the pastor.”

It was reported that Coffman had been
indulging in talk about the chureh and
Mr. Bradford. The purport of the address
was communicated to Coffman, and late
this afternoon the latter called at the par-
sonage to see the minister. The minister
ordered Coffman to leave the place. Coff-
man then shot him and surrendered to
Marshal Sorrell, asserting that the minister
attempted to shoot him. Mr. Bradford
died two hours after the shooting.

AGAIN DECLARES HE'S IN THE
COPPER WAR TO THE END.

 

Says His Trinity Stock Has Deprectated
84,000,000, bul None of It Is on Mar-
gins, and He Will Mold Out —Reliterates
His Ability to Stand Uhr Sterm.

Boston, Dec. 8.—Thomas W. Lawson
| gave out a statement to-night in which
he reiterates his intention of remaining
| in the copper fight to the finish. He says:

“No one regrets more than I the bad
| break in the price of the stock of the Trinity
Copper Company, which occurred last
week. I own 150,000 shares. A short
time ago it was worth at market prices
$6,000,000; at Saturday's price only $2,000,000,
but as none of it is carried on mar-
gin or borrowed on, and as I believe it
is worth much more than it has ever sold
for, and will sell higher than it has ever
sold, I will not sell it, and it therefore can
in no way be a menace to the market.

-“As I believe there is little Trinity carried |

which will carry its customers to a finish | VONKHERR VAN TETS NOT DEAD.

on margin outside that carried by my house,

on it, I see no reason for holders to be scared
into selling

“The cause of the drop in price was that
everything I am, or am supposed to be in-

terested in, has been under savage attack
for weeks. I protected Trinity by buying
until, as the onslaught grew more factees
] might have fatally weakened myself if I
had stood my £4 longer.

“I therefore ided it best,

treat.
the past have been with me in some pretty
fen stock market holes and who then had

th, afterward found to be well founded |

oat to allow any of the desperate tactics
of my generous opponents to prevail with
them to the extent of causing them to act
to their own loss. Above all,
not to be stampeded by the rumors, how-
ever well ‘proven’ they may be,
have capitulated or compromised.

“I give them my word, and they know,

regardless of Wal! Street scoff, now whether
my word should be, as it always has been,
at par. I give then my word I cannot be
‘gunned out’ or made to capitulate or com-
vromise. I will be doing what business
t decide to do in the wav I decide to do it
when every one of those who are fighting
me has sneaked off the field. And I will
do this as in the pe without asking or
accepting any assistance from any one

“I do not wish to disguise that since the
| out in the Amalgamated dividend I have
lost heavily or that I will not continue to
lose, but do want those who through
long years of good and bad times have
been with me to know I am now, as always
| in the past, conducting my affairs on those
| eee business principles which
are absolute guarantees of solvency at
| all times, without the favor of any, and I
also want them to know that the fight now
op, and which started with the coke and
| gas affair and climaxed in the Cup de-
ending episode, is to be to a finish, and
that while | expect no quarter, 1 want
| none and will give none.
“I just want my friends to know this
fight will be to a finish.

DALY COPPER STOCK NOT SOLD.

Ramer About the Amsigamated Slump
Pesitively Denied.
Botts, Mon., Dee, 8.--Rumors have been
persistent in Butte that the slump in Amal-

Anaconda have been thrown on the market

from New York and officiala of the Daly
Bank and Trust Company in Butte also

of Amalgamated, and that they are very
large holders of that and Anaconda stock

Wasurxoron, Pec. 8.—Senator McLaurin
of Mississippi was walking down Penn-
avlvania avenue with his brother this after-
noon and, having reached the junction of
Seventh street, where two trolley car lines
cross, was aroused from his conversation
by a terrifie clanging of a car gong. Half
a hundred other persons heard it, too,
and saw a young woman standing on the
track, with a car rapidly approaching.
The motorman, apparently, made no effort
to etop hie car, assuming that the young
woman heard his warning and would step
aside. Her back was toward the car and
the girl stood in the tracks oblivious to
warning shouts, calmly awaiting a car
coming in the opposite direction.

Senator MeLaurin, reelizing that the girl
was ignorant of her danger, jumped toward
the track and, lifting ber.in hisarms, forcibly
carried her to a place of safety. ‘The

the young woman was deaf and had beard

AMSTERDAM, Dec. 8.— The official papers

YOUNG MARX TELLS HIS STORY

GRAPHIC DESCRIPTION OF THB
WESTMORELAND TRAGEDY,

Lawyer Thought the Men Were Oyster
Pirates Turned Harglars—Stit Fell
First and HeMin Came Next—stif?
Said at First It Was a Practical Joke,

Herbert E. Marx, the young Brooklyn
lawyer who on Tuesday night last, when
attacked in his country home in Weat-
moreland county, Va., shot and killed two
of his assailants and so seriously wounded
another that he is likely to die, arrived
in this city early Saturday morning from
Washington, where he has been staying
with friends since Thursday. Mr. Marx
did not go to his own home, 138 Sixth ave-
nue, when he got back, but went to 1074
Bergen street, Brooklyn, the house of his
brother-in-law, Mr. Abel E. Blackmar,
of the law firm of Baldwin & Blackmar,
whose offices are at 31 Nassau street.

He was seen there last evening by a

| SUN reporter to whom he gave a clear,

straightforward account of that lat ter-
rible night which be repent on the farm
which, after being in his family for cigh-
teen years, tas now been sold and prob-
ably never again will be revisited by any
of his kin,

Mr. Marx is a delicate, slender young
man, amooth-faced and showing evident
traces of the great nervous strain he has
been under, as well as of the ill health
which was the cause of his leaving his
law office and going to the old Westmore-
‘and county farm in the hope of gotting
strongor. There were present in the room
when Mr. Marx made his statement both
his brother, Ernest Marx, and his brother-
in-law, Mr. Blackmar.

Ernest Marx and Mr. Blackmar only
arrived in the city yeterday afternoon at
5:30. They had not seen or heard directly
from Herbert sinoe they parted from him
at Fredericksburg, Va., on Thursday night
last when he started for Washington. They
had come through from Westmoreland
county stopping only for a short time in
Washington where they learned for the
first time that Herbert had gone home,
Herbert went to Mr. Blackmar's house
because his mother did not wish to be put
in the attitude of saying to the newspaper
reporters who called that her son was not
at home, when as a matter of fact, he was
there. Herbert remained at Mr. Black-
mar's last night and there was a little gath-
ering of his family there at dinner last
evening.

The young man, in telling his story,
seemed to be impressed with an earnest
desire to be quite exact in all the minutest
| details and at the same time to have a
very soleinn appreciation of the position
he was in of having killed, even in self-
defence, two men whom he always had
regarded as his friends He betrayed
a good deal of agitation at times during
his narrative. His story of the tragedy
was.as follows:

“It # on Tuesday night about 9 o'clock,
I was entirely alone in the house. I slept
alone there every night. I only had one
servant--a colored man named Iverson
Sanderson, who did the cooking for me.
He lived in a cabin some distance from
the house

“I should tell you something about the
construction of the house in order that you

| may understand better the events that hap-

pened. There were just (wo rooms large
rooms —on the ground floor and a little ex-
tension kitchen. The kitchen does not
Geers in the affair and may be left out of
sonsideration, as may be all the rooms up
staire

“I slept in one of the leree ground-floor

lrooms. There were three windows in
this room and one door that opened into
the other large room. To get outdoors

you had to go through this second room

and out on to a little porch there was in
front of the door that opened upon the
yard. My table was drawn up before
one f the windows the front window
looking out into the vard) “At the opposite
end of the room was another window,

My bed was in @ Cerner near this opposite
window, and so at the other end of the room
