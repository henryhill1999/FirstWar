Up to last election day the Democrats
controlled almost every city in the State.
On election day there was almost a com-

the Queen City as their particular pocket

united. This city and this State are nor-
mally Democratic, and a Democratic Gov-
ernor can be elected next wont if we are
united. If, we are not, the Republicans will
wv °

And here ie Mr. Danforth’s contribution:

“The yy has conte for parepay & ie
pat . uarre we have play-

« Tito the hands of the Republicans and
there is now a disposition all around to
get together. We sve that it will be useless
to te the State campaign next year
without a united party. e Republicans
are oa, sure to renominate Gov. Odell,
and is not an easy man to boat, If we
can't get together we might as well give up
the fight an pot fut up, any ticket at all.
On the other hand, if all the factions can
get together we can win, for this isa Demo-
cratic State. I am quite sure that a union
can be effected in ashort time. The Demo-
crate are tired of playing into the hands of
the enemy and they are going to stop the

gaine.

John C. Sheehan, the leader of the Greater
New York Democracy, was asked if he
thought that that organization could be
drawn into any combination of factions
wwnvdier the leadership of Mr. Croker, or in
the hands of the men who are now in con-
trol of the Tammany organization.

“The Greater New York Democracy
cannot be called off or knocked out in any
way,” sald Mr. Sheehan. “It is here to
stay and it is going to stay right along.
The men who are in it are men who stand
for only one thing and that thing is pure,
old-fashioned Democracy. As to Croker,
there are a lot of other men in the present
organizatian that are as bad as he is and
oer can have no part in any really Demo-
eratic party. The Greater New York
Democracy has no intention of letting up
in the attitude that it has taken and I do
not think that there will be any effort to
have it do so. The party has got to be
reformed here and in other places and we
are at work to bring that reformation about.
The Executive Committee of the party
will meet probably on Friday evening
and then this matter will be discussed
along with others. In the Greater New
York Democracy it is not possible to tell
what the committee will do, for it does as
it pleases, and as the members think best.
What action it will take I can't undertake
to say, but I do think it is safe to guess
that it will continue in the political world
as a powerful factor.” |

ORJECTS TO CARNEGIE'S

Elwood, Ind., Wants His Library
Without Honoring Him.

INDIANAPOLIS, Nov. 26.—The proposition
of Andrew Carnegie to give $25,000 for a
public library at Elwood has caused a pe-
culiar complication in that manufacturing
city. When the proposition was first re-
ceived the employees of the steel mills
objected to its acceptance, declaring that

 

NAME.
Gut

they would not patronize the library and |

would discourage patronage on the part
of others. The objection was based wholly
on the fact that Mr. Carnegie was a steel
inagnate and that the city should not accept
a gift from him.
fter much contention it was finally
agreed that the local officers might accept
the gift if they would make it plain to Mr,
Carnegie that his name was not to be con-
nected with the institution. The con-
| ditions required before the gift is made
were then complied with by securing a
site for the library and getting the pledge
| for $2,500 for its annual eupport, and a letter
was sent to-day advising acceptance of the
gift, but making it plain that Mr. Carnegie’s
name would not be associated with tue
| library. It was said that the library would
be known as “The Liwood Public Library.”
As it is customary for cities receiving the
ifis to name the libraries afterthe ‘donor,
t is not known what Mr. Carnegié will do
in the case.

SHE WED AGAINST HIS WISH

SO F. A. PALMER HAS CUT OFF
HIS GRANDNIECE,

 

 

The Rich Old Rank President Strongly
Ob jected to Second Marriages —-That's
Why Mrs. 8S. D. Reckwell Mept Hers
Sceret From Him for Nearly 8 Years.

For the last three years Samuel D. Rock-
well has been helping his father sell coal
at 1 Broadway. He has also been married
to the grandnieoce of Francis A. Palmer,
President of the Broadway Savings Bank
and until lately President of the Broadway
National Bank. Mr. Palmer, who is
89 years old and whose eccentricities
are well known to all his acquaintances,
was not informed of the marriage of his
grandniece until a few weeks ago. He
is very rich and it had been generally sup-
posed that his granduiece was to be his
heir.

One of the old gentleman's most decided
opinions was that second marriages were
criminal. He now intimates that he has
cut hia niece out of his will and that the
Rockwells, who gave a reception three
weeks ago to celebrate the announce-
ment of their marriage, will eat their
Thanksgiving dinner with a difference.

Young Mr. Rockwell announced last
evening that if Mr. Palmer kept on say-
ing that his grandniece had married a
man who was not able to support her and
that she was suffering from lack of suste-
nance, he, young Mr. Rockwell, would

right out in meeting and do some
talking about Mr. Palmer; intimating
that the matters on which he would speak
would be Mr. Palmer's relations with the
late William M. Tweed. Likewise Mr.
Rockwell permitted himself to say: ‘The
old man has most of his faculties with him
yet, thank you: he deserves a whole pile
of syimpathy—I don't think.”

The stories of the conveying of the knowl-
edge of the marriage to the venerable
bank President differ. The version of
Mr. Palmer is that he knew nothing of the
marriage until a few weeks ago. He says
he was not invited to the reception of Noy.
6. Mr. Palmer said:

“It is quite true that I knew nothing of
the marriage of my niece, Mrs. Crampton,
until a day or two ago. I know nothing
| of this man Rockwell she is said to have
married. They have seemed to forget me
| I had done everything for her. I educated
her. Now, poor girl, she is suffering over
| there. I am sorry for her. She has made
a great mistake.

| am very fond of them
! man isn't able to support her.
nothing. My will? Oh, I keep my will
up to date, but no one ever knew what was
| init. I never said she was to be my heir.”
In reply to this young Mr. Rockwell
| said, besides intimating that he would talk
about Mr. Palmer a whole lot if he were
| hard pressed:

“We were married perfectly openly at

N. Y., in August three years ago. All my

| knew about it. We kept all knowledge of
the matter from Mr. Palmer for this reason
We knew he had a frantic prejudice against
second marriages and we were afraid tha’
the shock would be bad for hii; that was

 

all.”
Mr. Rockwell said these things at his
wife's home at 10 West Seventy-second

| street which was given to Mrs. Rockwell
| by Mr. Palmer on the occasion of her first
marriage. Mrs Rockwell added that last
|} eummer while she and her husband were
| at Cayuga Lake, some unkind person sent an
anonyinous letter to Mr. Palmer telling
of her marriage. As as she came

. Palmer’s principal diversion until
within a year ago was the driving of
fast trotters. He <isliked garocingty to
“take anybody's dust.” He has always
been a keen judge of horses, and the dealers
in the horsemarkets along Third avenue
above Twenty-third street have learned to
hold him in high respect. He has a reputa-
tion as one who ecared his own coachman
into resigning by the speed at which he
steered his teams along crowded drive-
ways. He has always been an indefatig-
able attendant at horse shows.

As for the statement of Mr. Palmer that
he did not know youn Mr. Rockwell or
anything about him, John W. Rockwell,
the gone man's father, who is President
of the Puritan Coal Mining Company and
selling agent for half a dozen other bitu-
minous companies, said yesterday
that his son and daughter and Mrs, Samuel
D. Rockwell had known one another ever
since they were children together. Miss
Rockwell and Misa Lewis were fellow stu-
dents at Wells and Miss Rockwell stayed
at 180 Madison avenue for days at a time
when Miss Lewis was there.

Mr. Rockwell said that he did not know
anything about it, but that he didn’t think

that Mr. Palmer meant to leave any money |

to his niece anyway, and that the officious
or hungry friends who sent a typewritten
anonymous letter to Mr. Palmer about the
marriage had simply made a lot of profit-
leas un rfp omy for everybody. Mr. Rock-
wel] said that his son was 86 years old.
Otl.ers have thought that the young man
was several years younger. Mrs *kwell
is 88 years old, and like her husband, seems
much younger than she is.

COURT WON'T TELL MISS M'COMB

If She'll Lose 605,000 a Year by Marrying
Artist Herzog.

The will of James Jennings McComb,
who died on March 81 last, leaving a §15,-
000,000 estate, provided that his daughter,
Fannie Rayne McComb, should share
equally with her sisters and brother in the
estate if she did not marry Louis Herzog.
In the event of her marrying Herzog, who
is an artist of Philadelphia, she was to
have only an income of $15,000 a year and
on her death $300,000 was to be distributed
among her children. It is computed that
her income would be $110,000 a year if she
refrains from marrying Herzog. Miss
McComb, suing for a construction of the
will, contended that this provision was
invalid. After passing upon other parts
of the will Justice Scott says that it does
not appear that she has married Herzog
and, as she may never do ao, the question
raised is merely abstract and academic
and one on which the executors may never
need advice. Such questions, the Judge
says, the courts will not consider.

The other children of Mr. MeComb are
Mary Alice McComb Coxe, Lillie McComb
Grath and Jennings Scott McComb. The

most of the estate will go to the children
A provision of the will regarding Mr

McComb's house at Dobbs Ferry and the |

fifth floor in the Madrid, owned by him,
which permitted any of his children or
the widow to occupy them on the election
of a majority of them, and for their sale
by the executors on a vote of the majority,
the Court holds to be invalid, and these
properties fall into the resiiuary estate
Mr McComb had conveyed the Central
Park apartment buildings in trust to the
Tithe Guarantee and Trust Company un-
der covenants by which he was to receive
the net income for life. On his deatn the
trustee was to apply the rents fo pay off

the mortgages aud then to divide the in- |

come as the will should provide. The
will directed that this income should be
divided among the children during the
lives of the two youngest. The Court
holda that all these provisions are valid
except the one regarding the retention
income to pay off the mortgages
It decides that the trust stands good with

| out this provision, so that this large prop-

erty will be held during the lives of the

two voungest children

DIAMOND JURY LOCKED UP.

DEFENCE HEARS THAT THEY
STOOD 9 TO 3 FOR ACQUITTAL.

 

 

 

Attorneys for the Prosecution Hear That
It Was @ to & for Conviction—Counsel
for Diamond Spring a Surprise by Of-
fering No Evidence for Their Cilent.

ALBANY, Nov. 26.—The jury in the Police
Captain Diamond trial, after being out
six hours and a half, were locked up for
the night at 11 o'clock, not having agreed
up to that time, Justice Herrick adjourned
court until 9 A. M. Capt. Diamond's at-
torneys naturally look for a disagreement,
having heard rumors that the jury stood
9 t 3 for acquittal, while the attorneys
, for the prosecution got rumor that the
jury stood 9 to 3 for conviction.

Counsel for Capt. Diamond eprang a
surprise when they announced this after-
noon that they would offer no testimony
for the defence and were satisfied to stand
on that put in by the prosecution. Counsel
were given until 4 o'clock to review the
| testimony. Shortly after 4 o'clock Jus-
| tine Herrick charged the jury, occupying
| twenty-five minutes. It was an albso-

litely impartial charge and both sides
were satisfied with it. The jury retired
at 4:35 o'clock. At 6 o'clock they left the
jury room and spent an hour at dinner
at a downtown hotel. Justice Herrick
went home at 6 o'clock, leaving word for
the clerk send for him and the attorneys
should the jury reach a verdict.

Deputy Police Commissioner William
8S. Devery was in the court room and an
interest listener to the summing up.
In the morning Mr. Devery and the other

| witnesses while not on the stand were
excluded from the court room when testi-
mony was being taken. Neither Mr. Dev-
ery nor ex-Wardman George Bissert, who
had been subpuenaed by the prosecution,
was called upon to testify, owing to the
defence not putting in any evidence.

WHITECAPS KILL A WOMAN.

Objected to Her Manner of Life and Shet
Her Down.

Couumara, 8. C., Nov. 26.—Particulars
of the murder of Mra, Rachael Powell,
alias Thomas, by Whitecaps in the moun-
tains of Oconee county, seventeen miles
from a telegraph office, were recbived here
to-night. Ten young men, mostly well
connected, are already in Oconee jail,
while warrants are being issued for others.
The moon was very bright and many were
recognized by Wesley Powel’,

Powell and the woman who was killed
were under indictment for adultery. Mrs.
Powell was 50 years old They had five
children, who witnessed the killing of their
mother. According to Powell's statement
late on Sunday night a crowd came to his
house They had tools and started to tear
down his house They demolished the
chimney, tore off the roof and had attacked
the walls when he came out. The first
four men he saw were recognized as the
Hudson boys. He attacked them with 4
piece of plank and knocked Money Hudson
down.

About this time Mrs. Powell came to the
door and the crowd fired on her, She
fell, shot through the heart, and the crowd
then fled. Three of the Hudsons were
arrested twenty-five miles from the scene
of their crime as they were about crossing
into Georgia. The fourth was captured
near Walhalla, and the one Powell said he
had struck showed the mark of the blow.

The other prisoners are named Robert-
son and Sentnell. The Hudsons are sons
of a substantial citizen of the county and a
Confederate soldier This is the second
woman ever killed in that region, and the
mountain people are very highly wrought

up.

OHANLER HERE LAST WHER.

Came to See the Horse Show Despite the
Advice of Some of His Friends.

RicumMonpD, Va., Nov. 26.—*The finest
police force in the world is a cinch for one
who has threaded his way through them
from the Bronx to the Hudson on his escape
from Bloomingdale and who afterward
threw dust into the eyes of the detective
force of Philadelphia for nearly a year.”

These were the words of John Armatrong
Chanler, who returned to-day from the
New York Horse Show and settled down
at his country seat, Merrie Mills, in Aibe-
marle county. He remained in New York
for a week, saying to intimate friends that
if he was recog! he would be arrested
and reincarcerated in Bloomingdale He
disregarded the advico of Virginia friends
to stay away from New York. While there
he was in the earme oafés with old friends,
who did not recognize hin.

COLOMBIAN REBELS RETREAT,

FALL BACK AFTER ANOTHER
FIGHT ON THE ISTHMUS.

 

Government Forces Advancing Steadily
Toward Colon, but Sustaining Heavy
Losses —Puerto Bello Rombarded and
Colombian Troops Landed—No Ftghte
ing in Colon —We Keep Rallroad Open.

Spectal Cable Despatch to Tur Suw. n”
CoLon, Nov. 26.—An important engage-
ment was fought this morning at Barbaoa,
The Liberals retreated to Frijoles. The
Government forces are now at Tabernilla.
The losses of the latter have been heavy.
Trains, including one in transit with pas-
sengers from the steamship Origaba,
which sailed from New York last Tuesday,
could not paas the scene during the fight.
An armored train arrived here at 40'clook
this afternoon,

The Colombian gunboat General Pinson
bomba:ded Puerto Bello and landed part
of its force. Her commander afterward
returned here.

No fighting will be permitted in Colon.

Baracoa is close to San Pablo station
on the line of the railroad, to which place
the rebels were reported to have retreated
after their defeat on Sunday at Emperador
or Empire station. At Baracoa there is «
long iron bridge across the Chagres River,
and here the Liberals were expected to
make a strong stand against the Govern-
ment troops. The latter, however, are
now past Baracoa, reaching Tabernilla,
the most important station on the railroad.
The Liberals’ retreat to Irijoles carries
them a few miles further along the line
toward Colon,

Puerto Bello is the next port east of Colon
on the Atlantic coast of Colombia, and is
a place of minor importance with a very
amall, population.

KEEPING THE RAILROAD OPEN.

Our Forces Performing Thelr Duty oo
the Isthmus.

Wasrinaton, Nov. 26 —Such {nformation
as came to the State and the Navy depart-
ments to-day from their official repre-
sentatives on the Isthmus of Panama was
meagre. The only important despatch was
sent by Consul-General Gudger at Panama,
| who said that ‘Traffic is moving unmo-
lested.”

This question of free transit acrosa the
Isthmus is the one that concerns the United
States more than any other, as under ita
treaty obligations the American Govern-
ment must prevent interruption of traffile
between Panama and Colon. The action of
Capt. Perry of the battleship Iowa in post-
ing marines and bluejackets from that ehip
along the line of the railway is believed
to be responsible for the resumption of train
service.

Capt.ePerry, who started from Panama
vesterday with the intention of running a
train through to the Atlantic side of the
| Isthmus, nas arrived at Colon. After the

close of office hours this orenng Secretary

Long received a message from him saying

thatthe Colombian gunboat General Pinzon

had returned to Colon. No information
concerning her actions since leaving that
| place yesterday was contained in the mes

—

 

| page.

“Pie Government is reassured over the
situation on the Isthmus. With free trane
| eit restored the danger of a clash between
| the American forces and the warring Colom-

bian factions has been reduced to a mini-
'mum. It is confidently believed here
the General Pinzon's commander will nét
carry out his threat to bombard Colon.
His failure to do so after a lapse of the
twenty-four hours of grace for the remotal
of non-combatants is attributed to the
| knowledge that damage by the bombard-
| ment to foreign property would probably
bring a etorm of protest and demands for
| redress from W ashington and some of the
European canitals

In what manner Lientenant-Commander
MeCrea of the Machias has construed
| very broad instructions in regard to

bombardment question is not known here

A cipher despatch received from him to-

day acknowledged the receipt of Becretary
| longs message giving him the widest
discretion in the matter, but the ma
ere of it was not decipherable and
Navy Department found it pecessary to
ask him to repeat it
