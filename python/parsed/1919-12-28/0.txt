Special Despatch to Tue Svx.

Wasuincton, Dec, 27.— Secretary
Daniels has decided to put the be-
stowing of navy honors up to Presi-
dent Wilson. It became known to-day
that the board for consideration of
recommendations, which has been or-
dered to reconvene on January 5 to go
over the lists of names submitted for
consideration, will have before it all
communications relating to the recom-
mendations, as well as the letters criti-
cising the awards as published. Sec-
retary Daniels will place this informa-
tion at the disposal of the board, which
is headed by Rear Admiral Austin M.
Knight.

When the list has been reviewed
again the Knight board will submit its
recommendations to Secretary Dan-
iels, who then will send them to the
White House for consideration by the
President. Secretary Danlels said to-
day that he always was acting by the
direction of the President, and that he
would recommend the adoption of the
list of the Knight board and let the
subject drop there. This is interpreted
here as: surrender on the part of the

A

 

civilian head of the navy.

Another development of the day was
the announcement by Representative
Lufkin (Mass.), a member of the
House Naval Committee, that full in-
vestigation of the awards of decora-
tions, which aroused the criticism of
Rear A@mira] William 8. Sims, would
be made by a joint committee of the
House and the Senate,

High Officers to Be Questioned,

Representative Lufkin made his an-
nouncement after a conference with
the members of the Senate Naval
Committee. He said that Secretary
Daniels, Admiral Knight, Admiral Sims
and other officers would be called be- |
fore the joint committee, which does
not need special Congress authoriza-
tion to conduct its Inquiry. * Mr. Luf-
kin also added that the list of awards |
as made by the Knight board and the
changes ordered by Secretary Daniels |
would be examined by the joint com- j
mittee, ‘

Secretary Daniels safd that no crosses
or medals actually had been awarded
except to Admiral Benson, who received |
his while abroad, and that the matter |
of award would be taken up anew 80;
that some who had Jearned that they }
were scheduled to get on» might find
themselves in the other class or indeed
perhaps left out entirely.

The letters of Vice-Admiral Hilary P.
Jones, Rear Admiral H. T. Mayo, Capt.
it. Del Hasbrouck and Capt. Benton C.
Decker, all criticising tho list as an-
nounced Sy Secretary Daniels, were
made public at the Navy Department
to-day. ‘The communication of Capt. |
Decker, now commanding the Seventh |
Naval District at Key West, caused
much comment here on account of alle-
gations which he makes that all was not
harmonious in the American Embassy
at Madrid, where he was stationed as
naval attache during the war, particu-
larly the officer’s statement that Spain
was all ready to join the Central Powers
in war against the Entento.

Calle Reward Inadequate.

Capt. Decker's letter reads:

“It has been brought to my attention
by public notices that I have been
recommended for award of the navy
(ross,

“In my opinion this award is entirely
inadequate to the services that were
performed by the office or the naval at-
tache and those who worked with me,
The effect of this work was to keep
Spain from entering the war against us
at the tlme of the enemy March of-
tensive of 1918, also a reduction of the
submarine activities off the coast of
Spain.

. Tf my estimate of the situation is in-
correct and I am mistaken as to the
work done, then I feel that a cross
thould not be awarded for my services.
While {t may be impossible to prove
that the work done did produce the re-
fults claimed, I have been assured that
this was the case.

“This letter is not written in any spirit
of fault finding or objection to the
award of the board that was organized
for this purpose. I do not desire hon-
ors to which I am not entitled; on the
other hand, I feel that it is just, feeling
*s I da, not to permit the services of
the officers and men who were asso-
Ciated with me to be “taken go lightly.
The work dono by Mr. F. J. Marion,
W. A. Chadburne and Mr. Howell was
ef the greatest value to the country.

‘If my estimate is correct my ser-
Vices and the services of those who
worked with me, in spite of the opposi-

of the Ambassador, are certainly
reater than the work done by any sin-
kle ba@lesnip in the war or by any of-
fetal tationed on shore duty in an ad-
MiNisérative capacity.

RICH MEN IN LIMOUSINES
HUNT WINE BIN BANDITS

 

Precious Liquors Vanish From Cellars of Patterson, Ar-

Special Despatch to Tur Sun.

Cricago, Dec, 27,—Armed with shots

wine cellar bandits who within the last
two weeks have cleaned out many @

depredations are said to have resulted
to date in a loss to Lake Forest folk of
something like half a million dollars.

This band is considered a most cow-
ardly one, for many of its victims for
various personal reasons dare not ad-
mit that they have suffered at its
hands, but among those who have
come out into the light wate com-
plaints against it are J. Ogden Awsmour,

NEAR VERMILYE) THIEF CAUGHT

 

Miss Keeney, in Collapse, in
Adjoining Ward in Cum-
berland Hospital.

 

HER FATHER MYSTIFIED

 

Hears of a Reported Second
Wife, but He Can Get No
Confirmation.

 

Dr. William Grey Vern#llye, who is
in the Cumberland Street Hospital in
Rrooklyn, failed to shed any light
yesterday on the mysterious disap-
pearance of the Dr. William Grey Ver-
milye, who was to have married Miss
Ruth M. Keeney of Monson, Mass.,
Christmas day,

He would not see Miss Keeney, who
hastened yesterday to his bedside with
her father when she was notified by
the New York police thac Dr. Ver-
milye had been located.

In a note to the newspapermen he
denied he was hiding from anybody
and said “on my return to the United
States I was met by an invitation to
my wedding.”

Dr. William F. Jacobs, superinten-
dent of the hospital, said that he had
read last night to Dr. Vermilye re-
ports of the case in the afternoon
papers, and that while Dr. Vermilye
had declined to go into the details or
make any explanation, he admitted
he was William Grey Vermilye, at
present surgeon for the United States
Shipping Board. He did not, however,
either admit or deny that he was the
man who had promised to marry Miss
Keeney.

At the hospital it was said that Dr.

Vermilye had walked in Christmas af-
ternoon about the same hour Miss
Keeney and the wedding guests were
awaiting the vanished bridegroom's
appearance in the Methodist church at
Monson. He asked that a minor op-
eration be performed, but made no
reference to being married.

Bride-Elect Collapses.

Miss Keeney and her father, George
L. Keeney, reached the hospital about
2 o'clock yesterday afternoon. When
the young woman learned that Dr. Ver-
milye would not see her she collapsed
and was put to bed In the ward ad-
joining that in which the man she sup-
posed to be her fiance was resting. Her
condition was said not to be serious, but
her father said she wouid remain there
last night.

Miss Keeney last saw her flance the
Saturday before Christmas at the Grand
Central Station. All plans for the wed-
ding were then arranged and she re-
turned to Monson expecting to see him
again on Christmas Day, the date set
for the wedding. Dr. Vermilye’s move-
ments since that day unti Christmas
Day are cloaked in mystery. He did not
visit the offices of the Shipping Board,
although the money covering the ex-
penses of his last trip is waiting for him
there,

Tuesday he called on several friends
in Brooklyn to wish them the season's
greetings, but made no reference to an
approaching marriage. A. Heinmuller,
an artist of 245 Sunnyside-avenue, and
John A. Bendel, a rea: estate operator
of 2527 Atlantic avenue, both talked with
Dr. Vermilye Tuesday. They said he
looked hale and hearty and was ap-
parently in the best of spirits.

Mystery Grows Deeper.

Miss Keeney wou!d not talk with the
reporters when she arrived at the hos-
pital. She is a slight, delicate looking
woman of about 30. Dr. Vermilye gave
his age as 62 when he applied for a
marriage license in Massachusetts. Ac-
cording to friends of Dr. Vermilye in
Brooklyn who have known him for
many years, he is a man 65 or 70 years
old. There were several conflicting re-
ports circulated yesterday as to the pre-
vious ventures in matrimony of the Dr.
Vermilye who is in the hospital in
Brooktyn. It was said that his first
wife, who was the mgther of Dr, John
H. Vermilye of Atlanta, had died about
twenty years ago and that he had re-
married. No definite information could
be obtained as to what has become of
Dr. Vermilye’s second wife, if he ever
had one. In reply to a note sent to
him last night by the newspaper men
asking if there was any truth in the
report that he had a wife living, Dr.
Vermilye said he had no statement to
make ‘now or any other time.” Neither
Miss Keeney nor her father had heard of
a second marriage.

NINE UNDER ARREST HERE,
Securities Sold and Proceeds
Sent to Fugitive—Police |
Recover $38,000

 

Teo Julofsky, or Leon Jules, a mes-
senger boy for E. D. Levinson & Co. of |
52 Broadway, who disappeared on Sep- |
tember 19 with $141,000 worth of Litb- |
erty bonds which he was carrying in a |
satchel to another broker's office, was
arrested in Los Angeles yesterday. He
had $53,000 of the bonds left.

In jail in New York the police have
nine men or boys ranging in age from
17 to 40 years, all charged with grand
larceny and receiving stolen goods, the
same being the Levinson bonds. One
of the prisoners is a brother of the |
messenger caught in Los Angeles,

Bonds to the value of $38,000 have |
been recovered here,

Julofsky apparently skipped out with
a few of the stolen securities, leaving
most of them to be disposed of by pals
in New York or to be sent to him, An-
other arrest which is expected will, the
police believe, round up the last of the |
gang.

The story told at headquarters an- |
swers the question, so far as this case |
is concerned, of what becomes of Liberty |
bonds they are stolen between
brokers’ offices, Some of the sec urittes |
which Julofsky left in New York were }
peddled about for much less than their
value, some were lost in crap games,

and $16,000 worth were supposed to be |
tucked away in a safe deposit box.

 

 

 

after

Sellers Buy Fur Overcoats,

Two of the vendors blew themselves
to fur overcoats. One used part of the |
cash he received to hire a loft with the |
purpose, now blasted, of setting up in |
business as a manufacturer of women’s |
wear. As for Julofsky, it seems he was|
unable or afraid to market his wares
as he roved the continent. His friends
say ‘they have been sending him money
to pay his expenses.

Those under arrest here are: Solomon
Julofsky, 24 years old, of 665 West 160th
street, brother of the messenger; David
Benson, 40, of 878 Longwood avenue,
The Bronx, described by the police as “|
professional bondsman well known in the
West Side court; Max J. Gallubler, a
bond broker, living at 1061 Tinton ave-
nue, The Bronx, and with an office at!
406 Mast 149th street; Charles Jablokoff,
17, of 10 West 101st street; Arthur EB.
Miller, 22, of 1598 Avenue A: William
4. Harriman, 18, of 16 West lifty-
fourth street; Nathan N. Edson, 21, of
134 Bowery; Samuel Massey, 29, of 32
jast 117th street, and Harold F. Gal-
lagher, 24, of 2141 Hughes street, The
Bronx.

 

Arrested, Trying to Sell Bonds.

Last Wednesday two young men were
arrested when they tried to sell two of
the missing bonds to the Sacks Com-
pany, foreign exchange brokers at 33 |
Broadway. They proved to »9, the police |
say, Edson and Massey. Massey sgaid |
he had won $1,800 in a crap game jn!
White street and the man whu lost, a
stranger to Massey, paid his debt with
the two bonds and got from Massey |
$200 change. Massey and Edson were
held in the Tombs Court in $5,000 bail
aplece.

On the same day, it is alieged, Gal-
lubier, the 149th street bord broker,

was that on December 19 a stranger |
visited his office and asked him to dis- ;
pose of the twenty $1,000 bende, Gal-
lubler’s commission to be 15 per cent.
of the proceeds.

Information obtained after these ar-
rests led to the capture of the five other
suspects. Young Harriman, according
to the police, said that he met Jablokoff
at the latter’s request about three weeks
ago at 1029 Madison avenue, where Mil-
ler has a window cleaning establish-
ment. Jablokoff and Miller said they
had $60,000 worth of Liberty bonds of
which they wanted Harriman to dispose.
They turned $39,000 worth over to
Harriman. The police say that they
admit having done this and that Solomon

A search that now extends to every
corner of the country is being made
for Adolfo Paranelli, who until] Christ-
mas eve held forth at 311 Bleecker
street and who, the police say, has
been connected by the Hartford police
with the flooding of the Connecticut
Valley with the wood alcohol decoction
that already has taken fifty-four lives
in the towns of Holyoke, Hartford,
Springfield and Chicopee Falls, Mass.
The total number of deaths in these
towns that can be attributed to the
apparently wholesale indulgence in
wood alcohol as a beverage undoubt-
ediy will be far greater, At least as
many more are in hospitals, many dy-
ing and others permanently blinded.

Six men died here in New York
yesterday, and the hospital doctors af-
ter a brief examination made the terse
comment:

“Wood alcohol.”

Two more such deaths occurred in
Newark yesterday.

Cleveland reports fourteen deatis aiid
nine men and women in hospitale, some
of whom are bound to die and others
will never see again. From the South
and from the West came despatches in-
dicating that bone dry America cele-
brated Christmas by drinking wood

lieving that diluted it was posseseed of
no more harmful immediate effects than
the ordinary ante-prohibition whiskey.

ber of deaths throughout the country.
But it seems to be within bounds to
reckon on hundreds,

Government agents, at their wits’ end |

the poison and the dispensers thereof,
are making many arrests, and charges

loft murder and manslaughter are being

preferred against saloon and hotel pro-
prietors who have sold synthetic whis-
key or who have {tt in their illicit grog
shops. From the Canadian boundary it
is reported that whiskey--whether real
or of the wood alcohol variety is not
stated—is being found secreted in bales

of hay shipped to farmers and feed

pays tribute to the imaginations of

ing smuggled booze.
Fearful of New Yenr’s.

‘To make the outlook all the worse,
there are confident predictions that de-,
spite the results of the country wide
Christmastide orgy and its resulting
havoc, there will be a wet New Year's
and that the wetness will be that of
wood alcohol decoctions that will at least
double the number of deaths reported
thus far.

Denver reports that she has twelve
men and women in hospitals as the re-
sult of drinking liquor which has as its
base wood alcohol. Some will die and
all who survive will be blind. No at-
tempt is made in this report to estimate
the number of privately cared for vic-
tims. Memphis accounts for three
deaths.

Since war time prohibition took effect,
according to Chicago returns, more than
thirty-five men have died in that city
from wood alcohol poisoning—all the re-
sult of drinking it as a substitute for
the regular stuff.
Chicago yesterday and four were re-
ported dying last night. They were vic-
tims of Christmas orgics.

Peter M. Hoffman, Coroner of Cook
county, has flooded Chicago with warn-
ings that make it known that one drink
of wood alcohol can make a man per-
manently blind or probably kill him.
Yet men are being taken to the hospitals
every day. Two arrests of dispensers of
wood alcohol booze have been made in
Chicago and charges of murder pre-
ferred against them.

At least twenty deaths from wood
alcoholism are reported from Detroit.
Some of the victims purchased the stuff
in saloons, paying anywhere from forty
to sixty cents a drink and others made

Lonvon, Dec, 27.—There is a close
relation between the political and eco-
inomic problems of Burope and the
| tendency is to make political factors
dominate, whereas the real question of
| how to get Europe back to work so
‘she can feed herself is being side-
| tracked. The danger of such a double
policy as crippling Europe by political
|measures and at the samo time rais-
ing charity funds to feed her is out-
lined in a statement by Arthur Hen-
derson, labor leader, in the Ilouse of
Commons. He says:

“The Prime Minister has just told us
that he recognizes that the condition of
affairs in Central Europe is menacing
‘and speaks of large international cred-
its and urgent representations to the
| United States. This condition he now
admits is one to which the Labor
‘party has been calling attention by res-
foluticon and manifesto for months, Its
warnings seem to have fallen on deaf
| ears,
{hope tor American help in furnishing
them, but there is no use of talking of
credit and American aid in one breath
}if in the next we talk of some military
}or political policy that must undermine
j the economic health of Europe and make
the repayment of these credits impos-
sible.

“Mr, Hoover has sald that very thing
in no uncertain terms, and it is what
practically every authority on the fam-
ine situation emphasizes. They agree
| that famine cannot be remedied by the
‘mere sending of food, although this may
| be necessary asp a temporary measure.
\If it is to be prevented from getting
{worse nothing short of the reestablish-
ment of all the normal processes of
economic life in the territories concerned
will suffice.

 

 

Raw Materials the Need.

“From every famine area there goes
up the paradoxical cry: ‘Don't send us
food; send us coal, raw materials and
something with which to start our fac-
tories.’ One of the Austrian delegates
at the recent international economic
conference in London said that every
$5,000 credit accorded to Austria now in
the form of raw materials and coal will
prevent the need of $50,000 credit later
,on tor food.

“In some countries where the famine
is worse there is no very serious lack of

chants on the American eide of the | food in the country as a whole if it could | home by doniestic questions and because

ibe distributed. But it cannot be dis-
| tributed because the means of transport

and national authorities who are seek-|cause it will not be surrendered by the |

Vienna has large locomotive works that
| are idle because the coal mines, which
jused to supply these works, and which
are relatively near by, are now in a
new State, Czecho-Slovakia, and this
State, for one reason or the other, does
}not supply the coal.

Paris, Dec, 27,—Plans for the sec-
ond peace conference, which it is now
proposed to hold in Paris beginning
the middle of January, now appear to
ibe taking definite shape. Premier
Lloyd George and Arthur J. Balfour
are expected to represent Great Brit-
jain, while other will send
| their Premiers and Foreign Ministers, |
i There speculation
lconeerning the position the United|
States will take in the forthcoming |
chiefly |
jeastern problems. American partici- |
| pation in the full sense of the word
jis anticipated in certain French Gov-
| ernmental circles, it being assumed
| that the treaty will have been passed
j by the Senate by that time as the re-
| sult of party compromise,
| Second only to the approaching con-
| ference is renewed interest here in the
; treaty situation in the American Senate,
| Hope that a compromise will be effected
by the party leaders before the reopening
of Congress is being held out in official

second conference,

Old System Abandoned,

It is said that the method of work
lin the new conference, which will be
| known as the conference of 1920, will
| be similar to that employed in the recent
; pourparlers in London and that the sys-
} tem which operated during the last con-
j ference will be almost entirely aban-
doned and relegated to the dust of the
| Foreign Office archives, together with
other nebulous theories prevalent in
{1919. The British Premier will confer
with Clemenceau and other allied del-
| egates on the main lines of each impor-
} tant question, chief among which are
peace with Turkey, involving the fate
| of Constantinople, This being done, the
settlement of details will be left to minor
| officials and experts.

Domestic affairs, however, appear
\likely to interfere with the work during
|the early stages of these negotiations.
Lloyd George may be unable to remain

British Shipping Now
Held Up by Labor

WASHINGTON, Dec. 27.—

Great Britain is confronted
with one of the most critical ship-
ping situations the country has
ever known, despite the increase
in the number of ships flying the
British flag,

the Secretary of
the Port and Transit Committee
of London informed the Depart-
ment of Commerce to-day.

Labor trouble and’ the short-
age of railway trucks, the report
said, are holding up the move-
ment of cargoes and have created
such congestion at the docks
that some ships are allowed to
lie in the harbors from seven to
eight days before ‘discharging
their cargoes,

TREATY DEFEAT

Britain’s Special Ambassador
Unable to Accomplish Ob-

WASHINGTON, Dec. 27,— Viscount
Grey, British Ambassador, will leave
Washington next Tuesday for New
York, to sail for home the foillowing
Saturday on the Aquitania. He will be
accompanied by his personal suile, Sia
William Tyrrell, Ronald Campbell and
Major Craufurd Stuart.

When he came to Washington Octo-
ber 1 Viscount Grey was under a tem-
porary appointment to the embassy
for the special purpose of attempting
to deal with certain large questions
that have arisen or are impending as
the result of the world war. It was
thought these might be adjusted on a
fair and permanent basis by intimate
agreement between the two Govern-

ments on lines of common policy,

Delay in final action on the peace
treaty by the Senate has made it un-
profitable to undertake such  negotia-
tions, it was said at the embassy, even
had President Wilson's health permitted,
Developments in Great Britain also
have brought to the fore many questions
in which Viscount Grey is vitally inter-
ested and in the settlement of which he
desires to participate.

be affected unfavorably by the Viscount’s |

Special Despatch to Tak Sun.

WASHINGTON, Dec. 27.—Representae
tives of the Republican mild reserva-
ionists said to-day it was expected
Senator Lenroot (Wis.) would meet
Senator Lodge (Mass.) to-morrow for
discussion of the possible steps toward
compromise and settlement of the
treaty question. Senator Lenroot has
become the spokesman of this group
so far as concerns dealing with the
Republican leader. The group which
he represents ‘continues to insist that
there must be vigorous effort by lead-
ers of both parties to get together on
terms that will bring ratification with
the substance of the Lodge reserva-
tions,

Senator Hitchcock (Neb.), Demo-
cratic leader, was confined to his home
to-day by a cold and on the Demo-
cratic side nothing could be accom-
plished. The Republican reservation-
ists indicated they were anxious to
discuss terms with him, learn what he
will accept and then take his propos!-
tion to Senator Lodge. They think
they can effect a meeting of the minds
without great delay.

One Republican Senator declared
with confidence that a revision of the
preamble to the ratification resolution
had been formulated that would be
sure to satisfy the Democrats. He was
positive it would meet Republican re-
quirements and at the same time meet
approval of every Democrat who in
any circumstances would vote to rat-
ify.

Avotds Foreign Embarrassment,

The terms of this revision he would
not announce, but he said it would put
an end to possible embarrassment of
foreign diplomatic agencies in being
compelled to submit American reser-
vations to their Governments and get
affirmative acceptance of them.

Likewlse it would do away with one

great Powers assume the responsibility
of ratifying and putting into effect a
covenant among a large number of na-
tions is held to be unfair to the three—
whatever ones they may be-—that would
ratify on these conditions.

The great difficulty in getting a satie-
factory agreement on ratification still
lies in the reservation to Article X: Pres-
igent Wilson in various speeches de-
nounced this as absolutely wrecking the
whole covenant, and it happened that he
quoted the exact text of the reservation
as afterward adopted, So his face must
be saved—that was the cynical expres-
sion used by Senators discussing the
matter—by rewriting that reservation.
It is no easy task, and yet it is one that
must be performed if the supreme ob-
stacle to ratification is to be blasted out
of the way.

Ratify.

Democrats Ready to

How near the treaty came to ratificas
tion in the last hours of the last session
was explained to-day by a Senator who
at that time voted against ratification,
He said that seventeen or eighteen Dem-
ocratic Senators had agreed to vote for
ratification with the complete get of
Lodge reservations. “Oscar Straus could
give you the list,” added the Senator, “if
he cared to do so. I am not eure whether
there were seventeen or eighteen of
them, but they were prepared to swallow

the full eet of Lodge reservations. They
would have voted that Way but for the
letter of President Wilson to Senator

Hitcheock urging that Democrats should

not vote to accept the Lodge reserva.
tions. In view of that experience the
Democrats naturally feel that they have
done all that loyalty possibly could de-
mand, and they are now determiired to
have ratification if possible, regardless
of the President. If after they ‘et it hea

refuses to deposit the ratification he will
assume the complete responsibility and
their skirts will be clear.”
