General, the hearing that has been going
on during the past nine days came to a
sodden halt this morning and was ad-
corned until to-morrow.

One of the attorneys said that nothing
was to be given out as to the reasons for
the adjournment. It is said on the highest
authority, however, that Justice Keogh
may to-morrow morning order a dis-

ntinuance of the present habeas corpus

On two successive days the Rev

‘Invitations were sent out and presents

But on Monday went Dennis with a
long face to Miss O'Shay. He had written
to his mother, he said, telling her of lis
intentions and had received a letter from
her saying that she was crying her eyes
out. His aunt, too, on hearing of his wed-
\ding plans, was similarly affected and,
worst of all, the friend whom Dennis
had picked for best man also had broken
{down and sobbed when told the news
' Miss O'Shay last night said that she told

Dennia to “run along and cry with the

The Baron was sentenced to imprison-

ten years of solitary confinement.

The Judge having summed up in an

hour the jury retired at 8:30 o'clock. The |

doors of the court room were then opened,
the trial hitherto having been held in
camera. Even the aged parents of the
Baron, whocame especially to the court,
were refused admittance while the trial

limited number of the curious, most of

| whom were women, were admitted and

the police held up the rest. The jury
returned in an hour with the verdict of
{| guilty.

Lieut. Paterno heard the verdict with
bowed head and did not weep as he fre-

auently has done during the trial. He
simply seemed to be dazed.
When sentence was pronounced the

Baron was apparently on the verge of
collapse. The doctor who accompanied
hin to the cage in which he had been
confined found that his pulse had almost
ceased, He hurried the prisoner out of
the court and had him removed immedi-
ately by a back door unseen by the crowd
and taken to the prison, where he remains
ina peculiar attitude. He is listless, does
hot shed any tears and refuses to talk.
Once during the evening he muttered,
“Julia is now revenged.”

The sentence has created a tremendous
impression and is regarded as of almost
unprecedented severity Extenuating

circumstances have hitherto invariably |

been allowed in so-called crimes of passion,

Rome and the western world were
set astir on March 2, 1911,at the news of
the murder of Princess di Trigona, niece
of Marquis di San Giuliano, the Italian
Minister of Foreign Affairs, and cousin
of Prince de Scales, who was atabbed by
Baron Lieut. Paferno of the Italian army
The Princess was 36 vears old at the time
of her death and one of the most beau-
tiful women of Rome. She resided at the
Quirinal, where she was Queen Helena’s

favorite lady in waiting. She was sep-
arated from her husband less than a
year before the tragedy but no legal

separation had been granted. The King
and Queeu had tried to reconcile the couple
but were not successful
‘The murder was committed in a third
class rooming house called the Rebec-
chino, in Rome, where Princess di Trigona
and Lieut. Paterno had locked themselves
in a room, The Measagero, an Italian
publication, said the crime was committed
because the Princess, with whom Lieut
Paterno had been carrying on a liaison
for some time, refused io pay his debts
These amounted to $4.00!  Notwith-
standing the Baron was a cavalry lieu-
