ALLIES GRANT DEMANDS

 

Tr. Hels Sekely, acting as correspondent
for THE SUN, has just returned from his
second trip through Eurppe since the open.
ing of the war. In his capacity as fea
representative of the National Immigra-
tion League he has been in many
times and ie in close touch with affairs
and officials, He has often apprared be-
fore committees in Congress as an au-
thority on immigration matters and ie o
writer of wide note on economics, The
following is the second of @ series of seven
erticles by Dr, Sekely on conditions ina
Europe.

words used, but this was exactly the

ECONOMY REGIME IS ON

 

which largely depends upon foreign coun-
tries. In 1912 there was invested 1,135,-
000,000 franca in the Swiss hotels, which
employed 43,000 people. Seventy per
‘cent. of the income of these hotels was
| derived from foreign tourists. The num-
ber of foreigners travelling in Switser-
land is small. Consequently the hotels
|are facing a grave crisis. Most of them
{have been unable to meet the Interest
; charges on mortgages and to pay other
}debts. Such wae their plight that the
|Government had to take measures for
| relief,

A moratorium would have operated to
jthe detriment of the creditors, who un-

jloans with which to discharge current
/obligations. ‘These loans, however, could
be raised only when the first mortgagees

by a mortgage preceding theirs, Wher-
ever this could be done an additional
loan was forthcoming. In cases, how-
ever, where the permission for euch
precedence was refused the hotel owners

 

day (Wednesday) to discuss certain
points of the naval situation.”

 

It was Winston 8. Churchill who when

First Lord of the Admiralty forced the/

resignation of Lord Fisher as Firet Sea
Lord in May, 1915. Lord Fisher's res-
| tgnation resulted in a general political
| shakeup and in the subsequent reurgani-
; sation of the Government, the First
Lord was “shelved,” taking the Insignifi-

|cant Cabinet post of Chancellor of Duchy |

| of Lancaster.
Col. Churchill's

grievance against

Lord Fisher, as expressed in Parilament, |
was that he had not received the guld--

ance from the First Sea Lord to which
he had thought Iimself entitled. Col.
Churchill's present advocacy of the re-
instatement of Lord Fisher indicates a
revision of his feelings toward the latter
