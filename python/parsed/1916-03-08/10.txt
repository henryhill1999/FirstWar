Since the outbreak of the B ropean War. forvign bonds have become increasingly
attractive to the Ame Investor, and we recommend the above mentioned issues
feeling confident that they will rank with ¢ highest grades of foreign government
bonds Very attractive features are the high credit enjoyed by the issuing government,
the present low rate of exchange as # basis for purchase, the high interest yield with
rates for exchange at normal and the substautial profit which will surely accrue to holdors

through the readjustment of exchange after the war

Capital $3,000,000
Par Value $10—Full Paid and Non-Assessable

The Zinc Concentrating Company has purchased and
owns all the patents, rights and contracts relating to the
“Campbell System of Magnetic Separation of Zinc, Iron-
Sulphide Ores.” This process has been developed by actual
use commercially until today it is admitted by scientists
and metallurgists to be one of the most important develop-
ments in the treatment of zinc, iron-sulphide ores, ranking,
in relation to those ores, with the oil flotation process.

The affairs of the Company are in the hands of Voting Trustees
which will insure the continuance of the above management.

The Zine Concentrating Company owns fundamental patents
covering the Etherington-Singer Non-Oxidizing Roaster and the
Campbell Zinc-Iron Separator. These patents control the “Campbell
System," which is the only one giving satisfactory results to the
piseocery of zine-iron sulphide ores. his process is producing the
highest known recovery of metallic values at the lowest operating costs.

In order to furnish the Company with additional capital required
by increasing business we have purchased a large block of its stock,
a considerable portion of which has already been placed with our
customers and the friends of the management.

We offer the unsold portion at $3.75 per share (Par Value $10.)

Applications to list this stock on the New York and Boston Curb
Markets will be mude by the Company.
