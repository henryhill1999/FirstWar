U. S. to Lease 2 Islands

for Canal’s Protection

PANAMA, March 18.—The

Cortagena correspondent of
the Panama Star and Herald as-
serts that the United States is
arranging for a ninety-nine year
lease from Colombia of the
islands of San Adreas and New
Providence, off the north coast
of Colombia, near Colon. The
ayment, it is asserted, will be
40,000,000. The islands contain
small cocoanut plantations, and
but little agriculture is carried
on upon them.

The islands are considered to
have military value, as they are
immediately off the Caribbean en-
trance to the Panama Canal.

ers, as the action of the Rupperts

Col. Ruppert planned to assert his
right in this way to disregard the rul-
ing of Commissioner, Roper of the In-
ternal Revenue Bureau on February 6,
that any beverage containing an excess
of half of 1 per cent. of alcohol was in-
toxicating. At the same time this was

“We shalt take no action with re-
gard to the brewing of 2% per cent.
beer until we receive instructions from
the Bureau of Internal Revenue in
Washington,” sald William H, Ed-
wards, Collectorof Internal Revenue,
in this city Yesterday.

Roper Asks for Advice.

From Washington came the statement
from Commissioner Roper that ‘we will
meet the issue when we come to it.”
Meanwhile he decided to ask the De-

partment of Justice whether the bureau |
has authority to enforce its rule against ,

the sale of beer containing more than
one-half of one per cent of alcohol.

This decision was reached by the Com- ,
legal |

missioner after conferences with
advisers and deputies of the department
in charge of enforcing liquor laws, when
the Commissioner found the various
laws and food administration regulations
were so complicated that it would require

ag authoritative legal decision to clarify |

the situation.

The recent ruling from the bureau pro-
vided that beer containing not more than
2.75 per cent. of aicohol coul@ be brewed,
but that Lefore sale the alcoholic contept
must be reduced to not more than one-
nalf of one per cent, Revenue officials
maintained that this percentage limit
wos based on precedent and on court
decisions in various States. It has been
used for years in collecting taxes. Com-

missioner Roper admitted, however, that |

State laws vary and that he knew of no
specific Federal law or court decision
prescribing one-half of one per cent. as
the Jimit of alcoholic content for non-
yntoxicating beer.

Centention of Brewers,

The weight of this latest phase of the
ight of the brewers rests on the. point
whether beer containing 2% per cent.
f alcohol is intoxicating. The brewers
naintain that it is non-intoxicating and
are prepared to back up their claims
with testimony by experts and with
ourt decisions. Relying on assurances

to that\effect from the brewers’ organi- |

sation, Messrs, Root and Guthrie handed
ut their opinion that “the proclama-
tions of the President dated January 30
and March 4, 1919, authorize the use of

“E.ain ‘and other food products. in the |

production of malt liquors which are not
.n fact intoxicating and that the act of

November 21, 1918, does not apply to
non-intoxicating beers.”’
It is to that act that Anti-Saloon

ague leaders are pinning their faith.
'vhey contend that the phrase prohibiting
the manufacture of “beer, wine or other
intoxicati malt or vinous liquors’ does
away witli the necessity of proving that
beer containing more than one-half of 1

per cent, ot alcohol is intoxicating, sinee |
beer is expressly mentioned in the pro-|

nibitory phrase. However, Wayne B.
Wheeler, general counsel for the league,
said at Washington yesterday that Con-
gress would be urged to define intox!-
cating llquor before the measure went
Into effect on July 1.

Lawyers’ Interpretation.

As matters st@nd Messrs. Root and
Guthrie hold that neither that act nor
the law of August 10, 1917, “guthorizes
ony executive officer of the Government
to determine what malt liquors are in
fact intoxicating, or to prescribe any
fixed test or standard for determining
when malt beverages shall be deemed
intoxicating.”

On this point Commissioner Roper
looks for an opinion shortly from the
solicitor of the Internal Revenue Bureau
and Attorney-General Palmer, and as
eoon as their interpretations of the vari-
“ous statutes have been made, the Com-
missloner will determine what course to
pureve, If those decisions uphold him
in enforcing the % per cent: rule, reve-
nue oMficers will be to forbid

lon March 26. Mr. Lewis also said that |
,he did not think the law would permit |

"the trial of Blewitt on a second indict-
' ment found by the Grand Jury in egn-
nection with the wreck.

Isaac R. Oceland, attorney for Blewitt,
moved for the dismissal of the indict-
ment as soon as court convened yes-
terday morning. This motion was de-
nied by Justice Seeger, and Mr. Oeland
then suggested that the attorneys ab-
stain frgm summing up and submit the
case to the jury on the charge of the
eourt. District Attorney Lewis, how-
ever, refused to consent to this arrange-
ment, and Mr. Oeland then began his
; address to the jary. He completed this
|task shontly after noon, and then Mr.
| Lewis made his plea for the State,

| Justice Seeger began his charge to the.

' jury at 3:10 o'clock.

“The defendant was charged to main-
tain safe operation of trains,” said the
| Justice, “and had the right to get com-
|petent workmen by any lawful means.
,The rules for the preparation and in-
{struction of motormen were necessarily
|scmewhat embarassed. If the motormen
{selected were competent it makes no
| difference that the rules of the com-
| pany were violated. The company rules
|are not statutes,

“The defendant, as superintendent of
the division, has charge of the transpor-
tation of passengers, including the se-
‘lection of motormen for trains. I charge
;you that he was bound to exercise the
, utmost and highest care as far as hu-

man foresight can go. If he failed in
,that diligence in the appointment of
Lewis, , endangering the health

result Thomas Gilfeather was_ killed,

you may find that the first count of the!

indictment is sustained.

“If the defendant knew Lewis was not
competent, I charge you that it wag un-
lawful to appoint him. If he did not
know or omitted to eXercise the highest
degree of care and failed to learn of his
competency, the charge has been borne
out. If Lewis was competent and knew
| how to operate the train, it matters not
why or how he was selected. If he was
competent, but his careless actions
caused the wreck, the charge ci. aot be
‘ borne out.”

Justice Seeger cautioned the jury that
| evidence introduced by the State tending

to show that five other alleged incom-
petent motormen were put in charge of
| trains on the day of the wreck should
have no bearing on their verdict, even if
the motormen had been proved incom-
petent, since they were required to de-
cide only whether Lewis was incompe-
tent.

Special Despatch to Tar Son.

ALBANY, March 18.—As a result of a
conference to-day of the executive
committee of the Republican State
Committee and a conference to-night
of the Republican members of the
State Senate, which was expected to
be far from harmonious before it
,onded, predictions are being made that
the Legislature will kill:

The proposal of the Davenport
committee for levying a State in-
come tax to raise $25,000,000 needed
for the State treasury.

The plan to pass a bill doing away
with the present direct primary
system of nominating State officers
and returning to an amended form
of selecting them at party State
conventions.

The Walters bill to permit con-
tinued sale of 3 per cént. beer for
home consumption notwithstanding
the prohibition amendment to the
Constitution, and await action for
prohibition enforcement by the
United States Congress.

The so-called liberal labor legisla-
tion for health insurance, minimum
wage and the eight hour day for
women,

Will H. Hays, chairman of tha Na-
| tional Republican Committee, was ei-
pected to be at the conference of the
executive committee, but wired that
he was unable to attend, saying:

“There is nothing so important for the
feountry’s welfare as complete Repub-
lican success. This is no time for little
things. Just as during the war, so now
we have no time for petty jealousies,
carping criticisms, pulling and hauling
The Republican party accepts the re-
sponsibility which comes with its new
opportunities and with our eyes solely
on the country’s welfare we will meet
the new needs of the nation in the
| wisdom of experience and the efficacy of
honest, zealous service.

“This {s only possible if we all do our
part. The party in New York will not
fail the party in the nation.”

Candidates Arg on the Ground,

The omission of Mr. Hays to come
here for this meeting was attributed
by some politicians to a desire to keep

out of what might have turned into a
nice little tepublican party fight in
ease the executive committee should

have talked about “candidates,” of whom

‘there are several in Albany at this min-
ute. His friends, however, say other
business made it impossible for him to
attend.

Great secrecy was sought by those at-
tending the executive committee con-
ference. They agreed to give out noth-
ing of what happened, except the general
statement that everything was harmo-
nious; that all pending legislation was
discussed, and that a committee com-
posed of George A. Glynn, chairman of
the State committee; Bertrand H. Snell
of Potsdam, chairman of the executive
committee; Republican leader J. Henry
Walters of the Senate and Speaker Thad-
deus C. Sweet of the Assembly would
have more talk to-morrow on_ these
questions and might have something to

announce as to the attitude of the party ,

later,

Nothing surprised politicians more
than the well defined feeling to-night
that the Republicans have arranged to
forget for the present at least their
plans to rehabilitate the party State

dates, for county committees all over the

In some quarters to-night it is

mittee, headed by Mary Garret Hay,

more to do with the decision to let

else. Miss Hay told the executive com-

Special Despatch to Tum Scx.

Norro.k, Va., March 18.—Lieutenant
‘Commander Patrick N. L. Bellinger,
commanding the air station of the
Fifth Naval District, will attempt to
fly across the Atlantic Ocean in a na-
val seaplane. -He was notified to-day
by the Navy Department to proceed
to Washington at once for a confer-
ence. He is expected to start on the
‘ocean flight within the next few days
from Hampton Roads.

A farewell dinner was given for him
to-night by officers of the air station
and a loving cup was presented to him.
More than 200 naval officers were
rresent to wish him godspeed. He
will leave for Washington to-morrow.

Lieutenant-Commander Bellinger is
said to have been the first American avi-
‘ator to pilot an airplane under fire. He
flew over Vera Cruz in 1915 and was
under fire of Mexican snipers for more
than an hour. ‘

He has been conducting experimental
‘flights for several weeks. He flew 300
miles to sea several days ago and picked
up a destroyer which had several hours
start on him. He is thoroughly familiar
with the sea lanes which steamships fol-
low in the transatlantic service

Lieutenant-Commander Bellinger sald
he falt sure the flight would prove suc-
cessful. He did not know where the start
would be made, but tIntimated thae
Hampton Roads would probably be se
lected. Details of the flight, /he said,
would be arranged in Washisfton. He
mentioned that the start would. probably
be made in the next few days. *

BRITISH SHIP PLANE -
FOR OVERSEA FLIGHT

Secretly Built Machine is Sent
to Newfoundland.

 

 

By the Associated Press.

LONDON, March 18.—British
are to try a flight across the Atlantic.
A secretly built airplane, accompanied
by Harry G. Hawker, as pilot, and Com-
mander Mackenzie Girve, Royal Navy,
as navigator, was shipped from England
yesterday for St. John’s, Newfoundland,
from which it will start at the earliest
possible moment in an attempt to win
the Datly Mail prize of $50,000 for the
first machine to fly across the Atlantic.

The machine is a Sopwith two seater
biplane, with a 375 horse-power engine.
The fusilage is boat shaped and will sup-
port the machine in the water.

Pilot Hawker said he believed that
the flight would occupy about nineteen
and one-half hours. The machine, he
added, had flown 900 miles in nine hours !
and five minutes on one-third of its
petro] capacity, and is capable of main-
taining a speed of 100 miles an bour for
twenty-five hours. /

Harry (©. Hawker won the British
Michelin prize for 1912 by a flight of
eight hours and twenty-three minutes.

He has made many long distance flights
along the British coast. He established
a@ world’s altitude record of 28,500 feet
in 1916.

Newfoundland lies nearer to Furope
than any other part of North America,
the distance being about 1,960 miles,

Special Wirelesa Despatch to Tar Scx
Copyright, 1919; all rights reserved.
Lonpoxn, March 18.—Forced by se-

self into almost absolute control of

nication, the British Government now
is seeking the passage by the House
of Commons of a ways and communi-
cations bill, and one of the greatest
Parliamentary fights since 1916 ap-
parently is at hand.

Sir Eric+ Geddes, Minister without
portfollo in the present Cabinet, who
has been trying to placate the various
interests, is meeting insurmountable
difficulties and, realizing that he can-
not bring about acceptance of
measure in its original form, has ma-
terially altered the bill.

The original draft allowed the Govern-
ment to take over any or all existing
railways, harbor works, canals, docks,
&c. This proposed arbitrary power does
not fit in well with the British ideas of
individual liberty or self-government, and
as a result a tremendous hue and cry
has been raised throughout the country
against the passage of such radical legie-
lation on such short notice,

Opponents of the measure declare it
will enable the State to seize control of
every vehicle and vessel in the country
and they assert that this contemplated
control is equivalent to Germanizing the
British transport system. They visual-
ize the issue as ‘a battle between the

forces representing good and evil, even’

of spiritual versus bureaucratic

dictation.”

liberty

Shipping Men Object.

While the bill to a certain extent would
meet the demands of the railway men
for nationalization, it would seriously af-
fect harbors and docks, which are
elements vastly more intractable and the
structures are much more costly. While
water traffic lacks the regularity of rail-
ways, shipping is vastly more expensive
and the cargoes carried more costls
Therefore the great body of opponents
of the measure is found among the docks,
which really are municipal institutions,
governed by expert trustees

It cannot reasonably be expected that
such tnstitutions could be absorbed or
controlled by inefficient Government offi-
is asked why men who have
built or are building splendid harbors
and magnificent docks should be com-
pelled to make way for less representa-
tive men.

Tt is potnted out also that any inter-
ference whateyer from the Government
in the operation of the great national
gateways must inevitably and badly af-
fect the approaching contest for interna-
tional trade.

Looking at

the

the ways and communica-

tions bil from the viewpoint of its op-.

ponents, it is found to contain a variety
of propositions that apparently are un-
just In Manchester, for example, the
great work of canalization was carried
out not only by the municipality but by
private interests, working hand in hand
with the city

Tt is asked if all the efforts made in
the last decade ara now to be taken over
by the Government, deposing the men
who have devoted their lifetime to work-
ing out the many problems involved and
replacing them with political inefficients,

Concessions Are Made.

Owing to the heavy

opposition some
concessions already have been made.
The Government is Prepared to modify

the procedure by which it can acquire
ecntrol of the railways, canals and
docks, and also to jestablish separate
departments under a ministry to deal
with the various forms of transport, a
responsible and prominent official at the
head of each department to be in con-
tinual touch with the Minister. All pro-

; posals for constructing new railways or
‘the abandonment of existing works are

to be determined by the Ministesaee’ter
conference with the chiefs of depart-
ments

Sir Erie intends to emphasize the con-
ditions discovered by the Government
during the war, when it was found that
the loss in the railways’ business ran

into millions as a resyit of lack of uni-/

formity in administration, and also that
the canals were unprofitable because of
their Inefficient competition, while nearly
all the porgs were operated under officials
who continually sought parliamentary
power to increase their charges,

Theretore no transport system
ecnutinue on its present lines, it is
serted, and the Government must have
control of the whole.

Special Despatch to Tak Scx
WASHINGTON, March 18.—Out of the
confusion of statements and denials
about the League of Nation's covenant

sion from the peace treaty, Senators

cepted as the President's purpose to
weave the league constitution and the
peace treaty together as hard and fast
as he can. Asa result of this amend-
ments to the constitution as proposed
by Mr. Wilson’ are already being dis-
cussed.

Two general amendments to
league constitution if it comes in as
Mr, Wilson has promised it will are
now being talked of by Senators, who

will refuse to surrender the sover-
.eignty of the United States as the
Wilson pact would do. The first

amendment has to do with the Monroe
Doctrine;
the Army and Navy of the United
States.

So far as the Monroe Doctrine is con-
cerned, it is proposed that an amend-
ment shall be added to the Wilson pact
stating definitely that nothing in the
League of Nations constitution shall be
construed in any way to mean that any
European or Asiatic Power shall be per-
mitted to acquire any territory in the
Western Hemisphere by conquest, pur-
chase, cession, lease, or by any action of
the proposed League of Nations.

Witt Guard National Armament,

So far as the army and navy are con-
cerned, this amendment would provide
that nothing in the league pact shall be
in any way construed as preventing the

as large as the navy of the greatest
naval power in the world and that noth-
ing in the league constitution shall be
construed ag to prevent the United States

from raising and maltintaining an army ! England and France.e The Unitedy
as large as the army of any other nation |

in the world,

Irn both amendments under discussion
ji would be expressly provided also that
no further action of the league or of its
ex«grutive council could reverse this situ-
ation
, Of course these two amendments are
far from being all that would be pro-
posed, and the Senate is more than likely
to adopt these amendments and others
when the Wilson league pact comes be-
fore it

The Senate is determined not to treat
with the peace treaty and the League of
Nations covenant as one document It is
regarded as nothing more nor Jess than
coercion on the part of the President to
try to get the unpopular League of Na-
tions through a hostile Senate on the
back of a popular measure as the peace
treaty with Germany is expected to be,

To Lop Off Covenant,

Cabled advices from Paris to-day in-
dicated that the last attitude taken by
the President is that the covenant will
be attached to the peace treaty as an ape
pendix If this proves to be true,
stead of the President's former threat of
weaving the two together inextricably,
the task of the Senate acting as surgeon
on the twofold document will be = im-
measurably simplified

If it is true that the league tu-
tion is to be therely appended to instead
of woven into the peace treaty, Senators
said to-day only a minor operation in-
stead of the major one of dissection will
be necessary. This operation is expected
to he quick and successful, with Sena-
tors Lodge (Mass.) and Knox (Pa.) act-
ing in their capacity as chief surgeons,

Then the peace treaty, relieved of the
encumbrance, will be considered and ap-
proved. a4

The excited portion of the twofold
documegt, these Senators declare, will
then conie in for separate consideration
If it proves impossible to amend it to
remove the denationalizing features of
rit, it will be defeated when the vote on

ratification is reached.

WASHINGTON, March 18.—Warning to
President Wilson that his intended-at-

mercial Club. Senator Lenroot sald

“It does not seem to have occurred

to the President that if he is not will- |
ing to negotiate a treaty of peace sat-!

gress itself may and undoubtedly will
pass a joint resolution declaring the
war with Germany terminated.”

By the Associated Press.
Paris, March 18.—-Lord Robert Cecil.
| the British authority on the League of
| Nations, after a conference with Pre-
| mier Lloyd George to-night, declared
| in behalf of the British delegation that
the League of Nations covenant, in the
| epinion of the delegation, should be in-

 

|! corporated in the preliminary peace
| treaty.

His announcement followed an tm-
| portan conference this afternoon
; among President Wilson, Premier
Lloyd George and Premier Clemen-

ceau, the conference taking the place
of the session of the Supreme War
; Council, which will be held to-morrow.

Lord Robert Cecil, while discussing
the League of Nations covenant with
British ‘and American correspondents
to-night, said: “If the Monroe doc-
trine means, as I believe it does, that
there ought to be no interference with
affairs on the American continent by
European Powers without the consent
| of the United States, then I‘say that

| the doctrine is strengthened by the
| League of Nations.”
| Announcement was made at the

close of the conference that no final
| decisions had been taken but that all
‘the main questions surrounding the
Peace Conference had been discussed,
that the meeting had been entirely
satisfactory and that there
no change in the plans previously an-
‘nounced, which contemplate the com-
pletion of the peace treaty within the
next two weeks, including the League
of Nations
The conference was extended, lasting
from 3 o'clock in the afternoon until #
this evening. It had been in-
| tended that the meeting should occur
