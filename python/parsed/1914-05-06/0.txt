WASHINGTON, May 6.—The rebels made
a sharp attack on Tampico yesterday, ac-
cording to a despatch received to-night
from Admiral Mayo. The attack was de-
livered from the north and northwest of
the ofl port.
| Admiral Mayo reported that the fighting
was heavy but indecisive.

The Admiral added that firing continues
there daily. The Federals have been re-
| eaterend by 1,500 men.

It was reported here to-day that Ad-
miral Mayo has expressed his confidence
in being able to take Tampico with the
fleet now under his command. He has,
| In addition to his flagship the Des Moines,
two cruisers and a flotilla of mine torpedo

believe that Admiral Mayo has hinted in
his despatches more than once at the ~
