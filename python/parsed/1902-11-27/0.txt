liked the congested and crushed life of |

into the coneeit that everything outside

West man respecis his fellow man, if the
fellow man respects himself ‘There the
Jew is respected

“Take that fact under consideration and
come out where you can develop mind and

told to be other than what you are.”

Then came this advice

*Tell all the West Siders who come down
here from idle curiosity and pat your chil-
dren on the cheeks and then return to their
drawing rooms to tell of what horrors they

Bitter Opposition te Naming a Negro for
Collector of the Port of Charleston.
WASHINGTON, Nov. 26.—It is, probable

that the Vresident will eventually decide

hot to appoint Dr. William D. Crum te be

Collector of Customs for the Port of Charles-

ton, S. C., Dr. Crum is a negro. Two or

three weeks ago the official intimation was

; given at the White House that Crum would

be named for what is in some respects the
important Federal office in South
Carolina. This aroused intense feeling
among the white population of Charleston,
and it Was unfavorably conimented on
throughout the South, even while the Presi-
dent Was a guest in Mississippi. The fact

that Crum was nominated for postmaster
of Charleston by President Harrison and
that his name was withdrawn from the

Senate after a bitter opposition to confirma-
tion had been manifested has apparently
intensified the feeling in South ¢ arolina
against Crum’s proposed appointment to
the Collec torship.

The President has received a large num-
ber of letters from leading Republicans, as
well as Democrats, in Charleston and other
partsof the State, opposing Crum’s appoint-
neat and he has been waited upon by dele-
gations of indignant citizens. It is certain
that these expressions of hostility have
made an impression on the President

It has been reported that the Administra-
tion has disco verod some facts about (rum's
actions in the Republican National Con ven-
tion of 1892 whieh do not refleet cre tit Upon

him One of these stories is that Crum
was a Blaine dologate, but “switched” to
Harrison Upon the assurance that he would

ship. It is certain, however, that the mov-
ing cause in President Roosevelt's present
disinelination to appoint Crum is the bitter
and widespread opposition to his candidacy
on the part of the white citizens of South
Carolina and the belief that it would be a
tiistake to force a negro into sueh a Cone
spicuous office as the Charleston Collector-
ship

 

PREACHER SUED FOR DIVORCE,

 

His Vice-eCrusading Methods
Offended His Wire.

PHILADELPHIA, Nov, 26. — Because of the
irdor with which he carried on a crusade
against vice in Denver, Col., the wife of the
Rev, Henry M, Tesnon began divoree pro-
coedings against him in Common Pleas
Court No, 3in this city to-day. Mr. Tesnon

of the University of Pennsylvania. In
isd. he married Miss Ella Emma Berger,
the daughter of a tinware manufacturer jin
this city, Seon after his marriage he
accepted acallto the First Reformed Chureh
of Denver

Mr. Tesnon was indefatigable in his
efforts to suppress vice, and was made
choirman of the Ministers’ Alliance Commit -
tee, which conducted a crusade, Accom-
panied by guides and other ministers the
young pastor paid nightly visits to many
of the loWest resorts in Denver in his efforts
to secure evidence that would lead to the
arrest and prosecution of the proprietors

While the crusade was at its height stories
vere circulated by enemies of the young
preacher impugning his motives for visitir ¢
these resorts, and the matter culminated
in the publication of a sensational article
in the Denver Post denouncing the young
minister in the most scathing terms

Many persons believed, or pretended to

came so great that his wife left him

and returned to her home in Wyneote, Pa,

secure a legal separation at Denver, but
the minister came out victorious, In the
suit begun here to-day she charges de-

Assistant Postmaster of Warren,
Murdered on the Street,
WARREN, Mich., Nov. 20.— Early to-day a
gang of robbers blew open the safe in the
Warren bank and murdered Clinton T,

About 2.30 o'clock this morning they
drove into town and broke into the bank.
They drilled the safe and inserted a large
charge of -nitrogivcerine. The explosion
aroused Mr. Osborne, who telephoned to
one of his neighbors. All the telephones in
the village are connected at night, and it is
thought that the cracksmen heard the bell
on the bank telephone ring and listened to
Osborne’s conversation Osborne then
started down the street and had gone aghort
jistance when one of the robbers, acting as
an outside guard, shot him in the face with
a charge of buckshot, killing him instantly

Havana, Noy. 26. Shots were fired to-

Tho paper says t n» oly thinks hard
of the strikers, but there is nobody who
does not anathematize the Mayor, Civil

Governor and 8 eretary of Government as
responsible for the blecdshed. It adds
that it is proballe that S« flor Tamayo will
leave the Cabinet, and that S flor Zaldo
will become Secretary of Government,
Senator Silva Secretary of Finance and
Si fior Montes Secretary of State.

The Mundo speaks of the strike as a ae-
rious danger to the State

The Lucha blames the central Govern-
ment for the bloodshed, saying that it only
Legan to consider the seriousness of the
situation after the conflict had been going
on for three days. It declares that events
showed that the Cuban people are very
quiet, as,in spite of the fact that there wes
no government authority in the city for
forty-eight hours, the strikers being masters
of their own actions, Havana has not to
lament a single robbery, while only some
seven or eight lives were lost and 120 per-
sons injured.

It is rumored that the Mayor will be re-
moved from office if a new Secretary of
Government is appointed

President Palma and Seftor Zaldo drove
to Mariano to-night, where they dined with
Mr. Squiers, the American Minister. They
had an escort of eight mounted rural
guards.

It is stated that if the resignation of
Sefior Tamayo is accepted, the other office-
holders belonging to the National party
will also resign. As at present there is a
Nationalist majority in the House of Repre-
sentatives this might make a difficult situa-
tion for President Palma

The question whether the State or munici-
pal authorities were responsible for the
disorders growing out of the strike is being
discussed. It is stated that in a conversae
tion between President Palma and Seflor
Gaulberto Gomez, the latter argued that
the United States should take a hand in the
trouble, as foreign property was in danger.
It is generally held, however, that the
matter is one for the municipality to deal
with,
