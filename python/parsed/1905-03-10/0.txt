Mrs. Helen Bloodgood Garrettson Gunther

trial of her sult for a divorce from Charles
Van Valkenburg Gunther, whom she mar-

has not lived since Christmas eve of the
same year

J. Hampden Dougherty, counsel for Gun-
ther, ln oppesing the application, read to
the court a letter which Mra. Gunther wrote
to ber husband just after they separated
It was in part as follows

POSTAL INVESTIGATION,
soinioaae deities
Inquiring Into Charges
Against John H. Masten
WASHINGTON, March 9.—It develops upon
inquiry at the Post Office Department that
the investigation now in progress there re-
lates to charges previously made against
John H. Masten, rather than to the record
of former Fourth Assistant Bristow It
is alleged that Mr. Bristow pigeonholed
apers bearing on Masten’s record

The Department

certain f

Masten's name was mentioned in the
Bristow report in connection with the
time clock contracts, but he was exon-
erated of any wrongdoing. As to the

allegations concerning purchases of binding
twine, the Fourth Assistant had nothing
to say connecting Masten with the trans-
actions

Masten has been the storm centre of
several lively controversies in the postal
service. He was attached to the Brooklyn

post office for many vears. He was chief
clerk in the First Assistant's bureau when
Robert J. Wynne entered that office

Mr. Wynne displaced Masten, appointing
as chief clerk John J. Howley of Br voklyn
Masten wanted to superintendent of
mails at New York, but Postmaster-Genera!
Wynne refused to give him that important
assignment

Grief over the losa of life and the loaa of
national glory had a quieting effect to-day
on the workmen in this city. Forty thou-
sand men were discharged from the
Government armament factories and paid
off, after a series of strikes and lockouta due
to the Government refusing to accept the
men's political programme. Soldiers ocon-
pied the factories.

During the paying off, billa were distribu-
ted bearing the heading: “Better a month
of hunger than a life of oppression." The
bills called upon the men to stand together
and to take advantage of evente to enforce
their civil righta.
