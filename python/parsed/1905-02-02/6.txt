kept Metcalfe from entering a week ago.
It came out yesterday that Metcalfe’s com-
panion on the night he encountered O'Brien
was John A, Mitchell of Life. Mr. Mitchell
has made an affidavit of what occurred.

Doorkeeper O'Brien said that he got bis |

orders from Danlel Frohman, manager of
the Lyceum and president of the managers’
association,

[t is the opinion of Mr. Krotel that enough
evidences was ob tained yesterday to ask for
warrants, It isn't likely that Metcalfe
will adopt this course. If he did obtain
warrants and fail in his case he would be
liable for damages,

It is more than probable that the matter
will first be taken before a Magistrate.

Mare Klaw said last night, “I'm not sure !
| that the District Attorney bas any business

to conduct this kind of an investigation.
if they are after evidence I will furnish
the Distyiot Attorney with evidence to

indict Metealfe for criminal libel. It's |
| @ new definition of conspiracy to say that

men cinnot protect themselves from one
who wants to injur: them and thelr patrons
In a conspiracy there is an agreement
between two or more people to plan some
unlawful set. They have got to prove

first that it’s unlawful to bur a ian out |

of the theatres and it is not the business

of the man who does the barring to know |
that the man he bars is making a living |
by coming. Metcalfe was never recog- |

nized as a dramatic eritie by my firm and

we never sent him free tickets for a per- |

formance,"

They Would Like to Commit for Contempt

The City Magistrates wish power to punish
for contempt of court. At their regular

which eventually will get to Albany, and
they hope will have the desired effect. At

AND AUTHORS.

 

Much interest is aroused in the works of
Maxim Gorki, now that the author has come

| into prominence as a revolutionary leader.

His play “Nacht Asyl” is scheduled for

| tlmsly production at the Irving Place

Theatre, and “The Life of Maxim Gorki,"
written by the English journalist, E. J.
Dillon, &nd published by McClure, tells
the wonderful story of his career. Gorki
is a child of the people, who began life with
the rank of serf. He has been a painter
of ikons, a pedisr of kvaas, a soullery boy,

Y | gardener, watchman and baker's appren-
! and Heinrich Conried. The Mayor's com- }
mittee in charge of theatres has declare |

tice. He has come up from the ways of
sin and vice and degradation by hia own
strength of character, recognized his ability
to write and wrought out his own evolution
from trashy novels to the real thing in
literature, which he has expresso! in strong,
bold, vigorous strokes. Maxim Gorki
promises to be the spokesman of the revo-
lutionary movement, as Father Gupon is
the spiritual leader. If history repeats it-
eelf and the b'oo.ly tale of the French Revo-
lution be retold, Father Gapon and Gorki
will be among the Robespierres and

Dantons and Murats of the new régime in |

Ruasia.

Margaret Potter, author of “The Fire of
Spring,” one of the new spring books to
be brought out Ly Appleton, went into the
library of the British Museum a few years
ago to make some notes. While she was
filling out ber permission card the official
in charge glanced at the prepossessing
young girl and asked her ago.

“Nineteen,” replied Miss Potter, truth-
fully, vaguely wishing that she ware older

“Minors are never allowed inside the
gate,” said the official, severely,

“Iam 25,” sald Misa Potter, *if you really

| insist on knowing. I was deoeiving you

before.” The official sighed and observed
that he had known it all the time, and Miss
Potter was admitted. “I had to tell him
that,” explained Miss Potter later, “be-
cause I really needed the notes.”

lies in the fact that it is a romanoe of Alas-

| from the literary expression of it to which
he was accustomed. For one thing, this

honest and horny handed public was in-

clined to make capital of Mr. Tarkington's
elegance of attire, and his supporters were
anxious lest his fastidiousness in dress

should offend that fidgety but essential

element of success known as “the work-
inginan’s vote.” An amusing story is

told of Mr. Tarkington's walking down the
street during the campaign tn his cor-

rect and perfectly cnt frock coat, the gor-
geous waistcoat and all the distinguishing

featiues of modish afternoon dress. He
was acoompanied by a crowd of “heelers*
of the usualtype and as they passed a paint
shop one of the followers proposed to go in
among the paint spattered wofkinen. Mr.
Tarkington led the way, chose the grimierv

man of them all and grasped his paint
smeared hand in cordial greeting. There
was nothing for the others to do but to fol- |
low suit, and the men who planned the joke

carried away with them considerate paint
they had not paid for and an iftcreasing re-

| spect for their candidate, in spite of his |

elegance in dress.

Prof, William M., Sloane,

‘“*T read the book in two

thing. It is also the work of
a good craftsman, having
unity, continuity and distinc-

vigorously drawn, and that by
suggestion without needless
description; the scenes are

ellent and the author has
visualized old Paris with

The Silence of

Mrs. Harrold

Suggestive, isn’t it? of a plot
g complexities
—the kind we have not had since

'the days of Charles Reade. The

author of this new novel, Samuel
M. Gardenhire, made hte reputa-

tion when he wrote ‘Lux Crucis.’

He knows how to tell a story
with all the good old-fashioned
merits of intricate plot and en-
thraliing situation, yet applied to

‘the most compelling of present-
| day themes. It is Wall Street,
| the great powers of finance, the
| whirl of metropolitan gaiety that

give life and movement to these
pages. The !ove story involves
the fortunes of a popular young
actress and the son of a great
Wall Street operator. The secret
ways of big corporations—their
sins and theirvirtues: —are brought
strikingly home to the American
reader. The author is a New
York lawyer of wide experience,
who knows the inside of what he
writes about.

An ill-fated attempt to bring

theme of the ingenious novel,
