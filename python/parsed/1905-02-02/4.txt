was called forth by statementa made by |
Senator Bard of California and others to

“The first boy to apply at Cherry street
sald that his father and mother went to
work early, and that he usually had nothing

“What of the moral effect?”
asked,

“Ob, I don’t think the plan will pauperize
any one. Weare Ry recognizing a need

“What will prevent it fram being perma-

“That's a problem for some one to work

Col. Cox added that the Salvation Army

nearer the schools, but has been unable to
get halls ity stores at reasonable
prices. He would be glad If some one with
an empty store on his hands would lena it

HE WAS TOO SELF-IMPORTANT,

The White House Negro Messenger Trans-

WaSHINOTON, Feb. 1.—Artbur Simmons,

a negro messenger, who has been employed

at the White House almost continuously

since President Grant's administration,
was transferred to-day to the Interior |

Department. He received ai salary of

$1,200 a year at the White House, but his

transfer to the Interior Department re-
duces his pay to $840 |

Simmons became known to nearly all
the prominent men connected with the |
Government during the last thirty years,

but on account of a growing self-importance,
many complaints have recently been made |
against him by visitors to the President's |
offices i
Similar complaints caused his transfor |

son Administration, but he was restored !
to duty at the White House through the
influence of Secretary of War Daniel S
Lamont early in President Cleveland's
second term. His downfall has been pre-
dicted for a long time by many of these
who have had business to transact with the
! .esident'’s secretary. Matters carne fo a
