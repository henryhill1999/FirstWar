Important Amendments Introduoed by

Senator Gardner of Kings.
ALRANY, Feb. 1.—Important amend-
ments tothe New York city rapid transit

law were introduced to-day by Senator |

Gardner (Rep., Kings). The
amendments are favored by the Rapid
Transit Commission. It is held by many
persons that when new subways are built
provision should be made at the same time
for the construction of pipe galleries to
be owned by the city. A permissive pro-
vision to that end {s the first amendment
proposed.

The-rapid transit act doea not permit
a lease to be made of a road built for and
owned by the city for lesa than thirty-five
vears. The second proposed amendment
eliminates this restrictive proy ?

The rapid transit act requires a mini-
mutn deposit of $1,000,000, irrespective of
of the estimated cost of construction. The
third amendment proposed modifies this
requirement as follows

“Tf in any t of construction
embraced in a contract i imated by the
said Board of Kapid Transit Railroad Cora-
roissioners at the sum of $10,000,000 or leas
may,in the discretion of
eaid board, fix the amount of such deposit
at such @ sum less than $1,000,000 as the said
board may t in no case shall

The Rapid Transit act ullows certain

company. It proposed to. elitninate
this provision.

The first of six Ulustrated lectures on the
evolution of the horse by Henry Fairfield
Osborn, Da Costa professor of zoology in
Columbia University and curator in the
American Museum of Natural History
was given last night in the museum ball.
In this lecture Prof. Osborn considered the
horse as an animal mechanism and aided
the perception of his hearers by means of
the & moving picture
machine

“We do not have to go to the rocks to |
study the horse in pust ages,” said Prof,
Osborn, “He can be studied as he is to- |
day. <A horse does not ehy because he is
pernicious. Shying is a reflex actinherited |
from the period when he was a wild animal
and when such an act was the means of |

instance, is a watershed grained the same

turies the animal has grazed down hill and
the ordinary growth of hair would not

With charts, Prof. Osborn showed how
the horse, unlike man, is built for speed.
It cannot rotate its limba, which are strictly
fore and aft in action, and this rigidity is
conducive to speed. It bas the gaits of
most of the other animals, ambling like the |
pacing like the camel and min- |
ning with the hound. It cannot, like the
bound, straighten itself out in running.
Che limbs of the horse are extended only
in leaping obstacles. In all other gaits

length of the trunk.

STATEHOOD BILE DISCUSSED

A Little Passage at Arms Between Senators
Teller and Dillingham.

WASHINGTON, Feb. 1
Mon.) made a speech against the Statehood
bill in the Senate to-day, directing his
opposition to the proposed union of Arizona
and New Mexico. Mr. Dillingham (Kep.,
Vt.) followed in favor of the bill, and indi-
cating that the Nmited agricultural re-
souroes of Arizonaand the scarcity of water
precluded the development of that territory
to a position justifying it in becoming a
separate State.

This aroused the wrath
(Dem., Col.), who charged
Senator with unfairness
ness. He said he did not cast any

of Mr. Te

the Vermont

reflec-

| tions upon the sincerity of Mr. Dillingham,

but he questioned the authenticity of his
information. Mr. Teller declared that the
agricultural resources of Arizona were
vastly in excess of those of Vermont,
the increase in the number of farms and
farm va)ues much greater. In fact, Ver-
mont during the twenty years between

aod

1880 and 1900 had lost ground, both in the |

number of farms and the value of farm
produots, according to the statistical ab-
stract. Mr. Teller read figures to prove
this statement.

Mr. Dillingham replied with some vigor,

This was one of the questions put to James
J. Hooker, rman of the Rec
Shippers’ Association of Cineinnati,
Senator Elkins, before the Committee
Interstate Commerce this morning

Mr. Hooker said this was a purely hypo-
thetical case, as he had no money invested
in this manner.

“But if you had,” pursued Mr. E)kins,
“would you favor such legislation and
would you hold your stocks or sell them

a case,"

or sell their holdings

“Well, it might be a little late,
Senator Elkins, “to sell after a twenty-point
drop or more. J] know men who own halt
a railroad, men who own a third and men
who own a quarter, and [ am of the opinion
that these men intend to se}! their holdings
if the rate making power is taken from the
railroads and given to ons who are not
financially interested in the rail-
roads pay dividends.”

Mr. Hooker thought the t1 iffic ‘managers

quired a thorough knowledge of all condi-
