The workmen then retired and luncheon |

returned to St. Petersburg this afternoon.

The reception of the workmen at Tsarakoe-
Selo was advertised beforehand, with the
view to give it the fullest possible publio
effect. Tho Minister of Finance directed
the chief employers of labor to select two
of the best!workmen out of every thou-
sand and prepare them to visit the Winter
Palace, but not telling them that they would
be presented to the JOzar. Nearly all the
formalities that are customary when his
Majesty gives an audience to his humbler
subjects were omitted. No expression of
loyalty was uttered, and the usual offering
of bread and salt was not made

NO CHANCE AGAINST AN ARWY.

Kevolutionists Are Told.

The Russian Social Revolutionary party
held a meeting last night in Lieberkranz
Hall, Brooklyn, to key up for a larger public
meeting to be held in the Labor Lyceum
Friday night. Speeches were made in four
languages. Dr. Raievski spoke in Russian,
Mr. Katz in Yiddish, S. Pollock in English
and Dr. Sidlewskiin German. Dr. Ralevski
said:

“It is foolish for an unorganized mob
to go against a modern army. It might
have worked 100 years ago, Sixty years ago,
aven, the survivors of a mob under fire
might reach the soldiers and wrest away
thalr guns, but what chance have the naked
hands against Maxim guns and magazine
rifles? a

*The movement this time was eeorueey
Let us see that when it is renewed the people
are better prepared.”

“He Sald He Ought to Haye 500,"' De-
clares Coroner of Yale Football Cap-
tain Produces a Clerk Who Swears He

Coroner Moses J. Jackson made anabsolute
denial vesterday on the witness stand
in the General Seasions of the charges
that he had attempted to get $500 from
Lawyer Benjamin Keass to clear “Dr.”
Jobn W. Alexander of a homicide charge
ov that he had ever tried to bribe Deputy
Assistant District Attorney Chadwick with
$200 in the same case. The Coroner in-
sisted that it was Chadwick, the Yale foot-
ball captain, who had said he ought to get
$200 from Reass. When he heard the propo-
sition the Coroner was shocked, he said
With the testimony of Dr. Jackson the de-
fence practically closed its case, and the
Coroner will probably know his fate to-day. |

The Coroner and his counsel, Frank Moss,
came to court pretty confident that Re- |
corder Goff would not let the case go to

the jury, but he did, agreeing with Mr
Rand that even if the Coroner had no juris-
diction to inquire into a death in New Jer-
sey he was inquiring; and,acting as a Coro-
ner de facto if not de jure. could havesought
a bribe to influence official action

After Edward Lauterbach, Congre ss-
man Goldfogle and Wiliam S. Bennet
Prof. Irving S. Haynes of the Cornell Medi-
cal School and others had testified fo Coro-
ner Jackson's good character the Coroner
took the witnes« stand

He said he was born in Germany in 1865 |
and had been a practising physician tn
this city twenty-five years. He told of
getting the Alexander case, which was re-
portad to him by the police and ofehe arrest
of Alexander ou his warrant

“T fixed bail at $5,000," he said
wick wanted the bail g$iu.000, 1
it later to $3,000, at the request of Reass

Jackson then gave his version of the con-
veraation with Chadwick in the latter's |
office. He told Chadwick, le said

trict Attorney Perkina over the telephone,

“Then Reass came to ny house 1 didn’t
ask him. He said he wanted the case de
cided the next day, | told him ‘Go down |
to the District Attormey’s office, they want
$500." He said ‘Damn the District Attorney,’
and went away mad.”

On crosa examination he said that his
father’s name was Jacobson, but that he
shortened it to Jackson on the advice of a
friend when he came to this country. 7

“Why did you reduce bail from $5,000
to $3,000?" Mr. Rand asked

“Because I éxpected to get more evi-
| Laushuar. |

“When you expect more evidenos in a|
case you reduce the bail, is that ity” }

‘Yes,” said the Corone |

Mr. Rand couldn't twist bis story to any |
appreciable extent. The Coroner had al- |
ways thought Chadwick was a nice young |
man, he said, but he never mado a straight- |
out proposition to Chadwick to go into |
law business with his son

Benjamin S ‘Tynedale, a clerk in the

Mason lived with his niece, Mias Agnes

About a week ago he went to visit at the

ill there. His condition was such that
it was impossible toremove him tohishome
He failed rapidly and died yesterday after-
noon

Mr. Mason was born in Edinburgh, and
came to this country when a boy of 12
years. He made his home on Greenwich
street near Battery place, and as a young
man gota place isan oder superintendent
with Commodore Vanderbilt and watched
closely the methods of that great business

man,

When Vanderbilt established a line of
steamships running between here ana
Colon young Mason was sent down fo the
isthmus to Jook after the docking facilities
While there he saw # chance to better him-
self and took advantage of it. Commodore
Vanderbilt only freighted stuff to the sea-

PROTESTS AGAINST RATE BILL

FROM THEIR

Many Members Declare They Will Not Be

if It Decides to Rush the Bill Through
evolt Staried Against Townsend Bill. |

WasHINGTON, Feb. 1.--Harmonious sup-
port by the House Republicans of the Town-
send or Administration railway rate bill
is not as certain to-day aa it appeared to be
yesterday. Many Republican members
who were ready to be bound by the action
of the party caucus on Friday have been
receiving telegrams from influential con-

stituents who protest against any surren- |

der to the dictates of the party managers
on such an important industrial question
These telegrams oave come by the score
and are much to the point. Some of the
members who bave reoeived them are not
so sure now that they will vote for the Town-
send measure, while othera aro declaring
that they won't be bound by the action of
the caucus if the proposed plan of rushing
the bill through the House next week is
decided on

Two enibryo revolts among the Republi-
can Representatives have been started, one
by Representative Davis of Minnesota,
who is not opposed to rate legislation but
holds that the Townsend bill is unsatis-
factory, in that it would lead to endless
litigation, Members from Pennsylvania, to
whom many telegrams came to-day, are
also stirring up a spirit of opposition on
the ground that the great business interests

involved require the most careful con-

| sideration

“People in my State have $4,000,000,000
invested in railroads and property of that
kind,” said Representative Mahon of Penn-
sylyvania. “It’s ridiculous to undertake to
pass npon this question after we have had
reat only two weeks to consider it. |
wont be bound by the action of any caucus
if the bill indorsed does not safeguard the
interests of Pennsylvanians.”

Representative Castor of Philadelphia,
who has been too ill to give attention to the
subject, declared that if the ‘Fownsend
bill was as radical as represented to him
he would pot be bound by a caucus indorse-
ment of it fepresentative Datzell of

ure, but his idea is that a bill which will

If the voyage to

Europe lasted only three days,
fewer people would take it the
second time. The first three
days are occupied with getting
sick and getting well again. It
is the last three days of the voy-
age that leaves so pleasant an
impression that the voyager de.
sires to repeat that impression.

Unfortunately manu-
facturers embark upon adverti-
sing who stop before the voyage
is half over. They have noth-
ing but the unpleasant impres-
sion of paying advertising bills,
They have not waited to get the
pleasant impression of seeing the

many

profits roll up.

This means that no adverti-

sing should be commenced with-

out a fair understanding of what
it is going to cost and a reason-
able appropriation to meet that
cost.

There are too many manutac-
turers who have gone ashore while
their boat was in mid-ocean.

Hundreds of telegrams of protest against
the ‘Townsend bill have been received by
Kepublican members from influential men
in the Northwest, where the rase regula-
tion movement is supposed to be popular.
This one from KE. S. Hovt, président of
the Minnesota Stone Ware Company, is a
sample

“Referring to agitation regarding railroad
legislation, | wish to record my objection
to legislation giving the Interstate Com-
merce Commission the rate-making powe!
I believe the business interests of the coun-
try will be better served if this power is
left in the hands of the railroad companies
However, the commission should have the
power to adjust cases of discrimination;
enforce maintenance of published
