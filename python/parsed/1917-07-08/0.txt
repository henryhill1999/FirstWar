Lonpon, July 7.—In one of the great-
est aerial raids made on London, thirty-
seven persons, including séveral chil-
dren, were killed and nearly 150 injured
this morning. At least twenty German
airplanes flew over London dropping
bombs in the heart of the city,

Four of the raiding machines were
brought down by British filers. In ad-
dition allied airplanes, waiting off Dun-
kirk to attack the raiders on their way
home, destroyed three German seaplanes
and brought down or damaged four
other scouting airplanes.

The text of the Admiralty announce-
ment regarding the achievement of the
Dunkirk aviators reads:

The Vice-Admiral at Dover has re-
ports from Dunkirk that information
was received that enemy aiftcraft were
attacking England. Five flights were
sent up to intercept them as they re-
turned. The raiding enemy aircraft
were not seen, but three énemy sea-
planes were encountered and destroyed
and one enemy airplane driven down
into the sea. Another enemy air-
plane was driven down. ‘

The machines returned to replenish
their petrol and left again immedi-
ately. In the course of this patrol
one enemy airplane was brought down
in flames and another forced to land
on the beach damaged near Ostend.

During their operations one of the
raiding enemy air plan was en-
countered and it is thought highly

Probables,tliey returned near the
Scheldt and over Dutch territory.

Fly Low and at Slow Speed.

The Germans, who reached London
about half past 9 o’clock, steered a
course across the city from northwest
to southeast. They dropped ‘the last of
their supply of bombs on ‘ section of
workmen's dwellings and the
Thames. Some observers shys a giant
airplane piloted the squadrén and that
the bomb carriers were in the centre,
flanked by scouts for fighting off the
British airmen.

The low altitude and slow pace at
which the Germans crossed London and
the daredevil way they circled over
their objectives caused great surprise.
When first seen they were steering a
steady course for the narthwest, evi-
dently in the act of making a long,
sweeping curve which would ultimately
bring their heads in the direction of
home. They completed the mancuvre
over the Thames and as the British ma-
chines came into the picture the raiders
quickened their pace. |

A flerce running fight ehsued between
a strong force of British machines and
the raiders toward the mouth of the
river. The machines flew fairly low and
the rattle of machine gung was distinctly
audible from the ground. None of the
Germans had been brought down when
the combatants disap from view,
but the British squadron continued the
pursult and engaged them heavily.

Directed Against Civilians.

To-day’s attack was plainly directed
against the civilian population and
business and financial buildings. There
fe no question but that the Germans
knew where they were and it was not a
matter of scattering explosives blindly
from a great height.

How it happened that more persons
were not killed is hard to explain.
Thousands were in thé streets in the
area bombed, but probably a much
larger proportion took shelter in the
solid buildings, taught by the lesson of
June 13,

The upper story of one building,
where several hundred men and girls
Were employed, was partly destroyed.
First reports were to the effect that
great loss of life had occurred in this
dullding, but it later developed that no
one was even injured, as all the work-
ers had been quietly marshalled into
the basement when the gunfire began.

The upper part of a solid office
building was crushed.. Large concrete
blocks were thrown about the street,

but no one in this building suffered any
injury, as refuge was early sought in
the basement.

Among the places attacked was one of
the most extensive {metropolitan hos-
pitals, on which the Red Cross flag was
flying conspicuously and the location of

which must have been known. Early
rumors were abroad that the hospital
had been damaged, ‘but investigation
showed it had escaped entirely, although
feveral bombs fell close to it.

In oné building a number of proml-
nent business men had gathered for a

German ’Planes Bomb
Hospital, Killing 3

PARIS, July 7.—An official
communique, issued to-night,
says:

In the course of a bombard-
ment yesterday by enemy air-
pla.ies in the region of Nancy,
several bombs fell on a hospital.
Three persons were killed, one of
them a child, and four wounded.
It is also reported that several
were wounded at rye °

On the night of July 3, 84 al-
lied machines took the air.
“Several of these raids had as
their objectives towns situated
very far in the interior of the
enemy territory in reprisal for
bombardments against our open
towns.

Eleven of our airplanes flew
over Treves, on which they
showered 2,650 kilos of shells.
Seven fires started, one of great
violence in the central station.
Six other machines bombarded
Ludwigshafen, doing considera-
ble damage, Among other build-
ings, the important Badische ani-
line factory was devoured by
flames.

Another of our airplanes,

iloted by Marechal de Logis Gal-
ois, pushed as far as Essen ard
dropped projectiles on the build-
ings of the Krupp factory.

Military installations in the
environs of Coblenz, the Hirson
station, the railroad west of
Pfalzburg and the Thionville
station likewise were bombarded.
Another series of operations over
the enemy lines gave excellent
results. A fire started in the
station at Dun-sur-Meuse, a mu-
nitions depot exploded at Banthe-
ville and. the railroad station at
Machault and establishments at
Cauroy were burned.

In all 30,455 kilos (about 2%
tons) of projectiles were’ used.
Two of our airplanes have not
returned.

GREEK COERCIO

Provisional Government Re-
fuses to Send Troops to
| Act With Allies.

 

 

 

 

Perrocrap, July 7.—The official news
agency printed a declaration of the pro-
visional Government concerning the pro-
posed conference of the Entente Allies
on the Balkan situation. The declara-
tion states that Russia's representatives
will be instructed to defend the stand-
point of the provisional Government with
all emphasis, and to insist upon the ap-
Plication of those general principles ap-
plying to foreign policies that have been
proclaimed by Russia's democracy. In
part these instructions refer to the recent
events in Greece.

In this question, the declaration says,
the previsional Government !s unable to
refrain from taking an unfavorable view
of the methods applied to enforce a
change in the sovereigns of Greece. Al-
though the Russian provisional Govern-
ment condemned former King Constan-

tine’s personal policy, it nevertheless re-
garded as“not permissible any interfer-
ence in the internal affairs of Greece.
Thus Russia was compelled to lodge ob-
jections to the change in rulers and to
refuse participation of Russian troops in
the Entente expedition in southern
Greece,

In her relations with the Allies Russia
has defended the standpoint that the
form of the Government and the state
organizations in Greece are exclusively
the affair of the Greek people. The dec-
laration concludes with the assertions
that the military activity of Russia's
army has increased the importance of
her views in international affairs and
that the voice of Russia's democracy,
backed by the operations of the revolu-
tionary army, now ought to carry par-
ticular weight.

WASHINGTON, July 7.—Secretary of
War Baker has been deluged with re-
quests from American women, wives and
relatives of the personnel of the Pershing
expedition, for permission to go to
France and be near their husbands or
fathers or brothers during the next few
months, All requests have been refused.
Mr. Baker announces it as the inexorable
rule that the presence of American
women wil] not be permitted with the
army abroad,

The reason for this, it is explained, ta
that France now, and particularly the
vielnity of the fighting line, Is no place
j tur American womanhood,

There is, only one means by which
wives might have a chance of being near
their husbands on the battle front and
that is by joining the Red Cross.

Another rule adopted is that there
shall be with the American forces no in-
dividual not in uniform,

San Francisco was the plotters’ base of

Gen. Brusiloff's troops demonstrated

to-day that the offensive of July 1 was

no mere flash in the pan, and that the
new Russian army has every whit the
staying power of the old. Though their
losses were heavy, the Russians. per-
sisted alike in attack and in fighting
back counter attacks, giving Germans
and Austrians a terrific pounding.

Their greatest success was gained in
that region of Galicia east of Lem-
berg. The strong German trenches on
the heights northwest of Presovce and
the second range, east of Godov, were
stormed and held after the flercest fight-
ing. The two villages of Lavrikovce and

Fighting With Bayonet.

Then came the German counter at-
tacks, in which the fighting was with
the bayonet. Six strongly fortified po-
sitions captured by the Russians changed
hande time after time as the brown or
the gray lines swept over them. At
eome places the Germans forced back
the Russians, but at the end of the fight
the two lines of hills and Lavrikovce
and Travotioki remained firmly Russian.
In this fight seventeen officers and 672
men were taken,

A second attack was delivered jn the
region of Stanislau, and directly toward
Halizez, the key to Lemberg. In this
fighting, on the first rolling ground that
leads up to the Carpathian Tange, the
Russian troops forced Germans and
Austrians from their trenches on a front
of several miles from Jamnica to Pa-
sechna, northeast of Stanislau. Still fur-
ther south, and almost in the main range
of the Carpathians, the Russians took
the mage S Sviniuchi, north of Nad-
worna. In these engagements th
sians took 360 prisoners, a

The third Russian attack was near
Zlochoff, almost directly east of Galicia.
Here the Russians attacked the Teuton
fortifications at Katkovmanaluv, after
artillery preparation. In the first rush
of the attack the Muscovite troops
stormed three lines of Teuton trenches,
The German counter attacks were ex-
ceptionally strong here, however, and

finally they succeeded in winnin back
the lost ground. =

Germans Claim Victory.

The net result of the Russian offensive
—or group of offensives—is, however,
far different from that claimed by Ber-
lin in another statement of the ‘kind that
was issued after the July 1 attack, The
whole affair was “an excedingly san-
guinary defeat of the Russians," the
Germans say, not admitting the lose of
a aingle position.

According to this statement the Rus-
sians used armored cars, “which were
shot to pleces,” and wnen they retreated
were bombarded by German airplanes
and their cavajry shelled by long rdnge

ns,

This statement also endeavors to con-
vince the Russians and the Germans
that the other Allies, especially France,
are forcing the soldiers of free Russia to
fight, reaching this conclusion by the
fact that the Russian army orders were
written in French, which has long been
the language used for much official and
army business in Russia. This state-
ment also is part of the propaganda to
weaken Russia's loyalty and to reassure
the Germans themselves.

Earlier semi-official reports were given
out In Petrograd announcing the earlier
successes of the Russians. These men-
tloned a heavy bombardment on the
Pingsk front, in which the city of Pinsk
was said to be fn flames. The only men-
tion of Pinsk in the official statement
issued later is that Russian mine sweep-
ers cleared the River Pina, which flows
by Pinsk.

OMcial Statements,

The official statements follow:

Russian—In the direction of Zloc-
hoff, after artillery preparation, our
infantry attacked strongly fortified
positions of the enemy. We occupied
three lines of his trenches, but later
he succeeded in pressing back our de-
tachments.

In the sector of the heights nortn-
west of Presovce and in the wood west
of Koniuchy our detachments con-
ducted an offensive and engaged in a
stubborn battle throughout yesterday,
The enemy executed counter attacks
and at certain places pressed back our
detachments. Toward evening, how-
ever, there remained in our hands the
heights northwest of Presovce and the
villages of Lavrikovce and Travotlokt
and the heights east of Dodov. We
captured 17 officers and 672 men.

In the region northwest of Stants-
lau, after artillery preparation, our
advance detachments pressed back the
enemy in the Jamnica-Pasechna sec-
tor and occupied his trenches. South
of Bohorodzcany our advance detach-
ments defeated an advanced post of
the enemy. We occupied Svinfuchy
and repulsed the enemy's counter at-
tack. Altogether in the engagement
here we took 860 prisoners,

Proof that the German military au-

risings in Ireland and India came into
the hands of the United States Govern-
ment when agents of the Department of
Justice raided the offices of Wolf von
Igel, formerly German naval attache to
the German Embassy and also concerned
with Capt, Karl Boy-Ed in various prop-
aganda activities. Papers seized dur-
ing the raid were said at the time to
contain names and evidence of wide-
spread plots against the neutrality laws
of the United States, It ia believed that
this evidence forms the basis of the San
Francisco indictments just returned.

Through the information obtained by
the Department of Justice Government
officials arrested last March in New
York Chandra Hanador Chakraberty
and H. L, Gupta, Hindu students in
Columbia University, and Dr. Prnest
Sekunna, a German chemist, on charges
of having engaged in a plot to set on
foot a military enterprise against Great

with having used money furnished by
the German military authorities in Ber-

{for four hours in the Brooklyn Federal

Wall street address is the one from
which Franz von Papen and, after Von

| which the Government objected. Among
the passengers aboard the liner which
sailed without Steward Lindstrom was
Heinrich Schaffhausen, who was re-
cently deposed as an attache of the
Swiss legation at Washington,

é Von Linde Watched.

Marshal Power, Mr. Beer and Police
Lieut, Busby, following out their orders
from Washington, stationed themselves
at the pier yesterday some time before
the hour scheduled for the departure of
the liner. To the pier came Von Linde,
whereupon the watchers saw Von Linde
walk up to various members of the crew
of the liner and converse with the
sailors. Von Linde finally approached
the steward, Lindstrom, and the two
men talked together several minutes.

Then Von FAnde, the watchers say,
handed a package and some money to
the steward. Marshal Power, Mr. Beer
and Lieut. Busby decided it was time
then also for them to take part in the
conference, with the result that Von
Linde and Lindstrom were detained and
induced to go to the Federal Building.

Von Linde freely confessed, Federal
authorities say, that the package con-
tained “twenty-one letters, all of a purely
business character,” destined for com-
mercial agents at Gothenburg, Sweden,
and other cities in the Scandinavian
peninsula. He had arrived here, Von
Linde continued, two weeks ago on the
same liner that sailed yesterday, and on
that trip from Europe to this country,
added Von Linde, he had brought several
letters that never had gone through the
mails.

Feared Mail Holdup.

He had brought the letters over per-
sonally, he said, because to send the
jetters through the regular postal chan-
nels would mean that the British censor
officials would hold up the letters for a
month or a month and a half, which
would be detrimental to his business,
Von Linde insisted that the letters which
lie brought here two weeks ago had been
passed by the British authorities at
Halifax.

‘Assistant United States Attorney Beer
and Lieut. Busby took Von Linde and
Lindstrom by automobile to Von Linde's
Wall street office last night, where an
hour was spent going over various pa-
pers in the office.

With the exception of the examination
ef Von Linde and Lindstrom, who were
not arrested but merely ‘detained’ for
examination, there were no signs of fur-
ther activity on the part of local Federal
officials or departmental heads at Wash-
ington so far as Manhattan and vicin-
ity were concerned in the matter of the
expected general roundup of Teutonlo
agents hereabout.

Special agents of the Department of
Justice here who had detained a New-
ark suspect in Capt. Offiey’s office until
a late hour Friday night admitted yes-
terday that a long examination had un-
covered nothing of a suspicious nature
against the suspect, who was released.

The status of certain citizens of Aus-
tria-Hungary who are being watched by
local Federal agents is giving the offi-
clals some concern. It is believed that
of late much spy work and other pro-
German activities here have been taken
over by Austro-Hungarian agents. But
as this country has not declared war
against the Dual Monarchy the Federal
officials have no way of interfering with
Austro-Hungarians unless such foreign-
ers are detected in the commission of a
criminal act. Not being “allen enemies"
they cannot be picked up on mere sus-
picion, as in the case of suspected Ger-
mans,

WASHINGTON, July 7.—The process of

weeding out all Germans attached to
the Swiss Legation here and to Swiss
consulates throughout the country -is
now in full swing.

Helnrich Schaffhausen, who was)|
Count von Bernstorff's right hand man,
is now en route for Berlin aboard the
Norwegian liner Christianiafjord, with
Fritz Bern and three others. Fifteen
more German subjects are on their way
to New York. from various Swiss con-
sulates preparatory to leaving the coun-
try.

By way of explaining its action the
State Department to-day made this an-
nouncement:

“At the request of the State Depart-
ment, made two weeks ago, the Swiss
Legation is requiring all German sub-
jects in its employ or in the employ of
the various Swiss consulates throughout
the United States to resign. These
resignations have been received.

Had Department Approval.

“In this connection it may be said that
the Swiss Legation in temporarily re-
taining service of these German subjects
was acting with the approval of the De-
partment and under a reciprocal ar-
rangement whereby certain American
citizens were enabled to remain with the
Spanish embassy in Berlin to assist that
embassy in caring for American in-|
terests in Germany.

“This reciprocal arrangement, which
was of a temporary nature, is now
cancelled by the prompt and complete
comptiance of the Swiss Legation with
the Department's wishes.”

‘The United States Government, it was
learned to-day, has obtained safe con-
duct from the Entente Allies for Herr)
Schaffhausen and the other Germans
aboard the Christianitafjord. Safe con-
duct also will be obtained for the fifteen
other German subjects.

 

Case of Austrians.

With the Germans out of the Swiss
Legation, attention of diplomats is now
centred on the Swedish Legation, where
several Austrian subjects have been em-
ployed, and also on Swedish consulates
which have had the service of Aus-
trians. The United States is not at
war with Austria, so that the case is
slightly different. Nevertheless, it is
understood that the State Department
will invite such Austrians as remain to
leave. Many of the Austrians have been
relieved of their duties in this diplomatic
capacity, it is explained.

That both Germany and Austria will
retaliate by ordering all Americans
from the Spanish embassies and con-
sulates in those countries is regarded
here as a foregone conclusion. Few
Americans remained in Germany, any-
way, ané@ their opportunities for helping
the United States, even if they wished
to do @o, were 80 closely guarded
against by the Berlin authorities that
the Wilhelmstrasse could well afford to
let them remain.

CHILD CRUSHED UNDER CAR.

Mother Injured While Trying to
Save Three-year-old Son,

 

Samuel Gilman, three-year-old son of
Mrs. Gussie Gilman of 4284 Third ave-
nue, was contentedly at play on the
sidewalk in front of his home last night.
Suddenly he ran out Into the street, right
into the path of a rapidly approaching
northbound car.

His mother screamed and dashed after

him, but her efforts to save the little
fellow, were unavalling. Both were
knocked down and rolled under the car.
When the trucks were finally raised
by the combined efforts of an emergency
wrecking crew and a group of firemen
from a nearby station it was found
that the child was dead and the mother
dangerously injured. Mrs, Gilman was
immediately taken to Fordham Hos-
vital,
' Hundreds who had witnessed the ac-
cident rushed out to the scene and were
not dispersed until after the arrival
of police reserves. Some made threaten-
ing remarks concerning the car's motor-
man, Robert Smith, of 694 East 231et
street. The motorman and several wit-
nesses were held by Coroner Healy for
examination,

REPRISAL TALK

State Department Hints U.
§. May Try to Curb Ger-
man Deportations.

BERLIN CHARGES NAILED

 

Accusation of “Inhumane”’
Treatment of Teutons in
Africa Refuted.

 

WasHINGTON, July 7.—As a means of
protecting Belgium against further vio-
lations of the laws of civilization by
Germany the ‘United States and the
Entente Allies may decide to initiate
retaliatory measures against German
subjects in thelr countries.

This was strongly intimated to-day
coincident with an announcement by
the State Department that twenty-two
prominent Belgian citizens in Brussels
had been deported by the German au-
thorities as punishment for what Ger-
many claims to be “inhumane treat-
ment by Belgium of certain civilian
prisoners taken at Taborah, in German
Southwest Africa.”

“The facts are,” according to the
State Department announcement, “that
upon the capture of Taborah the Belgian
authorities determined to take the Ger-
man women, children and civilians from
German Southwest Africa to France,
where they would be interned. The
whole Taborah region has been devas-
tated by the war and it was impossible
for these prisoners to live there, whereas
in France they could properly be cared
for. The Germans alleged that this was
inhumane treatment and that the health
of the prisoners was jeopardized.”

The-Belgian Government, through the
Belgian Minister in Washington, has
called the attention of the State Depart-
ment to the new deportations.

One element which causes the Entente
nations and the United States to hest-
tate about initiating retaliatory meas-
ures is the fear that Germany would
Promptly use any form of reprisal as a
pretext to starve the thousands of rit-
ish, French and Russian prisoners ynder
her control.

LIGHT ON DEPORTATIONS

Prominent
“Cruelty” Charges of Germans.

Lonpon, July 7.—The events leading
up to the arrest in Brussels by the
German authorities of twenty prominent
officials of the Belgian Colonial Office
and directors of the colonial societies
were related by a prominent Belgian in
London to-day. His statement follows:

“When the Belgians and the British
captured German East Africa they took
prisoner among others the German Gov-
ernor, Dr, Schnee. Dr. Schnee's wife,
who was found to have compromising
papers in her possession, was arrested.
All the prisoners, including the Governor
and his wife, were sent to France and
treated with the utmost consideration.

“Some time ago the Belgian Govern-
ment proposed to the German Govern-
ment, through the Vatican, that Gov.
Schnee be exchanged for Burgomaster
Max of Brussels. The Belgian authori-
ties also offered to exchange Mme.
Schnee for Mme. Boel, wife of a prom-
inent member of the Belgian Legisla-
ture. They further proposed to exchange
other Germans held prisoner in East
Africa by the Belgians for Belgians who
are interned in Germany.

“The German Government sent to the
Belgian authorities a most insolent re-
ply, demanding that all the German
prisoners be released within three days
on the Swiss frontier or wherever the
prisoners wished to be taken. The pen-
alty, if the Germans were not released,
was to be the arrest of twenty Belgians,
The Belgian Government protested
against this ultimatum, and the next
move of Germany was to make the ar-
rests in Brussels which included Count
Jean d'Oultremont, formerly Grand
Marshal of the court of King Leopold;
Count Hippolyte d'Ursel, director of the
National Bank, and Baron de Cuveller.

“Since the arrest of a score of prom-
inent persons Germany has issued a
statement accusing the Belgian Govern-
ment of {ll treating German civilians in
East Africa. This accusation is em-
phatically denied by the Belgian Gov-
ernment.”

LAUDS LELAND STANFORD MEN.

French General Cites Ambulance
Section for Courage,

Paris, July 7.—The entire ambulance
section of the American field service sent
to France by Leland Stanford Uni-
versity last February is cited by Gen.
Mangin to-day in orders to the division.
The citation of the section is made for its
“having given constantly since its ar-
rival at the front, an example of courage
and profound devotion, especially at
Verdun and at Moronvilliers, in pushing
up to the battle lines under bombard-
ment to carry away the wounded.”

 
 
  
 

 

Smoot Amendment to Food
Bill Gives Wilson Power
to Commandeer It.

 

ACT SUSPENDS EXCISE

Manufacture and Importa.
tion of Distilled Liquors
Is Forbidden.

 

BEER AND WINES STAND

Action May Compel Revision
of Revenue Bill or Necessi-
tate Bond Issue.

 

WasHinoton, July 7.—John Barley-
corn, victor in many a combat, was
knocked out to-day. For the period of
the war at least he will be in disgrace,
branded as a public enemy throughout
the United States. His defeat was com-
pleted late this afternoon when the Sen-
ate, as the climax of its long and heated
prohibition debate, voted to forbid the
manufacture of all distilled liquors, to
forbid also their importation, and to
direct the President to take over all
spirits in bond, paying the owners cost
plus not more than 10 per cent. This
will cost the Government at least $640,-
000,000. It will compel a revision of the
tax bill just put in, adding this sum to
the amount the bill calls for, or necessi-
tating a bond issue.

In the final action taken to-day beer
and wines were left unmolested, as the
President desired. But if the Senate's
action on the prohibition question stands,
the cocktail and the highball, the gin
rickey and the mint julep, and all the
delectable compounds made up _ for
thirsty souls, will be banished from the
country's bars thirty days after the
President affixes his signature to the
food bill, that is unless the liquor inter-
ests of the country take out the spirits
now in bond before the decree goes into
effect. But even this will insure only a
limited supply, with retail prices mount-
ing higher as it becomes exhausted.

Senators who had a hand jn drafting
the bonded liquor provision of the bill
declared to-night that the liquor in bond
must be commandeered by the President
immediately after the bill becomes law
by his signature. Representatives of
the liquor Interests are of the opinion,
however, that they will have thirty daya
in which to take the liquor out of bond.

Liquor Interests See Profits.

To take out the bonded liquor before
Prohibition goes into effect will cost the
Nquor interests, it is estimated, $223,-
000,000. It is believed they will go im-
mediately to work liquidating all their
available assets and investing the pro-
ceeds in these bonded liquors, calculating
that they will be able to sell it at a stu-
pendous advance,

The Senate's prohibition substitute for
the House provision, as finally adopted,
reads:

THAT FROM AND AFTER thirty days
from the date of the approval of this
act no person shall use any foods,
fruits, food materials or feeds in the
Production of distilled liquors, except
for governmental, industrial, manu-
facturing, sclentific or medical pur-
poses, nor shall there be {mported into
the United States during said war any
distilled liquors, provided that the
President of the United States be and
hereby is directed to take over for and
on behalf of the Government of the
United States all distilled Mquors that
are held in bond at the time this act
goes into effect, and he is hereby au-
thorized to pay to the owners of such
liquors the actual cost of the same
plus a profit not exceeding 10 per
centum.

AND PROVIDED, FURTHER, that the
collection of all excise tax on distilled
spirits in bond at the time of the pas-
sage of this act shall be suspended so
long as this act is in force and the

distiller, in event that said distilled
spirits shall be taken over by the Gov-
ernment as here!n provided, shall be
discharged from a!l obligations for any
and all taxes levied and assessed

against said distilled spirits, provided,
however, that the owner of the dis-
tilled spirits shall not withdraw any
part thereof without the payment of
the excise tax in force.

ANY PERSON who wilfully violates
this section shall, upon conviction
thereof, be punished by a fine of not
‘exceeding $5,000, or by !mprisonment
for not more than two years, or both.

Senate’s Action I# Radical.

The action of the Senate {s more
radical than many expected a few days
ago. The defeat of the “bone dry”
forces has long been regarded as a cer-

tainty. Few of the conservatives ex-
pected, however, that the Senate, con-
fronted already with a staggering coat
for the war, would take the step it ald
to-day and vote to purchase the spirits
in the bonded warehouses in the hope
of insuring the total prohibition of
whiskey.

But prohibitive as the cost of this

appeared to some, !t was brushed aside
to-day over the protests of Senator Sim-

mons, chairman of the Senate Finance
Committee. Overthrowing as virtually
confiscatory the more radical Cummins
amendment adopted yesterday, which
would have prevented the release of any
of this liquor during the war period, the
Senate by a vote of 60 to 12 adopted
an amendment framed by Senator
Smoot, Utah, directing the President to
take possession of the liquor and pay

the owners for It.

Some of the money expended for this
purpose the Government can get back
by redistilling the liquor for the manu-
facture of munitions. The owners of
these spirits are to be released from
their political obligations to pay taxes
on it unless they withdraw {t before
seizure.

With the Smoot amendment disposed
of, thus settling the question raised re-
garding the bonded supply, the Senate
as its final step passed the Robinson
amendment with whicn had been incor-
porated both tue Smoot provision and
the Cummins amendment of yesterday
forbidding the importation of spirits.

Final Vote Is 45 to 36.

The final vote by which the Senate's
new section 12, which was the Robinson
amendment, gives authority to the Pres-
