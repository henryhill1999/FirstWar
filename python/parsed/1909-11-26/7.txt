PITTsBvuRnO, Nov. 25.—The Colgate foote
ball team this afternoon had a little amuse-
ment at the expense of the Carnegie Tech
eleven. The New Yorkers won, 38 to 6.

After the boys from Colgate got well started |
it was but a question of how many pointe |

Carnegie line and around the Carnegie |
ends and at times leaped over the heads
of the Carnegie players. The only oppor-
given to the Carnegie rooters to
applaud came when Hittner was pushed

New iork thus ends the football season

the fireat haif, while in the second half
Penns¥!vania made two nore touchdowns
The popularity of football with the sort
of people whose support is worth while
was shown by the size of the attendance. |
It was a damp, cold, disagreeable day,
but for all that there were over 15,000;
spectators at Franklin Fleld. The game
was further proof that football ought to
be abolished because the payers were
untidy and earnest enough to get their
feet wet and their faces muddy. Was!
that brutal? It was hard and rough it
ie true, but not brutal. It was dificult
for the warriors to keep their feet, and the
way they slid and bumped into each other
made the game look rougher than it really
lwas, Still it was rough enough, there
! being three men disqualified—two Penn
| syivanians and one Cornellian. |
The wet and heavy ball and wet and.
muddy field made finished football impos-
sible and accounted to a large éxtent for
the many errors committed. The Quakers
made thirteen fumbles and the Corneil
men nine. The Pennsylvanians fumbled
more, but they were heavier, faster, fol-
lowed the ball more closely and had a big
advantage in punting. For thore reasons
they won. They gained on punts and made
the onside kick count heavily in their favor

jand with smoothness in formations. In|
|a number of instances tackles were made|
| hy a man sliding along several yards into
the man with the ball. The field, having
been left uncovered from the day before,
got the full benefit of the storm. There
was much wild, hit and miss scrambling |
in the swampy, slushy ooze. The ends |
‘on both sides had greai trouble in getting
| down under kicks, but no more than the}
jeatcher had in holding on to the ball or |
keeping his feet. There were tribulations |
in. the way of men making open tack'es |
jand the tackling was good considering |
}the diffcultr in a@ripping a man. RBrad-
‘dock of Pennsylvania played an excellent |
game under the circumstances and Seely
of Cornell did well
Cornel] had two good men in the hack- |
in Robb ard Simson, but the latter
was outpunted considerably by Hutchin- |
son who employed a low, fast travelling
drive. Hutchinson also got into the plays |
busily. The Pennsylvania tackles were
| more active than their opposites, but there
| wasn't much difference in line work be-
tween them. The left wing on erch side,
generally left tackle, was a vulnerable

j

spot for attacks. All of the wuard« stood
up to their work strongly. Irwin, behin
the line for Pennsylvania, showed himself |
to be a husky line breaker Pennsylvania |
used Pike, the guard,to rush the bell, while
Cornell used Crosby, the end,and Dorman,
the guard, for the same purpose. ‘

Cornell had the kickoff, and Hutchinson
caueht O'Connor's drive. Hutchinson tried
the right end and couldn't gain and kicked
to Hoffman on Cornell's 40 yard line. Robb
failed to gain and Simson punted. The
ball sailed over Hutchinson's head, and
Crosby raced down, plunged through the
mire and hugged the leather on Pennayl-
vania’s 20 yard line. Simson slammed
through five yards, and a penalty for being
offaide took the bail five vards nearer Penn's |
oal. It was worked up to the 4 yard!
ine, and from there Robb was crowded
through Penn's left wing for a touchdown
The ball waa punted out to Owen, who war
thrown roughly, but clung to the ball. |
O'Connor kicked the goa!, and the score was |
6 to 0 in Cornell's favor

Trotting back through the morass, pla;

wasrésumed, with Mysonines » fifteen yard
kickoff to Weeks. Simson lifted the ball
in good style to Sommer on Penn's 42 yard
line. In the next scrimmage Hutchinson |
fumbled, and Seeley nipped the pigskin |
in a puddle of water. Donnan piled into}
Penn's wabbly left flank for eight vards, |
Simson made one, and then Robb four for |
a first down. The advance was checked,
and an onside kick went out of bounds at
Penn's 15 yard line

Irwin rushed five vards and Hutchinson
punted to midfield. The pass from centre
was so low the ball hit the ground~—-there
being visible patches of grass at that end |
of the fleld—but Hutch litted a beauty up|
the field just the aame

Cornell had had |
the Quakers on the defensive, but the
aspect changed in a jiffy. Fretz broke
through blocked a kick and recovered the
ball on Cornell's 25 yard line. That put |
Cornell on e defensive rwin made |
three yards, but a fumble by Sommer lost
ten yards, Hutchinson being the fastest |
swimmer and recovering the ball. |
Owen nailed an onside kick on Cornell's |
15 yard line and Monk downed Sommers
when the lafter caught Simson's punt,
Ramsdell went skidding around left end
for twelve yards, Hoffman nailing him
when his interference had almost carried
him clear. An onside kick by Hutch found
Cornell off her guard, and Cozens ewoopea
down on the ball on Cornell's 10 yard line.
e robust Irwin cracked Cornell's centre
or two sizable gains and Ramadell topped
them off with a jolt at Cornell's right tackle
which took him over the line, the storm
centre of a tugging, swirling mess of men.
Braddock’s goal kick made the score 6 to 6.
O'Connor kicked off for Cornell, the bali
swishing through the wintry air to Penn's

and a fifteen vard penalty against Cornell

on Cornell's centre. Irwin bored centre
for three more and the next time bucked
ornell's right for two more and a touch-
own. Hutchinson punted out from
corner to Summers, and Braddock, after
rrowing a bath towel and getting a few
pounds of mud off his shoes, kicked the
goal. It was then 12 to 6 in Penn's favor.

A pecuiias play attended ©'Connor's
kickoff to Hutchinson. Hutchinson ran
in twenty yards and as the Cornell men
surrou him he threw the ball over the
heads of the group. Marks picked the oval
up on the bound and galloped cpr varde
more. Field Judge Langiord ec
that the play was an incompleted forward
Pass and certainly that is what it look
to be. The Penn men said they had no
such intention, had no such play, but the
oMicial could go only on what he saw. The
pail was brought back to Penn's 35 yard

Hutchinson punted to Wood on Cor-
nell’s 42 yard tine and Simson footed around
right end eight varda on a fake kick.
Hutchinson eaughit a punt and replied with
@ fine drive to Cornell's 10 yard line. The
ball, however, was recalled. Pike couldn't
gain, Penn lost five yards for being offside
and a punt followed. The ball was booted
back and forth until it was sent out of

nine oval and fell on it for a touchdown.

but thought it was worth it. The punt
out went too far out to be caught and the
sore was 17 to 6 in favor of the Quaker
mermen.

Marks caught Cornell's kickoff and was
submerged in a burry. When he got up
he wasn't fil to usher at a wedding. Heil-
man tore off nine yards in two tries and
Hutchinson punted to Tydeman. Cornell
was nalized for roughing the fullback,
but Tydeman got back fifteen yards with a
swift plunge through the line. Crosby went

opponent in a manner far from gentle and

Cornell had @ good chance for a touch-
down. Tydeman and Simson made ten
yards between them, and Cornell made five
more because Penn was off side. ‘Tydeman
and Heffman’ carried the ball to Penn's
4-yard line. There Cornell was repulsed
twice and tried a forward pass. The bail

Crack Racer Fails on Opening Day at
Jacksonville.

JACKSONVILLE, Fla., Nov. 25.—The winter
meeting of the Fiorida J.ive Stock As-
sociation began here thia afternoon with
a large attendance. The feature was the
Thanksgiving Handicap, and because of
the defeat of the odds on favorite, Jack
Atkin, the race proved to be a big disap-
pointment. Jack Atkin raced as if the
track was not to his liking. Jt took him
a quarter of a mile to shake off the fast
filly Takahira, and then he opened up a
gap of two lenaths, which advantage he
held to the stretch. At that point Hill
Top moved into the lead and at the tast
furlong was joined by Arondack. Hill

The sleet, slueh and wind that pervaded |
the city yesterday did away for the time |

Three of them, the Commercial-Brooklyn

The Poly Prep-Erasmus Hall game will
not be played at all. Both the Manual
Training and Boys’ High teams were on
hand at Washington Park yesterday morn-

and some 200 enthusiasts were there to
watch them play. There was an inch of
slush and water on the fleld and a driving
sleet storm. After a conference Charlie

could be arranged Head Coach Tad Jones
and Graduate Manager Cook, however, said
that they could not induce the Syracuse
Players to remain over, and when the latter
took a vote and decided to go to the park
to carry out their end of the contract the
Fordham eleven concluded to go ahead. The
officials were umaminous in the opinion
that the conditions were not (too severe
to prevent the battle, but they suggested
that the playing time should be reduced to
twenty minute halves.

‘the slushy fleld made the footing uncer-
tain, while the heavy ball and the strong
wind caused many fumbles and muffs
Gardner scored a touchdown for Syracuse
shortly after ti first half began, but the
punt out was muffed and a goal trial was
prevented in the second half George
Walsh saved Fordham trom defeat by
catching an onside kick in midfield and
running fifty-five yards for a touchdown.
But he failed to kick an easy goal because
of the wet ball and the mud puddle in which
he made his try

Syracuse won the toss and selected the
north goal, favored by the high wind,
and G. Walsh kicked off at 3:05 o'clock.
Gardner made the catch and ran back
ten yarda before Mawgrane stopped him.
Shaw punted immediately to G. Walsh,
who was thrown into a sea of sloppy mud,
after which he punted to Darby, who ran
back to Syracuse's 50 yard mark. Again
Shaw kicked and Gargan was thrown on
Fordham's 20 yard mark. G. Walsh then
juggled the auarterback’s pass, but with
a brilliant rum over the uncertain ground
he covered thirty-five yards around Syra-
cuse’s left end, running ovt of bounds
when he had a clear field.

McCarthy failed to gain in a tackle play
and Syracuse received fifteen yards for
holding. Ona fake kick G. Walsh circled
the left end for eight yards, but when he
tried to punt on the next play his kick
was blocked, and in a wild acramble for
the ball Camp fell on it for Syracuse. With
a quick assault Gardner scooted around
Fordham's left end for twenty yards. G.
Walsh tackling him in the nick of time
to prevent a touchdown. The ball was
on the 5 vard line then and Shaw plunged
into the centre for four yards, Fordham
flabting back gameiy. In another rush
through Fordham’s left wing, however,
Gardner carried the hall over the goal
line for a touchdown. The ball was punted
as Darby
missed it there was no trial for goal and
the score stood 5 to 0 in favor of the visitors.

Anderson kicked off for Syracuse, and
E. Walsh, making the catch, hurried back
to Fordham’'s 25 yard lipe, where G. Walsh

unted. Gardner mufied the ball in mid-

eld and the Fordham rooters leaped for
Joy when McCaffery fell upon it. MeCarthy
ained four yards through the centre,

ut Syracuse received fifteen yards for
holding, which brought another punt by
G. Walsh. The ball was so slippery that
Darby muffed it, but he received it just as
Fordham's ends were about to grab it.

is was a conspicuous gain and en-
couraged Shaw to try an onside kick.
It wae a perfect drive, for Clark caught
the ball on Fordham’s 25 yard line, wher
he was spilled on his face. Gardner add.
five yards in a rush around the left end
but just at that point Fordham received
a fifteen yard penalty. #« forward pa
by Shaw was not successful, but he follow
with an onside kick. There was holding
by Syracuse on this play and Fordham
received fifteen yards. Then came another
onside kick and Fordham got ession
of the leather on the 20 yard line. The
ball changed hands on fumbles, until
Anderson of Syracuse tried to kick a goal
from placement on the 30 yard line, but eae
drive went low and McCarthy, who pick
the ball up on his 5 yard mark, made a cork-
ing run of twenty-five yards around the
isitors’ right end, finally going out of
bounds.

A punting duel followed, Shaw havin

substituted for Gargan on the Fordham
eleven. when the teams returned to the

quickly returned by G. Walsh, whose drive
earri the leather far over the goal line.
But the ball was ordered hack and Syracuse
received fifteen yards for holding.

G. Walsh tried an unsuccessful forward
pare, and on the next play Syracuse got the

all on Fordham's 35 yard line. Shaw
kicked out of bounds with a poor drive
that covered only ten yarda, and when G.
Walsh punted Darby was thrown by MoCaf-

was an exchange of kicks after that until
G. Walsh caught Shaw's drive in the middle
of the gridiron. Dodging first one Syracuse
player and then another Walsh proceeded
to gain headway until he ran clean through
the whole Syracuse eleven and crossed the
goal line in triumph after covering fifty-five
yards. It was a splendid play and yielded
a touchdown for Fordham, also tying the
score.

The goa) trial was made from directly
in front of the gon) posta, The ball was
held in. a spot covered with water and slush,
and when G. Walsh kicked it the leather
went too low and saiied under the croashar.

It was snowing hard at that point and
fhe pavers were freezing. Scully went in
for Barry at Svracuse's right end and Giearey
supplanted mer arthy as Fordham's
quarterback. Anderson kicked off for the
visitors and G. Walsh tried an onside
kick, but Waldron secured the ball on Ford-
ham'’s 45 vard line. Gardner and Shaw
made amal!l gains. whereupon Fordham
received five yards for offside play. Shaw

A short punt by G. Walsh was caught
by McCaffrey on Syracuse's 18 vard line,
but when the former had made three yards
more in a rush through the centre Syracuse
received fifteen vards for holding. After
that the play was confined-to a punting
majch between G. Walsh and Shae, the

a t wealth of first class material from

uted pretty evenly among the elevens
An all star team of the greater city limits
tself to one chosen m Brooklyn and
Manhattan elevens, for there are neither
teams nor individuals of any prominence
in the other quarters of the town. In look- |
ing over the fleld the following appear
to deserve the first consideration:
Left end, Lopez, Poly Prep; left tackle, Cas-
tator, Erasmus Hall; left guard, Squires, Eras-
mus Hall; centre, Kinney, Manual; right guard,
Haviland, Boys High: right tackle. Weber, High
School of Commerce; right end ‘Taber. Boys
Higb; Quarterback, Gamble, lrasmus Halil;
left hajfback, Hunton, Erasmus Mall: right ha
back, H. Halstead, Adeiphi Acedomy: futloac®.
F. Trenckman, Adelphi Acateny
Lopez of Poly Prep is recarded by many
who have followed the players throuch
the season as the best end inthe city. He
has played steadily and consistently and
is as strong on the offence as the defence.
His tackling has been excellent and he can
punt fairly well in a pinch. He possesses
a high degree of football sense. Ferris
Manual Training, Callow of Erasmus
| all, Telfer of De Wirt Clinton and Stewart
of Commercia! were all good men, but did
not seem to coe up to Lopez's atandard
Taber of Boys’ High also appears to deserve |
| his position without much doubt. He is
short but heavy and extremely fast. He
has done weil with the forward pass and
onside kick and can carry the ball on an
end play. Hart of Manual Training and'
Demoya of Erasmus Hall merit consider-
ation |
|

|

The tackles Castator and Weber make
an unusually strong offensive pair. Weber
war perhaps the best ground gainer that
Commerce had and Castator scored well
with the tackle back play. Neither, how-
ever, is lacking in defensive ability. There |
are plenty of first rate tackles on the teams, |
but they can hardiy be compared with |
Weber and Castator on the offence, and
it would be hard to find two who were their |
superiors ia repulsing plays

Wf the two guards Squires is thought to
be Haviland’s superior at opening breaches |
and tackling. aviland may heave. it the
leant bit on Squires when it comes to saving
off a hard attack. Haviland has been on
the defensive much more than Squires and
naturally has <r more in that di-
rection. Kinney of anual, a veteran
player, in the judgment of many outdid
