AMONG THE AUTOMOBILISTS
SMALL CAR RACE SUGGESTED
FOR PHILADELPAIA.

 

 

J. Fred Betz 3d Offers 8600 in Cash or
Plate to Quaker City Moter Club as
Prize for Event te Be Ran on Same Day
as Annual Fairmount Park Centest.

Some of the members of the Quaker
(City Motor Club are trying te induce the
officials of the Philadelphia organization
io arrange @ road race for small cars, to
be held on the same day the contest for
big cars is held in Fairmount Park. The
diseussion of the plan has resulted in J.
Fred Betz 3d offering $500 in either cash
or plate if the club’s contest committee
and other officials decide in favor of con-
ducting such an event

Mr Betz is a wealthy young amateur
member of the Quaker City Moter Club
and competed in the second annual road
race of the organization, held over a ciroult
in Fairmount Park on October 6, this year,
when he drove a dupticate of the 90 horse-
power Simplex with which George Robert -
son won the race. The members of the
Quaker City club who hope to induce the
club officials to arrange for a small car
race are divided over the manner the pro-
posed event should be run, some of them
being in favor of having the small care
race at the same time as the larger ones,
as in this year’s Vanderbilt cup race, while
others would like to see the small cars in
a separate contest started early enough
in the morning so it would be finished be-
fore the large cars began their race. *

The men who are interested in the pro-
posed event for small. cars think the club
officials could readily seoure the consent
of the municipal authorities and the Fair-
mount Park Commissioners for the event
to be run over the same circuit as the larger
cars use The first Fairmount Park race,
during Founders Week last year, and the
second race in October, this year, proved
to be very popular, as great crowds of
Philadelphians turned out to watch both
events, Mayor Reyburn occupying the
official box at each race

 
 

    

It is expected that the officials of the
Massachusetts State Automobile Associa-
tion will try to secure the eee
the provision in the State motor
law which requires drivers to eouna their
horns when approaching street crossings.
When the State Legislature was consider-
ing this provision last winter its pageage
was opposed by the motorists of the State,
aa they claimed that a somewhat sim: ~4
provision in the motor vehicle laws of
Jersey and Pennsylvania had respen-
sible for great annoyance’to residents on
roads used by aufomobilists, on account

The Franklin ne

-is more efficient and reliable than any
water-cooling system.

/
The Franklin air-cooling system for 1910 is
the sensation of the year. It marks an import-
ant era in automobile history.

It removes every objection, real or fancied,
that ever existed against air cooling, and places
air cooling in the unchallenged lead.

Our air-cooling system is simple and posi-
tive. The engine cylinders have —
flanges. Around each cylinder close to t
flanges is a sheet metal air jacket open at t
top. These jackets with their continuous hase
and the engine boot form an air tight compart-
ment. At the rear of this compartment is the
suction-fan engine fly-wheel. This fiy-wheel

fan draws the air in large volume throu ugh the
air jacket down around each cylinder. The air
that passes one cylinder does not pass any

other cylinder, Each cylinder is individually
cooled, and each has an equal and large supply
of fresh air. The front fan formerly used is
dispensed with.

Compare our air-cooling system and the
water-cooling system with its many mechani-
cal elements and complications. ur system
cannot fail to work. There is nothing to get
out of order. On the other hand the water
system with its fan, pump, radiator, soldering,
—— and piping is subject to epee ng

—— and freezing. And see the saving i
weight.

You can if you wish sat-
isfy yourself that under
severe work the Franklin
engine cools perfectly
when many water-cooled
engines give trouble from
overheating.
