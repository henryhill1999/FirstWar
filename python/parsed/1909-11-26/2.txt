HWE LIVES IN CHICAGO, WHICH
48S THE SOCIAL CENTRE.

 

 

® Danghter Brings Him to New York for
rhanksgiving, Just as New Engiand-
ers Go Into the Country —He Has Had |

Views on Gram; Has Some on Cotten. |

lames A
ator, who was a spectacular figure in the
grain market last winter and who is
credited with being a buyer of cotton,
came all the way to New York to eat

his Thanksgiving dinner. Not that he |
could not get a better turkey in Chi-!
‘cago; bless you, no; but Mr. Patten’s|
daughter wanted to be with a lot of Bryn |
Mawr school friends, so the whole family |
ust packed up and came East and had

dinner yesterday at the Waldorf-Astoria,
with Miss Patten’s friends as guests.

Mr Patten is willing to admit that |
New York is, still the financial centre |
of the country, but not the social centre,
which is still Chicago. “As for Wall,
Street, that is not everything nowadays,”
Mr. Patten added; “at least, ‘we don't
think so out West.”

Just one inch under six feet, the Chi- |
cago operator is broad in proportion, |
though not stout. His complexion

is |
. clear and his mustache white, and he}
attributes to never worrying the fact |
that he doesn't have to brush his hair
all in one direction. He is 67 years old.
His voice is low and he speaks in an even
tone, and apperently is the soul of good
humor |
“Ido not drink at all,” said Mr. Patten. |

*It has always been my theory that no}
man can be a speculator--for that a

 

what | am-—and succeed very long if
he uses liquor. He must have anormal
brain and his reason and judgment
must not be affected by stimulants. For
‘another thing, I never think of business
outside of my office. When I go home
from my Office I put businegs out of my
mind and do not think about it again
until I enter my office the next day.

“Conditions out West were never beiter. |
The farmers as a general thing have |
plenty of money. There are some places |
where they have been borrowers, but |
they all have something which is easily
convertible into cash. The merchants |
are having good trade, and the dry goods |
stores in Chicago say that their sales |
are beating all records.

“In regard to grain last winter, subse- |
quent events showed I was absolutely |
correct in my predictions. Wheat is!
higher to-day than it was a year ago
and the millers themselves are bulling |
nowadays. Because I called attention
a year ago to the inevitable rise in the |
price of grain | was abused for trying
to set up as a prophet. I may say that
I now have no interest in wheat. Some
of the millers are predicting that it will
‘go higher, but I doubt it. It has been
my experience,” Mr. Patten added with
a chuckle, “that what everybody is fixed
for seldom occurs. Personally I try
not to lose anything in any year, but
of course it is only human to make mis- |
takes

“Yes, 1 have been interested in cotton,
and still am. In fact I expect to be for
some time. The situation in that market
is precisely the same as it Was in wheat

, @ year ago. The crop is short, produc- |

tion being below requirements, and the |
spinners have been caught napping, just |
as the millers were a year ago. I am
hearing the same kind of talk that I heard
a year ago, and the same kind of abuse,
and it sounds familiar,” and Mr. Patten |
chuckled again. “Oh, yes, | know what |
they are saying. It all gets back to me. |

Well, | may be wrong. But that report | night and drove up to a saloon at Broad- | her.

‘of a good crop in Egypt is all wrong, for |
Gore is a 25 per cent. shortage in the Nile |
valley.

“Where will conan got Well, to tell

the truth, I have no idea.”

“You see,” with some energy, “what
makes these fellows so mad is to have
two or three barbarians come here trom
out of the West and show them what cot-
ton is actually worth. use we are
nothing but barbarians to them. ‘There |
is gossip in the cotton market, just the |
same as in any other, and of course I
hear pretty much what is said.”

“Have you ever conducted a bigger
speculation than you did in grain?” Mr.
Patten was asked. He thought a moment.

“Well, that affair of last year attracted
the most attention,” he answered. “And
do you know why it struck people's at- |
tention so forcibly? Because it came a0 |
near their stomachs. That is the whole!
reason. They could not believe that it!
was possible.

“| think the Government ought to take
a more active interest in the conserva-
tion of the soil and its development than
in the conservation of the forests. Our |
farmers are really not as good as those |
of Europe. Our production of wheat!
to the acre is not one-half of what it is!
in England, France or Germany. Our |
farmers need to be taught, and they are |
willing to be. The A cultural Depart-
ment is doing some work, but the need |
that confronts it is great.

“The boll weevil is going to enter seri-
ously into the price of cotton before long.
Why, it is slready over a great part of
the State of Mississippi. It did not get
north of Vicksburg last year, but before
the next crop is picked it will have ex-
tended all over the State. In Louisiana |
the cotton crop is only one-eighth of what
it used to be, owing to this same boll
weevil.

 

 

 

“Will the recent decision against gthe
Standard Oil Company have any ‘ect
on thecotton situation? Not the slightest;

only it may induce some speculator in
Wall Street to sell out his cotton, Wall
Street? Humph! New York may still be
the financial centre of the country, but the
West is not so dependent on it for money
48 it used to be. In fact in the last few
weeks the West has been lending money
to New York, and the latter is just as de-
pendent upon the West as the West is
Spon it. In fact we are all part of a sys-
am

“Oh, no; | am not sore over criticisms
that are made of my predictions. I ma
be wrong, but——,” and Mr. Patten smiled
a large but enigmatic smile.

DR. WOOD I8 PONDERING.
Hasn't Made Up His Mind Abeut Paladino,
but Thinks She's a Faker.

BaLtimors, Nov. 25.-In his rooms
in the physical laboratory at the Johns
Hopkins University Prof. Robert W.
Wood spent the day digesting what he
saw in New York last Friday night when
Eusapia Paladino, the Neapolitan me-
dium, launched Dr. Wood and a amall
party of friends on a sea of psychic waves.

Dr. Wood is sceptical concerning Mme.
Paladino.

The fact that he is a member of the
committee of scientists selected to pass
on the medium's claim to genuineness
is ground for his determination to try
a number of experiments on madame.

What these experiments will be Dr.
Wood refuses to disclose. In fact he
admitted to-day that he was without a
single plausible theory as to what the
real secret of Paladino’s powers is.

Dr. Wood exposed the “N” ray theory
of five years ago as an illusion. Two
years ago he endeavored to show up
Annie Abbott, “the Georgia Magnet,”
asafake. Dr. Wood said he had no faith
in spiritualism. When asked for the
basis of his suspicion he said;

“In the first place, prior to the most

 

| violent disturbances that occur in the |

séances Mme. Paladino requests the
audience to converse, saying that the
division of thought helps the experi-
ments. Secondly, while there is plenty
of light in the room when the table rises
from the floor the room is made much
darker for the other experiments. If
her powers work in the table experi-

‘ment while there is plenty of light why |

wouldn't they work with the same amount
of lizht during the other experiments?”

“How do you account for her ability
to raise the table from the floor?” was
asked.

“That is another thing I am not pre-
pared to discuss now,” said Dr. Wood.
“The theory has been advanced that the

stunt is done by means of a number of |
| electric belts worn by the woman, but as |» s. Joseph H. Choate was amon
ithe first.

she dressed herself completely in the
presence of the wives of the men of the
party such an idea is without foundation.”

PIQUA SENDS US A SON.

Whe Stings a Taxicab Driver for $6.30
Fare.

William A. Orr, a young man from

Piqua, Ohio, landed in the West Side

 

|court yesterday after a 96.50 taxicab ride

ch he offered to settle with his last six
ta.

Orr hired the cab near Sharkey's place
in Fourteenth street late on Wednesday

whi
cen

way and Forty-eighth street He stayed
inside so long that the driver, Harry
Kelson, sent in and demanded payment.
Orr said he had no money, but could find
friends who would pay. He drove to
121 West Forty-ninth street, then back to
Sharkey’s and then to the Waldorf-
Astoria where he said he was staying.
The clerk at the Waldorf said that Orr
had registered there two days before,
but had not occupied his room.
Kelson took him to the Herald Square
baths. There they said that Orr had
visited them two nights before and that
some one else had paid his bill. Orr had
no other places where he thought he could
t money, and Kelson took him to the
yest Forty-seventh street police station
and had him locked up. He had six pen-
nies in his pocket.
The taxicab driver didn’t get home until
6 o'clock in the morning and was late in
arriving at court. In the meantime, no
