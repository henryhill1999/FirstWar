tredoction an’ Hew to Present It.

There is no very marked change of style
from ‘he engraved invitations in use last
vaar, but there are several innovations of

form in the size, text and wording, says
Vogue. which are worth noting by the
shostess Who would be ibsolutely correct

The preference tor both the Old Eng-
lis nd Colonik ext, and ulso for the

as in former seasons, ‘le Colonial having
almost altogether suprurseciod it

The place card—fer juncheons, dinners
or card parties of anv sori —may be 3%
inches long by 2', inches wide or smaller,

and preference is given to a thick bristol
board card that has a bevelled gold edge
and rounded corners. If there be a crest
er coat of arms in the family this may be
* ambossed in gold, silver or white in the
ce tre at the top of the card, the guest's

he plain eard of this sort, without.a
" s equally good form—poasibly bet-
or in America—and the same card may
tre decorated on the left side with an
Jiuzminated jong monogram in gold or
a color. But this must not be used for
anything except a luncheon or card party,
where the husbond of the hostess does
not appear. It would be entirely out of
place at a dinner

4n unusual feature in the “At Home”
card, where the hours are named from 4
to 7 o'clock, is the introduction of the
host # name, and such a card is shown; it
measures 4*%4 inches long by 2% inches
wide

Another style for an afternoon recep-

na

tion, and that most used, is engraved in| form: Miss Mary T. Blank or Mrs. James |

the English script and omits the name of
the host, but hes that of a daughter,
already socially launched, on the second
line. No numerals or abbreviations are

spelled out, and the size should be 5},
inches long by 3%, wide

In the same size, and similarly minus
the numerais,on a heavier quality of card,
may be engraved thw invitation for an

not a débutante is an ordinary visiting
ecard, 84 by 2% inches, with the address
engraved in small script in the lower
Yicht hand corner, only the house number
appearing in figures. In the left hand
corner opposite, in the same small script,
may be given the day, date and hours
(‘from 4 until 7") in three separate lines.

An excellent form for an aunt who
wishes to entertain for her young niece,
or an older sister for a younger one, where
there is no mother,\is also shown in size
5% by 3%, English seript. Individual
preference may vary the hours named,
which may be “from 5 until 7 o'clock” in-

stead of the conventional “4 to 7,” but

‘in this script even the house number |

must be fully spetied out. j

For a breakfast invitation the card may
read either “Mr. and Mrs.”—for instance |
a hunt breakfast—or may be sent out in |
only the hostess's name; that is, in instances |
where the guest list is composed of women j
exclusively. The third line should be)
left blank for the guest's name and the
text used should be the shaded Coloniz). ;
_ time is set at the hour most appropri-
me for the special occasion. The whole |
form, with the address, covers seven)
linas on a rather stiff cara & by 3 inches |
in size. i

A general utility card, which a hostess |
who entertains a t deal will find al-|
most indispensable, has a number of |
blanks to be filled in, whereby it may be,
made to serve for a luncheon, afternoon
at bridge or musicule, as she may desire. |
It may also be utilized for a dinner invi- |
tation or for an evening reception by,
adding in writing “Mr. and” before the
“Mrs.” on the p_ line. This smart, |
rather heavy card displays the shaded |
Oid English text and is 3 5 inches in
ai

\2e

Dead white cardboard is conventional! |
for all of these invitations, and where)
cream colored tinting is used it must be |
regarded as a matter of personal eccen-
tricity and preference, although the gold |
edged place card admits of rather more |
latitude in this respect and may be}
figntly creamy of tint, showing a!
smoother surface. '

Invitations for a manshould usually be |
addressed to his recidence or club, not to |
his office. An invitation for a married
woman should include the husband with
the wife, unless the entertainment is ex-
clusively for women. Even though the
husband is net known personally to the
sencer, his existence cannot be ignored.

Invitations to dinners and luncheons are |
of course not sent to persons who are in
mourning, as that would be an empty
form, but invitations to weddings, re-
reptions, &c,, must be sent as a mark of
remembrance, even when it is known that
these friends will not accept.

In general, the correct style for an ac-
ceptance may be derived from theinvita-
tion itself, as the answer is always written
o the same degree of formality. The
veet course always is to observe very care-
fully the formula of an invitation and fol-
iow it precisely in your reply.

UNEARNED INCREMENT

| The sale of Manhattan Island
IH] for $24.00 is still good enough
to point a moral and adorn a
tale.
You know, of course, what
ff unearned incrément is.
In this instance it is the dif-
if ference between $24.00 and the
|f] Present incomputable value of
Manhattan Island.
iI] You know, too, that unearned
‘if increment is created by the
community and that the pres-
|f} ent value of your property is
iff due to the fact that over
|} 3,000,000 people prefer to live,
work, pleasure and die in New

York to anywhere else.
| In other words, since 1626,
|f] millions of people have been
|f} contributing to the present
value of your property.

But if it remains undevelop-
ed, then your unearned incre-
ment is running to waste.

High rents have been created
for you; when will you improve
your property and collect them?

It is rather difficult to present in person

| Whenthe bearer of a note or card of in-

FAMOUS OLD ROADS,

 

Helped to Make History.

Of the famous old pathways whic
have played a part in the history of t
country none is more interesting than the
Santa Fé trail. Its story, so far as the}
white race is concerned, goes back to |
1540 when Francise1 Vasquez de Coronado |
led an expedition from Mexico up to what |
is now Kansas.

About fifty years later the city of Santa |
Fé was founded. Early in the nineteenth |
century American traders began finding
their way to Santa Fé and by 1824 the
first wagon trains had left Independence,
Mo. After that business along the trail
was rushing. In 1825 it was made an
authorized road by Congress. |

It began at Westport, now Kansas City.
Fort Leavenworth was established to
protect trade along this highway. In |
1907 each school child in the Sunflower |
State was asked to contribute a cent to a |

fund to buy markers for the famous old
trail and 369,166 responded.

Parallel with the Albany post road but
keeping from two to six miles east of the
Hudson is another famous old trail. It
was an Indian route, but was utilized by
Lord London in command of the British
forces.

The Nolichucky trace—in the South
trace rather than trail is the designation !
of these old path ways—led through the |
Waxhaw settlement on the Catawha/
River, the birthplace of Andrew Jackson
and James K. Polk, on “across the Blue
Wall.” Through Cumberland Gap the
road is called the Harrowgate road. It
leads on to Harrodstown in Kentucky.
Boone went, through this gap in 1769. |

Kentucky was peopled through the!
Wilderness road that went over Cumber-
land Gap by followers of Boone, and as you
ride along that road to-day you can see
how the teams of successive immigrants
have worn down the old road several feet |
below its original level. But this immi-|
gration passed over the gap, leaving it
as lonely as any other mountain pase.

No less famous is the Natchez trace, |
called by the backwoodsmen tary |
