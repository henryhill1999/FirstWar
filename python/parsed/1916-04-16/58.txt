S OF THE

AS VIEWED BY THE GREATEST CRITIC

Macaulay's Estimate of
the Poet

     

IGHEST among those who have ex-
H hibited human nature by means of
dialogue stands Shakespeare. His

variety is like the variety of nature, end-
less diversity, scarcely any monstrosity.
The characters of our own associates are

to be reckoned by scores, Yet in all these

scores hardly one character is to be found
wich deviates widely from the common

standard, and which we should call very
eccentric if we met it in real life. The
siliy notion that every man has one ruling
passion, and that this clue, once known, un-
rave’s all the mysteries of his conduct,
finds no countenance in the plays of
Shakespeare, There man appears as he is,
made up of a crowd of passions, which con-
tend for the mastery over him, and govern
him fn turn. What is Hamlet's ruling
passion? Or Ovhello's? Or Henry the
Fifth'’s? Or Wolsey’s? Or Lear's? Or
Shylock’s? Or Benedick's? Or Macbeth's?
Or that of Cassius? Or that of Falcon-
bridge? But we might go on forever.
Take a eingle example, Shylock. Is he so
eager for revenge as to be indifferent to
money? Or go bent on both together as
to Ge indifferent to the honor of his na-
tion and the law of Moses? All his pro-
pengities are mingled with each other, #0
thet in trying to apportion to each its
proper part we find the same difficulty
which constantly meets us in real life. A
superficial critic may eay that hatred is
@tytock’s ruling passion. But how many
pessiong have amalgamated to form tliat

hatred? It is partly the result of wounded
pride: Antonio has called him dog. It is
partly the result of covetousness: Antonio
has hindered him of ‘half a million; and
when Antonio is gone there will be no
limit to the gains of usury. It is partly
the insult of national and’ religious feel-
Ing: Antonio has spit on the Jewish
gabardine; and the oath of revenge lias
been sworn by the Jewish Sabbath. We
might go through all the characters which
we have mentioned and through fifty more
in the same way, for it is the constant
manner of Shakespeare to represen: the
human mind as lying not under the abso-
lute dominion of one despotic propensity
but under a mixed government, in which a
hundred powers balance each other. Ad-
mirable as he is in all parts of his art we
most admire thim for this, that while he
has left us a greater number of striking
portraits than all other dramatists put to-
gether he has scarcely left us a single
caricature.

| Bayard Taylor's Poem
ee

H*s- in his right, he stands!
No breadth of earth dividing seas
can bar
The breeze of morning, or the morning star,
From visiting our Jands:
Hie wit the breeze, his wisdom as the star,
Shone where our earliest life was set, and
blew
To freshen hope and plan
In brains American-—

To urge, resist, encourage, and subdue!
He came, a household ghost we could not
ban:

He sat. on winter nights, by cabin fires;
His simmer fairies linked their hands
\long our yellow sands;

He preached within the shadow of our
spires;

And when the certain Fate drew nigh, to
cleave

‘he tirth cord and a separate being leave,
He in our ranks of patient hearted men,
Wrought with the boundless forces of his
fame,
Victorious, and hecame
The Master of our thought, the land's first
Citizen!
Tf, here, his image seem
Of softer scenes and grayer skies to dream,
Thatched cot and rustic .avern, ivied hall,
The cuckoo's April call
And cowslip meads beside the Avon stream,
He shal! not fail that other home to find
We could not leave behind!
The Forms of Passion, which his fancy drew,
In ue their ancient likenesses beget:
) from our lives for ever born anew,
He etands amid his own creations yet!
Bere comes lean Cassius, of conventions

A hundred Hamlets,
betrayed;
And sweet Anne Page comes tripping o'er
the grass, i
And awkward Falstaff pants beneath the
shade,
Here toss upon the wanton summer wind
The locks of Rosalind;
Here some gay glove the damned epot
conceals
Which Lady Macbeth feels:
His ease here smiling smooth Iago takes,
And outcast Lear gives passage to his
‘woe,
And here some foiled reformer sadly breaks
His wand of Prospero!
In liveried splendour, side by side,
Nick Bottom and Titania ride,
And Portia, flushed with cheers of men,
Disdains dear faithful Imogen;
And Puck beside the form of Moree,
Stopes his forty minute course;
And Ariel from hie swinging bough
A blossom casts on Bryant's brow,
Until, as summoned from his brooding
brain,
He sees his children all again,
In us, as on our lips, each fresh, immortal
strain!

| Shakespeare, the Unique |

By JAMES RUSSELL LOWELL.
Orrin Shakespeare was endowed with

by their times

 

that healthy equilibrium of nature

whose point of rest was midway be-
tween the imagination and the understand.
Ing—that perfectly unrufied brain which
reflected all objects with almost inhuman
impartiality—that outlook whose range was
eclipitical, dominating all zones of human
thought and action—that power of veri-
similar conception which could take away

Richard III. from history and Ulysses from
Homer—and that creative faculty whose
equal touch is alike vivifying in Shallow
and in Lear. He alone never seeks in ab-
norma! and monstrous characters to evade
the risks and responsibilities of absolute
truthfulness nor to stimulate a jaded im-
agination by Caligulan horrors of plot. He
is never, like many of his fellow dramatists,
confronted with unnatural Frankensteins
of his own making, whom he must get off
his hands as best he may. Given a human
foible, he can incarnate it in the nothing-
ness of Slender or make it loom gigantic
through the tragic twilight of Hamlet. We
are tired of the vagueness which classes all
the Elizabethan playwrights together as
“great dramatists,” as if Shakespeare did
not differ from them in kind as wel! as in
degree. Fine poets, some of them were;
but though imagination and the power of
poetic expression are, singly, not uncom-
mon gifts, and even in combination not
without secular examples, yet it is the rar-
est of earthly phenomena to find them
Joined with those faculties of perception,
arrangement and plastic instinct in the lov-
ing union which alone makes a great dra-
matic poet possible. We suspect that Shake-
speare will long continue the only specimen
of the genus. His contemporaries in their
comedies either force what they call “a
humour" till it becomes fantastical or hunt
for jokes, like rat catchers, in the sewers of
human nature and of language. In their
tragedies they become heavy without gran-
deur, like Jonson, or mistake the stilts for
the cothurnus, as Chapman and Webster
too often do. Every new edition of an
Elizabethan dramatist ig but the putting of
another witness into the box to prove the
inaccessibility of Shakespeare's standpoint

as poet and artist.—Library of Old Authors.

661-1662. March 1st. My wife and T ty
coach, first to see my little picture
that is a-drawing, and thence to the

Opera, and there saw “Romeo and Juliet,”
the first time it was ever acted, but it isa
play of itself the worst that ever | heard,
and the worst acts that ever I saw these
people do, and I am resolved to go no more
to see the first time of acting, for they were
all of them out more or less.

1662, September 29th. To the King’s The-
atre, where we saw “Midsummer Night's
Dream,” which I had never seen before,
nor ever shall again, for it ia the most in-
sipid, ridiculous play that ever I saw in
my life,

1662. December 28th. To the Duke's
House, and there saw “Macbeth” most ex-
cellently acted, and a moat excellent play
for variety. I had sent my wife to meet
me there, who did come: so I did go to
White Hall and got my Lord Bellassis to
get me into the playhouse; and there, after
all staying above an hour for the players,
the King and all waiting, which was ab-
aurd, saw “Henry the Fifth" well done by

I democracy.
_, But to the

wind coming into my back and neck, which
did much trouble me. The play continued
till 12 at night; and then up, and a most
horrid cold night it was, and frosty, and
moonshine.

1666-67. Janudry 7th. To the Duke's
House, and saw “Macbeth,” which, though
I saw it lately, yet appears @ most ex-
cellent play in all respects, but especially in
divertisement, though it be a deep tragedy;
which is a strange perfection in a tragedy,
it being most proper here, and suitable,

1687, October 16th. To the Duke of
York's House; and I was vexed to 8e6
Young, who is but a bad actor at best, act
Macbeth, in the room of Betterton, who,
poor man! {s sick: but Lord! what a prej-
udice it wrought in me against the whole
play, and everybody else agreed in dislik-
ing thie fellow. Thence home, and there
found my wife gone hoine; because of this
fellow's acting of the part, she went out
of the house again—Diary and Corre-

Sir Walter Scott's View |

HE English stage might be considered
as equally without rule and without
model when Shakespeare arose. The

effect of the genius of an individual upon
the tase of a nation is mighty; but that
genius, in its turn, is formed according to
the opinions prevalent at the period when
it comes into existence. Such was the case
with Shakespeare. With an education
more extensive and a taste refined by the
classical models, it is probable that he also,
in admiration of the ancient drama, might
have mistaken the form for the essence,
and subscribed to those rules which had

   

produced euch masterpieces of art. For-
tunately for the full exertion of a genius
as comprehensive and versatile as intense
and powerful, Shakespeare had no access
to any models of which the commanding
merit might have controlled and limited his
own exertions, He followed the path
which a nameless crowd of obscure writers
had trodden before him; but he moved in
{t with the grace and majestic step of a
being of a superior order, and vindicated
for ever the British theatre from a_ pe-
dantic restriction to classical rule. Nothing
went before Shakespeare which in any re-
spect was fit to fix and stamp the char-
acter of a national drama; and certainiy
no one Willg succeed him, capable of ex-
tablishing by mere authority a form more
restricted than that which Shakespeare
used,

| Walt Whitman's View |

HE inward and outward characteristics
T of Shakespeare are his vast and
rich variety of persons and themes

with his wondrous delineation of each: and
all—not only limitless funds of verbal and
pictorial resource, but great excess, super-
frtation—mannerism, like a fine aristo-
cratic perfume, holding a touch of musk
(Euphues, his mark)--with boundless
sumptuousness and adornment, real velvet

 

and gems, not shoddy wor paste -but a
good deal of bombast and fustian (cer-
tainly some, terrifie mouthing in) Shake-
speare!)

Suberb and imfinitable as all is, it is
mostly an objective and physiological kind
of power and beauty the sonl finds in
Shakespeare--a style supremely grand of
the sort, but in my opimion stopping short
of the grandest sort, at any rate for ful-
filling and satisfying modern and scientine
and democratic American purposes, Think,
not of growths as forests primeval, or
Yellowstone geysers, or Colorado ravines,
but of costly marble palaces and palace
rooms and the noblest fixings and furni-
ture and noble owmers and oecupants to
correspond---think of carefully built
gardens from the beautiful but sophisti-
cated gardening art at its best, with walks
and bowers and artificial lakes and appro-
priate statue groups and the finest culti-
vated roses and lilies and japonicas in
plenty—and you have the tally of loyal
henchmen-—ll in themselves nothing
serve as capital foils to the aristocracy,
The comedies (exquisite as they certainly
are), bringing in admirably portrayed com-
mon characters, have the unmistakable hue
of plays, portraits, made for the divertise-
ment only of the elite of the castle and
from ite point of view. The comedies are
altogether non-acceptable to America and

“AN EPITAPH ON THE ADMIRABLE Dramatic

Morr, W. SHAKESPEARE,”

HAT needs my Shakespeare for his

The labour of an age in piled

‘Or that his hallow'd relics should be hid

Under a star pointing pyramid?

Dear son of Memory, great heir of Fame,

What need'st thou such weak witness of
thy name?

Thou, in our wonder and astonishment,

Hast built thyself a lifelong monument,

For whilst, to the shane of slow endeav-
ouring art, :

Toy cast numbers flow; and that each

heart

Hath, from the leaves of thy unvalued
book,

Those Delphic lines with deep impression
took;

Then thou, our fancy of itself bereaving,

Dost make us marble with too much con-
ceiving;

And, ao eepulchr’d, in such pomp dost Ife,

That kings, for such a tomd should wish
to die.

“TO THE MEMORY OF MY BELOVED, THE AUTHOR,
MR, WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE: AND WHAT
HE HATH LEFT Us."

O draw no envy, Shakespeare, on thy
name,
Am I thus ample to thy book, and
fame:
While T confess thy writings to be such,
As neither man, nor muse, can praise tov

much,

‘Tis true, and all men’s suffrage, But these
“ways

Were not the paths 1 meant unto thy

praise;
For aeeliest Ignorance on these may light,
Which, when it sounds at best, but echoes

right;

Or blind Affection, which doth ne'er ad-
vance

The truth, but gropes. and ureeth all by
chance;

Or crafty Malice, might pretend this praise,

And think to ruin, where it seem'd to
raise * * ©

But thou are proof against them, and in
deed

Above th’ ill fortune of them, or the need.

I, therefore, will begin. Soul of the age!

The applause! delight! the wonder of our
atage!

My Shakespeare, rise; I will not lodge thee
b

Chavet, or Spenser, or bid Beaumont lie

A little further to make thee # room:

Thou are @ Monument, without a tomb,

And art alive still, while thy book doth live,

And we have wits to read, and praise to
give.

Tha. I not mix thee ao, my brain excuses;

I meat with great, but disproportion’d
Muses:

For, if I thought my fidememt were of
years,

—SSSS=>E=S>>=

I should commit thee surely with thy
peers,

And tell how far thou Mdet our Laty out-
shine,

Or eporting K14, or Marlowe's mighty fine.

And though thou hadst small Latin, and
lese Greek,

From thence to honor thee, I would not

eeek
For names; but call ferth thund'ring
#schylus,

Euripides, and Sophocles to us,

Paccuvius, Accii& him of Cordova dead,

To life again, to hear thy buskin tread,

And shako a stage: or, when thy socks
were on,

Leave thee alone, for the comparison

Of all that insolent Greece or haughty
Fome

Sent forth. or since did from their ashes
come.

Triumph, my
show,

To whom 41! scenes of Furape homage owe,

He was not of an age, but for all time

And all the Muses still were in their prime,

When like Apollo he came forth to warm

Our ears, or like a Mercury to charm!

Nature herself was proud of his designs

And joy'd to wear the dressing of his lines’

Which were so richly spun, and woven so
fit,

As, since, she will vouchsafe no other wit.

The merry Greek, tart Aristophanes

Neat Terence, witty Fiautus, now
please;

But antiquated and deserted lie

As they were not of Nature's family

Rritain, thou has one to

ror

Yet must I not give Nature all: the Art,

My gentle Shakespeare, must enioyv a part,

For though the Poet's matter” Nature be,

His Art doth give the fashion, And, that he,

Who casts to write a living line, must
sweat

(Such as thine are), and strike the second
heat

Upon the Muse's anvil: turn the same

(And himself in it) that he thinks to frame;

Or for the laurel, he may gain a scorn,

For a good Poet's made, as well as born.

And such were thou, Look how the father’s
face

Lives in his issue, even so, the race

Of Shakespeare's mind and manners
brightly shines

In his well turned and true-filed lines:

In each of which he seems to shake @
lance,

As brandish’d at the eves of Ignorance.

Sweet Swan of Avon! what a sight & were

To see thee in our waters yet to appear

An4@ make those filghts upon the banks og
Thames,

That so did take Eliza, and our James?

But stay, I see thee in the hemisphere
