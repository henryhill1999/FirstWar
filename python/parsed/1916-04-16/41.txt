An Original Proposition at
Bridge in Which Aces Don't
Take Tricks.

 

 

PUZZLERS AT CH ECKERS|

Bridge problem No, 378, by S.C. Kin-
sey, was based upon the rather original
proposition that the players on one side
were to get the required number of
tricks without any of the three aces in
Play taking a trick, unless thelr oppo-
nents gave them these ace tricks.

The curious thing about the problem
fa that if it were not for thie restriction
it would have at least three solutions.
As it is there fs only one that is sound,
and only one way that the condition can
be complied with.

Clubs are trumps and Z is in the lead.

and Z want seven tricks, and they
agree to take those seven tricks without
using an ace, unless A and B give them
to them.

The solution is for Z to lead the jack
6f spades, which Y wins and leads the
@even of trumps. It does not matter
whether B covers the trump lead or not,
as Z must win the second round of
trumps in-elther case.

As A's remaining spade is of no use
to him he will probably discard !t on the
second trump lead. When Z leads the
three of spades so as to put Y back into
the lead A is face to face with the prin-
cipal condition of the solution of the
problem.

If A discards a diamond Y will at
@nce throw him into the lead with a
heart, upon which Z will discard his
emall diamond. Now A must give Z
two tricks with the two aces. In arder
to prevent this A discards the ace of
hearts on the spade kad.

This turns the attention to B's hand,
and Y leads the nine of hearts. If B re-
fuses to win it Y will go right along
with the six, which B must win, or he
allows Y to make the king and solve
the problem at once.

While this play in the heart sult ‘{s
going on between Y and B it is evident
that Z has to throw away both his aces
and the queen of diamonds, so that no
ace at the table ever takes a trick.

Correct solutions from:

Only four persons solved this problem:
J. C. Hume, W. P. W., Henry Andresen
and Roscoe C. Harris. A!! others failed
through not complying with the terms,
as they made Z deliberately lead an ace
and take a trick with it, when there were
still three other cards in his hand to
lead that were not aces.

It was rather a difficult matter to
etate the conditions clearly without dis-
closing the key to the solution, which
would have made it no prob!em at all.
The composer twice revised his statement
of the condition before the problem
finally appeared.

The first idea was to say that Y and
Z were not to win a trick with an ace,
unless the trick were forced upon them;
but as A was the only player who couid
do this, and the only card he could get
in with was the ace of heart, any one
could have guessed the solution at a
om and there would be nothing to
t

Se ee EEE

i

It was clearly stated that no ace was
to win a trick unless A-or B gave it
to them. This does not mean that if Z
tried to win a trick with an ace and
they could trump it that they must do
eo, Giving a player a trick that he
could not otherwise have made (by
leading right up to that suit) is one
thing. Allowing him to win tricks when
he is In the lead is quite another thing.

Those who tried to solve the problem
by leading a small spade, won by Y with
the king, and returning a small heart for
Z to trump cannot be credited with cor.
rect’ solutions, because after Z% leads the
lop trump he must follow with the ace |
of diamonds, when he is not forced to
do so at all. If B refuses to trump it,
the ace wins.

This {s a violation of the terms of
the problem, as B does not give him the
trick; Z takes it. Z could have led three
other cards that were not aces,

In the correct solution, on the other
hand, if A keeps the ace of hearts Z%
1s forced to make tricks with his aces
by A's play, because he cannot get rid
of the lead, and must make his aces in
epite of himself. Two of those who sent
in correct solutions noted this point.

Here ts something from a composer
who never falls to please and who has
Given the cracks some of the hardest
Propositions imaginable for seven or
eight cards. In this one he has added
an extra card just to complicate things
a dit.

CHECKER ENDINGS,

Problem No, 373, which was sent to
THe Sun by A. J. McArt, was not par-
ticlarly difficult after the key move
had been found, but as that move was
rather an unusual way to start a prob-
lem a good many missed it and could
not find any way of getting the win.

This ia not astonishing if we consider
that it is not often that a player can
finish up a game with a win to his
credit when he has only one king left
and his opponent has two kings and
three men still on the board.

The distribution of the pieces
Black meg on 8, 20, 26 and 27; kings

Here is something much easier than
any of the problems presented lately,
as it is intended to give solvers a little
more time to study out the intricacies
of No. 874, which will probably keep
them busy for a few days if one may
judge by the way the solutions are drib-
bling in,

For the Information of those who are
in doubt about the terms of the prob-
lem {t should be explained that while
the solution of No. 368 was given on
March 12, the majority of those who
have held a place on the honor list are
of opinion that black did not play his
best and that It could have been made
a drawn game from the situation shown
in No, 374. Tt is now un to them to
show how, and THe Sun will show that
it is a win for white against any move
that black can make, or else there will
be several names added to the list of

those entitled to white cards,

answers to problems must reach the of-
fice of THE Sun not later than the

THE SILVER SHEET.

Here is a little puzzle suggested by
Frank 8S. Busser of Germantowm Pa.,
which has some very original elements
in it:

A certain metal worker had a sheet
of silver exactly six and a half feet
square and very thin. Out of this piece
of metal he was ordered to construct two
triangular trays, each having just
enough raised border around it to keep
things from rolling off. After some talk-
ing over the matter he agreed to the
following conditions:

Thin sheet of
Silver

— 64 feet —- —~—

 

The sheet of silver was to be subd.-
vided in such a way as to form fro:
the pieces two equal triangles and leav:«
just enough material over to form a hor-
der around each of the triangles 1-14ih
of an tneh in height,

The triangles to be scalene, no two
of their sides being equal, although each
triangle is equal to the other, and the
peculiarity of each triangle is that ite
area is to be expressed in non-fractional
feet units, while the total length of its
three sides is expressed in the same
number of units as the area.

How ts the sheet to be divided and
what are the dimensions of the triangles?

ROUTE OF THE RINGERS.

MPLOYEES of the subway, the
EF, elevated lines and the ferries
note the disappearance of the
ringers with the passing of very cold
weather, What are ringers? They
are the human derelicts who haven't
heen able to beg the price of a bed
during the day and who spend their
last few cents for transportation that
is to last them the night.

It is easier on the subway for the
ringers than any of the other trans-
portation routes. A man can board a
train at the Brooklyn Bridge station
after the express trains stop running
and can ride and doze about eleven

miles to, say, 181st street on the
Broadway line. There he can alight
and crossing the platform. catch a

down train,

He can ride south to Brooklyn
Bridge again or over to some island
station in Brooklyn, There he can
cross the station platform again and
start off north again, this time select-
ing a Bronx Park train at Brooklyn
Bridge.

Ten miles or more he travels to an-
other isiand station platform and then
back. He !s warm and fairly com-
fortable. During the night he travels
perhaps elghty or 100 miles, We will
not ride to a terminal station because
the employees may hustle him off the
platform to buy another ticket. This
is against his principles as well as be-
yond his power.

The same ringer programme can be
carried out on the elevated lines, al-
though the conditions are not go
favorable as in the case of the subway.
On the ferries it is harder still, al-
though it can and is done. From
Cuortiandt atreet to Weehawken 1a the
favorite ferry line for the singer.

AT ROYAL AUCTION?

Attempts to Arrive at the
Comparative Value of Play
and Bidding.

 

 

MISTAKES AS A FACTOR

 

Some recent attempts to arrive at the |

comparative value of bidding and play

at auction have led to the discovery that |
any opinion based on an examination of |
the results at duplicate must be incon- |
clusive owing to the interference of the)

ecores in the honor column, especially
the 125 added for a game won, which
gives one trick an entirely artificial
value,

There also remains the eternal ques. ,

tion, Was {t the good play or sound bid-
ding of one side or the errors of the
opponents that made the difference in
the final acores? In a duplicate game
of nine tables, playing twenty-seven
deals, there were only six in which the
hand was played on the same declara-
tion, comparing the record kept by a N
and S pair sitting still and an E and W
pair going round the room. It was two
hearts at one table, three clubs at an-
other; no trump at one table, four
spades at another and #0 on,

One of the most confusing things In
trying to estimate the value of good
bidding as compared with good play is
the effect that stop*ing just short of
game or going game has on the total
s¢ore. In some cases a good player will
get the game by superior skill, in others
he gets it only through some error of
his opponente. Take this hand, upon
which only one pair goes game:

At one table Z passed without a bid,|i,aq, and instead of laying down the
| king of clubs to show the two tricks

although he has a very fair no trumper.
When Z passed, A bid the no trumps and
B took him out with two spades, which
held.

Not knowing anything about his part-
ner’s suit, Z led a small heart, with the
result that it was the only opening which
would allow B to go game on the hand,
as he won Y's six with the singleton
queen,

Rut the opening {fs not all of it. B
must play the hand well to take advan-
tage of his opportunity. The beginner
would probably rush off to get out the
trumps and then try to establish the dia-
monds, but B leads only one round of
trumps, putting dummy in with the ace,
‘Then he leads the ace of hearts and dis-
cards a losing club. The rest is easy,
as two more rounds of trumps clear up
everything.

This gives B 36 4125—18--148 on the
hand, At other tables all they make is
9 points because they cannot possibly win
the game, and there are 18 points to be
deducted from their 27.

When Z starts with no trump, as he
undoubtedly should do, A doubles and
Y anticipates the take out by showing
the clubs. When B goes two spades, Z
knows what to lead, and the queen of
hearts never makes, so that B never
gets the club discard. Two clubs, ace
of diamonds and a trump save the game.

In comparing the value of bidding and
play, to which account are we to charge
this difference of 134 points? Shall we
call it A’a bad double, which allows Y
to show the clubs and forces B to bid
spatles; two things that would never
have happened if A passed?

At two tables A passed when Z bid
no trumps, and A led a diamond, setting
the contract for 50 points, aces easy,
is A or B must get In on anything after
Y has made his five club tricks, At
most of the tables at which Z had to
lead in the dark he started with two
diamonds, so as to avoid leading away
from suits headed by single honors
that are not the ace.

Here is another hand tn which the
lead gives the declarer a chance
he could never have made for him-

was left with it. Instead of opening with
lis four card club suit, Y led the ten

king, concealing the jack, and led th
trump, the finesse of the queen gettiny
two rounds and dropping the king

Instexd of trying to put himself in
on anything, so as to catch Z's las:
trump, which would have been the be-
ginner’s idea of the hand, A leads the
top diamond from dummy, picking up his
own jack, and follows with another win-
ning diamond, on which he discards the
king of clubs,

Then he trumps a club, picks up Z's
trump and loses one trick to the ace of
hearts at the end, By securing the lit-
tle slam A makes 59 points more than
any other pair in the reom. Shall we
credit this to good play or to Y's error
in the opening lead?

This is an easy game hand at spades,
no matter what Is opened or what 7
leads next; but at one table, for some
reason or other, B took his partner out
of the spade with no trumps, and got
himself into a mess over that diamond
sult,

Z led the elght of diamonds and
dummy won the trick with the jack. Two
rounds of spades followed, and then
dummy got in with the king of dia-
monds to make four more spades.

This forced B to keep two hearts, so
that he could get back to make the ace
and queen of diamonds, so he had to
take a chance and blank the club jack.
When A led the heart king, eo as to
clear the way for the jack, Y jumped

This deal was played at nine tables
and some got the declaration at hearts,
while others got it at spades, the bids
usually going up to three or four at each
table. The inetructive play is A's going
game in spades, after bidding four over
Z's four hearts.

Y led his partner's declared sult,
hearts, and Z went back with a club, on
which A played the ace. The jack of
trumps went to Z's ace and he led an-
other club, which A won with the kine,
the queen of trumps exhausting Y and Z.

The beginner would probably start in
to ruff dummy with the hearts at this
stage, but this will leave A with a losing
heart at the end. Instead of that A sees
chat there are two chances to go game.
He may be able to set up a diamond
trick and get a heart discard or he may
force Z to lead the ace of hearts and
make the queen good.

When A led the diamond Y¥ had so many
that he felt sure A's lead was a shri
sult, and probably an attempt to make
both queen and ace, so he put on the
king. A club put dummy in. A smali
diamond from B's hand forced the ace
from Z and then it did not matter what
Z led, as dummy could ruff two hearts
and give A a heart discard on the queen
of diamonds.

Strange to say the player at one table
that was left ut four hearts managed to
go game at that declaration, through the
errors of his opponents. It was A's

4

that hia bidding did not show,
started eight in with the spades.

Z won the trick and led a small trump,
which A passed up, allowing the ten to
win. Two more rounds of trumps left A
with the lone queen, B keeping all his
diamonds against dummy's long suit,
discarding a spade end a club.

When Z led the ace and ten of dia-
monds A refused to ruff, discarding the
amall club. When dummy won the sec-
ond diamond trick with the king and
came back with the jack B did not cover,
as he knew Z would trump, but this
gave Z a discard of his small spade.
After that all A could make was his
trump and his two clubs, as Z's ten
and jack of clubs must be good for
tricks by ruffing other suits and lead-
ing clubs.

To what shall we attribute the 18
points made on this han@? To Z's cour-
age in going to four hearta and fright-
ening A out of four spades, or to the
errors made by A and in play?

Here ig a hand that will give the be-
ginner some idea of the way in which
crack players bid up their hands to the
limit, and incidentally how they use the
modern system of doubling to encourage
the partner to go on bidding:

Here is the bidding at one table.
Z starts with no trusrp and A says
four hearts. He figures on losing two
clubs and a epade, even if his partner
has not a trick in his hand. These two
sulters are very strong. When it got
round to Z he bid four spades. This
A passed. So did ¥ of course.

The only way that B can show his
partner that he has one sure trick, and
that it is in the opponentis suit, !< to
double four spades. A did not leave
this double in, of course, but went ty
five hearts. Y 4id not like to bid five
spades, as he had too many losing hearts,
but Z doubled,

The beginner’s attention ia called to
the manner !n which A made his con-
tract against Z's tremendous hand. Y
led a spade and dummy put on the
ice. A overtook the ten of hearts with
the jack and led five rounds of trumps,
jeaving himself with only two emall
ones.

What is Z to Mscard?

Long before Y had to discard at all
% had let go one of each ault. When
Y discarded the eight of diamonds on
the fifth round of trumps Z let go a
spade. A now leads ace and another
club, trumps whatever Z leads and gives
him another club trick, Those two
clubs are all Y and Z can make.

Five hearts doubled, with nine honors
ind a fulfilled contract, gives A 804
72460+4125—327 points. But now look
at how easy it is to play this hand
badly, to say nothing of failing to bid
it up to its full value. The greatest

recor made was when A_ showed his
supporting sult after bidding only two
hearts over Z's no trump.

When Z bid two spades A bid three
clubs, for which there !s no excuse.
Y helped his partner's spades. B went
to four hearts, which Z doubled. Now
it has been shown that A can make
five odd by getting a club discard. He
can get four odd without forcing any-
thing, yet at this table he is set, getting
three only.

Y fed the spade and the ace went up.
A then led the ten of hearts fram
dummy, but instead of overtaking it
he let it win, thinking he could put
himself in with the ace of clubs and
catch all the trumps, even if Z had
five. When he saw that Z had only
four, as Y followed sult, it was too late
to overtake the ten.

¥ trumped the ace of clubs, and then
it was easy for Z to hold on to his
three good clubs, as he had played
the small one on dummy’e lead, know-
ing very well that A dare not play
anything but the ace. This left A
with @ balance of 28 minus on the
hand, instead of which he might have
made 377, as his contract was .@e less
than the five odd he could have nwde.

Here is a deal in which there was a
double chance to go game, and the
player arranges matters so that if one
fails he will try the other, The student
of tactics will find this an instructive
hand in several ways.

reason or other, Z did not bid the spades,
and the bid wae up to B, fourth
hand, who wasted no time in declaring
four hearts,

Z% led the spade king, which B
trumped. He took no chances on
finesse, but led his trumps right out,
ace first, letting Y make hie king. B
trumped Y's spade lead and ploked up
the rest of the trumps. Now comes the
pretty part of the play,

B leads the king of diamonds, and of
course Y refuses to play the ace, as that
would clear wp the whole suit for the
dummy, if B can lead it again and
finesses the ten. B expected this holdup
on the part of elther Y or Z, so he goes
on with the jack, and when Z passes he
overtakes the jack with the queen, to
make it appear as if he had no more
diamonds to lead.

If Y is observant of the small cards
and marks hie partner's eight, he will
know the seven must be with B and will
pass again. B is prepared for this, and
has made up his mind that if dummy is
allowed to hold the second diamond trick
with the queen he will risk the club
finesse.

But Y 414 not go as deeply into the
epots on the cards as thet and played
the ace, so that B did not need the club
finesse, as he could discard it on the six
of diamonds, after putting dummy in
with the ten.

 

MAKING THE CHECK GOOD.

E was in high spirita as he
atrolled whistling down Cen-
tral Park West.

It was spring; his health was good,
the sun was shining brightly, the birds
in the park were twittering merrily,
and in a poker session the night before
he had won $276, of which $76 was in
cash. In an inside pockct a check for
$200, the balance of his winnings,
nestled against his heart. .

It was great to be alive anyway, and
wasn’t it fine that he had yielded to his
wife's pleas to be allowed to buy those
spring clothes! The bills for the
clothes had been coming in for a week
now and had worried him somewhat,
but now, with $276 he Had not ex-
pected to get and the money he al-
ready had, he would be able to pay
them without difficulty. His wife de-
served all the spring clothes he could
buy her. But wasn't it lucky that he |
had drawn that fourth jack against
that ace full the night hefore? ‘

He reached the bank on which the
$200 check had been drawn and
blithely swung through the doors, in-
dorsed the paper and presented it at
the paying teller's window.

There was a pause while the teller
got busy with his books. In a moment
he wae back at the window:

, “Insufficient funds,” he sald.

The sun was obscured behind black
clouds, the birds in the park were
squawking horribly, foigotten pains
began to remind our hero of their
existence.

If the maker of the check was the
kind of man who would give an N. G.
check to pay a poker loss, he was
surely not the kind of man who would
make good later thought the holder of
the worthless paper. Then he had an
idea. He asked the teller how much
the check’s maker had on deposit, but
the teller refused to inform him; say-
ing it was against the rules.

Over on @ park bei.ch our hero
pondered his problem. At length he
reached a solution,

The check's maker was in the the-
atrical business, Our hero visited a
press agent of his acquaintance and
got a couple of complimentary tickets.
Then he visited the bank again. From
the special guard he !earned the pay-
ing teller'’s name.

Then he wrote a note to the paying
teller, enclosing the theatre tickets, and
to it he signed the name of the maker
of the check. He sent the note and
tickets by especial messenger to the
teller.

Then after waiting half an hour he
called up the bank and asked to talk
to the teller. When he was connected
he gave the name cf the maker of
the check, talked pleasantly for a mo-
ment about the theatre tickets he had
just @ent, and then asked how large
his balance was,

The teller, glad to do the favor to
one who had just sent him two theatre
tickets, answered,

“One hundred and forty-three do!-
lars,” he said.

Our hero after a comment or two
hung up the receiver and walked
straight around to the bank.

Here he questioned the receiving
teller to make sure there would be
no slip in his plan.

“Can I deposit money to amother |
man's account?” he asked.

“Certainly,” eald the receiving teller.
“We're alwaya glad to get money from |
everybody.” |

Our hero then made out a deposit |
slip for $60, under the name of the}
maker of the check, and shoved the |
slip and $60 through the receiving |
teller’s window. |

Then he waiked to the paying teller
with his $200 check.

“I'd like cash for this,” he said.

The paying teller looked at the check
and repeated his “ineufficient funds,”
but our hero said loftily:

“Pardon, but a deposit which makes
the check good was just received.”

The paying teller looked it up and
found this to be correct, so there was
nothing left for him to do but pay out
the money. At a cost of $60 our hero
had made a bad check for $200 good.

Again was the sun shining and again
were the birds twittering.

CRUELTY TO CHICKENS AND
MEN.

|
OMMISSIONER HARTIGAN of
C the city Bureau of Weights and
Measures has been fighting for
fourteen months to get the Federal
Government to investigate the inter-
state poultry trade. Most of the
chickens eaten in New York come
from the middle West and about half,
those for the kosher trade, are brought
in alive, They are transported in spe-
clally prepared poultry cars with tlers
of crates, 4,000 chickens to a car.

These chickens are sold by the
pound, When the farmer turns them
over to the shipper he wants the max!-
mum weight of course, Sometimes he
will give them a mixture of grain and
water that makes a paste which sticks |
in the crop for twenty-four hours and |
adds a false six or seven ounces to
their weight,

The shipper sends a man with each
ear. He in turn has his instructions
to starve the birds two days before they
reach their destination and then to
give them plenty of the “paste.” The
commission merchant ts forced to em-
ploy the same methods, Result, when
the chicken eventually reaches the)
consumer it has ruined its digestion |
and perhaps !s in a condition to ruin!
the digestion of whoever makes a meal! |
of it.

Mr, Hartigan wants the Government |
to have inspectors board all New York
bound trains carrying poultry at
Philadelphia or Albany and examine
each fowl to prevent this practice,

 

O*s: it wae the custom of the

Broadway umbrella sellers, the

transient species, to pick out
busy spots along that thoroughfare
and offer their wares to the public at
60 cents each. Foggy and rainy days
and nights were the occasions when
the umbrella sellere made their ap-
pearance. They seemed to spring from
the ground as if by magic and worked
diligently to dispose of their wares, at
the same time keeping an eye open for
policemen.

The reason why the presence of a
policeman was not especially desired
b.: tl.om was the fact that the umbrella
sellers cannot procure licenses to
carry on the business of protecting
from the wet those who are too proud
to take umbrellas with them from
home on a threatening day and they
have to conduct their business with-
out lawful permission. Consequently
they are in constant danger of being
arrested. What the umbrella sellers
suffered more or less from the activi-
ties of the police used to be shown by
the large number of prisoners brought
into the West Forty-seventh street
station on foggy and rainy nights, just
when the business was beginning to
thrive.

However, the clever ones in the
ranks of the umbrella sellers quickly
formulated a echeme to circumvent the
police. They employed, the same
scheme used by ticket speculators to
outwit the police, namely, hiring a
convenient store to serve as the depot
for umbrellas.

But the umbrella sellers have also
{mproved their method of selling as
well, in fact, the modern method !s so
good that the police are finding it im-
possible to detect offenders. The
dealer no longer carries a bundle of
umbrellas as a sign of the business
he is engaged in. Here's the way the
up to date umbrella sellers work their
scheme: a

A group of them hire a store from
which they operate. A stock of um-
brellas is kept on hand so that the
sellers’ supply can be replenished
whenever necessary. But the sellers
no longer carry the umbrellas in bun-
dies. Each carries a single umbrella
and mingles with the crowd on Broad-
way, offering his umbrella to any one
who is not supplied and who appears
as if he would like to buy one.

The umbrellas offered for sale to the
Broadway crowds are more elaborate
than those formerly peddled by the
sellers using the old methods. The
new umbrellas have fancy handles,
with metal trimmings here and there
to attract the eye. The material used
to cover the frame is of a better grade
than that formerly used. With these
advantages to ald him the modern
seller enjoys more prosperity than did
his predecessor.

Just one more detail of the scheme
to show where the supply depot comes
{:. Obviously it wouldn't profit.a seller
to be satisfied to sell one umbrella a
night and then quit, and yet !f he car-
ried a bundle of them he would be
prey for the police, Bo the up to date
seller as soon as he has disposed of
the umbrella in hand makes his way
back to the depot as quickly as pos-
sible and gets another umbrella. He
promenades up and down, soliciting
customers here and there, until he has
disposed of the second umbrella.
