The Devon Dog Show Association has
been following an unusual plan in order
to wet judges for its annual show, which
takes place at Devon, Pa, May 20. Thi
year all of the judges for this show will)

out to a marked degree and by con-

entirely of women and it will be Inter- |

ment, Suffice to say that all of thore:

named on the judging list are exhibitors
of standing and there can he no doubt
but that they all have qualifications
