Mr. Bensley in the character of Jago in “Othello.”

By GEORGE C. D. ODELL,

Professor of English, Columbia Uni-
versity.

NE who studies theatrical prints of
the eighteenth century in England
will from the first be perplexed by
seeming inconsistencies in the ac-

ors’ dressing of Shakespeare. Why should
Richard JIT. and Falstaty, for instance, be
trrayed with something at least approxi-
mating historical accuracy, and Macbeth
tnd Hamlet garb themselves like gentie-
men of the time of George IIL? Why
should Coriolanus appear in what the
slayer assumed to be Roman habilitnents
ind Italian men and women of the vague
ho chronology of Romeo and Juliet. or
Renedick and Beatrice appear as gounc
ladies and gentlemen decked out for a
tout at Hampton Court? And why should
Rosalind, in the forest of Arden, sport a
powdered wig that any fop about town
might have envied? These are difficult
problems.

T believe the clue to the mystery may

be found in an examination of Rowe's
Bhakespeare, published in 1709 This, the
sariiest complete issue of the poet

efter the folios and possessing immense
value as the first attempt at editing
him, has special significance for our in-
quiry fn the fact that each play is pre-
ceded by a line engravinw representing a
Vital scene in the action. These pictures—-
vharming in themselves—-show exactly the
same inconsistencies of dressing as do the
portraits of actors from that time to the
end of the century.

Tt f@ perfectly clear from an examina-
tion of the plates in Rowe that in the
English historical dramus the artist ae-
sorded something like accurate costume to

tike Londoners of 1709; not knowing pre-
tisely how to represent them, le took the
vasiest way and made them twin brothers
to the man he saw in the street.

“The Winter's Tale” and “A Midsummer
Night’s Dream,” being vaguely Greek in
locale, occupy a middle ground and are
gressed in a semi-classical manner: in the

perplexing problem. Probably both are

of his career only one suit (of modern cut)
ad any part he might be called on to per-
orm.

The actresees always Gressedf exactly as
they pleased, regardless of chronology or
expense. WLekain and Mile. Clairon, from
1755 on, were influential in bringing his-
torical accuracy of costume on the stage.
But even then the women of the company
reluctantly gave up the fashionable hoop
and pannier (worn for any heroine) and
both men and women clung aa long as pos-
sible to the huge plumed headgear asso-
ciated with tragic characters of either sex.

The panniers of the tragedy queens of
France were duplicated for a good part of
the elg@hteenth century in England. Over
an enormous hoop was worn a gorgeous
embroidered petticoat, draped and hung
with various festoonings of other material,
fringed with gold and extending the form
to a colossal circumambiency; the little
human bust emerging from this billowy
mass Was usually clad in the waist mode
of the day. But the coiffure! towering al-
titudes of hair drawn over a frame were
surmounted by a coronet and a nest of os-
trich plumes soaring almost two feet above
the actress's face,

This feathery adornment was worn also
by actors in the parts of Greek and Roman
heroes. It will be observed in the pore
trait of Quin as Coriolanus, but to get it
and its accompanying male dress of
“classical” fashion I would refer to @ well
known portrait of William Smith as Alex-
ander in Nat Lee's the “Rival Queens.”
This is the “Gentleman” Smith who created
Charles Surface in the “School for Scan-

1" in 1777, and nothing could be more

 

dal
grotesque than his jdea of a Grecian tragic
hero, With his scalloped, panniered skirt,
luis buskins and his huge feathers he is
more like an Amazon of the “Black Crook”
period

Fortunately for my peace of mind I have
seen no likeness of actors In Shakespeariag
“olassical" roles arrayed so preposterously
Qluin’s Coriolanus is a monster from
which alone we must imagine a whole
school, and at that it probably represents
not Slakespeure’s mighty Roman but the
tamer hero of a tragedy by James Thom-
son, the author of “The Seasons,” in pious
tnemory of Whom Quin produced the play

of life itself, transparent and _ brittle--if
ene can use such words of such a thing--
rut unconquerable, because it must needs
die down in darkness before it can know
defeat. It is above al) an attitude which
hag learned the wisdom of resignation; a
wisdom that does not necessarily render
us passive or inert, but which saves us
from the vain and useless waste of energy
entailed in the effort to change what lam-
entable experience has taught us can
never be changed.

It is perhaps for this very Tfeason an
uttitude much more friendly to persons,
to tndividuals—-with all their heart break-
ing and seductive weaknesses thick upon
them--than to principles or convictions or
what are culled ideals. To these latter
evocations of human folly the Shake-
Speurian attitude Is touched--why should
we not confess it’--with a certain quiet
unmistukable vein of mischievous deviltry.
And yet- for they are so lovely and touch-
ne in their ardor---who could treat the
ideals of youth, especially the ideals of
love impassioned youth, with more delicate
tenderness than Shakespeare?

It is # Very singular thing, and one
well worth noting, that in hig attitude
toward women und girls Shakespeare is
more reverential and mare chivalrously
considerate than any writer who has ever
lived. And yet it is not that he idealizes
them in the foolish, insulting manner of
ordinary erotic minded men, In some
strange way he seems consclous when he
approaches them of the presence of some-
thing mysteriously near to the deepest

crete of the universe

He does not rend and tear at their
psychological frailties in the manner of a
Balzac. He does not patronize them or
seald them in the manner of « Meredith.
He does not exhibit them in their tumultu-
ous and desperate moods of abandonment
us does Dostolevaky, It is rather as if he
eame to them gently and gravely and very
quietly; almost as if he would apprehend
the magical secret’ of thelr existence by
catching them asleep, or, at any rate, as
they are in their unguarded, unperturbed
moments, when they are alone, or alone
with some girl friend.

Turgenieff has something of this Bhake-
spearian delicacy and reverence in regard
to women, but with him it {s often spofied

im 1749. I hope the observer of the por-
trait will not mins the armchair in Corio-
lanus’s tent; Doran telis us that Quin as
Falstaff in “Henry IV." when wearted from
fighting sank down on the battlefield to
moralise and would repose not on a stump
but or a@ red velvet armchair with blue
fringe conveniently placed there to re-
ceive his bulky form!

In all matters discussed above conjecture
must not be pushed too far; at best we can
arrive at little more than probability. The
small number of prints of the earlier actors
in costume also balks inquiry. Undoubt-
edly practice varied from decade to decade,
and ..0ot much could be expected in any
case Of an age with So little facility for

producing stage effect and with eo littie
tradition behind it.

That all classic plays, for instance, were
not acted in classic dress is proved by the
fact that Barton Booth, Addison's great
Cato, wore, at the premiere in 1713, a full
wig and @ flowered gown. No doubt, tf
Cato had been called to the fleld of battle
he would have donmed the costume @ la
Romaine; but tn any case we see from
Booth's attire how easily an audience ac-
cepts and abides by the theatrical conven-
tion of its own time.

The plates in the Rowe Shakespeare

fronts the student of the English stage of
Garrick’s time. In these flustrations cere

by a certuin irritating and self-conscious
sentimentality, Ulinost ax if, like some el-
derly beau, he were himself “in love’? with
the little darlings. There is also a tendency
in Turgenieff—-and tt is a peculiarly annoy-
Ing one-—to emphasize the innocence and
purity of his young heroines, There is
absolutely nothing of this in Shakespeare
indeed, he is so free from it that there
have been found commentators heavy
handed and clumsy enough fur
as to call attention to the unmaidenly *'for-
wardness” of some of the Shakespearian
virgins.

May one be allowed to hazard the suxg-
gestion that what our greatest poet really
feels most conscious of in the company of
women and girls is their usteounding ab
sence of pedantry; that magical nearness
to Nature herself, which gives to every
one of their unexpected caprices the mys-
tery of deep clear water or the depths of

palpable fact, witnessed to by all the poets
of real clairvoyance from Catullus down
to Thomas Hardy.

In answer to the question which after
these 300 years we tind ourselves still ask-
ing--the question, namely, as tou where er-
actly lies the extraordinary appeul of Shake-
speare’s pluys---we seem led to discuss jt in
the manner in which he hits the precise
mark so hard, so almost impossible an
achievement, in all those recurrent crises
of human feeling which the drama of life
evokes, And yet when one has suid “He
hits the mark” one has after all said very
little, for the ultimate, the residual charm
of the Shakespearian touch lies not so
much in “hitting the mark” as in doing xo,
ut least in his great scenes, with an im-
aginative felicity und absuluteness that
seem to cover in some indescribable kind
of way more ground than the tnere revela-
tion of @ particular human mood.

It {ja ag though the very benuty, so baf-
fling to logical anulysis, of the words he
uses conjures up vistas und horizons of re-
moter, less palpable associations than the
mere stress of the tragic or comic occasion,
such as it may be, is able in itself to evoke.

tain strongly individualized characters like
Shylock, Malvolio and Falstaff have indi-
vidualized costumes, though the characters
about them appear in ordinary Queen Anne
dress. This strikes one as very curious;
in the 1714 nine volume Shakespeare these
same characters, as well ag Othello, are
even more sharply set off from the rest.

Now years after, a dmwing quite In the

The Falstaff wears a duplicate of the
dress sported by Quin in the beautiful
mezzotint of him in the character and may
be “faked up” from it; but all the other
people in the sketch—except Quickly—
might have stepped from the “Rake's
