ject is robbed of much of ita difficulty.
The first lecture in the series was |
largely preparatory for those that are |
to follow. Certain principles of Buc- |
ahism, so necessary to the compre: |
hension of Chinese art, were touched |
upon, and references were made to the
early Greek and other foreign influ-
ences. After the lecture in some sup-
plementary, remarks the lecturer de:
scribed some of the picturesque diffi-
culties of research and discovery in
China and expressed an emphatic de-
sire that the proposed American Arch-
wological Inatitute in Pekin be estab-
lished. the war having caused the
withdrawal from China of the Euro-,
pean students, and the work, which |
is of such great importance to the art}
world, seems to devolve upon us. The}
