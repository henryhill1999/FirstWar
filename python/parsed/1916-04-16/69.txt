Who Is Making

Military History in Mexico

OL. GEORGE ALLAN DODD
fe making inilitury history in
Mexieo and he is going about
it with the determination that

has characterized him well nigh from |
childheod. He is what he is despite!
parental opposition. He had to fight
from the start in order that he might
quality himself to serve in the army.

Cal. Dodd was born in Williamaport,
Pa., on July 26, 1862, and wae lees than
13 yeare old when the civ!) war cume'
to a close, His father breathed a sigh
of relief at the conciusion of hostili-
ties, for the lad had given him no end
of trouble by the determination to en-
list. Dodd senior had in fact antici. |
pated in upirit the pacifist song, “1 Did,
Net Raise My Boy to Be a Soidier"
and hig difficulties multiplied accord-
ingly.

To carry out his desire George. Allan
ran away from home, but was caught.
brought back and = industriousls |
drubied, with. the ‘paternal shingle. |

disetpiine served only to spur him |
On, @nd‘the youngster made up his
miné te enter the army sooner or
later. ..

He pegged away at his schoolins
with an eye to a militury career, and
by eheer persistence he was udmitted
to West Point as a cadet on July |,
1872, just before hia twentieth birth-
dey. About four years later he com-
pleted his academic course and wus |
graduated, and on June 15, 1876, won!
hia commission as an Second Tieuten-
ant and was assigned to the Third |
Cavalry. 1

Fortune smiled upon him in making
him “a yellow leg,” for the cavalry
arm of the seryice has brought out
hia best quulities. He seemed to have
an inatinctive sympathy for the horse, |
and the dash of mounted services made
an immediate and lasting appeal to
hia goldieriy bent.

Among his classmates at West Point
aue Herbert W. Slocum, to-day Colo-
nel of the Twelfth Cavalry, and by
chance stationed at Columbus, N. M..,
when the Villistas rushed the town
and etarted the present trouble. Some
of hie other classmates were the pres-
ent Chief of the Genera! Staff. Major-
Gen. Hugh L. Scott, and Ernest A. |
Garlington, now a Hrigadier-Genera!
and Inapector-General of the army. He
has always been popular with his
academy associates and a ceaseless
abject of admiration on the part of |
hie fellow “yellow legs.” Probably
still more important has been his wrip
upon the enlisted man, and whatever
hia rank, wherever he has commanded
cavalrymen the soldiers have done
their best to please him.

Dodd remained with the Third Cav.
alry until February, 1901, being pro-
moted in the meanwhile to First Lieu-
tenant and then to Captain, reaching
the latter rank on August 31. 1889;
and finally attaining his majority on:
February 2, two years later, when he
Wap assigned to the Fourteenth Cav-
airy. On March 16, 1902, Major Dodd
Was transferred to the Thirteenth Cav-
alry and after twelve months service
there went back to his old regiment,
the Third Cavalry.

He became a Lieutenant-Colone) and
was assigned to the Tenth Cavalry,
one of the two negro cavalry resi-
ments, and remained with that organ-
{gation until November 11, 1907. We
became a Colonel the year following
and on April 14, 1908, was assigned
to command the Twelfth Cavalry.
Three years later he was detached
and was unassigned in September of
1911. So far goes the rather unevent.
ful record of this officer as one reads
tt in the Army Register, that official:
pubileation dealing only with dates;
but colorful information is available ,
from other sources.

Immediately after leaving West
Point Dodd was ordered to the far
West, and the first ten years of his
service was a period of contiiuous ac-
tivity involving one campaign after
another against hostile Indians, Dodd
was in the Powder River expedition of |
1877; he had to do with the troubles,
at the Red Cloud agency in 1878; and
is performances during the Ute ex-
pedition were such as to win in 1879
the commendation of his superiors for
Sallant service. During the Arizona
outbreaks of 1883 Dodd commanded.
a famous company of scouts; and in)
1893 he played an important part in
suppressing Indian disturbances in}
Oklahoma. Those years of

tuted @ echooling that developed Dodd
into the fineet sort of cavalry leader.
What ts more, the training went a
tong way eteward making him physi-
cally the seasoned wartior thut he is
to-day.

During the war with Spain. as a
Captain, Dodd served in the Fourth:
Cavalry and took part in the battle:
of Ban Juan, from the Ist to the ad,
of July, 1898, and participated in the)
niege operations following, which led |
to the fall of Santiago. He displayed |
hig characteristic gallantry at that |
time and was commended for his con-
duct In the face of the enemy. |

In the fall of 1898 Capt. Dodd re-
turned to the United States, and with
hig troop was ordered to Port Wrhun
Allen, Vermont, Efts stay there was
Urief, lasting only «a few weeks, and
then he was sent to the Philippines,
He arrived there in time to take part
in the expedition under Major-Gen,
Young which was despatched into
northern Luzon,

While a part of that expedition Capt.
Doé4 and his men partictpated in a
dozen battles with the natives, and
ile work was of such a nature that h-
warn commended for gallant uid merito-
rious conduct, and Gen. Young recom-
mended hira for a Brevet Majority

It was during Capt. Dodd's service
in the Philippines that he exhibited
“main his cunning !n outwitting the
native foe. By making a wide detour,
not unlike that which he has recently
performed in Mexico, Dodd surprised
u hedy of 400 Filipino tribesmen, and
although his foree consisted of on)
one troop of American cavalrymen he
wan able nearly to annihilate hie
enemy. Fightirg the Indians of the

ning effect of surprise.

was promoted to Major. He remhined
at Fort Ethan Alten for a couple of
years, and during that time made him-
self and his men noticed by their
thrilling, spectacular cavalry drills.
‘The men became nadepts in the hair

tary tournament held here in the Mad-

general public was brought to a bet-
ter understanding of what mounted
soldiery meant.

In 1903 Major Dodd was ordered to
eammand For: Assiniboine, Montana,
and while there was promoted to his
Lieutenant-Coloneley and aswigned as
second in command to the Tenth Cay-
alry. In 1907 he was ordered to Chi-
cago aa Chief of Staff to Gen. Carter,
who then commanded the Department
uf the Lakes, An experience he had
at this period affords an interesting
disclosure of a peculiar gift possessed
by Col, Dodd.

While at his desk at headquarters
one day he had a premonition that
something was going to happen to his
youngest son. He tried to shake {t off,
but the aprehensive feeling persisted.
Finally he draw a ‘telegraph blank
toward him with the idea of despatch-
ing & message of cuution to his wife,
but pushed the blank aside impa-

Again he felt the warning impulse
and actually wrote the mevsuge bid-
