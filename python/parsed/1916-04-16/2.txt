Whether Von Rintelen paid for the

of the Department of Justice refused to
say There is no doubt, however, that
Von Rintelen, Capt. von Papen and Capt
Hey Did all had dealings with Dr Scheele
and that the first two paid him money
at various times. Dr. Scheele's dealings
were extensive because he was assisting
Von Rintelen’s schemes of shipping varl-
ous sorts of supplies from this country
Gennany by way of Holland, Norway
aod Sweden,
Von Rintelen was behind Dr. Scheele's
elheme of mixing lubricating oils, so
iiivw needed by the Germans, with fer-
zr. Tt was learned yesterday that
Scheele received one letter from one
of Von Rintelen’s assistants telling him
that upon shipment of 2,000 barrels of
he fertilizer he was to go to Amsinck

Conferences at Bank.

tt also was learned yesterday that
Von Rintelen, Capt. von Papen and Capt
Hoy-Nd were accustomed to hold confer-
eoces ina room in the banking offices of
Amainek & Co, That institution, ke
any other bank, has rooms for confer-
ences which may be utilized by their
Nents and the bankers knew nothing of
» nature of the business discussed
there, Tt is safd that Von Rintelen, or
one of his associates, used such @ room
6! times

Von Rintelen and Capt. Otto Wolpert,
superintendent of the Atlas Service, a
subaidiary oof the Hamburg-American
Steainship Company, were very intimate.
Capt. Offiev said westerday that “there
fs no doubt that Capt. Wolpert knows
more about Von Rintelen’s doings than
almost any other man. in the country.
But Capt. Wolpert has refused to talk
fore the Grand Jury and already has

een adjudged in contempt of court.’’+
Capt, Wolpert) admitted before the

CONFESSES WHEN CAUGHT

lt was a simple, childish task that
lgenatius T. T. Lincoln, the diffiident Ger-
nan spy, set for the gangsters who were

to fescue him from the Raymond street
jail in’ Brooklyn on April 1 All they |
had to do was to get into the jail a7 t
pretending they were United States mar-
shales. knock the doorman senseleee, |
chain and gag Warden Hayes and alt the |
keepers except one, who was to be com-
pelled to open Lincoln's cell. Having !
locked up the ke@pers (each of whom
carries a revolver) they were to walk
out of the prison with Monte Cristo Lin.
coln and scatter in automobiles or on
their legs, just as they preferred.

Lincoln's’ minute directions for the
xecomplishment of this feat were made
public yesterday by Commissioner of
Correction Lewis, along with the fact
that he had dismissed Keepers Thomas
W. Danbeck and Michael C, Keating “tor |
having hekl conversation with a prisoner
not made necessary by their offictal
duties,”

The plan of escape was the sixth that
Lincoln had devised in the jail since h!s
recapture after hie escape in January |
from a Deputy United States Marshal, |
Lincoln entrusted his scheme to Keeper |
Thomas W. Marshall in the belief that |
the latter was a confederate, Marshall
promptly turned the paper over to,
Warden Hayes with its accompanying
sketches of the prison's interior |

They were photographed and passed |

missioners to @rab all the gunmen in

building.. But despite the simplicity of |
the adventure outlined by Lincoln the
wang leader merely pocketed the gu
which the spy sent him as a retainer and |
instead of leading his flock to Ray- |
mond street quietly left the city. a

 

day, ae has been said, was April 1.
How Gangstére Were to Enter

“Ring the bell." begina the note of
instruction which oe as sent nat =
chief gangster. ‘Three of you have to
be there. eMitale one to have handcuffs |
on. One to have either a police shield, |
or, better still, a United States shield

“When the keeper arrives he will first
open a wendow glass of the door and he
will ask who is it. Hold the middle
man’s hand in euch a position that the
keeper should see the handcuffs. At the
same time show him your shield by tur
ng your coat back and reply, ‘United
States prisoner.’

“Indeed, not to make him suspictous
there should be only two, namely the
handtuffed man and the one with the
shield, the six others to be hiding under
cover on either side of the stairs, but out
of the view of the keeper who opens the
door, Ag seon as he opens the door
cover him with a pistol and knock him
senseless,

“It is of the utmost importance that
wile the twe are doing this the six}
others the very instant they see the first |
two enter the prison also enter and do!
ar follows: ‘Two te remain as guards at}
the door and gag and chain the keeper
there in a corner.” ;

Two others were to hustle to the war-
den’s room—-"‘first room on the right, see;
sketch,” Lincoln wrote. If the warden |
was there he was to be covered with)
pistols so quickly that he could not press
a butten, he was to be ehained and
gagced and his telephone and bell w res!
cut. The visitors were cautioned te shut!

to the prison proper, right across the cor-
ridor. }

the door, while the eighth, wearing a
shield, was to walk up to the platform |
and say: t

“Hello, Hay, Commissioner Lewis ts!

inspee?ion, Tell all the keepers

Thus ene keeper after the other-— |
keepers being notoriously a docile, un- |
suspecting lot, ready to obey any!
stranger who ehouts “hello, Hay" at,
them—was to be lured into the warden's |
office. As fast as they did so the five|
gangsters in the office were to point
their guns, and having chained and
gagged the keepers to pile them on
the floor.

“Thus.” explained the adco!t Lincoln,
“vou will get all the five keepers from
inside the prison without trouble or.

When the plot fell to pieces Lincoln
made a full confession. He bragged that
his plan would surely have succeeded
if “men of courage and resourcefulness
had followed it. He said that when he
related the details to Keeper Danbeck
the keeper said:

“Now you have it. You are foolish
to attempt to escape, but If you are
to attempt to escape this la the way
to do it.”

In his trial! before Commissioner
Lewis, Danbeck admitted that Lincoln
had given him a code, the numbers of
which referred to words in Lincoln's
publi*hed book, and that after leaving

Mating a Due-Art Record
=— Mr. Grainger at the Re
cording Piane.

PERCY GRAINGER is a pianist of brilliant
and very broad capabilities. His musical writ-
ings are at present being more widely performed
than the compositions of any ether English-
speaking composer. Unquestionably he is a
musical genius. And fine and remarkable as
his present accomplishments are, his future holds
promise of even greater performances.

He was the close friend of Grieg, the famous
Norwegian composer. Grieg saw in him an
artistic pewer ef great richness and profundity.

The noted critics in every principal werld
capttal have heard him and have given him
their highest mead of praise.

Percy Grainger, the cheerful, sunny compeser
—the sane, poetic pianist —ts without question
one of the mest commanding personalities in the
musical werld today.

‘SWF PEOPLE sometimes are lis-

tening to music, and sometimes
taking part in it, we shall have
better musicians, much keener list-
eners—and greater enjoyment in
music !”’
Mr. Grainger thus epitomized
for me his idea of music at its best.
‘‘Why,’’ Lasked, ‘‘doyou require
that people take part in music as
well as listen ?”’

AIDS TO MUSICIANSHIP

I feel that quicker, clearer un-
derstanding comes that way,’’ he
replied. ‘‘If a man plays a bit him-
self, he better appreciates what the
musician is tryingtodo. But just as
making music sharpens our wits
and our taste for Bearing it, so lis-
tening to fine music feeds and
stimulates our musicianship.”

‘*Then surely our Duo-Art Pian-
ola is quite your ideal of a musical
instrument for the home,” I sug-
gested.

**Ves—dquite,’’ said Mr. Grainger,
“T am frightfully interested in the
Duo-Art. I play it as a piano, and
sometimes as a Pianola. Does the
idea of a pianist using a Pianola
seem odd to you? Well, you know,
I am thinking of doing some com-
positions for the Pianola. From the

Te appreciate the full significance of Mr.
Grainger’s tribute to the Duo-Art Pianola,
of this marvelous instrument
Briefly, the Duo-Art Pianola is a
new reproducing piano. It has three attributes.

FIRST—It is a regular piano for hand playing
and practice, conventional in appearance and ob-
tainable in either Grand or Upright form.

SECOND-—It is a regular Pianola which may
be played with ordinary Pianola music-rolls. As

some understandin
is necessary.

viewpoint of the composer, it is a
very interesting instrument, with
perhaps broader possibilities even
than the piano.

‘*And, of course, we do not lose
sight of the third faculty of the
Duo-Art. When I am en tour, my
mother may have it to reproduce
my records, and for the time, I am
with her in spirit—the Duo-Art
reproductions are so vividly like my

playing. :
‘On the whole, the Duo-Art is
quite wonderful indeed—one of the

greatest marvels I have found in
your remarkable America.”’

‘You sincerely think that the
Duo-Agt reproduces from your
records so accurately as to satisfy
one 6o well qualified to judge criti-
cally as your own mother? ”’

DUO-ART REPRODUCTIONS
PRACTICALLY PERFECT

‘*Yes, surely, And when I my-
self hear the records which I have
played at my best and then edited
and corrected until they are my
fullest musical expressions, I think
to myself—‘Ah, on the days when
I play like that I am very well
pleased.’”’

TeDUOART >

‘This is quite a fine thing you
are saying for the Duo-Art, Mr.
Grainger,—tell me, do you mean
to go on record with the statement
that the Duo-Art actually simulates
your art even in such subtle things
as gradations of touch and tone
qualitye”’

EXPERIENCE IN RECORD-MAKING
VALUABLE TO THE ARTIST

‘*That is a very legal soundin
query, if you understand what
mean,” replied Grainger, smiling,
—‘‘yes, I think the Duo-Art simu-
lates every phase of my work,
rhythm, tone and all the rest. With.
reference to rhythm particularly,
I am amazed at the absolute accu-
racy with which the instrument re-
produces the artist’s most personal
characteristics.’’

‘*You have found record-makin
an exacting task, then,’’ I suggested,
“each detail must be eo carefully
considered in order that the finished
record may be you at your best.”

‘Extremely interesting, yes, and
exacting —but very valuable too.
My mother, who has always been
my inseparable companion and ad-
visor, the other day remarked upon

PIANOLA

such it offers the same facilities for personal ex-
pression control as other models of the Pianola.

THIRD—It re-creates from special music-rolls
the exact performances of various pianists who
have made record-rolls for it. Obviously the im-
portance of this great new feature depends on the
ability of the instrument to faithfully reproduce
musical values in expressiveness as well as technique.
That it possesses this ability to a degree positively
miraculous is evidenced by the extraordinary en-
thusiasm of the great musicians who, like Mr.

my improved interpretation of a
work which I present frequently in
recital. ‘You play that differently
and much more tellingly these last
few days,’ she said, ‘has anything
occurred to give you a new point
of view?’

‘**T’ve been hearing my interpre-
tation on the Duo-Art Pianola—1
have been playing the part of the
audience, listening to my own work.
The improved interpretation is the
result of a new kind of self criti-
cism,’ I replied.

‘*The Duo-Artactuallyhas helped
greatly in study and practice,’” he
went on, ‘‘for obviously as one sits
at the keyboard it is impossible to
know how some effects reach the
audience.”’

Mr. Grainger slid deep down in
his chair and sat thoughtfully quiet
for afew moments. ‘I quite sin-
cerly think that the Duo-Art Pianola
is going to do great things for music.
Artistic interpretations by great
musicians make musical classics
clear and comprehensible—and en-
tertaining to the layman. With
these fine interpretations presented
sorwidely by means of the Duo-Art,
the result must be a rapidly advanc-
ing taste in music—a quickly in-
creasing interest in music.

AEOLIAN IDEALS

‘The musical world surely owes
much to the Aeolian Company, for
you with your high ideals and your
very liberal spirit have added a dis-
tinct impetus to the advancement
of musical art.”’

After reading this report in

print, | can say that itis accurate
and truly reflects my views.

Grainger, have made and are making record-rolls
for it. Among these may be mentioned such
famous names as Bauer, Busoni, Godowsky,
