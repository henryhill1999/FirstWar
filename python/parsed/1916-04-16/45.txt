Shows Where Income Goes.

 

The Finance Department has devised
an interesting diagram ehowing how
every $100 of city income {se eapent. It
shows that nearly $8 out of every $100,
or $17,975,021.73, of the budget is set
aside for the direct State tax and to
meet deficiencies in taxes mostly per-
sonal and not collectible.

The diagram indjpatee how $194,-
981,165.81 will be spent in Manhattan,
The Bronx, Kings, Queens and Rich-
mond. The various items are grouped
under three heads, borough government,

county government and general city
purposes.

The diagram shows how each item
in each borough compares with those
in other boroughs. For inatance, the
cost of borough government in Rich-

mond {s $32.62 of every $100, while in
Manhattan only $2.12 of every $100
goes for the borough government. Of :
every $100 spent In Manhattan the dia-
gram shows $94.81 {!s for general city
purposes, which it 1s expected will total |
$115,529,840.15 this year. In The Bronx
$88.33 is for general city purposes, in
Kings $90.38, in Queens $80.66 and in
$60.41

DUKE DE MOROBUYS JFine, Modern Loft to Replace Old

CLAFLIN SETTLES

Structures in Former Textile Zone! DRY GOODS DISTRICT

The firat result downtown of the pro-'
posed soning scheme and the progress |
of the campaign to drive manufacturers |
out of the high class shopping district |
{a seen in the improvement of the prop- |
erty at 19 and 21 Greene street with y
a modern loft building. It is the first
improvement recorded for the old a |
cantile district In a long time, and seems
to give substance to the report that
owners in the old zone are ready to
rectify their erro of a dozen years
back, now that the opportunity ia of-
fered by the “save New York” campaign, |
and will improve their holdings !n a
manner that wiil lead back the firms
which left there years ago because of
the general condition of buildings In that
territory.

The new Greene street bullding will
be aix stories high and modern in every
detail, even to the architecture in the
exterior. It will be a fireproof struc-
ture, 60 feet wide and 100 feet
deep. Old buildings cover the property
now. They @ill be removed as svon
as possible and construction of the new
structure started.

Because of the poor sub-surface soll
{t was decided to bulld only six stories,
since a foundation for a taller building
would cost @ prohibitive sum. The
old side walls will be retained and the
new building bullt to them.

According to the plans of Laurence
M. Loeb, the structure will have a
freight elevator and «a passenger lift.
The rentals to be charged will be no
greater than are paid in modern bulid-
ings in Brooklyn, Queens and Hoboken.
The building will be erected for J. R.
Simon & Co., who will use part of it
for their businese.

 

 

NATIONWIDE BUILDING SLUMP.

High Material Prices Reflected in
Fewer Buildings at Increased Cont,

Building activity throughout the coun-
try last month was less in volume than
that of a year ago, but the cost was
considerably greater. Reports to Brad-
atreet’s journal frorn 107 cities show 18,-
721 permits filed during Marc h, with an
estimated value of building planned or
permitted for of $68,181,668, a decrease
of 12.6 per cent. in permits but a gain
of 14.1 per cent. in value as compared
with March a year ago, The returns
are very irregular, as shown by the
fact that every group of cities shows a
decrease in permits, while all but two
groups show gains in estimated expendi: ;
ture. In the detailed liet by citles, too,
it is found that fifty-sig cities show
eains, while fifty-one show decreases
from March a year ago.

For the first quarter of 1916 expendi-
tures aggregate $177,600,265, a gain
of 18.2 per cent. over the first quarter
of 1915, which showed a loss of 11.2
per cent. from 1914.

Reports from individual cities show
gains of 26.6 per cent. at New York
(three ‘boroughs reporting); Piitsburg
gains 75.6 per cent., Detroit 29.5 per
cent., Toledo 34 per cent., Chicago 55
per cent., Milwaukee 6.6 per cent., St.
Paul 29.4 per cent., Washington 121 per
cent. and Los Angeles 26 per cent. Im-
portant cities showing decreases are
Philadelphia 14.8 per cent., Cincinnatl
32.6 per cent., Cleveland 64.3 per cent.
and Minneapolis 28.9 per cent

PASSAIC GRADE CROSSINGS. |

|
Years of saivadine : Frutttel—p., I. |

& W. to Remove Grades. |
Passaic, No J, April 15. The problem |
of eliminating the dangerous grade

crossings of the Delaware, Lackawanna

jand Western Railvoad just north of the

Passaic station, Where Passaic avenue
at « tangent, has been solved after sey
eral years of agitation

Upward of $166,000 will be apent on
the improvement, the railroad agreeing
to pay all but $35,000 of the cost, this
to he borne by the city. The railroad
is looking forward to the elemination
also of the Bloomfield avenue grade
crosging. thus doing away with all cross-
ings in the eity.

Both Passaic and Van Houten avenues
are inain arteries of travel and two of
the finest residential streets in the city. |
The former is the connection avenue
between Passaic ang, Nutley, while ue
Houten avenue is as heavily travelied |
automobile road whic 4 leads to the Great |

 

 

Notch road, one of the prettiest drives
in Jersey
In reaching a conclusion as to the

method of eliminating the crossings these
facts were taken into consideration with
the result that Passaic avenue will be
depressed and pass,under an artistic
concrete bridge, On either side of the
railroad there will te a semi-plaza to
enable trafic to turn from ene avenue
