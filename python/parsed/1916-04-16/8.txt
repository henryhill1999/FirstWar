In the opinion of automobile fuel ex-

mixed with quantities of water will run
& car satisfactorily for any considera-
ble distance or at a reasonable cost,
no matter what Louis Enricht of Farm-
ingdale, L. 1, says. Mr. Enricht, a
chemist, declares that his combination
of a few simple chemicals with plenty
of water at a cost of 1% cents a gallon
has sounded the knell of the gasolene
industry.

While the experts are more or less in
the dark because Enricht conceals his
formula, they are united in one thing:
All believe that there is no economy in
using hydrogen gas to run a car. It is
by the release of hydrogen from water
that Mr. Enricht says he gets his com-
bustion, :

This point of view was best summed:

amount, or a little leas, to run the car,
There is no economy in that.”

An expert of the General: Chemical
Company took the me position.

Dr. Allen Rogers of the Pratt Insti-
tute, who is going out to take a look
at Enricht's fuel for himself, did not
want to express an advance opinion. But
he did say that the “two dry batteries”
described as about all the apparatus nec-
essary would not be of any use to de-
compose water—they wouldn't furnish
anywhere near the necessary current for
the task. Dr. Rogers thought that some
such chemical as metallic sodium might
be the means of freeing the hydrogen.

Charges on Fifty-one

Guy 8. Biddinger, formerly @ sergeant
of police in Chicago and now a private
detective in this city, surrendered him-
self in the District Attorney's office yes-

where he is said to be under fifty-one

indictments. Judge Crain in General
Sessions took the bond, githough As-
sistant District Attorney Dooling said he
thought the amount should be $20,000.
The bond is to insure Biddinger’s ap-

Atpany, April 15.—John D. Rockefel-

In 1910, when the State issued its firet

$1,600,000. The chief donor to this fund
was the late J. P. Morgan. Other promi-

BIG POWER FRANCHISE

ee

Charter Declared Unconstitu-
tional Gave Away Rights
Worth $200,000,000.

 

ALBANY, April 15.—The final skirmish
in the long controversy between the
State of New York and the Long Sauk
Development Company for control of
the Long Sault Rapids, in the St. Law-
rence River, which are capable of pro-
ducing approximately 1,000,000 horse-
power, will take place Monday before
the United States Supreme Court. The
Long Sault company, a subsidiary of the
so-called aluminum trust, brought the
case to the highest court on an appeal
from the State Court of Appeals, which
decided that the charter given this cor-
poration by the Legislature of 1907 for
the development of water power on the
Long Sault Rapids was unconstitutional.
Attorney-General Woodbury is resisting
the efforts of the Long Sault company
to seize these rapids.

Detective Benjamin Bailie was stand-

In a low voice, “Go to room 49 on the

stepped into one of the many doorways
of the quarter and was gone.

Bailie, however, went to the address
given and found a room numbered 49

door, but all that met his gaze was an
