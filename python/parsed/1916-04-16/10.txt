more fun to be got out of a pretender
than anybody else, so he again makes
the youthful model pose as a famous
French woman painter. A similar falee
representation was the foundation of
the author's two preceding plays.

But this heroine has various adven-
tures before she gnes to visit a home in
New Jersey in which she is supposed to
be an artist of the most advanced school.
She teaches that there should be two of
everything. To paint a picture of a full
moon so as t produce the proper effect
two full moons should be shown is the
theory of this founder of this new school
of painting. Of course this is all the
sheerest nonsense. Miss Murdock is @
model in the first act.

Being a frivolous person, this youn
model has rented an automobile and with
her girl friends taken a joy ride which
ends in tragedy. The machine = is
wrecked. She must pay $3,600 damages,
First she tries to borrow it from a
French admirer and then from a painter.
Finally she appeals to the old sculptor
for whom she had been a model for a
dozen years. When there is no-chance
of getting the money from any of these
she imposes on the New Jersey hostess
looking for a lion to whom she has prom-
ised to pay just the sum that the young
model needs for the automobile com-

pany.

suited to the leading role. Thomas Wise
