WILL HOLD REGATTA|RUSSIA PURCHASES
ON LAKE CHAMPLAIN} BIG STEAM YACHT

 

Boats on Six Mile Course Al-
ways Will Be in Sight of
Clubhouse.

 

DATES NOT YET CHOSEN

 

Tansing de Long has been elected
commodore of the Lake Champlain
Yacht Club. ‘This club was organized in
1837, and its clubhouse is at Burlington,
Vt. Commodore de Long is one of the
most enthusiastic power boat racing men.
One of bis best boats was the Elmer It,
a 80 foot semi-epeed boat, which he
raced under the colors of the Albany
Yaciit Club.

The Lake Champlain Yacht Club in-
tends to hold a big regatta this season,
the dates to be announced later. It 1s
stated that conditions are ideal for

motor boat racing on Lake Champlain
and that a course of Or six miles
to the lap may be laid out tn front of
the clubhouse, with the unusual condi-
tion that the boats would always be in
sight. The Lake Champlain Yacht Club
ts affillated with the American Power
Boat Association, and Commodore de
Leng is anxious to get the fastest boats

in the country to enter the club re-|

gatta this season. As the club is com-
posed of influential men who are good
fellows and loyal to the best interests of
thelr club a royal good time {s assured
visiting yachtsmen, -

 

The Albany Boat Corporation is bulild-
tng a 45 foot express cruiser for Thomas
B. Taylor. Mr. Taylor fs the secretary
of the American Power Boat Assoctation
and was the original owner of the Fly-
away, the pioneer of the express cruiser
type. This new yacht for Mr. Taylor
will be something out of the ordinar:
Tt ts 45 feet long by 9 feet beam and

motor wil] make more than thirty-eight
miles an hour.

This company has just closed a con-
tract for a 40 foot runabout which ts |
guaranteed to make forty miles an hour.
Among recent sales by the Albany com-
pany {s a 3% footer to make forty miles !
an hour for use on the Pacific coast. The |
Oregon Kid. champion of the Pacific
qoacst and the Mississippi Valley, was
bullt by the Albany Boat Corporation,
and naturally Western yachtsmen favor
{ts designs. Leon L. Tripp, the presiden
ef the corporation, recently returned
fron: Miami, where he watched an Al-
bany boat win the Southern champion-
ship. Another Albany boat won the;
Australian championship at the same |
ume.

Greenport for several years and she was
towed from there to Shewan's yard tn
South Brooklyn on Friday, where sho
will be thoroughly overhauled. The As-
tec is one of the most luxuriously fitted
yachts bullt in this country. She was

the interior {tings and furnishings were
| specially made for her. The dining room

Warrior ran on an uncharted reef off

lost, but they were rescued by a ——
ater

rior was floated off the reef, brought to
this port and found to be little injured.

Mr. Vanderbilt had turned the yacht

feet long and was built in 1910 by
Bayles at Port Jefferson from designs
by Morgan Barney. She is owned by
James D. Lacey.

Frederick W. Vanderbilt after his ex-
perience on the Warrior did not take
an active interest in yachting, but late
last year he purchased the power yacht
Thelma and during the winter he bought
the steam yacht Virginia, which was
built in 1899 for the late Isaac Stern.
The Virginia also was designed by the
lute G. L. Watson and she too has made
many extended cruises, one of the most
notable being up the Amazon River with
Commodore E, C, Benedict and a party
of friends on board. She Is 199 feet
over all and 166 feet on the water line.
Mr. Vanderbilt has renamed the yacht
Vedette, which was the name of the first
steamer he owned.

owned by Commodvure Kk. LD. Morgan of

Wasnirorow, April 16.—Decreases of
$4,600,000 each tn the gold reserves and
total cash reserves of the Federal re-
eerve banks took place in the past
week, according to the weekly statement

of condition made public by the Fed-
eral Reserve Board to-day. Here is the
statement:

tween Federal reserve banks was $0,-

The largest losses in gold reserve are

INTEREST S8TILY, UNPAID

 

In view of the continued default of
the January Interest on the $20,000,000
5 per cent. debenture bonds of the Chi-
cago, Rock Island and Pacific Railway
Company, !t wae said yesterday by a
member of the debenture holders’ pro-
tective Committee, application will be
made to court for Judgment on the prin-
cipal of the issue. Yesterday was the
last day of the extension granted by the
committee to allow the stockholders op-
portunity to draw up an involuntary re-
organization plan,

It was learned that a plan was being
drawn up by Speyer & Co. and Hayden,
Stone & Co. for the debenture holders’
committee, for the reorganization of the
company that would be necessary after
the default of the debenture principal.
Nothing was said by the debenture inter-
ests in regard to the Amster plan, but it
fe inferred from their action that they
do not think that it will succeed,

Mr. Amster knnounced yesterday that
the plan had brought {n approximately
$5,000,000 In subscriptions from stock-
holders and expressed the belief that
if allowed sixty or ninety days his
committee could raise the $25,000,000
estiinated as required in the plan. It
is pointed out in the financial district,
however, that the heavy eubseriptions
to such @ plan are nearly always made
in the first few days. Those that follow
oe usually the subscriptions of strag-
glers,

No details of the propoked deben-
ture plan could be secured yesterday.

Pennsylvania Raflroad Leads

Interest in the steel trade last week
was largely centred in the rail situation.
The most important development came
when the Pennsylvania Raflroad = an-
nounced the placing of orders for 205.000
tons of heavy section ratls, including
125,000 tons for lines east and $0,000
tons for lines west of Pittsburg. It is
understood that the rails for the Eastern
lines will be 130 pound sections, but
that less heavy sections will be used for
lines west. None of the large steel com-
panies had received definite advice of
their proportion of the Pennsylvania ton-
nage up to noon yesterday, when most of
the offices closed. If the percentage used
last year holds tn the distribution this
year the United States Steel Corpora-
tion interesta will be awarded 90,200
tons, while the Pennsylvania and Cam-
bria Stecl Companies will each receive
