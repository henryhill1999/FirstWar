Out of Primary,

SaLem, Ore, April 16.—A telegram was
received by Secretary of State Olcott to-
}day from Charles FE, Hughes in

his name being placed on the primary
ballot and requested that action be with-
‘held until @ letter which was on the
ij rund explaining his objections had been
received, ;
This action by Justice Hughes probably
will postpone the filing of a writ of man-
damus to compel Mr. Olcott to place
Justice Hughes's name on the ballot, as
proposed by the Hughes faction in
