Proprietor Tom Carroll of the Hermit-
age, right here in Manhattan, was just
coming under the wire also. Mr. Car-

mont that stirred their neighbors. Half

@ Gomen witnesses said that Fillas had

hat she had killed her flance,

Rafoul, the victim; Elian and hie sia-
Qumin-law, Najeeba, joined the Syrian
eefeny that monopolises the lower part
of Washington strect a few years ago.
Rafoul, the siik weaver, of 17 Rector
etreet, fell in love with the popular
®yeian girl who worked in the embroid-
ery ehop near by, and all the colony knew
their love and watched with interest the
romance. Najeeba lived with her
brother-in-law, Elias, in the tenement at
81 Wachington street, and was happy in
the vision of an approaching wedding to
Rafoul. He was a frequent caller at
their tidy apartment high above the
queer little stores on Washington street,
across from the red brick schoolhouse
where so many different tongues are
epoken throughout the day.

Marriage License Ie leaued.

Often the young couple were seen to-
@ether. Soon the word spread about
among George Shaloupe’s patrons that

Rafoul and Najeeba were enguged to
wed, in fact that the day wuld soon
be at hand. One day recently Najeeba

boasted to her Griends in the embroidery
factory that Rafoul had obtained a mar-

riage license The girl trusted him, she
said, and believed they would wed, but
again and again the day came and went
and then Nejeeba began io realize her
betrayal so inueh that the other embrold-
ery workers cast significant glances upon
her an) Najeeho quit her work,

Ttafoul to realize the girls pre-

   

MHeament He even offered to set up
Refoul and his wife with furniture and
other necessities of married life, but
Rafou! put them off with vain promises.

Two weeks ago Najeeba and her
brother-in-law hailed Rafoul to court
on a serious charge, but Rafoul was
discharged in General Sessions for lack
of corroboration, and then the sneers
became more bitter, Najeeba’e friends
tried to get Grand Jury action, but
that, too, seemed toa be failing. Mean-
while Elias could scarcely restrain his
vengeance. iKkafouli nad even seoraed
the pleas of Najeeba's parish priest.
So things progressed until yesterday
morning, when Elias and Najeeba were

walking down Washington street just
vefore & o'clock, and spied Rafoul ap-
@reaching a few doors beyond.

The tales of witnesses questioned by
the Assistant District Attorney eay Elias
did the shootine that followed, but
Najeeba took unto herself the deed and
claimed the pistol as her own. Anyhow,
Rafoul must have divined his fate, for
he darted toward the entrance to
George Shaloupe’s shop as a bullet
eracked the glass. He gained the in-
terior, with Elias and Najeeba in pur-
wult. Rafoul retreated to the kitchen
fn the rear and tried the door to the
backyard. Jt was locked, and Elias and
Najeeba were coming in the front door.
Four more shots were fired. All struck
‘Rafoul and he crumpled up by the door,
Elias standing over him, asking him
if he was dead.

Girl Claims the Pistol,

Policeman Dennis McCarthy of the
Greenwich street station said he saw
MWifas pass the pistol to Najeeba. Mc-
Carthy grabbed her as she held it, and
@6 BOTNe One Wrenched it from her hand
MeCarthy said she claimed !t as one

which she had bought lest Rafoul at- |

tack her again, Other witnesses testi-
fied in the station house that the girl
came along after the shooting in the
@hop and meeting her brother-in-law
asked him if he had shot Rafoul, The
District Attorney did not believe all
of Najeeba’s story in the light of what
other witnesses said and in spite of
Elias's statement that he did not shoot
himeelf, that he did not know who did
it, that he happened by at the time and
was there when the police came,

Rafoul did not recover consciousness
to tell his side of the story, but no one
could be found in the excited Syrian
colony yesterday afternoon to say aught

but_a word of sympathy for the sad
eyed girl of the embroidery factory,

ter of a start with those who had come
from greater distances, but his car had
to carry a weight handicap.

When they all had been shot up to
the nineteenth floor—which is not to
be confused with the nineteenth hole—-
of the Biltmore they found that the
New York hotel man once they had de-
cided to give a supper dance had done
that thing as it had not been done de-
fore. ‘

Tropical Forest Ie Shows,

Where once the Biitmore’s grand ball-
room and eurrounding dining and supper
rooms and foyers had had walls and
pillars and pilasters and balconies it
now had nothing to show except a forest
of green which had something on any
tropical forest which even the Colonel
has brought home tales about. Dogwood
in dloam, laurel and smilax and palms
and birds in golden cages might not have
impressed the Colonel, had he been there,
sufficiently to cause him to admit that
he never had seen such a jungle riot;
but never had the Colonel seen a forest
all lit up.

And this one was Jast night--with
very tiny green and blue And pink’ and
orange and red and white electric bulbs.
Jack roses and orchids and a hullabaloo
of other posies were sandwiched in be-
tween all these. And any place one
stepped one was in grave danger of atep-
ping upon a fifty piece self-sturting
orchestra,
| ‘The only reason any space outside the
ballroom floor was left free at all was
in order to place tables tn positions.
Just what time the firat of Proprietor
John Mel. Bowman's Biltmore suppers
got under way is not known because
the supper parties were averlapping even
before the press gallery had got to the
scene of carnage. Doubtless the suppers
by this time are beginning to merge inte
breakfasts between dances

New York folk who go light on the
warmed over roast in the flat at home in
order to be in proper condition for an
| after theatre supper party in a New
| York hotel may be curious to know
what New York hotel proprietors de-
cided to have for eupper when they de-
Ided to put in a night—and morning-—
riotously by hurrying away from their
lown hotels to spend the evening, night
land thencefortA in another hotel. Well,
they started ont, following a suffictent
| number of dances, with this:

One must admire the self-control of
John Mck. Bowman, net once did the
menu say “a la Biltmore,” not even after
that Jambon concoction, where the name
of the hotel might have been slipped In
} quietly. And if Proprietor Bowman were

ASK WHITMAN'S STAND
ON CITY RELIEF BILLS

| New York Tax Reduction Com-
mittee Seck a Public
Declaration.

 

 

 

Several mombers ofthe Tax Reduc-
tion Committee, which was organised
to promote the pamaagétof the bills tn-
‘troduced {n the Legislature for the finan-
cial relief of New York city, sent
a letter to Gov. Whitman yesterday ask-
ing him to declare publicly that he te
not using his Influence to defeat these
measures. The letter says:

“There are in olreulation reports,
j which have hecome so general that they
cannot be ignored, to the effect that
you are not in sympathy with the legia-

ative billx to relieve New York city
'from unjust taxation. In a despatch
a day or two ago to one of the New
York morning newspapers the statament
was made that the pagsage of the Brown
automobiie registration bill, which di-
vides the registration fees with locall-
tles, ‘was vigorously fought by the Whit-
man Senators, all of whom voted against
it.’

‘The further statement was made in
the despatch: ‘The vote in the Senate
on the automobile bill was interpreted
to mean that the Governor is still lined
up with the up-State crowd In opposition
to the desires of New York city” |

“Of course we do not assume that
thie is an authentic statement of your
attitude, byt It does neem certain that
the continued circulation of such a re-
port, whether it be true or not, ig cal-
culated at this critical time to do great
harm to New York city in its struggle
for justice at the hands of the legisla-
ture,

“Wa the undersigned thérefore re-
spectfully urge you to make ft clear to
the public and to the Legislature that
you are not, as reported, lending your
influence to thoee who oppose the bills
for the relief of the city.”

fentificd Ttrough| Mrs. Lemuel Valentine Holder

of Garden City, L. 1., Sues
for Separation.

 

Garoen Crov, L. TL, April i6..—Mrs.

burglary of the apartments of William | Viola Alida Holdem has brought a suit

Kronmeyer, former Hoboken Council-
man, On the second floor at 53 West
Eleventh street, yesterday was that the
burglar was too polite. As Mr, and Mra.
Kronmeyer were returning from a trip

uptown they met in the hallway of the
apartment house three young men. One
bowed and lifted his hat aa if he knew
them. His action, because Mr, Kron-
meyer could not remember having seen
him before, caused him to notice the man
particularly.

When the Kronmeyers reached their
apartment they found the door unlocked
and the place ransacked. He immedi-
ately thought of the young men in the
hall. When he reached the street they
were not in aight, but the frult pedler
on the corner had seen them board a
car on Sixth avenue. Although the street
car had about a block start, Mr. Kror-
meyer commandeered the automobile
of Edward A. Unterberger of 60 Went
115th street. Through the window of
the street car, which they overhauled,
he could agee the three young men. They
were dividing some jewelry. At Twenty-
fourth street with the assistance of
Policeman Hennery of Traffic C the
three were arrested, They attempted
to escape through the front of the car,
but they found the way blocked by Un-
terberger’s automobile.

On the way to the West Twentieth
street station one of them attempted to
throw away a part of the jewelry, When
they were examined by Deteotives Sheri-

for separation against Lemuel Vaientine

Holder, a foreign exchange broker, with
an office at 66 Pine street, Manhattan.

Mrs. Holder charges crue) and inhu-
man treatment, which, she says, began a
few months after her marriage in St.
Agnes's Church, Manhattan, on June 18,
1908. The following October, she says,
her husband came home intoxicated and
asked her if she knew a man n
Callahan. When ehe said she did he
chased her about the house. She says
he often ran after her, but she was
almost always able to outrun him. Fre-
quently she ran to the bathroom and
locked herself in,

Once in New Rochelle she failed to
escape from him. He beat her ahd
choked her, she says, and she had to
call her sister and brother-in-law, Mr.
and Mrs. Raymond Platt, to subdue
Holder, At another time Holder beat
her in the home of her sister, 300 West
109th street, she charges.

Mrs. Holder says that because of her
husband's cruel treatment she left him
in the fall of 1913, but after several
weeks he and eome friends effected a
reconciliation, on Holder's promise to
keep sober in future. °

After thie his treatment of her was
much better, she says, but early this
year he provoked a violent quarrel with
her, in the course of which he threat-
ened to shoot, and actually went search-
ing for his revolver. Mre. Holder ran
out of the house and went to her ele-
ter's home,

He was very jealous and many timos
he wrongly accused her of meeting other
men, she saye in her complaint.

Mre. Holder says her husband's in-
come ia $6,000 a year. <A motion for
alitnony will be argued in Manhattan on
April 21. Holder wit! probably contest
