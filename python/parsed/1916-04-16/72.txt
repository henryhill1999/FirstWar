One of the greatest beauties of the
plan in fact is that besides enabling the
company to cross the continent with-
out baving to endure the hardships of
| one night stands the scheme makes
| jumps of more than fifty miles or s0
| wholly unnecessary for “Toe Great

Vuresuit” troupe. Instead, for instance,

of jumping all the way from Manhat-

ian to Seranton “The Great Pursuit"
need go no further from Broadway
than Jersey City. In Jersey City there

Would be no necessity for changing the

play as it is now being performed on

Broadway beyond crossing out the

word “Scranton” in Misa Tempest's

lines and substituting “Newark.”

At Newark Jater on Miss Tempest of
course could memorize the words “Jer
sey City” between acts, The only ob-

| jection to so short a jump or to any
! jump of less than fifty miles from New

York city would be that the company

ing back to Manhattan each night

It consequenitiv would be far less

goes without saying, the snappy city of
Camden, N. J.

And why, it may be asked, cannot
the scheme be so perfected that “The
Great Pursuit’s” star line shall have @
snapper attached to it which will make
it unnecessary for the play ever to
end its New York run? Ah, that's
something else again. <A singie glance
at the names of the volunteer critid
and the cartoonist jis enough to cone
vince any reader that we, descendants
of the old Knickerbocker stock which
made New York what it is, are beet
quatified to speak on any tople cone
cerning the city of our ancestors, and
we promptly agreed while developing
the scheme between acts of “The Great
Pursult" a few nighia ago that an
effective snapper for New York city
was an impossibility

The whole scheme hinges upon the
idea of mentioning in a given city the
name of a rival city. The absurdity
of trving to dig up the name of any
city in the world which is a rival of
New York to the extent of causing
us to deacend to anything #0 pre-
Vinela| as municipal jealousy is of
estise anearent. Lene New ‘Sorkers,
we are in a position to state this aue
thoritativeiy.

In view of ail that has been said
tere to-day. it is scarcely necesséary
to add that every reader in every town
from coast to coast sureiy realizes
that “The Great Pursuit" some day
perhaps in the dim future, but surely
some day--wil) visit the hume town
for a run. And so it would be unjust
to the playwright. 1o Joe Brooks and
