the Metropolitan handi-

tute nine yesterday morning on Odio Field cap committ@ of the Metropolitan Golf

before a big crowd of high school men
who were gathered at the heights to
take part in the annual prep school day
activities. The score was 5 to 3.

The visitors took the lead tn the first
inning and kept it throughout the game,
but were never eure of victory until the
last inning was finished.

The game was really a pitchers’ battle
between Belloff of Stevens and Hag-
bloom. The former only allowed two
hits and the latter six. In control Hag-
bloom had the advantage over his op-
ponent, passing only four men, *while
Belloff passed eight. {rrors also proved
costly to both aides,

Stevens started off in the first inning
with a rush. Cotter drew a pass, John-
eon reached first on Strawbridge's error
ané Drew reached first on a bunt, filling
the bases. Lenthe then came to the
bat and doubled to deep left, scoring
Cotter, Johnson was put out at home.
Memory aingled, scoring Drew.

In the third inning Belloff reached
first on Strawbridge’s error. Memory |

the plate with a clean single over short.
In the fourth inning Farris scored as a
result of a wild pitch by Hagbloom, and
in the ninth two doubles by Farris and
Cotter scored the former.

New York's three runs were made in
the fifth inning after two men were out.
Strawbridge was put out at first. Me-
Culloch walked. Mooney fanned and
McCulloch stole second and third. Egan
crew a pass. On a double steal McCul-
lech crossed the plate and Kgan went
to second. Hagbloom walked and Tetel-
man singled, scoring Egan. Connell hit
a double to right field, allowing Hag-
bloom to tally. Pfan got @ base on balls,

HAVERFORD FRESHMAN
GIVES PENN ONE HIT

Busby Holds His Opponents
Hitless Until Ninth Inning
and Wins 2 to 0.

PHILADELPHIA, April 15.—Busby, a
freshman on Haverford’s team, shut out
Pennsylvania's baseball team this after-
noon at Franklin Field. He allowed the
Penn men only one hit. The score was
2 to 0, “

Penn's hite did not come until the
ninth inning. Smith, the firat Quahor up
in this inning, hit a line drive through

shortstop that Cary touched but could
not field.

Haverford's two runs came in the
eighth inning. Up to this time Cross
had also been pitching hitless ball, but
Hanon hit the first ball delivered for a
clean single. Through a mixup of sig-
nals Koons's pop fly also went for a hit.
A double steal by these two men, fol-
lowed by the squeeze play, so upset
Cross that he juggled Crosaman's bunt
until both Hanon and Koons had scored.

Saminy Moore, third baseman of the
Pennsylvania baseball team, was elected
captain of the nine, The election was
to fill the place of Capt. Mann, who did
not return to college this spring.

Last year Moore played shortstop, but
was moved to third base this season to
make room for Martin, the basketball
star. Moore has been playing a brilliant
game at third all season, In the game
with Haverford to-day he made three
putouts and four assists without an
error, The score:

Haverford.... 90000002 ~~ F 4
Pennsylvania. 900000000-0 1 1

Batteriee-—Haverford--Busby and Hanon;
Pennsylvania—Crose and Dolan.

Kauff was the property of the Hoosiers
—#0 far as the reserve clause of a base-
ball contract goes——when on August 28,

*. P. Dixon 2d, G. A. Dixon, Jr} 1914, they contracted to sell him to the

New York Nationals. The management
of the Giants was to pay Indianapolis
$10,000 for Kauff's services provided he
was retained after May 1, 1915. In case

Indianapolis, however, tried to sell the
skin before it was taken from the bear.
At the time New York was dickering
with Indianapolis for Kauff that young
man was playing with the Federal
League club of Indianapolis. The Hoo-
siers drafted him in the fall of 1913,
but Benny refused to report and the
next season went over with the inde-
Pendent opposition.

In the winter of 1914-15 Kauff was
transferred from the Indianapolis Fed-
eral League club to the Brooklyn Fed-
In April, a year ago, on the as-
surances of the player that he was not
under contract to Robert B. Ward of
the Tip Tops, Kauff was signed to a
Giant contract, being assured of a bonus
of $5,000. . It was a dispute over this
bonus, by the way, that made Kauff a

M.j holdout for several weeks this spring.

McGraw attempted to play Kauff in
centre field against the Braves at the
Polo Grounds. James E. Gaffney, then
president of the former world’s cham-
pions, hurried to a telephone and ap-
prised President John K. Tener of the
National League of the fact. Tener told
Gaffney not to permit the Braves to
play against Kauff, an ineligible player

HANDICAP 9—C. W. Abbott, @. H. Abbott,; who hail not been reinstated by the

Paul Acier | National Commission.

Meanwhile Tener
tried in vain to reach the umpires by
Before he was successful

New York. Later when Tener reached
Umpire Mal Eason and explained the
situation the teams agreed to play with-
out Kauff. Boston won. McGraw
thought it only an exhibition game,
but learned to his sorrow that the de-
feat counted as one of his regularly
scheduled battles.

Meanwhile Kauff and the New York
club petitioned the National Commission
to reinstate Kauff. The triumvirate
turned down the application May 1 last.
Robert B. Ward convinced the Giants
that he had a valid contract to Kauff's
services for the seasons of 1915, 1916
and 1917,.80 Harry N. Hempstead
@ashed his hands of the player. It is
this same contract under which Kauff
is now playing in New York. The Giants
purchased it, at a stiff figure, from
Harry F. Sinclair after peace with the
Federal league was established.

The commission points out in its da-
nial of the claim of Indianapolis that
Kauff is only one of many players listed
as Federa! League means of retrench-
ment through sale to organized baseball
in keeping with the peace terms. It
points out further that in the agreement
for the purchase of Kauff from Indianap-
olis the New York club etipulated to
the effect that the hargain would be
void if Kauff was not actually under
contract to the Indianapolis club at the
time. Indianapolis admitted {t held no
contract with Kauff—that its only claim
to him lay in the reserve clause of
Benny's contract with the club from
which he was drafted by Indianapolis.
