Babicora, pulled up his horse this morne
ing in front of the campfire of Gen,
Pershing here in the Santa Maria Val-

ley and the heart of Villa land.

“L come, my General, to offer any as-
sistance I cun to you in your hunt for
the bandit Villa,” said Don Juan, “The
peons on the ranch of which FT have
charge have been trained to be soldiers
by me and they are good ones, my Gen-
eral. We have successfully defended
our ranch from the bandits more than
ones,

“Maybe the General has not heard the
true story of the capture of Villa's right
hand, the Gen. Jose Maria Rodriguez,
he who murdered the eighteen Americans
at Santa Ysabel, not two months back,
and the same whose body was exhibited
in Juarez?”

“We would be pleased to hear (he
story, Don Juan,” Gen, Pershing replied

“Then here ix the chance for the cor-
respondent,” said the Mexican, smiling

Rodgers says he is upholding the ac.
tivity of the American side of the in-
ternational negotiations with Carranza,
while Ambassador-Designate Arredondo
looks after the Mexican side at Wush-
ington.

Mr. Rodgers denied reports circulating
here that the United States has fixed
the date of retirement of the American
forces from the republic, stating that
the retirement of the troops is not con-
templated yet, though the negotiations
are cordial,

Assistant Minister Parker said to-day
that his information from throughout
the republic indicates that the Parral
incident has provoked no trouble any-
where for American residents.

Gen, Obregon began his duties as Min-
ister of War to-day, giving many cam-
paign orders. He promised to discuss
the international situation to-morrow,
but would say absolutely nothing until
then,

Gen, Carranza held a reception at
noon in the national palace for all Gov-

Amador wus visited to-day by local dip-
lomats. He conferred for a long time
with the Chinese charge. Gen, Obregon
spoke to-night from the balcony in the
brilliantly iluminated national palace,
gaying in part:

“The eternal enemies of the revolu-
tion, the majority of whom reside tn
Mexico city, have tried to make Mexico

Minister of Finance Cabrera to-day
cénvoked all bankers to a conference,
