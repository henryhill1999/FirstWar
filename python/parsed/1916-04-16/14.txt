ROLAND ROBERTS I§ |MORE PLAY BILLIARDS
THAN ANY OTHER GAME
So Says John T. Doyle, Who Backs Up His Statement

With Statistics Showing 240,000 Players in
New York, 4,000,000 in Country.

LATEST COAST STAR

Youngster May Come East
This Year With Other
Californians.

SEVERAL SURE TO COME

 

 

Ry EUGENE R, O'CONNELL.

Ever since the settling of the amateur
question applying to tennis players
which removed the doubt as to whether
or not. Maurice E. McLoughlin, Thomas
* Bundy and William M. Johnston
would be eligible to play in the East-
ern tournaments, the likelihood that they
will come East has been a big topic
for discussion among followers of the
game here. There was little doubt but
that Johnston would make the trip in
order to defend the title which he had
to work so hard to win. There was and
still is a great deal of uncertainty about
MoLoughlin, however, and about Bundy
too.

As a matter of fact every year since
MecLoughiin won his first national cham-
pionship, Just as regularly as the ten-
nis season came around, came also the
rumor that the Comet would be among
thoee missing in the big Eastern tourna-
ments. And just as regularly Mce-
Loughlin reported present and carried
off the plums. This year the followers
of the game seemingly have more than
‘the hard transcontinental trip,” “the
long absence from home and business”
idea to base their conclusions on. Mce-
Loughlin should find it hard to get away
from his new business, and incidentally
should find some difficulty in devoting
the time to getting into shape for the
strenuous Eastern campaign.

However, those who know McLoughlin
well are practically certain that he will
play in the Eastern tournaments. While
he has not stated that he will surely
make the trip Bast he has said that If it
{s at all possible he will be back try-
img to regain the national title. And
not only that, but the famous Califor-
nian also will make an effort to win
the national doubles title which he and
Bundy lost last year to Johnston and
Clarence J. Griffin. McLoughlin and
Bundy had held the doubles crown for
three years, long enough for them to
Qecome attached to it, and they are now
Yenesome without it.

The first rumors that McLoughlin and
other prominent Pacific coast players
would stay home were expressive more
of the fear that they would than the
reality of their doing #0. Followers of
the game who had ceen the Californians
play once always wanted to see them
perform again. A few years back the
Californians would not have been missed
from the championship tournament, but
now 'f they ehould stay out the national
championship would be a rather hollow
sort of titie. Five years ago a Cali-
fornian was a sort of freak in one of
the big Eastern tourneys, and now a big
Eastern tourney {s a sort of freak with-
out a Californian or two,

‘ms year instead of Californians
keeping away from the East, all indica-
tions point to a wholesale Invasion of
the East. Before the season ends there
will probably be many a young player
along the Eastern seaboard who will
heartily wish the coast stars had re-
Maiied on their native heath. If the
present plans of the Far West players
come to anything it will be remarkable
{ the windup of the season fimis more
than two of the Eastern stars eligible for
the first ten.

The season will have its new Call-
fornia marvel too. No season would be
complete without it. First it was Bundy,
then McLoughlin. After McLoughlin
came Johnston and Robert Lindley Mur-

ray last year Ward Dawson came
heralded as the latest California sensa-
tion. Dawson did not do very well at

the sensationing business, but he showed
promise and probably learned enough
to make him a hard man to win from

when he comes East this year. The
regular dyed in the wool new boy
prodigy of the courts who will invade

the East this year is none other than
Roland Roberts

Roberts is only 18 years oid, but has
already reached that stage of proficiency
wherein he is a star among stars out
near the Golden Gate.
the remarkable speed common to Cali-
fornia players, learned on the asphalt
courts, with a wonderful knowledge of
the game, fluent strokes and versatility.
Only recently the Sidney R. Marvin ten-
nis trophy was awarded to him and that
in itself should be demonstrative of his
ability. This trophy is awarded semi-
annually to the player in the Golden
Gate junior tennis club showing the
Mehest proficiency and sportsmanship.
Marvin is the man who has brought out
Practically all of the high class Cali-
fornia tennis players, among them Mc-
Loughlin, Johnston and John Strachan.

Murray is already here, and although
he works {n Bayonne, N. J., he is still a
Californian and will compete as such.
Murray, Johnston and McLoughlin cer-
tainly should get places in the first ten,
@ven if they are not one, two three.
What Roherts will do on the turf courts
remains to be seen. Even the meteoric
McLoughlin needed some seasoning be-
fore he reached the top, but on his
first visit was placed in the first ten,
Qe were all the others with the excep-
tlon of Dawson. Should Roberts fol-
low in the footsteps of his fellow na-
tive sons it looks as if there would only
be six other places in the first ten to
be Allied

In taking these into consideration,
however, Dawson, who has announced
that he will make the trip, should not be
Overlooked, Last year he falled to get
ROing at top speed, showed nothing like
the forin that he displayed on the Coast
and yet was only slightly behind the
charmed circle, Should he make good
this year, and most critics belleve he
will, half of the honor places will be
filled with Californians.

By SHEPARD G. BARCLAY.

Baseball is known as America’s na-
tional game, Millions are interested in
it, read it and go to see it. In number
of actual players, though, billiards is
giving it a hot battle, if not even surpass-
ing it. Hearken to John T. Doyle, bil-
liard impresario and considerable statis-
tician, who has reams of data ready to
spin off as fast as the mind can com-
prehend,

“There are approximately 240,000 bil-
liard players in Greater New York and
4,000,000 of them In the country,” said
Doyle yesterday afternoon. It was in
the little office of his establishment on
Forty-second street. Doyle reached for
# pencil and a small pad of note paper.
He began to jot down numbers as rap-
idly as he can write. '

“The only sports that New Yorkers
participate ip to a large extent besides
billiards are golf and tennis,” he re-
sumed. “It is hard to get at the exact
number of tennis players, but golf is
easy to estimate. There are 100 courses
within forty miles of Broadway, with
membership averaging 400 in each, That
makes a total of 40,000. The public
links have about 10,000 additional, with
9,000 Heenses out, and about 1,000 others
who pay the daily fee. Thus there are
about 60,000 golfers in and about New
York.

“To get the number of tennis players
all you can do is make a general esti-
mate, based proportionately on the num-
ber of golfers. 1 should say there are
perhaps 50 per cent. more tennis play-
ers than golfers, or 75,000 in all. Billiard
players therefore are nearly five times as
numerous as golfers and more than three
times as plentiful as tennis players.

Eight Thousand Tables Here.

Interesting enough if true, and so I
said to Doyle “How do you know there
are 240,000 billiard players in the city?
There isn't any way you can make an
estimate on billiard players with any
degree of accuracy.” I had heard some-
body say he had a pocketful of statistics
on the subject if he only would produce
them. He produced.

“No way to estimate them, eh? How
about this?” he said as he plunged head-
leng into his favorite subject. “I have
figures from the Department of Licenses.
Dropping off a few extras and dealing in
round numbers, there are 1,500 licensed
billiard rooms in Greater New York—
commercial rooma, 1 mean. They vary
in size from the big ones with more
than twenty tables down to the little
fellows with only one, such as the little
place behind the barber shop on the side
street. A fair average would be four
tables to the room. That would give us
6,000 tables in commercial rooms alone.

“Mind you, I'm making all these
figures conservative. Every one is
smaller than it should be. In addition

to the public rooms there are about 900
tables in clubs of various sorts. For
the sake of being conservative we'll say
only 700. Then there are approximately
1,600 in private residences, which we'll
call 1.2790. Thum we have 2,000 tables
in addition to those in public rooms, or
a total of &,000.
“I estimate an of

average thirty

players to a table, figuring on the basis!

of my own experience here. In this

'
'

nobody but their owners. Besides those
fellows there are at least two or three
times as many other who have
not gone to the trouble of picking out a
particular cue but just take one from
the rack when they come in. Again for
the sake of conservatism we'll say there
are not two or three times as many
transient patrons as regulags but only
the same number. That would make
600 regulars and itrregulara altogether.
There are twenty-one tables in my room.
Thus, with 600 players, there are about
thirty players to a table.

Little Else in Small Cities.

“That average of thirty to a table will
hold good all over. It is probably greater
than that as a matter of fact. Thirty
players to a table and 8,000 tables—that
makes 240,000 billiard players in the
greater city. Since Greater New York
has somewhere in the neighborhood of
6,000,000 inhabitants, its population is
about 6 per cent. of the country. On
that basis the entire United States has
4,000,000 billiard players. The number
in proportion to populatiun is even larger
in the smaller cities, where there are not
so many other forms of amusement to
attract the inhabitants.”

The chief factor in the growth of bil-
lards is the elevating of the game in re-
cent years. Time was, a little over a
decade ago, when mothers and fathers
refused to let their young sons “fre-
quent pool rooms.” The expression “pool
room” has passed out of use in con-
nection with anything except places
where race track betting goes on e6ub
rosa. The game that used to be called
“continuous pool” is known now as
“pocket billlards.”

Formerly almost always a medium of
gambling, billlards now is strictly a
game of pleasure. There is probably less
gambling in billiards than with any
other sport that has professionals con-
nected with it. Even the pros do prac-
ucally no betting now. The upward
progress of biliiards in that respect has
been parallel with the growth of base-
ball, which had a hard struggle for rec-
ognition by the best people until gam-
bling was stamped out.

Conditions have changed so much now
that fathers and mothers are anxious
for their sons to play as much billiards
as they will, Every sort of club now
has its well appointed billiard room.
Lodge rooms of the Elks, Knights of
Columbus, Free Masons and other simi-
lar societies have them. Every branch
Y. M. C. A. of any size in the country
now has anywhere from one to more
than a dozen tables. Churches are in-
stalling them in parish houses and Sun-
day school rooms One prominent
Brooklyn minister recently delivered an
address before a throng in the Y. M.
Cc. A. in which he declared billiards the
most elevating of games.

The various settlement houses, such
ae the Hudson Guild, University Settle-
ment and Boys Club, now offer billiards
as an inducement to take young lads off
the streets and out of mischief. Per-
haps the biggest billiard tournament in
the world is the one in which these
youths participate annually. Fifteen
guilds or clubs enter in the competition,
with a total of 300 players. After a
long elimination series the event gete
down to where there are only eight sur-
vivors for the finale. These eight then
get together up at Doyle's and settle it

could not see the ball to hit it. The
rest of Fottre!ll's game did not measure
up to his serviee on his trip here, but
{t was «il good enough to make him a
hard man to beat.

John Strachan is another who is going
to try and make the trip, according to
some of his friends, Strachan is re-
garded as the strongest player on the
Coast to-day, not even barring Me-
Loughlin or Johnston. Last year in
the Pacific coast championships he
downed Johnston easily in straight sets

Three Cushion Match in

BIG SMOKER TO-MORROW

Charles Ellis, world’s three cushion
champion, has accepted the challenge of
his fellow townsman, Charles McCourt.
No date has been set for the match,
which is to be played in their home city,
Pittsburg, almost certainly in the acad-
emy of Harry Davis. The last week of
April or the fret week of May prob-
ably will be chosen. It will be the first
time in years that two men from the
Fame city have come together in a pro-
fessional billiard championship match.

Because of their coming title tlit epe-
cial interest attaches to the work of
Ellis and McCourt in the Interstate
Three Cushion Billiard League. The
league season is drawing toward its
close now. Ellis ts the leader with thir-
ty-two games won and eight lost. Right
behind him are McCourt and Pierre
Maupome of St. Louis, recently beaten
by Ellis in a world’s championship
match, Maupome is second with thire
ty-three won and nine lost, and Mce-

Clab League Comes Up Again.

A wide variety of matters will be
discussed to-morrow night at the sec-
ond smoker of the National Associa-
tion of Amateur Billiard Players in the
rooms of the Arion Society. First and
foremost is the plan for organizing an
interclub amateur billiard league, Other
topics will be the projected three cushion,
straight rail and cushion carom tourna-
nents for next winter and the hope of
getting some of the Europeans here for
an international competition. Cutting
the length of the Class A championship
games from 400 points each to 300 also
will be under consideration.

The suggested interclub league may
be in existence before the meeting ad-
journs. At the smoker, because of their
connection with the national association,
Will be representatives of the Arion So-
clety, the Liederkranz, New York Ath-
letle Club, Amateur Billiard Ciub of
New York and Crescent Athletic Club of
Brooklyn. It is possible also that the
Hanover Club of Brooklyn will have
some one present. Arthur Townsend, a
prominent Class A player of a few years
back, will be there to represent that club
if he can make other engagements fit in.

The most difficult problem of all in
regard to such a league seems to have
been disposed of satisfactorily in the
formulating of a new handicap scheme.
Tt fs to have all Class A players tn
the league matches rated at 250 points,
playing that number no matter how
strong or weak the opponent; with all
Class Bo men at 175, Class © per-
formers at 125 and those below Class C
100) points. If those figures are not
right a committee of the league can
be appointed to adjust them according
to the latest scheme, All the members
of each team will be numbered, with
the strongest at No, 1, the next as
No. 2 and so on down the line. The idea
Is to have the strongest players of op-
posing teams meet, with the strength
tapering off down toward the end of
the team, which will avoid the neces-

sity of too great handicap allowances. | Coaswain,

NINE FACES STRONG FOES

 

Though the indications are that Co-
lumbia will ffave a good varsity crew
before the season is over, Coach James
C. Rice eaid yesterday that a lot of work
will have to be accomplished before a
smooth working combination is in sight.
Two weeks on the Hudson have shown
the crew to be ragged but promising.
The inexperience of the men also is a big
factor to be overcome. As the first var-
sity is boated now it is distinctly a soph-
omore crew, there being no juniors in the
shell and only three seniore—Captain
Norm Bration at stroke, W. H. Diek-
mann at No. 5 and O. B. Myers at
No. 2,

Diekmann ie the only man rowing in
the seat he occupied at Poughkeepsie
last June. Captain Bratton has rowed

for three years, but this is his first sea-
son at stroke. He is a powerful fellow,
26 years of age, 5 feet 114 inches tall
and 185 pounds in weight. Considering
the light and stocky Rice strokes of the
past, Bratton seems out of place, but
his work against Yale last fall shows
him capable. If anything should hap-
pen to Bratton, Columbia's chances
Of the two men
who stroked last year, Felix Wormser
has quit the game and O. B, Myers is un-
fit because of his welterweight bulld to
row astern, He is rowing No, 2.

There has been a continual dropping
off in the Columbia squad, which hag not
been noticed very much because it has |

'
up his losses yesterday he found that of |
the sixteen men who rowed in the var-
sity and junior boats last year omy two
were lost by graduation. Yet out of the
fourteen still eligible only four are on
the squad at present Important among
those who have been last for one reason
or another are Naumer, veteran at bow
for two years; Tichborne, Ferris, Worm.
ser, Simonds, Mansbach, Spurgeon and
Munroe. Just these eight would make a
formidable varsity crew.

So it appears that Coach Rice has
been forced practically to seek his var-
sity material from last year's freshman
boat. As a cub combination it did noth-
ing wonderful, finishing third at Pough-
keepsie to Syracuse and Cornell How!
it ever improved enough to beat Yale
in November was one of the wonders of
the world It is Rice alone who be
lieves that too much emphasis must not
be placed on the Yale victory if the crew
is to be successful on May 18 against
Annapolis, Pennsylvania and Princeton |
and on June 17 against Corneil, Penn-
sylvania, Stanford and Syracuse.

The race against the first named trio
for the Childs Cup at the American
Henley, Philadelphia, will occupy Rice's
attention for the next month. After
that he will worry about Poughkeepsie.
As the Childs Cup event is more or less
of a sprinting race, the Columbia crew
will be drilled on starting and getting a
snappy stroke with lota of drive in it

The fact that the crew averages only
16419 pounds in weight will not be con-
sidered much of a handicap in the short
race. The lightest man in the boat is
J. H. Trowbridge, who is trying to hold
down the bow position, a seat that has |
been @ jinx a'l year Trowbridge
weighs 149 pounds He was stroking

Being the Seventh of a Series of Practical Articles by
an Expert on the Subject of the
Car and Its Operation.

 

Ry WILLIAM H. STEWART, JR.,
President Stewart Asctomediie
Sehool,

In the four stroke type motor the
crank ehaft makes two revolutions to
complete the cycle of operations. The
suction and compression stroke is one
revolution ; the firing and exhaust stroke
is the other. The charge of gas is taken
into the cylinder: by the down etroke of
the piston and compressed by the up
stroke. Likewise when the charge ie
fired the piston is forced outward and
on the second up stroke the burned gases
exhausted. In order to admit the new
gases to the cylinder the intake valve,
timed to open and close at the right in-
stant, is necessary. Likewise an exhaust
valve.

Ordinarily one would think that these
valves should open and close at the end
of the strokes, but such is not the case.
A fixed “lag” and “lead” are given the

valves according to the design of the,

motor. Ordinarily the intake valve is
timed to open at a point about 12
degrees past top centre and to close at a
point about 30 degrees past bottom
centre. The exhaust valve opens about
40 degrees before bottom centre and
closes about 10 degrees past top centre.
Top centre is determined when the piston
is up; bottom centre when it {s down.
Since there are 360 degrees to a circle,
the flywheel is usually marked in a
manner to fiz these points of opening
and closing.

Motors differ considerably as to valve

exhaust valve is timed to open before
the piston reaches bottom centre in or-
der to permit excess preasure to escape
before the piston returns on the up
stroke. If this lead was not given to
the exhaust valve undue pressure would
be exerted on the piston during the ecav-
enging stroke.

Since three of the four strokes are
idle the energy consumed in effecting
thie would cause loss of power. As the
Piston travele upward on the exhaust
atroke the burned gases are expelled
through the exhaust valve, which is also
held open as long as possible to take
advantage of the velocity of the gases.
In eahort, the exhaust valve may remain
open until the piston begins to travel
down on the suction stroke and tend to
create a vacuum. At this point the
exhaust valve must close and the suc-
tion concentrated at the intake vaive,
which should then open.

At “A” is shown the intake timing
gear which meshes with “C,” the crank
shaft gear. At "B” is shown the ex-
hauett cam e6haft gear which likewise
is driven by the crank ehaft gear. Since
two revolutions of the crank shaft are
| necessary to complete the cycle, namely,
| suction, compression, firing and exhaust,
| the timing gears “A” and “B" must be
driven at half time speed. For this
reason the cam shaft timing gears have
| twice as many teeth as the crank shaft
timing gear.
the cums.of the cam shaft. These, in
rotating, actuate the valve lifter “R"
which operates valves “I” and “11.”

Thie earance should be in accoriance
with Instructions of the manufacturer.

If the valves are not timed accurately
the motor will not develop its mazimum
efficiency or even may not run at all.
Reseating the valves oocasionally ia alo
n . Especially is this true wit!
the exhaust valve, which is subjected
to considerable heat and waste products
of combustion. The inrush of fresh
éases past the intake valve has a tend-
ency to keep it clean, and for this rea-
son this valve does not foul so readily.
A slight particle of carbon on the seat
of the valve will cause loss of compres-
sion and when the compression is re-
duced loss of power results.

Correct ignition timing is also very
important. The charge of gas must be
fully tenited at the inetant the crank pir
Passes dead centre. When this is done
the full expansive force of the explo-
sion ie exerted on the piston and the
best results are obtained. When the
motor is turning over at the rate of
1,000 revolutiong a minute the crank pin
passes through top centre much faster
than when the motor is turning over at
the rate of 500 revolutions a minute.
Since it takes a certain amount of time
for the charge of gas to become fully
ignited {it is necessary to introduce the
epark into the cylinder a little in ad-
vance in order to fully ignite the charge
by the time the crank pin passes dead
centre. The faster the motor turns over
the more advanced must be the spark
The volume of the spark is not changed
by advancing or retarding, but simply
the time of the spark in relation to
position of the crank pin. When @
motor is turning over very fast the
spark may be advanced as much as
40 degrees; that is to say, the charge
will begin to ignite 40 degrees before
the crank pin reaches top centre. As
the speed of the motor is reduced the
advance must be reduced, otherwise the
force of the explosion will be exerted
on the piston too soon and the ten-
dency will be to reverse the direction
of the crank shaft. When the spark is
too far advanced a knock is noticeable.
Thia is caused by the piston acting
