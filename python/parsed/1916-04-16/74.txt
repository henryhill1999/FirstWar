“His name is Piotr Ivanovitch

Stanborobel explained with a smile.
“A friend in Vindivostek wrote me
te meet him. Yer, a merchant I met
there. Peter Ivanovitch, or Petya, to
give him the nickname, is a Russian
student. But here he comes.”

We were introduced and I gazed in-

eyes, a mobile mouth with thin red

the look of a man who has been

He would not drink anything but

“I have sent Momoloy word to mect

frown, “If he does, it will be well,
to have an extra witness. I have

have complete confidence. Have you,

the title page suggests, of “an Amer-

he dors not pretend, as some soldier-

that his knees shook on more than one

intimates that there were times when
he wished he were somewhere else. |
