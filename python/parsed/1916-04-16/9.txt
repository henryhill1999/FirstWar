Thoughts Suggested by a Ten Dol-
lar Check.

From a friend und reader of Try
Sun who prefers to be known only as
“L. BH. M.” except to ourselves we
have received a perfectly valid check
for $10 accompunied by the following
remarks:

“2 ehould like to be one of a million
voters to contribute a like amount for
the formation of «a campaign fund to
further the nomination and election of
one Tuwopors Roosgve.t and the brand
of Americanism he stands for, as com-
pared with the synthetic congoction of
atuf® handed out by the present incum-
bent of the White House.”

We have been a little puzzled us to
the advice we shall give our corre-
spondent about the proper disposition
of his ten dollars. If Colonel Roosg-
VELT were an avowed cundidate for
homination and election us President,
with a regular organization devoted
to his political udventure, the matter
would be simple enough. We should
then ask “T.. TH. M.” to communicate
directly with the treasurer of the
Roosevelt campaign committee But,
if we understand the Colonel's pres-
ent attitude, there is nobody at this
time authorized to receive cash con-
tributions for the purpose indicated
by our correspondent. Not even Mr.
Groxce W. PERKINS possesses such
authority. Colonel Rooseve tt has de-
clared (and who will dare to doubt
his unqualified statement?) that he
does not wish the nomination. If he
does not want to be nominated, it
certainly follows that he does not
want to be elected. Months ago he
formally notified the suthorities of
Nebraska, Minnesota, Michigan, and
perhaps some other States which we
have forgotten, that under no circum-
stances would he permit his name to
be used in the primaries. Six weeks
ago he firmly resisted the entreaties
of some of his enthusiastic supporters
in Massachusetts, again declining to
be a candidate in the primaries “of
that or any other State.”

This attitude, so consistently muin-
tafned by Colonel Rooseveit in the
face of persuasion that would ordi-
narily move a stone will, ought to be
conclusive in removing the doubts of
those who suspect our distinguished
fellow citizen of some sort of mental
regervation which makes him a self-
conscious candidate in another sense
than thut which concerns the Prest-
dential primaries. For the national
platform on which he ran unsuccess-
fully for President four yveurs ago de-
clared “in particulur for nationwide
preferential primaries for candidates
for the Presidency” as the proper
channel for the expression of the will
ef “a self-controlled democracy.”
How, then, could the Colonel refuse
to let his name go to the primaries
for such a free expression of the
popular will as his own platform of
1912 demanded as a check on boss
rule and the theft of nominations
or the stampeding of delegates in a
national convention?

Furthermore, this same national
platform of the Progressive or Roose-
velt party in 1912, on which THrovorr.
Rooseve tT received 4,119,582 ballots,
splitting the old Republican vote and
throwing the Presidency to Woovsow
Wrieon, the candidate of a minority,
declared emphatically against uny
such campaign fund as that which
our friend desires to start in Colonel
Roosrve.t's interest. An avowed pur-
pose of the Roosevelt secession of
foar years ago-—treason, the old line
Republicans persist in styling it—
. Was to prevent the inordinate use
of money in Federal politics, “We
pledge our party,” said Colonel Roosr-
VELT’s convention, “to legislation that
will compel strict limitation of all
campaign contributions and expendi-
ture, and detailed publicity of both
before us well as after primaries and
elections.”

This ten dollar contribution, stund-
ing alone, might not constitute « din-
gerous invasion of that strict limt-
tation of campaign funds for which
Colonel Roosrvert’s party declared in
1912, but what of the $10,000,000 to-
tal which would be amassed if the
other nine hundred und ninety-nine
thousand nine hundred and ninety-
ume voters should accept “L. H.
M.'s” Invitation und follow his ex-
ample? Hus he reully thought of the
significance of his inittative? Toe
he actually mean to start a snowball
of this sinister sort und these unprec-
edented dimensions? What would
be the result on the nation's soul of
injecting $10,000,000 into a campaign

to nominate and elect a man who is
not even a candidate? If Colonel
Roosgvert were a candidate, how
could the $10,000,000 be used to nomt-
nate and elect him, except in the way
of corruption, direct or indirect, but
in any way pernicious?

Why, this financia] proposition for
the development of a pubdiic opinion
which must be spontaneous in order
to have any effect upon the Colonel's
firm resolve would huve staggered the
imagination of the late Mank Hanna,
It would have caused that great cam-
pnign financier to throw the frying
pun into the fire as an obsolete im-
plement. It fs beyond the dreams of

S'the avarice of any previous collector

of campaign funds. Ten millions: of
dollars to nominate and elect as Pres-
ident of the United States the very
map who stands for the stern limita-
tion and repressive scrutiny of all
campaign contributions and expendi-
tures! Our well meaning but most in-
considerate correspondent surely must
perceive that in practical ethics ft
would make no difference whether

tion, he is a problem {nm contro! and
guidance that no novice ever solyed.
The American language has no ex-
pletive energetic enough to move him ;

and Russtan is hard to learn,

Alaska has kept in touch with every
mile of the race, Three of the teams
were “bunched” less than 150 miles
from the finish. One of the contes-
tants was compelled to drop out be-
cause the rules provide that each
driver must bring back to Nome all
of his original dogs, and this contes-
tant’s sled was not large enough to
carry one of the exhausted racers. On
the way the drivers encountered a
bilzeard “which was so biinding thi?
they were forced to trust to their
dogs to keep the trail.” In another
place two of the contestants were
compelled to drive together for their
“protection in the darkness.”

When finally Kamuk, Sawashka
and all their brothers and sisters of
the winning team come yelping out

this stupendous sum had been joy-[of the snow trail with the driver's

ing Individuals or extorted from a
comparatively small number of male-
factors of great wealth. In the po-
litical use of the cush the impact
would be the same.

For this and other reasons recited
above THe Sun has thought it best
to return “I. H. M.'s” check and to
ask him to reconsider. Does he doubt
now the essential immorality of the
$10,000,000 proposal? Can he doubt
that it would be regarded as immoral
by the object of the benefaction (even
if he were a candidate) or by Mr.
Grorct W. Perxrns himself, however
refreshing the {dea of outside assist-
anée on such a scale might be to Mr.
PERKINS's secret soul?

A Day for the Flag.

The Empire State Society of Sons
of the American Revolution asks the
citizens of New York to show their be-
lief in preparedness by a general dis-
play of the American flag on Patriot's
Day, the anniversary of the battle of
Lexington.

This suggestion is timely and the
request should meet with a patriotic
response,

The anniversary of the battle of
Lexington occurs next Wednesday,
April 19 Let every American flag
signalize on pole or at window the day
and the deed of the Forefathers and
Pioneers of American Preparedness !
Domestic and Other Conversational

Requirements.

Word comes from the ever interest-
ing Pacific coast that the “wave of
enlightenment that began in San
Francisco and that is toilsomely mak-
ing its way eastward” has so uplifted
the conversational tone of the ladies
in those parts that to be their equals
in dinner table talk our men folk
“will need to polish up whatever men-
tal equipment they may possess or
else stay’ ut home and confine their
conversational prowess to the domes-
tle board, where the requirements
are not severe.”

We like the spirit of this. Nothing
namby-pamby here. A sturdy, ring-
ing boast and threat combined: “We
are the people; watch your steps!”
We guess no purt of the country
boosts itself, especially in Intellectual
stuff, so to say, unless it is there with
the punch, the trumpet note of de
fiance,

We find, however, in the language
we have quoted above a hint, as It
seems, of a social status Interesting
indeed, if we ure not misled tn our
reading. Gentlemen of the East, It is
suggested, unequul tn hazurd of wits
with ladies who have received bap-
tism in this wave of enlightenment,
were in a better place, or a place bet-
ter adapted to their mental Iimita-
tion, if at home, “confining their con-
versational prowess to the domestic
board.”

Somehow {t {s impossible to escape
a notion thus conveyed that gentle-
men leaving dining tubles under the
ubhappy bandicap of inability to meet
scintillating sparks with igneous par-
ticles would upon returning home tind
their wives there,

Maybe not; we muy have miscon-
strued, yet the haunting thought pre-
vails that gentlemen dining with la-
dies where the billows of thought
roll high and strong leave their wives
to dine at the domestic board, where
the requirements are not severe, but
the dinners, no doubt, much better,

 

Alaska’s Great Yearly Race.

eight dogs in all; onee ucross the

Black Degs.

A month ago Buy Crasx of Al-
bany disappeared from his sister's
side in front of a motion picture
theatre, Search for bim was unavall-
ing. The eight-year-old boy could not
be found. Subsequently his guar-
dians received a note, signed “The
Black Dogs,” demanding $5,000 ran-
som for him, and threatening to kill
him if it was not paid. No method
of turning the money over was sug-
gested in the note, and it was gener-
ally regarded as a hoax, the work of
a demented person or of one having
a perverted sense of humor. Persons
capable of such conduct exist; why, is
one of the unsolved mysteries of an
incomplete civilization.

Yesterday the boy’s body, stripped
of its outer clothing, was found by a
policeman. A_ botanist wandering
near the Six Mile Water Works, to
the west of Albany, on Friday, came
across the child’s overcoat and jacket.
Superficial examination did not dis-
close marks of violence; the manner
of the boy’s death could not be at
once established. By the time this is
read the cause of death may have
been revealed, and if the lad was a
victim of kidnappers the authorities
will have taken the appropriate steps
in their pursuit, a pursuit that, it may
be confidently assumed, will be kept
up until every resource of society for
their capture has been exhausted.

But if the youngster met death from
natural causes, if instead of being
kidnapped he slipped away to fight
Indians, to hunt for Virra, to Join
the Canadian army, and came to his
end through Infantile folly, the au-
thorities still have a duty to perform.
It is to catch the authors of the note
signed by “The Black Dogs,” who
made a jest of this tragedy of child-
hood before or after it reached its
conclusion. We confess that we do
not know under which section of the
Penal Law they should be prosecuted

if they merely took advantage of an |

opportunity to torment Birry CrarK’s
guardians; perhaps nothing in that
imposing volume covers their case;
but even then they need not go un-
punished. They might, for example,
be consigned to the care of a police-
man who has children of his own;
if they were we fear they would re
sist the officer in the discharge of his
duty and subsequently get a part of
what they deserve.

 

4n Encouraging Aspect ef the Mex-
fean Situation.

The desire of the Carranza Gov-
ernment to avoid a breach with the
United States that might precipitate
intervention appears in every note
dealing with the movements of the
American punitive expedition in Mex-
ico, and particularly {n the statement
made by Sefior Amapor, Sub-Secre-

tury of Foreign Relations, in the city |

of Mexico, on Friday. This attitude
of the Carranza Government is reas-
suring when unconfirmed reports of
encounters between Mexicans and
American regulars are current on the
border, and it is comforting to know
that there was more fiction than
truth in the first news of the clush
at Parral.

Sefior Amanporn in the statement he
gave out at the city of Mexico nfter
General Canranza's entgy, a state-
ment notable for {ts moderation and
good ‘sense, declared--we have no
doubt he was well informed—that
“the attack on the Americans in Par-
ral was due to the influence of ene-
mies of the de facto (iovernment.”
Sefior Amapos also said that “the
Mexican Government believes in the
friendship of the United States, ‘and
believes that the present crisis will
puss, leaving relations more cordial
than ever.” Oan there be any doubt
that he spoke for the First Chief?
An examination of the notes trans-
mitted by the Carranza Government
previous to the outbreak at Parral re-
venls grave concern lest a misunder-
standing or an untoward incident may
cause complications between the two
countries, Thus, efter proposing lim-
{tations upon the commanders of
forces that cross the line under the
reciprocal agreement, the Mexican
note of March 18 says;

“If confusion occurs and damage is
done to one of the parties by the other

age ahaill be held personally responsible,

oature that leads him to do the wrong |©f the contracting parties, nor shall such

act be considered aufficient to cause a
rupture of the relations between the
countries.”

Parral is a case in point. For the
disturbance that occurred there the
Carranza Government {s not disposed
to hold the Americans responsible,
and thé information we now have in-
dicates that the officer {n command of
our troops did not disobey his orders
to refrain from occupying towns and
making a show of force in or near
them. It must be admitted that on
all points there was not a meeting
of minds, to use a: legal phrase, in
the correspondence between the two
Governments upon the’ scope and
movements of the American erxpedi-
tion; but it must be remembered that
when the note of March 18 was
delivered General Pensnina had al-
ready entered Mexico in pursuit of
Vira with, as Secretary Lansino
had good reason to believe, the sanc-
tion of the Carranza Government.
But there was ngreement in essen-
tials, and the good faith of the Wash-
ington Government was unquestion-
able. Still, the Mexican notes con-
tinued to deal with limitations of
time and space as if the American
force had not penetrated Mexico and
was far south of Casas Grandes, and
the American note of April 5 in turn
discussed conditions that had no re-
lation to the progress of the American
troops, And it was not until the
clash came at Parral that the Car-
ranza Government in a fever of anx-
fety pleaded for the recall of the ex-
pedition and pointed to the limitations
laid down formally in its notes to
the State Department.

The situation remains delicate and
perilous, but the First Chief and his
advisers, civil and military, seem to
be ready at all times to cooperate
with the Washington Goverament
with a view to avoiding complications
that may cause hostilities hetween
the two countries. This being the
case, Parral should cease to be a
provocation, and so long as organized
Carranza .troops do not attack the
Americans negotiations to regulate
the punitive expedition can be car-
ried on with the hope of an agree-
ment satisfactory to both sides.

; What does it cost to go to college?

The average annual expenditure of a
girl at Smith College, we learn by the
Alumnae Quarterly of that excellent
jand representative institution, is
|$765.55. “Averages” would be at once
{more dignified and less persuasive if
they discarded the cents. Some stu-
dents get through the year on less than
$400; seven spend more than $1,600.
Of 421 girls at Smith College, 236 keep
the total cost of a collegiate year's liv-
ing under $750.

The average girl uses 87.4 per cent.
of her money for necessaries, 8.2 per
cent. for recreation, dues, church and
charity, and 4.3 per cent. for books.
Her account book is said to show
$35.09 for “recreation, hospitality and
extra food.” Divided into four groups
according to expenditure, $350-$600,
$600-$500, $800-$1,000, and $1,000 and
over, only two items have the same
rank in the list: board and room, the
item of greatest expense, and recrea-
tion, fifth in all the groups.

Clothing, which ranks sixth in the
first group, is second in all the others:
books are fourth for the girla who
| have less than $600 to spend, and
(sixth for the others. Group one puts
church in ninth place and laundry last
of the ten items; in the others, that
relation Ls reversed.

Is the cost of the girl’s education
increasing? The tuition fee has re-
cently been raised $50, but the exami-
nation, which appears to have been
made with more than ordinary regard
j for reasonableness which does not ul-
ways consort with mathematical aver-
ages, leads to the conclusion that “a
normal and happy college life is not
necessarily more expensive to-day
than it was twenty years ago." Money
has to-day no more and no, less than
it had twenty years ago to do with
“success” in college.

And the college gir) of to-day runs

WHY HE REFORMED.

The Professional Weiter Reselves to
Be of fome Use tm the! World.

“There are people in the world,”
said the reformed writer, “who have
intelligence enough to‘atifie their in-
clinations ‘before they are strong
enough to become passions. This, 1
take it, is the reasun why not every-
body in the world writes for a living.
It is so fatally easy to sit down with
@ pen and write something that
@omebody will pay something for that
the wonder is that not everybody does
it. The only Way to account for this
is that some are clear sighted enough
to resist the initial temptation. There
are others who abandon the pursuit
as T have done, after having entered
upon it, but they are so few as not
to be worth counting if a census were
to be taken.

“Once a person becomes obsessed
with the notion that some importance
attaches to his expreasion of his own
thoughts he begins to feel the faact-
nation to which so many yield. And
once he hag received pay for some-
thing he has written, no matter what
it is, the chances are that he will be
convinced that he has discovered his
true vocation. A career is open to
him which requires no other qualifica-
tion than a little stationery and some
facility of utterance: Equipped with
these he proceeds to utter, and a
most surprising number of persons
with no other qualification than these
achieve success in the sense that they
do actually make some sort of a living
by writing.

“Now this is a great mystery. I can
bee only one explanation of it. That
is that the whole world has gone mad
about reading. Very few people care
particularly what they read, but every-
body reads. So there is a great de-
mand for printed matter, regardless
of any merit in the atuff that is
printed, and there you are, Somebody
has to write the stuff, so multitudes
of writers make a living who have, as
I said, no further qualification than
stationery and a flow of words. How
else can we account for the enormous
sales of some of the publications of
the day?

“My own reformation began with an
uneasy feeling that I might better be
of some use in the world, even if it
“were only in a small way, so I set
up a boot blacking stand. By work-
ing faithfully at that I can make more
than the average pay of a professional
writer, and I can at least improve the
appearance of my customers’ under-
standing.”

When Colone] Roosevelt returned from
the Spanish war, in September, 1898,
and was nominated by the Republican
party for Governor of New York, Mr.
Schurz published a long letter opposing
ving his reasons
therefor. From thie letter, which filled
a column and a half on the first page
of the Evening Post of October 22, 1898,
I will, with your permission, make the
following citations: ‘

Will you permit me, in support of Mr.
Schurz’s views, to quote also this pas-
sage from the editorial columns of the
New York Times of November 1, 1898:

Mr. Roosevelt presents himself as a
Great fighting man. a beilever in keeping
the flag wherever it has been planted and,
in maintaining @ big army and @ powerfu! |
navy. He is presented by Mr. Egan as the
foe of closer relations for peace with our
close kin across the sea and as a man of
notable dash. Mr. Schurs said the other
day that a large number of votere were
afraid of Roosevelt for those very rea-
eons. We think Mr. Schurz waa right.

Colonel Roosevelt was elected Gover-
nor in spite of the alleged fears of him
as a “fighting man, a believer in keep- |
ing the flag wherever it had been,
planted” (atrocious doctrine!), and
later became President, holding that of-
fice for seven and a half years. What
happened through his “influence upon
the foreign policy of the republic’ dur-|
ing that period? Here is a partial list
of the outcomes of his “hot impulses
and his extreme notions of militant
imperialism.” I arrange them in chron-
oiogical order, showing that there was
at least one each year of his administra-
tion :

1902.—Arbitration of the European
claims against Venezuela. When he
forced the Kaiser to coneent to arbitrate

1903.—-(a) Settlement of the Alaskan,
roundary question. (b) Righteous peace!
with Turkey, with protection of American
lives and property,

ee  —

 

 

 

1904.—Protection of ilves anf property
of Americans in Morocco. (Perdicaris
care.)

1905 —-(a) Peace between Japan and
Russta. (b) Polley of open door in China!

rescued from destruction. |

19606.—-Aigectras convention,
equitable commercial relations
Momeco and European nations.

1907.—Cruise of the American fleet
around the world, which restored friendly
relations with Japan.

Ie there a record of services for peace |
by any other President that surpasses,
that? In recognition of his service in
bringing about peace between Japan and,
Russia he received the Nobel prize and
a letter of hearty congratulation from |
Carl Schurz. During his Presidency of}
seven and a half years not a shot was |
fired against a foreign foe, and when he)
retired from office the United States was,
at peace with all the world. '

White Plains and the Second James. |

To THE Epitror or THe Sun— Sir: The
news from White Plains in THe SUN to-
day as to the New York Central's hav-

ing no right to land deeded by King
James Il, of England in 18697 to
Stephanus Van Cortlandt is at once
startling and disconcerting,

Inasmuch as James Il, ceased to be

King of Kngland in 1688, his successor
being William of Orange (William IIL),
unless there is some error in the year,
Jumes IL, who died in exile at St.
Germain, France, in 1791, could not
very well have made a grant of land
as a King in 1697 by reyal patent

Yet there may be some sort of basis
for the statement, as Charles Tl made
a grant of land in 1664 in the New
Netherlands to his brother, the Duke
of York, afterward James II, The quenr-
tlon then is, What ‘disposition was made
of that grant after James's ignominious

flight to France and the end of the

THE BOWERY OF OLD.

Some First Hand Reminiscences of a
Famous Thoroaghfare.

To tHe Epiror or Pus Sun—Sir:
came to New York and got @ job
Garvin's machine shop in the Carnell
Building, 189 Centre street, in the oepring
of 1886, I roomed at the London and
Liverpool lodging house over the Lon-
don and Liverpool clothing store. The
rooms were box stalls, A twenty-two
inch wide cot took up about half of the
room. At the elde of the head of the
bed was a closet with an sup-
to hold a sult of clothes.

i tet from the top of the closet was
a shelf to tay a hat or any emall article
on. A foot from the bottom of the closet
was another shelf for your shoes, and
under this you could place a sinall
sult case, We paid 25 cents a night for
the privilege of sleeping in one of these
stalls if the bugs would allow you to
sleep or some crank that had the jim-
jams did not get a fit and climb over
the partition and holler that the devil
was after him or rats - = or other
reptiles did not distu m.

The National Theatre as 1 remember
it was on the left going north, about
the middle of the block between Hester
and Grand streets. I think F. A. Wal-
lace wax the manager, and his wife and

two children were at the same time on)’

the stage. Wallace was always the
leading character and fis wife took all
the leading parte, Young Wood played
Western sketches and detective stories
taken from the nickel novels like Nick
Carter. Wood now ts writing moving
picture plays. Delany, a character, was
the heavy villain. Marston sang a little
and took comic parts, Sometimes Mrs.
Wallace, or Edna Wallace, as she was
called, took small girl parts, but she
was rather large and was a fine formed
woman and as a small girl she showed
considerable of a fine pair of legs, The
Wallaces when ey rae oe a 6
went to Long Island an oo

farm, 1 was told by a ohe legged man
who sold fruit from a pusheart for
many years in front of the National
Theatre.

1 saw this same man six years ago
near Bleecker street, still with his Dush-
cart, He told me most of the old Wal-
jace company were dead.

Owney Geoghegan had
across the street from the London and
Liverpool lodging house, I think it was
101, Next to that was Worth's East
Side Museum, at 103. Going north on
same side, or east side, next to the mu-
eum was the Little White Elephant. 1
believe thig was a liquor saloon, but
various games were indulged in there
and rooms could be had upstairs. Tf
have been told the old Thalia Theatre
was below Canal street. Here I have
seen “Mazeppa” played. Here Fanny
Herring and other women played the
part of a captured prince and were
lashed to the back of a white horse.
I think the characters were taken from
a book called “Thaddeus of Warsaw.
North of the Thalia Theatre was
Cramer's resort. I cannot recall the
name of the place at this time, At-
lantiec Garden was a respectable Ger-
man beer garden where the better class
of Germans at that,time took or met
their families after business hours in the
afternoon of Saturdays. Many times
these Germans would not go home till
late Sunday morning.

Next, north of here, was a emall place
with a small platform where the half
drunken men and many sailors used to
go. The women that resorted here
wore tights and clotl@s very short
at top and bottom. Oftentimes you
could see half a dozen women sitting
on as many sailors’ laps drinking, and
hugging them.

On the east side of the Bowery at
that near Chatham Square and
under the shadow of the elevated rafl-
road was a museum of anatomy. A
fairly gaod looking man by the name of
Doc Metonnell ran thie place, and in-
side they had a small room where they
{nduced many young men to have their
heads examined, telling them what pro-
fessions would be best for them to fol-
low. The cost of the examination was
$3. They gave you a copy of Fowler
& Wells's book on phrenology. If they
saw you had some money to spare they

a boxing resort

time

there was a show case with a lot o
articles marked with numbers. While
you were examining these things a

rough dressed young man came in and
paid a quarter to draw an envelope from
a box on the counter. From the envelope
he took a card, and the number corre-
sponded with a card on a pear! handled
revolver valued at $15. The young man

displayed it for sure tinie, opened it,
put it in his pocket, then pulled it out
and looked at it some more. Then Dr

McConnell said to him, kind of on the
tly but loud enough for all the rest to
hear, “I will give you $15 for that gun
and another chance.” The young man
would take three $5 bills, thank the’ Doe,
draw another envelope and get out

Then the rest of the gang would draw,
and some get a five cent diamond ring
and so forth, but of them oof any
value until the same capper came in and
drew a prize and restored it and got a
big price tn theatre money.

There was a ten cent museum on
Chatham Square on the west side, only
one story high: but this was more of a
resort for the girls of the street to pick
up chance countrymen and sailors.

At night the Jerseymen used to stop
on Park Row at Jim Fisk's restaurant
or Boss Tweed's restaurant. Here you
could get three fried ergs, pint bow! of
coffee, bread and butter, dish of fried
potatoes and lettuce or radishes, all for
ten cents,

Near Houston street was the Globe
Museum, tan cents: freaks swallowing
swords, elastic skin men and the man
Venus with a breast like a weman, but
no examination allowed Ifere L saw
the man and woman who under Bar-
nhum's inanagement were represented as
the connecting links between monkey
and man. Afterward each had a plece
of white sheep's wool fastened to the

top of the head to show that they were
turning to animals again, The Dicker-
son sisters were here, dancing and sing-

ing, Maud took male characters and
dressed in men's clothes She was a
boxer and used to box a Newman

woman from Jersey City. Maud Dicker-
son afterward married a deputy mar-
shal in Paterson, Alice was a tine, large

Old Peter Cooper used to come out

FIVE SENATORS L0S
BY GRRRYMANDER

Reapportionment. Bill Intro.
duced at Albany Gives New
York City 24.

 

 

ONE LESS IN ASSEMBLY

 

Arsany, April 16—Tie bill reappy
tioning the Senate and Aasenibly cis.
tricts of the State was introduced tn
both houses to-day and advanced t) -he
order of final passage so that It can be
passed readily next week.

Senator Charles W. Wicks of Oneida
chairman of the Reapportionment Com.
mittee, introduced the bill in the Senate
Assemblyman Machold of Jefferson of
fered the bill in the Assembly.

The measure ax drawn forces out a1
the Senate five of the present members,

for it puts their districts in with the
districts of five other* Senators, The
Senators combined are Lawson and tii).
christ of Kings, Republicans ; Cullen and
Heffernan of Kings, Democrats; Mills
and Bennett, Republicans, Manhattin,
and four Republican up-State Senators
Hill of Broome and Jones of Chenango,
and Sander of Genesee and Newton of
Livingston.

Queens county gains one Senate dis
trict, giving Greater New York a totai
of twenty-four Senators out of the tota)
of fifty-one. The greater city, however,
jones one of its Assembly districts. Man-
hattan and The Bronx get only thirty-
one instead of thirty-five. Kings retains
its twenty-three districts; Queens gets
six instead of four and Richmond gete
two instead of one.

Other District Changes.

.

Other changes In the Assemi'y dis-
tricts follow :

Broome county gets two in:tead of
@ne; Erie county loses one district, ge
ting eight instead of nine; Jefferson
lores one district, having one instead of
two; Nassau gains a district, getting
two in the new bill; Schenectady gain:
a district, getting two instead of one
Ulster gets one instead of two; West-
chester gains one, getting five instead of
four.

One of the important. changes in the’
Senate representation te in Manhattan
where the district of Senator Ogden 1.
Mills has been enlarged so thut it in-
cludes part of the district of Senator
William Bennett, in which Mr. Benne:
lives,

Mr. Bennett, who was elected Senator
as a Republican and Progressive, has
already announced that he {is to run in
the primaries as a candidate for Gov
ernor on the Republican ticket, which of
necessity means that he will retire from
the Senate.

In Kings county two Republican Sena-
tors are thrown together and two Demo
crats also come together. The Repub-
licans are Senator Robert R. Lawsen and
Senator Alfred J. Gilchrist. One of
them must retire from the Senute
cause of this combination. The l'*mo-
crats are Senator Willlam J. Heffer
and Senator Thomas H. Cullen, who
has served continuously in the Lega
ture since 1896. He had three s+a'-
the Assembly and since 189% he
tained his place in the Senate ‘
expected that Heffernan, Who his serve

be

 

only eince 1913, will give way ‘to Culer,
who is known as the dear tie
