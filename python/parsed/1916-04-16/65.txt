Setting Has Played a More Important Part

T

ways played a more important
part’ in the impression they have pro-
duced on the public than the actors, or
the managers concerned with putting
them before their patrons, have ever
realized. There were, of course, no prob-
lems for Shakespeare, whe had his means
at hand and put tis dramas on as fast
as he wrote them with whatever facili-
thes he and his) associates controlled.
Naturally he wrote for the theatre of
his day and respected its limitations It
happened thet these limitations formed
the style of Elizabethan drama. bur

the great Mlizabethan. So it was evident
that something had be done to bring back
the

interest of the public to a form of
drama which was languishing, for one rea-
son, because there were no great inter-

preters of Shakespeare's characters grow-

ing up. Undoubtediy a demand on the
part of the public for the plays of Shake-
speare would have brought into existence

some great actors of his characters, But
the public had shown signs of impatience

so long ago as the middle of the nine-
teenth century. Samnel Pheips met the
new demand by his wonderful spectacular

productions of the Shakespearian plays at
the Princess Theatre. Here was also arche-
ological and histories! accuracy to gild the
pill. The successes of Phelps at the Princess
Theatre inevitably created a tradition whieh
has survived down to our present time.
It is not unfair, however, to say that it is
gradually coming to an end. Silk and can-
vas, the skill of painters and carpentera,
singers and dancers were all to be bought
for money. They were costiy maybe: but
they were at least attainable. Of course,
a flash of genius cannot be bought for all
the gold of Golconda,

So the tradition of richly spectacular
Shakespeare continued down to the golden
days of Henry Irving and Ellen Terry, and
now Herbert Beerbohm Tree has taken up
the torch, What he has accomplished
may be observed at the New Amsterdam
Theatre. This is the typical spectacular
Shakespeare which flourished in England
from the days of Phelps. In our own
theatre there was little that might be com-
pared with the splendor of these imported
productions, Augustin Daly followed far
behind them so far as spectacle came into
question, Occasionally Richard Mansfield
would buy a second hand production from
one of the famous English producers who
did not expect to bring it to this country
But not until the lavish expenditure of
James K. Hackett in his “Macbeth” and
“The Merry Wives of Windsor’ was there
any spectacle of American origin to be com-
pared with the investiture of the Shake-
Spearian dramas which Henry Irving
brought to this country.

But there came by degrees a conviction
in the minds of audiences that there might
be, after all, a way of acting Shakespeare

that would preserve more of the
spirit of the original than this appeal
to the eye to the expense of so many
other possible qualities. Would it not be

better, for instance, to have more of the
beautiful verse of the poet—in those Plays
in whieh the verse is beautiful—and more
swiftness of action than to alt during the
frequent intermissions before a curtain
while the acenery was changed and the
orchestra ground out appropriate music
from Germon, Sullivan or Mendelssohn,
