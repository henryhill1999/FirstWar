Collecting Old Locomotives

OLLECTING photographs of old}

( " locomotives may seem a bit!

prosaic to some poopie, Nevers;

theless there are a lot of people:
in this country who follow this fad |
with all the interest and enthusiasm of ,
the most ardent numismatist or phi- |
latelist. In fact, a comparison of!
stemps and coins with original photo- |
graphe of the earliest American loco: |
motives leaves, in their opinion, the
advantage all on the side of the ivco-!
They |
treasure thelr collections o#8 much ae)
any boy does his stamp album.

In comparison with those who coi-
lect coins or stamps the number of
collectors of old locomotive pictures is |
small, naturally. Yet there are in the
country several thousands of these
collections. It is not a new collecting
fed by any means. Some of the col-

years or more.

Very few railroad men are numbered
among the collectors. Among the}
owners of the largest collections of
this kind are a banker, an insurance
man, a lumberman, a botanist and a
clergyman. Most of them worked up
an enthusiasm for the locomotive back |
in their boyhood days. This led them
to compile a pictured history of its
development. They have kept track !
of almost every screw and bolt that
has been added since the days of the!
old De Witt Clinton. The size and
type of cylinders, connecting rods,
emokestacks and tenders mean as
much to them as do the marks on
stamps and coins to those who collect
such things.

This collecting fad has its rules and
ite prices just like the others. Vic-
tures are traded and high prices are
paid for originals. The original photy-
@raphs of the early locomotives--taken
of course years after they had been
running. because photography was not
known in their early days--command
high prices. Ii is not unusual for a
collector to pay $25 for the privilege
of copying one of these originals.
Those who have gone into the fad ex-
tensively keep in close touch swith one
another and know at all times the,
state of the market and the proper
vaiue to be placed on pictures which
they desire to add to their colections.

One of the largest collections of tils
kind belongs to Join W. Merrill, an,

fMsurance man in Boston. It com- |
prises over 3,000 pictures and has
taken him fifteen years to get

together. Mr. Merrill keeps the pic-
tures in a safe which he had made for
the purpose and has given instructions |
to the local fire department that if
his house ever burns the safe in to
be saved even at the expense of the’
house .

A collection of jocomotive pictures
even larger than that of the Boston
man is the property of Charlies b.
Cheney. a surveyor, of Hrvoklyn.
There are over 4,000 pictures in Mr.
Cheney's collection and he has bien at
{t for over twenty-five years. The
collection is mounted in four aibums. |
The owner has gone all over the}
country taking pictures of locomotives
Of apecial types to add to it.

Arthur Curran of New York, who
has written extensively about early
locomotives, has a collection compris-
ing over 2,000 photographs. Mr. Cur- |
ran, however, has specialized more on!
early New York Ceniral and New

 

 

 

 

 

Haven locomotives. He has a picture ;
of the De Witt Clinton taken tnirty- |
five years ago by the road's official
photographer which is prized highly
by collectors. Another picture is that
of the Joha Bull, the Pennsylvania's |
oldest locomotive. which was imported |
from England in 1830, This picture was
taken when it was resurrected in 1893
and sent to the world’s fair at Chicago)
under its own steain.

Bit on that account. In fact some ot
the property ownera will breathe 4}
sigh of relief when this distinction has |
tecome a thing of the past. |

The plant in question happens to be |
the sunken British steamer Matatua, |
@ craft of about 6,500 tons, which had |
to be scuttled to put out a fire that
threatened to destroy her. besides,
this was the likeliest way to save some
of her cargo. But this wholesale
ducking aroused the chemical ac-
tivity of a troublesome part of her
freight—about 300 tons of calcium
carbide, Hence the acetylene plant
referred to.

The Matatua left New York about a |
month ago for St. John, where she was |
to take on the last of her cargo, con- |
gisting of more than 400 automudiles, |
tons of steel ralls, lots of cast iron
Piping. a quantity of wood alcohol and
the calcium carbide already men-
tioned, The last was packed in metal !
tanks holding each about 240 pounds,
end the drums were stowed away in
seven of the cargo spaces fore and aft
wherever they could be squeezed in
aroung or between other freleht. In
the language of the sea they were
used as dunnage, or a steadying sup-
port for other cargo. This arrange-
Ment was not a wise one, for more
Peasons than one. The shippers real-
fue this now.

All went well with the steamship un- |
tl she was full laden and actually out
in the stream and ready to leave St,
