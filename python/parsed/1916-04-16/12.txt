PutLapeuputa, April 15.—Pat Moran's
hampion Phillies beat the Giants in®the
ibber gamté of the opening series by aj
score of & to 4 this afternoon, It was!
he same tally that the titleholdera hung |
ip opening day and victory came to |
them in almost as fluky a fashion. |
Cateher Bill Rariden was tnetrumental
inis afternoon, as on Wednesday, in un-
iermining a pretty good afternoon's
sork for New York.

Rariden spilled the beans in the third |

nning with a very senseless throw that

«ded greatly in the manufacture of three
aaa EO
;

ins for the l’hillles. The Glants in a
same upliill fight got back those three
suns, But it took a lot of deep think-
ng @n the part of McGraw to accomplish
hat much. Mac had to Juggle his pitch-
rx and pinch hitters so that he came
down to the last inning with his hopes
esting on the more or lesa untried Rube
Schauer. Bill Rariden could not handle
ldube's speedy ones. Between the two
if them they fussed around till they sim-
ply pressed the game on Philadelphia.

Tt has been said that the Phillies were
icky champions. They looked the part
o-day. Kverything broke in their favor.

, Phe Giants got only six hits off Al Dem-
aree, Inst year's hoodoo, bui they hit
the ball hard enough to have amassed
twice that number under ordinary cir-
cumstances. On the other hand the
Phils had several very scratchy blows,
vut every one of them figured directly in
un making.

Wilbert Robinson's band of Dodgers
continued their weird exhibition of the
national pastime yesterday and the Bos-
ton Braves again triumphed at Whbbete

Bill McKechate, best of them, ecoring a man each time.

It wae te Magee's bludgeon,
however, that finally won for the Braves. |
With the ecore 2 all as a regult of a rally
by the Dodgers in the sixth and with two
men on he tripled to left centre. It
was a mighty clout. Had the fleld been
heard the sphere would have rolled and!

a

Bill McKechnie, former player of the
Ametrican, National a Federal leagues,
who was tried at @hird base by Mc-
Graw in Philadelphia yesterday, te not
under contract to the Glants. McKechnie
is still the property of Harry F. Sinclair,
the Federal magnate.

Pat T. Powers was in Philadelphia
yesterday as gagent of Sinclair trying
to sell the player's release to President
Harry N. Hempstead of the Giants.
Hempstead said last night that he and
Powers were unable to agree upon a
price. Ile admitted that the Giants
might close a deal for the third baseman
before Monday's game.

McKechnie, who was knocking about)
the major and fast. minor leagues for
several years before he jumped to the
Federals in 1914 and became a star with
the outlaws was regarded ag a very weak
hitter. In wveeterday's game at Philadel-
phia he falled to get a hit, but he scored
a run from a base on balls, and stole
a base. He also had iwo timely assists.

There is little IHkelfhood of Sinclair
realizing uny great price on this player.
But Mctjraw is so badly in need of a
Ahird baseman at present that he may
pay more than he would if Lobert, Hun-
ter and Brainard were not out of com-
mission,

As it was the ball sank almost at the,
spot where it came back to earth.
Casey Stengel tossed a scare into the
Braves in the eighth, when he drove the
ball to centre fleld, hitting the fence just
to the right of the Bedford avenue exit. |
He got three bases on it, but was nippss
at the plate in trying for one tore.
rounding third he hesitated for‘a on
ment and it was by that fraction of a_
rubber. That and the sixth were the
only two chances to score which the!
had. In the other frames, with
the exoeption of the fifth, they managed
to get one hit, with nothing coming of it.

for two innings, allowing only three men
to face him each time. Fred Snodgrass, |

ex-Giant, opened the third with a single
to left. Gowdy hit one to O'Mara, and
as the latter juggied it Snodgrass
reached second, while Gowdy was safe
at first. Hughes forced Snodgrass at
third, Bmith to Gets. Maranville put one
in Cutshaw's territory and as the latter
fumbled around Gowdy raced home with |
the first run.

New Haven, Conn, April 15.-—In @
game marked by loose fielding and er-

Tho Yanks gave a live, sippy, fight-
ing exhibition, and, to tell the truth
without fear or favor, had no end of
luck in smothering hot drives extracted
by the Washington bats from the Fisher
pitching.

To be more exact, Fisher, rather than
his team, was the lucky one, There was
slashing flelding back of him in pinches,
the sort which causes the rooter to jump
to his feet and exult, and his salvation
was in large part due to fine defence
at critical times and to having liners
go straight to flelders. However, Fisher
} worked hard and earnestly and, braced
by his good support, improved in hie
pitching. Hoe was hit freely tn the firet
part of the game and was decidedly ef-

cluding Beck's terrific home run drive to
deep centre, scored three runs for Colum-
bia. A triple and a siugle in the next:
frame brought hia retirement, Garfield
then vaking the box for Yale.
