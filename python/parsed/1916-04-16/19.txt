Passover, the principal Jewish spring !
festival, begins to-morrow evening. RBe- |
fore noon to-morrow all leavened food
niust be removed from every Jewish
home, No leavened food may be qaten
by a Jew throughout the entire eight
days of the festival, matzos (unleavened |
bread) being substituted. |

On the first two days of the Pass-'
over and on the last day abstinence |
from work and attendance at special,
services at the eynagogues is required
of every Jew. The first two evenings
of the feast are marked by a special
ceremonial meal service, the Seder, held
in every Jewish home, At the Seder
the Haggadah, which relates the story of
the miracles connected with the de-
liverance of the ancient Hebrews from
slavery in Exypt, will be read by the!
head ef the family. The eating of bit-|
ter herbs and the paschal lamb to com- |
memorate the exodus from Egypt a |
also enjoined by the Seder ritual. }
