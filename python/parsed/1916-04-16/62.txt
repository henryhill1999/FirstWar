GREAT ACTORS WHOSE

DWIN BOOTH was the second son of
Junius Brutus Booth, the celebrated
English actor, and was born in
Belair, Maryland, November 13,

1698. His first regular appearance on the
gtage was at the Boston Museum in Sep-
tember, 1849, with his father in “Richard
fii.” Members of the theatrical profession,
who held the elder Booth's acting in great

reverence, seemed to agree that the genius.

of the father had not descended on the son.
His father, too, was disappointed with his
acting.

Fdawin Booth’s first appearance in New
York was at the National Theatre in Chat-
ham etreet in September, 1850. A year
later in consequence of the illness of the
elder Booth the son took his place in the
part of Richard II7, It was not until the
death of his father, however, that hfs bril-
lant acting won recognition. He toured
extensively and his Hamlet, Richard and
Richelieu were highly praised.

In 1862 he became manager of the Win-
ter Garden Theatre, New York, where he
gave a series of Shakespearian produc-
tions of a magnificence unexampled up to
that time. The splendor of this period of
his career, however, was temporarily ex-
tinguished when in 1865 his brother, John
Wilkes Booth, assassinated President Lin-
coln. The three Booth brothers, Junius
Edwin and John Wilkes, had
played together in “Julius Cwsar” in the
autumn of the previous year—the perform-
ance being memorable both for its own
excellence and for the tragic situation
into which two of the principal performers
were hurled by the subsequent crime of
the third. Edwin Booth did not appear
on the stage for some time after the as-
gssination. Then he played Hamlet at
the Winter Garden Theatre, the audience
showing by unstinted applause that no
grudge was held against him on account of
the infamy of his brother.

In 1869 Booth built a theatre of his own
at Twenty-third street and Sixth avenue,
New York, and organized a splendid stock
company which was distinguished by us-
ing the true text of Shakespeare, thus an-
tedating by several years a similar reform
in England. Yn 1874 Booth failed finan-
cially, and it was many years before he
rebuilt his fortune. He converted his resi-
dence on Gramercy Park into the Players
Club for the elect of the profession, retain-
ing only a small apartment for himself,
where he died June 7, 1893.

His most famous part was Hamlet, for
which his extraordinary gifts peculiarly
fitted him. He probably played the part
oftener than any other actor before or
since,

dier and biographer, was born of Irish
parents April 4, 1838, at Paterson, N. J.

as Murad in “The French Spy" in 1853.
In December, 1856, he made his first New
York appearance in, “The Hunchback.”

His career as a soldier in the Civil War

liew in Bulwer Lytton’s drama was _ his
best part.

the second Wallack’s Theatre from 1861 te
1882. In 1882 he opened the third and last
Wallack's Theatre at Thirtieth street and
Broadway, which he conducted with great
liberality and artistic success, although
the financial results were less satisfactory.

He himself was a popular actor, espe-
cially in comedy. His greatest successes
were as Charles Surface, as Benedick and
especially as Elliot Grey in his own play,
“Rosedale,” and in similar light comedy and
romantic parts, for which his fascinating
manners and handsome person well fitted
him, He was the author of several other
plays, but “Rosedale” is the best known of
his works. He also wrote his own “Mem-
ories of Fifty Years.”

He married a sister of Gir John Millais.
He died at Stamford, Conn., in 1886.

| John Maccullough

John Maccullough was born at Blakes,
near Coleraine, Londonderry, Ireland, Nov.
14, 1832, of extremely poor parents. His
father was unable to provide for hie large
family and in 1847 John and his eleter Jane
emigrated to America. They had heard of
a cousin named John Maccullough {n Phila-
delphia. The immigrant boy and his
sister found him and John obtained work
in his cousin's chair factory.

His dramatic faculty was developed by
the accident of his
stagestruck fellow workman in the shop.
He made his firat appearance on the stage
at the Arch Street Theatre, Philadelphia,
under the management of William
Wheatley and John Drew in 1867. Hise
rise in the dramatic profession was gradual.

In support of Edwin Booth and Edwin
Forrest he played second rolea in Shake-
spearian and other tragedies. Forrest left
him by will all his prompt books. In 1866,
when he accompanied Forrest to California
he was received with immediate and un-
common favor. He remained in Calt-
fornia with the consent of Forrest and
undertook, with his distinguished contem-
porary, Lawrence Barrett, the management
of the California Theatre, and writers have
declared that this period was a brilliant
chapter in the history of the dramatic
profession on the Pacific coast.

Virginiue was his greatest success, and
he played that part and others with favor
in New York and London. In 1884 he
broke down mentally and physically and
died in an asylum in Philadelphia in 1885.

William Winter, in a remarkable sketch
of Maccullough, says: “When John Mac-
cullough, a youth of 15, came to America
he could read but he could not write. He
received no education and was in ignorance
of literature and art. Dying thirty-eight
years later, he had become a man of large
and varied mental acquirements, a con-
siderable scholar in the dramatic profes-
sion, and the most conspicuous heroic ac-
tor of his time on the American stage, Such
a career, beginning in obscure and ignorant
penury and ending in culture, honorable
eminence, prosperity and fame, is extraor-
dinary, and in dramatic annals it makes
John Maccullough a memorable name.”

Fanny Davenport

    

Fanny Lily Gipsy Davenport was the
daughter of the celebrated actor Edward
I~acmis Davenport. She was born in Lon-
don in 1850 and was brought to America
as a child and educated in Boston. When
7 years old she appeared at the Howard
Athenwum in Boston as the child of
Veftamora, but her real debut was at Nib-
ios Garden in) February, 1862, as Wing
or Spain in “Faint Heart Never Won Fair
Ludy.”

While playing at the old Arch Street
Theatre, Philadelphia, under the manage-
ment ot Mrs. John Drew she attracted the
attention of Augustin Daly, who promptly
gave her a place in his Fifth Avenue Thea-
tre in Is0%. Afterward she visited the
principal cities of the country in a wide
variety of roles, both comedy and tragedy.

Among her greatest successes were those
won in Sardou’s “Fedora,” “La Tosca,” and

d’Arc as the heroine. Ii was a failure and
it is thought that the consequent chagrin
hastened her final illness. She appeared
on the stage for the last time at the Grand
Opera House, Chicago, in March, 1898.

His first conspicuous success was as
Digby Grant in “The Two Roses." In 1871
he began his association with the Lyceum
Theatre, London. His success was imme-
diate. In 1874 he played Hamlet, The
unconventionality of his performance
aroused keen discussion and singled him
out as the most interesting English actor
of the day.

In 1878 Irving opened the Lyceum The-
atre under his own management. With
Ellen Terry as Ophelia and Portia, he re-
vived “Hamlet” and produced "The Mer-
chant of Venice." His Shylock was as
much discussed as hie Hamlet had been,

worthy period of the. English stage.

He died at Bradford while on a tour in
October, 1905, and was buried !n West-

Both on and off the stage Irving always
maintained a high jdeal of his profession
and in 1895 he received the honor of
knighthood, the firs; time it was ever ac-
corded an actor, He was also the recipient
of honorary degrees from the universities
of Dublin, Glasgow and Cambridge.

| Ellen Terry |

Ellen Alice Terry, who in private life ts
Mrs. Charles C, Wardell, was born in Cov-
entry, Iengland, February 27, 1848, of old
theatrical stock. She made her first ap-
pearance on the stage at the Princess The-

 

atre, London, at the tender age of eight

first time with Sir Henry Irving, playing
Katharina to his Petruchio in “Tam-
ing of the Shrew." In the following year

Ben De Bar

Ben De Bar, jong noted as a comedian,
Was born in Englind in Sid. His father
was steward of an estate and had an am-
bition to educate him for a business career.
At an early age, however, young De Bar
evinced a lively interest in the stage and
he made his first attempt on the boards in
the Enelish provinces.

Kor three years he played with inereas-
ink success on the London stage and then
came to America in 1834 and at the &t.
Charles Theatre, New Orleans, appeared
under the management of Caldwe!! as Sir
Benjamin Rackhite in “The School for
Seandal."| In 1887 he came to New York,
acting at the old National Theatre in var-
ious comedy roles,

Tt has been estimated that he aceumu-
lated a fortune of $600,000, Later he went
South and lost his money through the eon-
ditions brought about by the civil war. He
was a pronounced Secessionist and it was
at his home in st, Louis that Wilkes
Booth is sald to have obtained many of
the ideas which led to his assassination of
President Lincoln,

To recoup his financial losses De Bar
went on a starring tour and at thig period
Hlayed his best known role, that of Fal-
staff in “The Merry Wives of Windsor.”
He died at St. Louis in August, 1877,

conjecture that Shakespeare
lived and died unhonored rests on

no foundation of fact. The converse
alone is true, Shakespeare's eminence was
fully acknowledged by his contemporaries,
and their acknowledgments have long
been familiar to scholars,

Yet the reiterated assertion that Shake-
speare’s contemporaries left on record no
recognition of his worth proved that in-
formation or the subject was narrowly dif-
fused and that public intelligence suffered
by the strait limits as yet assigned to the
distribution of genuine knowledge of the

HOW THE BIBLE INSPIRED MANY
THINGS IN SHAKESPEARE

reason is twofold.

gome gfaphio force the working of the lew
of taste in literature.

The repute that Shakespeare acquises @&
his lifetime, though it was rarely defined
with subtlety, was in spirit all that ju-
dicious admirere could desire. The een
temporury estimate was authoritatively
summed up in the epitaph which was in-
scribed on his monument in Stratford-on-
Avon church soon after his death. In that
inacription he was hailed as the equal of
great }.eroes of classical antiquity—of Nee-
tor in wisdom, of Socrates in genius, of
Virgil in terary art; he was acknowledged
in plain terme to be the greatest of contem-
porary writers; all living writers were ée-
clared to be worthy only to serve him as
pages or menials.

Bhakespeare's epitaph, the significance of
which is not always appreciated, justifies
no doubt of the aupremacy that he enjoyed
in the English world of letters of his own
day. The homage of literary contempor-
aries was confirmed without faltering and
in finer phrase by Milton, the next qoeou-
pant of the throne of English letters,

No subsequent change of literary taste
or literary fashion in England really
dimmed Shakespeare's fame. In the days
of the Restoration, Dryden humbly 8¢-«
lanowledged discipleship to him. Some cen-
cure he suffered from thoughtless lips; but
the right to the rank of classic, which had
Been granted him as soon as the breath
left his body, was never effectually dis-
puted.

The formal critica of the eighteenth cene
tury eought to show that much of his
work deviated from formal standards or
from rules of formal art. But these cen-
sors gave him the worship of incessant
study. They edited and annotated his writ-
ings, with the result that a succeeding gen-
eration of readers acquired a more ac-
curate comprehension of his work than was
possible before. The triumphal progress
of Shakespeare's reputation was stimulated
by eighteenth century research and criti-
ciam to a quicker pace.

The critical faculty of the nation Was
erpecially acute and sagacious at the open-
ing of the ninteeenth century, and Sheke-
speare’s preeminence was then seen in
sharper outline and in fuller grandeur than
at any earlier epoch. The sympathetio in-
tuition of three early nineteenth century
critics—-Coleridge, Lamb and Hazlitt-—re-
maine unsurpassed. But there has beem no
trace of retrogression in the wise and rea-
soned enthusiasm of later generations of
the reading public.

The history of Shakespeare's fame ig in-
deed that of a flowing tide; the ebbing was
never long enough sustained to give it gen-
uine importance; the forward march waa
never seriously impeded, and is from start
to finish the commanding feature of the
chronicle,

  

 

First, elevated thought may be expected of either, and

e
M*= persons confuse the Bible and Shakespeare in placing quotations. The

second, the Authorized Version was produced in 1611, just when Shakespeare
was at the height of his career, so that the English of the time fs refleated

in both the Bible and his works.

But that Shakespeare knew his Bible well has been proved by many scholars. It
was only natural that he should draw upon the Scriptures for metaphors and even for
direct quotations, for in his day the Bible was the chief literature of England. The
various Fnglish versions current during his life were used in preparing the King James
version, so that even if he had in hand a Wyelif translation, for example, he might
well use the very words found in the authorized version.

Few except students of both Shakespeare and the Bible are aware of the large
number of direct quotations from the Bible to be found in the plays, and fewer etfil

know how often Shakespeare alludes to Biblical characters and phrases.
