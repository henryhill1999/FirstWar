Gustave Mahler's eighth symphony |
upon it. A younger and more alert
person sat beside him thoughtfully
reading the advertising signs under
the roof of the car. Suddenly she
said:

“How foolish to write such long
@riticisms of the Mahler symphony.”

“Why. it was an important event

in the activities of music in this town
and it called for extended

But the whole thing could have heen

“Of course, but what on earth has
that to do with it?

"Oh, [T just thought that one might

Was ‘Mehr Mahlere; als Ausdruck
der Empfindung.

Whereupon the heavy eyed man sub-
sided.

  
 

Some of the comments made on the
symphony of Mahler were interesting
because of their suggestions One
newspaper was moved to wrath be-
Cause more excitment was caused In
the symphony than had been caused
by the conducting of Mahler when he

 

was at the head of the Phichurmonk
Society But as this paper correctly
noted, there was no campaign of ad-
vertising in tavor of Mr. Mahler.
Nothing what r was done except
to spread abroad announcements that
the greatest con tor in Burope had
, been secured at an extraordinary
price and that in fact he could not
have been engaged at all hid not the

Metropolitan Opera House agreed to

insists that no small fuss wag made
about the engagement of Mahler.

Memory also recalls with great dist
tinctness the energy of the campaign
of slander, public and private, which
Was carried on against those few
newspaper writers who declined
Praise everything done by Mahier
Without consideration of ita actual
merit. However, let us grant what
is «iite true. The production of the

elehtl) symphony was advertised much
more skilfully than the conducting of
Mahler.

As this observer of musical doings
sat in his familiar seat surveying the
historic scene there came to him slowly
but overwhelmingly a perception of
the true centre of the event, Soine
800 Choristers clad in black and white
filled the big stage and faced the great
audience. In front of them the val-
uable Philadelphia Orchestra sat
Stretched across the extension of the
Stage into the auditorium

Facing the stage, in seats and boxes

in serricd rows rising from the na-
quet floor to the topmost gallery, a
remarkable audience sat absorbed. In

it were the leading representatives of
the musical life of this city. Pader-
ewski and Frank Damrosch sat in the
Morgan box, De Coppet, father of the

Plonziudeys, and Guillaume Stengel
were in another box. Rubin Goldmark,
teginald de Koven and Paolo Bal-

lico represented the musical club life

of the town Pianists, composers,
Singers, violinists and ‘cellists were
everywhere, And among them were

ths men and the women who support
such institutions as the New York
Symphony Society, the Philharmonic
the Kneisel Quartet, the Musical Art
Society

And in the very centre with his face
to the great chorus and his back to
the wudience was the real pivot upon
which the whole thing hung, Leopo'd
Stokowski, conductor of the

‘bert song.

At every ballet performance, previous |

to the opening of the curtains, whiai-
evei miusic may be played, little atten-
tion 18 accorded it. Talking, loud and
incessant, can be heard in various
parts of the house. Indeed there is
much talking while the action is in
progress. Some of the lovers of ba’-
let apparently do not care to hear the
music at any time

Those who do think about this music
at all regret that so few of the ballets
are provided with specially composed
scores “Les Sylphides.”’ “Carnival.”
“Scheherazade.” “Thamar,” “Le Spec-
tre de la Rose” and "“Cleopatre” are
musically adaptations. In the pase of
“Scheherazade” the story which hus
been invented to accompany Rimsky-
Korsakov's music has a very distant
relation to that which the composer
set out to illustrate in his musie. Le
was writing about Sindbad,
no reference whatever

to whom |
is made in the;

ballet. In fact the story of tho ballet
is a prologue to the entire Arabian
Nights. Even Scheherazade herself |
does not appear in it

The most symmetrical art works

thus far produced by the Ballet Russ»
are the two for which Stravinsky com-
posed music. Even in these the con-
nection between the score and
action {ts not always close. In
trouchka” particularly there are some
very bald spots where every one on
the stage wanders about aimlessly
waiting for the music to reach the
point at which the action may again
Much has been
told us about the marvellous genius
of Mr. Nijinsky. It is strange that
it does not prove itself equal to the

| simple task of devising some little illu-

 

 

sion for these halting places.

It is a great pity that every person
who attends the ballet does not make
a point of Iistening attentively to Stra-
vinsky’s music. Naturally there are
obvious bits which do not easily escape
any one’; notice. The music of the
hand organs, for example, and the
delightful trumpet travesty of the
scene between the Moor and the
Ballerine must catch the ear of the
Most casual listener.

But there are so many touches of
fine humor and fancy in the rest of
the score that one who does not hear
everything misses half the pleasure
of the entertainment. Meanwhile the
season has been enlivened by the ar-
rival of Nijinsky, whose art
further study on the part of lovers of
poetry and rhythm in dancing.

Two choral concerts in one week are
a large, number for New York. The
Columbia University chorus on Tues-
day evening brought to first perform-
ance “The Peace Pipe" of Frederick |
Converse and “The Black Knight” of
Sir Edward Elgar. The Oratorio So- |
ciety gave last evening rahms’s

Song of Fate” and Haydn's “Crea- | Aldine Giub, the “anetaiiation ofcothcerk

tion,” of which something is said elae-
where jn this paper.

The study of choral works is one of |
the best methods of cuftivating a love
for good music. A vast amount of
nonsense is written about “educa-
tional” musical schemes. We are told
with profound solemnity about the
“educational” influence of opera. The

subsequent general surrender impera-
