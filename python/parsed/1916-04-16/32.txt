EASTER IN THE CHAPEL OF THE HOLY SEPULCHRE.
The broken column, to which tradition says Christ was tied with ropes and suffered the lash, is brought out in the chapel on
Easter and other special days. Thousands of pilgrims and native Christians of Jerusalem visit the shrine and reverently kiss the
holy relic. The column is mounted on a pedestal of pure gold. Coperight, Pndoemwood & Underwood
