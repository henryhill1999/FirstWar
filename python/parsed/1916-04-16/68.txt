A BATTLE IN THE AIR OVER THE FRENCH -TRENCHES |

Pen Picture by One Who Saw of What!
Happens When the Rival Fleets
Grapple in the Central Blue

 

William T. Martin. the young American newspaper man who won
the French war cross for valor and wh«se thrilling stories of life in

the trenches cre familiar to readers of THE SUNDAY SUN, is back at
the front. His vacation in America is ended and this is the first of

its letters since his return.

 

By WILLIAM T. MARTIN

ROM his secret place among the
ruins near the top of the
hill overiooking the first line

trepehes the soldier peers far out
info the territory of coe Germans.
Down beiow, near the bare of the hil!
re his own trenches, .A Jittle distance
further on he can indistinctly make
out the network of the enemy's lines.

The Germans, knowing lookouts are |
siationed on the hill and being unable
to locate, have long since completed |
the destruction of the little village
at the summit. The observer has a
deep dugout where he can take sheiter
when German shells fal] too near. {

Looking out over the land on the!
other side all seems barren of life. |
Near by is part of a little village, a
remnant the French have left stand-
ing their village—and it too seems
dead, The trenches at the base of the
hill lose individuality in the distance
ina general network that runs right
and left. Some distance to the left it
ic broken by a river. Nets are stretch-
ed across it. The German batteries
are far in the rcar and out of sight.

To hide their movemenis from the
French the Germans bring their equip-
ment up in the nighttime er behind
screened roads, Here and there at long
intervals the wind or a shel has made

break in the cloth or the brush of
the screens, ami before the Germans
sve had time to repair them the sol- |
vier Jooking through can occasionally
see a wagon hurrying along, an auto-
mobile laden with supplies, a staff car
rushing past filled with officers or sol-.
Wlers on their way to or from. the!
trenches,

Sometimes au ambulence cashes by,
They usually rush up after the deep
resounding reports down in the
trenches, mines being thrown from)
one trench to another, or after the
sharp fusillades of exploding grenades
or rifle flre between attacks, Some- |
tmes the watcher can almost tell the
number of wounded, The ambulances |
ere noiseless from his distance, but |
now and then be can hear the long
erawn out rumbling of the heavy
wagons as they jog along. !

When his batteries shell the roads |
behind the lines, often he can see the
projectiles burst, Sear the deep, roars |
ing crashes and see their terrific,
bavoe. And then occasionally he can |
mark an acceleration in the distant |
rumbling of the wagons as they roll |
over the ground, drawn by wild steeds |
urged along by frantic drivers. |

to various batteries roundabout and
they have orders to be on the lookout. |
| All around it is a tense moment. Down |
in the trenches the soldiers: of both
sides watch the oncoming fleet. Fir-
ing has ceased, and everywhere there
seems to be a suppressed silence.

a gigantic machine gun, It is deafen-
ing, From the other end of the line a
machine wabbies unsteadily under the
impulse of a roaring motor.

The nolse is intensified as another
machine gives a little shiver and a
mechanic from the resr of it crawls!
out fron under a long support suaning |
hack to the rudder as the propeller!
sturts up, becomes almost invisibie,
and its engine buzzes away.

At different points along the line the
operation is repeated. A moment iater
all of the giant machines throb under
the roar of the motors that consumes
everything with sound. The whole
thing has taken but a Cew minutes,

The men are already mounted in the

| little cars. There are two in a machine,

the latter is a handy man. Concealed
almost in garments of thick fur ma-
teria: that covers their heads and the}
parts of their bodies visible above the}
little cars they are hard to recognize |
ar men but hate the appearance of
foreign creatures. ‘i,ooking closer the
faces of the men are grim and set.
The giants shaking things about them
in their numbers look like things of
the imagination. ‘
Suddeply from the line comes out
one of the machines; moves slowly and j
unsteadily over the ground, gains in}

momentum and bumps along to the far
end of the field. Then, unsteadily, it!
rises from the ground, mounts into the
air and gracefully sails away in the
direction of the high hill. One by one
the others follow. In a short time all |

are gone.

The noire joses volume, softens, ana
as the machines soar away toward thy
hill it becomes a drowsy din. They

row smaller and resemble somewhat
a flock of birds spread out in the air. |
As they diminish in the distance the}
flecit seems hardly to move. They wil
soon be over the trenches. They will)
meet the oncoming craft of the enemy
and their orders are to turn them
back. It wil! be a battle in the air,
