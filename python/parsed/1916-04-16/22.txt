and actuality, The emotional quality
of the drama is‘singularly dry. There
are in spite of all the careful observ-
ances of the rules few minutes of
emotional stir. Have the formulas
been worked out? Taken in considera-
tion with the great success of "“Jus-
ties,” which filline the Candler
Theatre to overflowing and yet violates
every rule of playmaking, there seems
to have been a change of some charac-
ter in the public mood.

There is nothing in the play at, the
Empire Theatre so entertaining

drawn with engaging humor the char-
acters of the devoted husband and
wife who jar in the accustomed way
and mingle their affection and asper-
in a style conventionally supposed
to be common to all married: couples,
Not only has the author sketched

A PLAY A WEEK.

 

The Standard Theatre will
show “Under Fire,” the war tae
by R. C. Megrue which Wil
Courtenay acted so long at the
Hudson Theatre earlier in the
season. Violet Heming is still
the leading actress. There will
be a benefit to-morrow night for
the staff of the theatre.
There will evidently be no end
to the extent of society which
“Potash and Perlmutter in So-
ciety” will cover. After spending | |
