Financed by Secret Teutonic
Means—Sought to Destroy
Our National Spirit.

Special Despatch to Tue Sux.

WASHINGTON, Feb. 23.—The German
American Alliance, claiming member-

ship of 3,000,000 or more persons in the
United Statts,
naturalized American citizens and a
considerabie percentage native born
Amoricans, to-day was denounced before
the King sub-committee of the Senate
Committee on the Judictary as the core
of the Kultur canker in the American
body politic,

Gustavus Ohlinger, a Toledo attorney,
uttered the Indictment, and Senators of

the sub-committee were astounded at
the frankness with which he described
the plottings and treachery of these
self-constituted agents of Kaiserism.

The allegations pronounced by Mr.
Ohlinger in his opening statement con-
vinced Senators that the time had ar-
rived for the most searching investiga-
ton, Senator King (Utah), chairman
of the sub-committee, has a bill pending
in Congress looking to the forcible dis-
ruption of the @erman American Alli-
ance. Its favorable report as a result of
the investigation only thus far pursued
is freely predicted.

Cardinal Purposes of Alliance,

Six purposes were set down by Mr.
O) linger as the fundamental reasons for
the existence of this inimical organiza-
ton in war time. They are:

To consolidate all Germans in the
ln.ted States Into one economic, po-
Ntival and social ‘‘bloc.””

‘To arouse antagonism of race and
thereby insure closer unity’ of Ger-
mans in America.

‘Yo scatter propaganda inspired by
Imperial German Government
throughout the Amertean

broadcast

republle,

‘Yo foment opposition to the policies
o: the United States Government.

To further the aims and plots of
disloyal persons, parties and organiza-
tions tn this country.

‘Yo agitate resistance to the prohibi-
tion Of-theruise of alcoholic -stimu-
lants throughout the United States.

‘The climax of Mr. Ohlinger’s arraign-
Hent was reached when he charged
that through secret and unknown chan-

» the funds necessary to the upkeep
©. the organization were obtained.

‘Is it your inference that the German
can Alliance obtains money from
joyvat sources here?’ demanded Sen-
King.
at js exactly what I do mean to
fnfer,’ replied Ohlinger. “Their funce
come to them from persons and parties
whose interests are actively against the
Vihted States. If the committee will pur-
> thie investigation I am sure it will
develop much enlightemment on this
tubject.”

    
 
 

 

 

Allflance Head.

J. Hexamer, who was president of
1 German American Alliance, so the
these testified, had been “honored” in
Sof by Kaiser Wilhelm IT. with the
russian Red Eagle of the Fourth Class
“the spreading of German Kultur"
in the United States.

Oblinger in which German Americans
were urged to vote “only for the friends
of Germanism.” It was shown that when
the iseues of the Presidential campaign
* 1916 were in the formative period
the German American Alllance had un-
dertaken to line up its
against American statesmen supposedly
f iintente Ally sympathies. Theodore
Koosevelt had been the central objec-
‘ve of this movement, but President
Wilson, whose utterances up to that time
had not taken the shape of such definite
‘enunciation of the German policies as
had Col, Roosevelt's, also was included
in the list of Americans to be opposed.

Special Despatch to Tnu Svs,

WASHINGTON, Feb, 23, — President
Wilson to-day threw down the gauntlet
to Senator Gore (Oklahoma) and oth-
ers in Congress who have urged a guar-
anteed price of at least $2.50 for wheat
this year. He issued a proclamation
which in effect maintains the $2 basic
price previously set by the President
under authority from Congress. In ex-
planation of his pronouncement he is-
sued a statement based on information
given him by the Department of Agri-
culture, the Food Administration and
other advisers, in which he sets forth
that it is h!s duty under the food con-
trol act to announce the price of wheat

‘for the coming year.

The prices fixed, tne President de-
clared, would assure the producer of a
reasonable profit. On the basis of No.1
Northern spring wheat and fts equiva-
lents the President fixed the prices as
follows:

Chicago, $2.20; Kan-

Omaha, $2.15;

curred at the two camps at Fort Worth,

1919. The Presi-
dent's proclamation states that the ac-
tion is to meet an emergency requiring
the stimulation of wheat planting.

Giveg Out Statement.

In a atatement accompanying
proclamation the President said;

“Under the food control act of August
10, 1917, it {6 my duty to announce a
guaranteed price for wheat of the 1918
harvest. T am therefore issuing a proc-
lamation setting the price at the prin-
efpal interior primary markets it
makes no essential alteration in the
present guarantee. It is a continuation
of the present prices of wheat with
some adjustment arising from the desig-
nation of additional terminal marketing
points.

“This guaranteed price assures the
farmer of a reasonable profit even If the
war should end within the year and the
large stores of grain in those sections
of the world that are now cut off from
transportation should again come fnto
competition with’his products. To In-
srease the price of wheat above the
nresent figure or to agitate any increase
of price would have the effect of very
seriously hampering the large opera-
tions of the nation and of the Allies by
eausing the wheat of last year's crop
to be withheld from the market It
would, moreover, dislocate all the pres-
ent wage levels that have been estab-
shed after much anxious discussion and
would therefore create an induetrial un-
rest which would be harmful to every
industry in the country.

“YT know the spirit of our farmers, and
have not the least doubt as to the loy-
alty with which they will accept the
present decision. The fall wheat plant-
img, which furnishes two-thirds of our
wheat production, took place with no
other assurance than this, and the farm-
ers’ confidence was demonstrated by the
fact that they planted an acreage larger
than the record of any preceding year,
larger by 2,000,000 acres than the sec-
ond largest record year and 7,000,400
acres more than the average for the five
years before the outbreak of the Iuro-
pean war,

Why Wheat Is Picked Ont.

“It seems not to he generally under-
stood why wheat ts picked ou! far price

the cereals The answer is that while
distribution of all our farm
products has been subject to great dis-
turbances during the last three years
because of war conditions only two com-
modities, namely wheat and sugar, have
been so seriously affected as to require
governmental intervention,

“The disturbances which affect these

Conference Accepts Aims
Recently Outlined by
British Workers,

Repudiate All Attempts at

many After War.

Feb, 23.—The Interallied
Labor Conference, which ended its ses-
sions here to-day, has accepted the war
alms programme ay enunciated by Brit-
isa labor on December 28, and the next
step probably wiil he the calling of an
International conferenceg at an early
date, including both labor and soctalism.

At a luncheon given to-day in honor
of the foreign delegates to the confer-
ence Arthur Henderson, former member
of the War Cabinet and leader of the
Labor party, described these aims as
meaning the establishment of a league
of nations, Involving international co-,
operation for disarmament and the pre-

LONDON,

vention of warfare in the future, the
restoration of Belgium, Serbia, Ru-

‘mania and Montenegro, and only terri-
torial changes in the future based on
justice and right.

Mr. Henderson asserted that the peace
aimed at Was of the peoples and that the
peopies must stan] behind it, and he
added that labor was prepared to go
on with the war until all the conditions |
insisted upon for a permanent peace
were met.

Appeal to Enemy Peoples.

James Ramsay Macdonald, Soctaliet
and Labor member of Parliament, said
that the next step of labor and socialism
was to bring the matter before the Ger-
man and Austrian peoples themselves.

The conference voted to send five dele-
gates to the United Statea “for the pur- |
poxe of conferring with tho representa-
tives of the American democracy on the
war situation.”

The delegation will be headed by Ca-
mille Huyemans, secretary of the Inter-
national Socialist organization, the oth-
ers being selected by the French, British,
Italian and Belgian Soctalists respec-
tively.

“If the

  

 

Americans won't come to us,
we must go to them,” said one delegate.

M. Vandervelde declared: “It is ab-
solutely essential to have the Americans

Lonpon, Feb, 23.—-The probable effect |
of the German Invasion of Russia unon |
conditions on the western front {is at- |
tracting increased attention here, While
it Is true that the Germans are meeting

no military opposition, climatic condi-
tions in northern Russia at this season
are such as to make heavy demands
upon transportation and Germany must
employ a considerable number of men
to meet these as well as to hold the
conquered territory.

The occupation of Finland, Petrograd,
Kiev and Odessa, not to mention the
Ukraine, will require large armies, and
long lines of communicatian through ex-
ceedingly impoverished country will ne- |
ecessitate a huge amount of supplies as
Well as an adequate force to protect
them agains: guerrilla warfare,

Careful observers of military and:
incline now to the
belief that the German announcement of
an impending blow on the western front
Was intended to cover the Germnan de-
signs in Russia under the theory that
by holding the Allies from the North
Sea to the Adtiatic Germany would be |
left free to pursue her purpose to con-
solidate her power in an eastern empire
far exceeding her dreams of a Mittel-
europa.

Needs Million Men ip Russia.

Tt is calculated that the Russian ad-
Venture will require from 750,000 to
1,000,000 men, and to suppose that while
Germany is engaged In this trentendous
enterprise she can also begin and main- |
tain a great offensive in the west {s to

she never has done since the first few

The progfamme as adopted corre-
sponds in general to the declarations
of President Wileon and Premier Lioyd
George. It has the support of the So-
cialist or labor parties of England,
France, Italy, Belgium, Portugal, Ru-
inania and South Africa. The Social

Poreign Minister, had cefused  pass-
ports,

The discuasions of the conference's
war aims were enlivened by the diver-
gent views expressed by various delega-
tons, particularly the Italian, on the
subject of tervitorial adjustments, but a
fairly satisfactory compromise or gene |
eralization was reached in each cuse
where a disagreement was threatened.
The general tone of the conference was
in no way pacifist or pro-German, and
the discussions revealed a sincere resolve
among widely separated factions to
reach unity

The programine which tinally resulted
was passed unanimousiy. The French
delegate, Albert Thomas, the former
Minister of Munitions, declared:

 

 

Revolution In Threatened,

“The war aims as outlined are the ab-
solute minimum which we will accept,
and if anybody tries to foist on us a
peace not embodying these terms it will
mean a revolution which will not halt
until Justice*has been secured, even if
that takes fifteen vears.”

Mr. Henderson also declared that the
programme could be regarded as the
minimum demands of the laboring
classes of all the allied countries.

Mr. Vandervelde said. “Whether we
are victorious or not, these will remain
our war aims and we shall strive unre-
mittingly for then.”

The only section of the conference's
declaration to which the allied Govern-,
Jnents are likely to take exception is the
clause insist®g on an immediate con-!
ference between the Soclalists of the al-
‘lied countries and Germany, and. this!
clause hud the enthusiastic support of
, the entire conference.  Desides adopting
ithe formal war aims jrogramme, the
conferelice passed a resolution to con-
vene an international Socialist confer-
, ence to sit concurrently with the officlal |

 

Peace Conference and also demanded!
that at least one Socialist should be in-
cluded by every nation tn the offietal |

delagation at the peace conference

Hen-

Speaking at the luncheon, Mr.
derson announced that as a result of

the preliminary conference at Paris and
the present conference at London, the
decision reacheal by British labor on;
December 28 regarding peace had, in
substance, been accepted by allied labor
and Soctalism,

“These proposals,"’ said Mr.
son, “in short, stand for the establish-
ment of a league of nations on a firm
basis, provided that all the peoples of
all the countries associated with such a
league Insist upon international coopera-
tion for disarmament and for the pre-
vention of future warfare. By adopting
these views the conference has declared
for the absolute freedom ana integrity
of Belgium, Serbia,
negro, and that every territor!al change
shall, so far ag we are concerned, be
based matnly on justice and right, thus
making for the permanency of a world

Germany's Possible Reserve.

“Last season the enemy never had
more than two millions on the western
front and one million on the Tsonzo. He
has certainly lost men, guns and ground,
but has preserved his lines unbroken and
should presumably do so again with the
same numbers. He is, therefore, now in
&@ position to retain a strategical reserve
of one and a quarter millions for an
offensive.”

“The Allies should be able to hold
their front with the same number,
namely, 3,000,000 men. One great ad-
vantage possessed by the enemy is that
of position, as he is acting on intertor
lines and able quickly to despateh his
reserves to any point.”

If the Germans do attack in the west |
they will not, unless they gain some re- |
markable initial success, attempt to]
break through. ‘Their success or failure }
will very likely depend on the possibility |
of sunprise or some new develop- |
ment of the infernal machinery of war i

PETROGRAD, Feb, 23.—The

Bolshevik Headquarters has
received a wireless message
signed by Gen. Hoffman, saying
that the German answer had
been handed to the courier of the
Russian Government, who im-
mediately started on his return
to Petrograd. The message gave
no intimation of the contents of
the reply.

A second wireless message, ad-
dressed to Leon Trotzky, from
the Austro-Hungarian Govern-
ment has been received announe-
ing that Austria-Hungary is
ready, with her allies, to bring
the peace negotiations to a final
conclusion. |
