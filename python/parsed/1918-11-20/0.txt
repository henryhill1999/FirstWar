Special Despatch to Tur Scn.
Wasuinaton, Nov. 19.—A_ confer- |

ence of Republican Senators to-day, |
which was ond of the largest In point | |
of attendance in many months and
bore every evidence of solidarity
within the party, went on record as:
being opposed to a continuance of the
autoeracy brought about by the war. |

It was apparent that those par- |
tieipating. in the conference were
unanimous in their objection, now the
war is over, to having Congress made
« rubber stamp merely bo register
the will of the Executive. Revoking |
many special war powers con-
ferred upon the President during the
emergency ,was alsd strongly advo-'
ited at the meeting.

See Sectalistic Pendency.

the

A strong socialistic policy on the
part of the Administration was dis-
cerned by some of the Senators pres-
é@nt, who announced their intention of
making speeches regarding this ten-
dency as evidenced in the seizure of
the cable lines by Postmaster-General
Burleson.

The following resolution concerning
the exercise by Congress of its normal |

function . 5 ) legislative matters was
adopted ‘expressing the sense of the
Congtegs: -— i

That the Congress ‘snatP a@wert and
exercise its normal and. constitu-
tional function, including legislation
necessary for reconstruction.

The conference adopted a modification
of the Weeks plan for reconstruction
which would create six non-partisan
Joint committees as follows:

Demobilization of the army and navy.

Foreign trade and commerce.

Interstate’ trafisportation.

Domestic business.

Employérge’ and employees’ relations.

Natural resources of the nation.

Committees Not Discussed.

The subject of comnaittee assignments
in the next Senate was not discussed |
at the conference. Those who have been’
urging a change in the rules in this
sespect and who are undersjood to ob- !
to Senator Penrose as head of the
-nance Committee were present and
wave every indication of working in ac- |
cord with the other Senators, t

Special Despatch to Tun Son.

Wasninoton, Nov. 19.—Secretary of
the Navy Daniels will appear before the |
House Naval Committee  tosmorrow |
' morning and will be asked by the com-,
mittee to explain the exact present sits |
vation Of the navy in every detail.

The committee met for the firet time
to-day to consider the enormous estt-
mate of $2,441,900,000 for continuing |

ing programme, but at the insistence
of Republican members decided to in-
vite the Secretary to tell what ships
of the last building programme have
been built, what ships have been laid
down and not completed, and how many |
have not been started, It appeared to- |
day that the naval plans for the future}
are to be discussed most exhaustively |
before Congress cétimits itself in the |
way of big expenditures. |

Admira! Earl, naval chief of ordnance,
was before the committee to-day and |
it soon became apparent that hundreds |
of millions of dollars could be lopped |
, Off estimates submitted by the Navy De- |
partment. The estimates were framed |
for ordnance and every other detail as |
if war was to continue without the end !
{n sight, It was decided to hear Secra- |
,tary Daniels fully before attempting to’
estimate how much could be cut out of
the bill.

Call Present Plans Too Big. f

Members of the Naval Committee hold
that the plans in the estimates for a!
new three year building programme are
altogether out of place at this time
Many of the capita! fighting ships pro-
vided for in te three year programma,
whieh ordinarily would be close to coim-

pletion now, have not even béen started,

them and the yard put to building de-
stroyers as fast as they could be turned
out.

It was apparent to-day that the com-
mittee would insigt that the unfinished |
ships of the last*three year programme
be included in the number of ships the
Navy Department seeks {n its new pro-
gramme. This would mean a big re-
duction in the appropriation for next
year.

, asked if he intends to continue to try to

man the ships with naval enlisted men
in peace times or whether it is the inten-

| tlon to have the ships operated by civil- |

ian crews,

Would Lease to Private Persons.

A strong element of the committee in-
tends to voice opposition to the Govern-
ment continuing operation of the big!
after the war is ended

to private owners.

The committee will ask the Secretary
to say frankly and fully just what share
of the German navy is to be turned over
fo the A'nited States, how {t will affect
the relative strength of the navy as com-
pared with the other naval Powers of
the world, and what .the policy of the
Administration is to be as to the place
the American navy should occupy among ;
the world powers, particularly with rela-
tion to Great Britain, ‘

The Secretary will be asked also to ex-
plain fully to what extept the plan for
part disarmament of the navies of the
world {s expected to be, effective and, if |

| the plan is to go through, why it {s neces-

sary to lay the plans now and provide

ij money for an enormous new naval pro-

gramme. The Republicans of the com-
mittee will ingist on a definite answer to
‘this question, mainly in the interests of
national economy.

Berlin to Offer Proof
of Kaiser’s Abdication

By the Associated Preas,

PARIS, Nov. 19.—In order to
end the discussion as to
whether William Hohenzollern
has really abdicated as German
Emperor, it is‘ understood the
German Government intends to
pu ublish his decree of abdication.
his consists of an attempt to
justify the war on the ground of
Germany’s isolation.

The abdication decree, accord-
ing to the correspondent at Zurich
of L’Information, concludes with
these words:

“To avoid difficulties and to
put an end to the mourning and
suffering of my people I re-
nounce the throne and leave my
faithful subjects free to choose a
government which seems to them
most compatible with honor and
to their interest.”

Assuming the German Government to
have had 190 per cent. support of the
| people at the beginning of the war the
| chart shows how German morale fell and

tors. These influences included not only

te results of the submarine campaign,

 

but the unanimity of purpose evidenced |
by the different groups in the Reichstag

and the egonoms «
try. So remarkably accurate
information upon which the chart was
based that the ‘morale line’ reached the
zero point between November 10 and 16.

The chart Indicates clearly that prac-
tically every major operation of German

WASHINGTON, Noy, 19.—
{Senators who conferred with Pres}-
j dent *Wilson to-night for two hours
left the White House with the tm-
| pression that the President now plans
!to remain in France indefinitely or
}at least until the major portion of
| the work of the peace conference has
been completed.

The President was understood to
be especially interested in the appli-
cation, in the framing of the treaty.
of the principle of the freedom of
the seas, which he enunciated in his
fourteen terms and on which the Al
lies, in agreeing to discuss peace with
wermany, have reserved the right o7
freedom of action at the peace con-
ference.

While in France the President wa:
sees to plan transaction of any neces-
sary executive business in the Ameri-

Embassy. Technically he the:

capitals the embassies there would he-
come his executive headquarters.

Besides discussing his plans for his
trip abroad the President was under
stood to have taken up with the Sena-
tors problems of reconstruction and
necessar® legislation. It was said tha
he opposes creation of a recoristruction
commission, ejther executive or Con-
eressional, preferring that the work br:
