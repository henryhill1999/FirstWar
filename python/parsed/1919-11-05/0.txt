, Speotal Deepateh to Tus Sun.
;WasHinaton, Noy... 4 — Samuel
Gompers, president of the American
Federation of Labor, issued a state-
ment to-night explaining his version
of the demands of the striking coai
miners and declaring that thé miners
had no alternative but to strike on
November 1.

The injunction obtained by the Gov
ernment at Indianapolis was char-
acterized as “not only a grave wron¢
but a gross blunder.” According to
Mr. Gompers it bars of the

y United Mine Workers from attempting

to end the strike.

In the last part of the statement Mr.
Gompers declares he has “an abiding
faith” that if the injunction is va-
cated “a mutually honorable adjust-
ment” can be made and the strike
ended.

Statement by Gompers,.

The statement of Mr, Gompers was
{sued after his return from New York.
It reads:

“Representatives of newspapers have
asked me for a statement regarding the
Coal strike and the situation.

“In the first instance it should be
known that the demands of the miners,
which upon the surface seem so radical
and far reaching, are by no means 80.
For several years the miners have not
had more than a half year’s work, their
working days averaging from 160 to 180
days per year, intermittent, by days and
by weeks—empioyment and then unem-
ployment.

“The miners simply ask for a regula-
tlon of the working time so that coal
production and employment may be
cegular rather than intermittent. If the
miners were permitted by the operators
to work full time the supply of coal thus
inined would soon force down the price
of coal on the market and this the
operators are determined not to permit,

“The miners’ case might better be
fiated by their demanding at least five
cays of six hours work per week, which
: really more than they are permitted

to work at the present time, An under-
standing of these conditions clearly
shows who are responsible for the pres-
ent situation and the cause,

“When in 1914 the miners received
én increase of twenty cents per ton, the
Cperators raised the selling price five
@llars per ton. Surely, the conditions
and the standards of life of the miners
have deteytorated by reason of there
being no practical advance in their
Wages and their earnimg power, while
= cost of living has soared higher and

igher.

Justifies Calling of Strike.

_, "The mandate of the officers of the
Jnited Mine Workers of America was

direct from the representatives of the

men who at the recent convention de-
cléed that unless a substantial improve-

Ment in wages and a regulation of the

working time were granted the strike

Associates therefore had no alternative,

tives of the United Mine Workers to

Lewis Offers to Yield
If Injunction is Vacated

J[NDIANAPOLIS, Nov. 4.—John
L. Lewis, acting president of
the United Mine orkers of
America, stated to-night that the
cmeitiatena’ ane to resume
n ons e operators
immediately if the restraining
order now in force against them
was vacated. Mr. Lewis’s state-
‘ment reads:
If the injunction is vacated
‘the miners will be willing im-
mediately to meet the opera-
tors in joint conference to ne-
gotiate a w: scale.

Asked if miners would return
to work prior to opening of ne-
gotiations, Mr. Lewis said the
miners’ offer meant only “nego-
tiations without reservations,”
and would add nothing to this
declaration.

Under the restraining order, as
construed by the miners’ officials,
any statément as to continuation
of the strike would be a violation
of the restraining order isgued in
Federal court here against them
last week. In view of this Mr.
Lewis’s statement is taken to
mean that no move toward calling
off the strike would be taken be-
fore reopening negotiations.

RAILWAYS TO BE
RETURNED JAN. 1

Hines’s Announcement of Wil-
gon’s Intention Smashes
Senate Plan.

 

 

RECESS IS NOT PROBABLE

Cummins Is Determined That
Congress Must Keep at
Work on Measure.

Special Deepatch to Tus Sun.

Wasuinoton, Nov. 4.—President Wil-
son is determined to turn the railroads
back to their owners January 1, 1920,
even if Congress has not completed its
programme of railroad legislation by
that time, Walker D. Hines, Director-
General of Railroads, informed Sena-
tor Cummins (Iowa), chairman of the
Senate Interstate Commerce Commit-
tee, to-day.

Mr. Hines was so emphatic in speak-
ing of the President's plans that Sena-
tor Cumming has determined to call
the committee to-morrow or Thursday
to consider a programme of temporary
legislation that will tide the roads over
until a comprehensive permanent
measure can be agreed to by both
houses. There is such wide variance
already apparent between the Senate
and House committees on important
points that it is doubtful if the com-
plete railroad bill can be passed by
January 1.

As a result of his conference with
Mr. Hines, Senator Cummins has de-
cided that Congress must not take a re-
cess between the special and the regular
session. He plans to keep the Senate at
work on the railroad bill as soon as
the peace treaty ts disposed of.

The temporary legislation to be pro-
posed probably will deal mainly with

tailroad finances and rates, which will
be the big problem immediately upon the
return of the roads. The questions of a
hew transportation board, adjustment
of labor troubles, regulation of water
carriers, the funding of the amount in-
vested by the Government in equipment
and minor matters will be left for the
Permanent legislation that will follow.
The plan to continue the guaranteed re-
turn in some form undoubtedly will be
considered in the temporary Dill, so
would the various proposals for extend-
ing credit to the railroads through Gov-
ernment loans or the sale of securities
with governmental approval.

Mr. Hines did not go into details as
to what Congress should do, but simply
warned that the President is determined
there shall be no delay in returning the
roads. He pointed out that plans al-
seady have been agreed to with rallroad
executives for the return of the lines,
but added that some temporary legisla-
tion is essential.

Paris, Nov. 4.—That the peace treaty
with Germany will go into effect about
November 20 was foreshadowed by an
announcement following to-day's meet-
ing of the Supreme Council that ali
plebiscite and delimitation commis-
sions would meet here November 10
for organization purposes.

The purpose of this is to have the
commissions fully organized and pre-
pared to assume authority in their re-
spective districts on the day the peace
treaty becomes effective. The Com-
missioners themselves will be on the
ground that day in Silesia, Memel,
Schleswig and Teschen to take over
the authority of the Germans, and will
be supported by troops of the Allies,

French in Command.

Bpecial Despatch to Tus Stun.

Louisviuia, .Ky., Nov. 4—Edwin
Porch Morrow was elected Governor
of Kentucky to-day by a majority that
may reach 25,000. Certainly it'will be no
less than 15,000. He is the third Re-
publican Governor of this State, Govs.
Pradley and Willson being the only
other Republicans to enjoy the honor.

Mr. Morrow’s opponent was Gov.
James D, Black, who ascended to the
ffice from the Lieut.-Governorship
when Gov. Augustus Stanley was sent
to the United States Senate.

Mr. Morrow’s election is conceded to
be a signal. defeat of the policies of the
Wilson administration. Mr. Black ran
on a straight Democratic platform which
embraced the League of Nations as the
President fetched it from Europe. Mr.
Morrow's platform avoided reference to
national matters except insofar as a
general advocacy of rigid American
principles is concerned. The victorious
Republican candidate eschewed refer-
ences to the prohibition amendment and

virtually all international matters. He
confined himself to local and domestic
problems and his success was conceded
even by Democrats many days before his
election:

Mr. Morrow’s victory marks the
greatest Republican triumph this State
has known, inasmuch as he owes his
election to the votes of many young
men, who by all their traditions and
training should be Democrats, but who

Only the ratifying Powers will be
represented at the organization of
these commissions on November 10,
and the occupying forces will be Brit-
ish, French and Italian, unless by that
time the United States has ratified and
her reservations have been accepted,
in which event America will partici-
pate.

 

The Supreme Council has decided for-
mally that the forces of the Allies tn
Upper Silesia shall be commanded by a
French General, when the people decide
by ballot whether this important mining
district is to belong to Poland or Ger-
many.

It is understood that the council pre-
fers an American to head the Teschen
commission, where the claims of Poland
and Czecho-Slovakia will be decided.
Until ratification of the treaty by the

United States a Frenchman will be! racy in the South.

chairman of this commission. An Eng-

lishman will be chairman for the Allen- |

stein district of East Prussia and an
Italian for the Marienwerder district of
East Prussia.

Need for Caution Seen.

The extent and character of the Amer-
ican reservations remain the subject of
the greatest interest here because it has
been conceded that before America dan
participate the other Powers must make
clear their attitude toward whatever
reservations are. adopted. With = the
question in America so near a decision,
diplomats here are maintaining a dis-
creet silence on the subject, preferring to
wait until they know what the stand of
the United States actually is.

No better evidence could be had for
the necessity of weariness by the United
States in protecting its own interests in
every paragraph of the covenant of the
League of Nations than is supplied by
the manceuvres in the Rumanian-Hun-
garian situation. Here European diplo-
macy is seen in full action.

Yesterday's note to Rumania, for ex-
ample, is attributed again by several

refused to vote for Mr. Black and his
sponsor, Senator Stanley.

Mr. Morrow was defeated for the Gov-
ernorship four years ago by Mr. Stan-
ley, but the latter’s majority only was
431 votes. Due to the Kentucky elec-
tions law, which Mr. Morrow promises
te change, Mr. Stanley's victory could
not be contested by Mr. Morrow.

Mr. Morrow's election is looked upon
as more than a purely local matter.
It is recognized as a break in the erst-
while solidly Democratic South and a
forecast of other defections from Democ-
Missouri promises
to follow Kentucky's example. Arkansas
is expected to elect a few Republicans
to office. Neither of these States goes to

| the polls until 1920, however.

The Republican platform on which Mr.
Morrow ran advocates woman suffrage
among other things that have failed of
Kentucky's recognition. And although
Mr. Morrow avoided the prohibition is-
sue during his campaigning, !t is be-
HNeved that he will show himself opposed
to the newest amendment to the Fed-
eral Constitution.

Police Strikers Upheld—
Blow to Radicalism.

Special Despatch to Tax Svx.

Boston, Nov. 4.— Massachusetts
ranged itself overwhelmingly in sup-
port of the “law and order” platform
on which Gov. Calvin Coolidge, Repub-
lican, sought reelection to-day and
swept him back into office, together
with the entire Republican State ticket.
At a late hour it was estimated that
his majority over Richard H. Long, his
Democratic opponent, would be ap-

}
proximately 125,000. It was the greatest

potitical landslide the Bay State has
known in many years.

Gov. Ccolidge appealed directly ‘0 |

the people to support organized Gov-
ernment. His triumph is generally in-
terpreted as a tremendous blow to Bol-
shevism and radicalism in the labor
movement, not only in Massachusetts
but throughout the country. Gov.
Coolidge was specifically attacked by
Long for his uncompromising attitude
toward the striking Boston policemen
@st September and the strike became
at once the principal issue in the cam-
paign. The voters yesterday utterly
repudiated the action of the policemen
in refusing t
recognition of their union was with-
held by the constituted authorities.

The surprising strength developed
by Gov. Coolidge was general through-
out the State, even in the manufactur-
ing cities, where Long believed that he
would have his strongest support.

Even in Boston, one of the Demo-
cratic strongholds of the country, Gov.
Coolidge was close upom the heels of
his adversary as majorities go here. The
nominal Democratic majority in the city
is 30,000, but Long made pre-election
claims that he would carry it by 40,000.
With only two-of the 219 precincts
missing, the count showed to-nigit that
Long had received 46,995 votes and that
Coolidge had 41,848 courted in his be-
half, a majority for Long of elightly
more than 6,000. It has been years
since Boston has made such a strong
Republican showing as this,

Complete unofficial returns from the
1,193 precincts throughout the State gave
Coolidge a total of 317,191 and Long
193,291, a majority of 123,900, but the
Coolidge supporters assert that the ma-
jority, on the corrected and official re-
turns, will go to 125,000 at least and per-
haps 130,000. The vote was the heavi-
est cast in years in a State election.

The greatest blow to the Democrats
was in their failure to carry the man-
ufacturing cities. Because of Long's
claim that he was championing the cause
of labor it was felt generally that he
would show pronounced strength in
these centres. On the contrary, Coolidge
practically carried all. Lynn was the
only city of importance outside of Bos-
ton which did not assist in the crushing
of the Democratic candidate. Even in
Lynn Long's majority was only a few
hundred out of almost 20,000 votes cast
there.

Long admitted his defeat “by 160,000"
even before the polls were closed in some
of the cities, where he expected the
strongest support. The early returns
showed a tremendous falling off in the
Democratic vote, in comparison with
last year, and corresponding gains by
Goy. Coolidge. Long's admission of de-
feat came after returns were received
from the mill city of New Bedford. His
loss of strength among the workers was
heavy.

The Republican ticket which was
elected to-day was as follows:

Governor, Calvin Coolidge (reelected),

Lieutenant-Governor, Channing 4H,
Cox (reelected).

Secretary of State, Albert P. Langtry
(reelected).

Treasurer, Fred J. Burrell.

Auditor, Alonzo B. Cook (reelected),

Attorney-General, J. Weston Allen.

The striking policemen and telephone
girls were Long's strongest supporters.
During the campaign the policemen toured

{the State {n automobiles and attacked

the Governor bitterly for discharging
them, asserting that his action was “a
blow at organized labor.” Netwithstand-
ing the rebuke which the voters admin-
istered to the principles he advanced
Long said to-night that he “believed in
them thorouhgly” and that, if he ever
ran for office again he would not change
his platform.

Statement by Coolidge.

Late to-night Gov. Coolidge issued a
statement in which he said:

“Thanks are due the millions of peuple
in Massachusetts. I give tnem freely,
without undertaking to specify all who
have supported the great cause of the
supremacy of law. The heart of the peo-

The Democratic party met a
stinging defeat yesterday.

Representative F. H. La Guardia,
the Republican candidate for Presi-
dent of the Board of Alde@aen, de-
feated President Robert L.” Moran,
the Tammany candidate for reelec-
tion, by a narrow margin.

With only thirty-three election dis-
tricts missing out of a total of 2,567
Te Guardia was leading by about
1,162, Moran headquarters at an early
hour this morning acknowledged that
the figures they had indicated his de-
feat by 900. They said a recount
would be demanded without doubt.

Police: Commissioner Enright sent
word to every police station ordering
that the ballot boxes be guarded with
the greatest care.

Samuel §. Koenig, Republican
leader in Manhattan, suggested to the
leaders of the other counties that the
boxes be watched by Republican
workers.

The Democratic plurality in the
city for Goy. Alfred E. Smith last
year was 270,000.

Rebuke to Democratic Party.

It was cleur that the voters cast
their ballots as they had been talking
and that the tremendous change in
the political complexion: of the city in
a year was due in no small measure
to the unpopularity of the Wilson Ad-

ministration in Washington. The
voters wished to rebuke the Demo-
cratic party and they did so dect-
sively. P

| Irwin Untermyer and Justice Robert
:L. Luce, the Tammany candidates for
the Supreme Court, First district, were
‘defeated. Judge Joseph E. Newburger,
who was turned down by the “Boss,”
and Philip J. McCook, the Republican
candidates, were elected.

Untermyer was a poor fourth in the
race. He was beaten by Justice New-
burger by about 80,000 votes. New-
burger ran about 57,000 votes ahead
of Luce and McCook defeated Luce
by about 30,000,

Henry H. Curran, Republican, was
elected President of the Borough of
|Manhattan over Edward F. Boyle,
Tammany candidate and chairman of
its general committee, by about 6,000
votes,

The Republicans captured two of
ithe three City Court Justiceships.
Richard H. Smith, who was also

Saved From

 

! Surrogate. James A. Foley, his son-in-
j law and former State Senator, had a
i plurality of some 23,000 over James
| O'Malley, his Republican opponent. This
‘ victory was largely personal and did
little to take away the sting of hte
Tammany rout.

The overwhelming defeat of the Tam
'many ticket means a weakening of the
leadership of Charles F. Murphy, and

fearly this morning Democrats were al-
| ready talking of the end of the reign of
; the Squire of Good ,Ground.

‘ In spite of everything that Tammany
| leaders could do to save Untermyer, in
spite of all the money that was spent
by Samuel Untermyer, his father, the
jiresentment felt by the rank and file of
ithe party was clearly shown in the over-
twhelming defeat of the young man.

Former Senator Foley defeated James
O'Malley by about 23,000.

Charles F. Murphy left Tamman:
Hall at 12:30. When he was asked to

take some comment
jo’clock he said:

i “T will not concede the election of La
Guardia. I believe that Moran has been
elected,
| tion of Curran until the full returns are
; in.”

Jacob L. Livingston, Republican
leader of Kings County, said:

“This is not a Republican victory,” he
said, ‘so much aa it {s a victory for the
Democrats who are dissatisfied with the
policies of President Wilson and are
disgusted with the party for other
causes. It presages what will happen
in 1920,"
