TROOPS CALL FUND
"THEIR BEST FRIEND’

Smokes Received by Soldiers
in Germany Came as Joy-
ful Surprise.

 

 

WOUNDED CRY PRAISES

Deluge of Cards Sent to Don-
ors Bring Gratitude
From Overseas.

~_— -—

Where feelings of gratitude are so free
and general it may not be good taste to
weigh the degree of its expression sent
over in the cards and letters of the
American soldiers to Tus Sun Tobacco
Fund. Only occasionally does there appear
fn their mail a stereotyped phrase, the use
if which is probably due to lack of time
or other natural causes, but as a rule the

oldfers speak from the heart out and

say an original word or two which proves
that they mean it when they call the
smeke fund their best friend.

Officers, like men, manage to get the
real expression, although they are sup-
posed to write by a formula; through-
out the war they warmed up their com-
munications in spite of the trammels of
military etiquette, and during the dis-
cuseion of peace terms they have felt
almost at liberty to discard these gyves.
At any rate, however close to form the
officers kept, they were as thankful as
the men when they received THE SuUN
smokes and always managed to say &0.

When a bulk of soldiers’ mail is care-
fully looked over it is apparent that the
deepest joy conferred by the smokes is
aroueed in the hospitals. The sick and
wounded men are overjoyed to be in a
Scn fund distribution, and the way they
‘eli about their joy is sometimes pretty
nearly rugged poetry.

The smoke fund believes that these
cards will always be preserved by the
donors to whom they are written, first
because as a souvenir of the war they
will become increasingly valuable, and
second, because owing to the familiarity
n which they are written the cards con-
stitute almost a personal tie between the
contributor to the fund and the re-
cipient of his bounty. In a few in-
stances the fund knows the cards are
<0 held by the donors because they have
taken the trouble to write in and say so.
The fund ts sure these instances could
be innumerably multiplied and that the
existence of this new tie is wide spread.

consequence, the tobacco going over
these expressions of gratitude of the
soldiers would serve as one. How can
a donor fall to wish to repeat his gift
when he has a card from a soldier in
a hospital assuring him that
bacco he sent over has made him wish
o get well?

And when a soldier doing police duty

delighted that he could send {it and in-

soldier. He said so through the months
