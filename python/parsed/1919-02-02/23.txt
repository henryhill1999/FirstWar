A New View of the Educational
_ Significance of Patriotism for
Parents and for Teachers

(The writer, who is connected with
one of the great American schools and
has had educational experience abroad
a3 well, suggests that the setting aside of
fads and prejudices and centring efforts
on the fourfold development of the child
—physical, mental, moral and social~-
may, in due and natural course, lead to
the production of a citizen who will be
patriotio through all sided fitness.)

F with the assertion of our immortal
Declaration of Independence we so
often and so sincerely affirm—that

every citizen of our great republic is en-
Utled to “life, liberty and the pursuit, of
happiness'’—~we do not fajl to forget the
pledge that our forefathers made to that
end, namely, their lives, thelr fortunes
and their sacred honor, it will indeed be
easy to grasp the interpretation of cit!-
zenship both as «a privilege and a duty.
It 4s obviously a duty in so far as the
State contributes towérd our welfare and
4s responsible for our protection; con-
versely a duty !n so far as the individual
4@ reciprocally obligated to the State.
Into it we grow up naturally, inevitably,
@8 we do into our other relattone in life,
and as our response is cordial and intel-
figent or mechanical and unappreciative,
én exactly the same proportion may our
unit value of loyalty and national ef-
ficiency be measured. But citizenship is
not a relationship between the individual
and the State in which the conditions of
that relationship are constant
are, on the other hand, progressive. The
mutual obligations implied are ever in-
creasing, and in order properly to benefit
from the advantages of the institution
and effectively to discharge our respon-
albilities to the same we need earnestly
to see to it that we ourselves and the
Children of to-day are intelligently pre-
bared for such a task and such an op-

portunity. Patriotism te the greatest
of incentives toward good citizen-
ehip, but patriotism is an emotion,

while citizenship is the product of train-
ing and environment. And it is, briefly,

with such a training and such an envir- |

onment now for the coming generation
that this discussion has to do.

It seems to me impossible to dissociate
the “good ‘citizen’ from “good citizen-
ship.” What makes for one must in con-
Sequence contribute to the other.
iret environment of the child is the
home, and then perhaps with stronger
because broader influence comes the
school. I do not mean to weigh the par-
ticular conditions of training which the
State might go so far as to recommend
for the early years at home, to argue the
educational vaiue with citizenship in
view of some subjects presented this
Way, others that way tn the schools, nor
to discuss the @#sthetic, athletic or “so-
celal” sides of school activities in their
@eneral relations. I mean, on the con-
trary, to take a more casual point of
view, a psychophysiological perspective,

to discover if possible some stumbling |

blocks in our paths as teachers, some
perticular symptoms which augur
poorly for goud citizefiship among our
pupils and some plan whereby the clay
within our hands may in years to come
de of worthier@®ational service.

Yn the first place, let me enumerate
fome of our stumbling blocks as teach-
ers: Are we not possessed of hobbies
detrimental to the genuine progress of
our pupils? Do we not, frankly, find
ourselves at times a tribe jealous of
some successful co-laborer? May we
riot savor of the pedantry of depart-
ments of education in
or the narrow conventionalities of our
norma! schools? Have we not the vil-
lage point of view instead of the na-
tionel, which tncludes the international,
perspective? Furthermore, are we fit
physically, mentally, morally, socially
fin the broadest meaning of that word)
to lift our pupils higher every day in
their progress toward efficiency? To
do this it takes not only willingness
and strength, but enthusiasm to do it
well, and if it !s the need of the com-

pensation or the unfitness for other
tasks which holds us ill fitted to the
“job let us pray to Almighty God

for inspiration that we may be “a light
to lighten the Gentiles,’ or else for im-
mediate deliverance {nto some more con-
genial sphere of oecupation.

Personally I believe that Federal con-
trol of our public schools (to say noth-
fine of Federal supervision of our
private schools) might do much to
eliminate ineffectiveness
tional systems. It certainly would heip
toward the disposal of: the ghastly
mischief wrought by politics, it would
standardize curricula, it could present

still wider opportunities for the develop-|

ment of the body and mind and soul
of the child. L believe also that as we
approached them very gently, very
tactfully, very
or lure uire our divisions

or even re

 

of pedagogy to become human. This
echievement would influence our teach-
ers to be, so that they im turn would

Jay less stress on the professional side

of their vocation and more importance
to the spiritual side. Their work, in
short, would then become not mechan-

functionings but enthusiastic, in-
spired art, making, it is quite true, a
greater tax upon nerve force, yet
yielding results beyond the dreams of
academic avarice. But, atwve all, I
should wish to have the teacher's ex-

perience and interest pass beyond the
schoo] room and the town and the
county and the State to survey the

nation as an integral part of the world,
commercial, scientifie and soctal. And
this survey, patriottcally interpreted,
should be viven to the puplis from time
to time not as a sight of world events,

@uch aS we Inay see any evening on
the movie screen, but rather as a
vision of what the United States has

and what it must continue
the welfare of world

contributed
to contribute to

civilization, and that through this reve-/
lation each child under that teacher's!

care may grasp in some way its
privileges, duties and opportunities, im-
mediate and future, as a citizen of the
Stars and Stripes.

These then are the ways-—-or some of
them---in which teachere may
themselves spiritually, as it were, and
earry with them their boys and girls to
higher conceptions of and nobler agpir-
ations for citizenship. Means and
methods of the teacher, per se, are quite
@econdary and futile subject for debate.
It would, however, be fortunate should
the Sfate sce fit to permit the execise
of the teacher's individuality as to
@means, holding her responsible for re-
sults, and as to method it is neither
the inductive nor the deductive, but
the productive that counts So
much for the teacher, though the
points have’ been but briefly touched.
It is so much easier to seek and pleas-
anter to find the needs and shortcom-
Megs of others than of ourselves, Let
us turn then trom the introspective to the
extraspective and view the children with
whom we have to deal,

It has been truly said that real liberty
Hes in ovedicnce to law, that comprehen.
aive law of democracy established by the
qudgment of the majority tor the welfare
of the whole. Beyond this, Mberty is not
Uberty, but license. Of perfect freedom

there is none within the limits of civili-
zation. Absolute freedom is absolute an-
|archy, and taat is beyond the pale, It ts
|no doubt this perverted view of liberty
| gained through narrow minded interpre-
tation of American history and held by
| children of American descent, or a false
vonception of freedom on the part of the
children of foreign born parents, which
is one of the most startling symptoms
of poor citizenship. This attitude im-
plies both lack of reapect for and un-
readiness to yield obedience to con-
stituted authority. Doubtless a study
of civics as such may do much
to impress a child with the power
and importance of the machinery of gov-
ernment; that the study of geography
may fascinate him as well as indicate to
him graphically our territorial greatness
ae a nation, and that the study of history
may fill him with the ambition to be a
second Washington or inform him liter-
ally of the development of American
ideals and princip'es; but I do not believe

come a radical change in what is pre-
sented for the amusement of the boy and
| girl and a censoring of what appears for
|thetr information, and a law for all
| alike, before we get down to rock bottom
{on the question of true citizenship and
are able more logically to expect re-
spect for and obedience to constituted
authority. We have further to see that
}the child besides respecting law and

joraet shall have sufficient social quall- |

ties which shall include respect for the
| Property of others and exclude the Amer-
jican evil of selfishness. Maving these
; needs in mind, we may proceed to view
| the child whom we would make a citizen
in his fourfold aspect—phyeical, mental,
| Taoral and social.

This order of designation is not em-
| Ployed because one aspect is more im-
| portant than another, for each is equally
timportant, and all are interdependent.
) It is, rather, the natural chronological
|order of development. As has been al-
ready pointed out the capacity for cit!-
zenship develops with the ind{vidual. It
| is impossible to expect normal reflexes
from abnormal) stimuli, and it behooves
the State, the parent and the school to
assure every safeguard for the pliysical
well being of the child. The recently
Pastte National Service Handbook has
pointed out that every step taken in such
}a direction “is the primary form of !n-
surance of the country’s future.” This,
to my mind, is synonomous with good
eltizenship. The parents should help
the school and the school the parents in
establishing hygienic standards and pro-
| viding proper environments. The city
| child is immediately at a disadvantage
compared with his country cousing in
the matter of fresh air. good food and

agreeable recreations, but even with its!

| drawbacks In these directions there is
much in the fortuitous experlences that
| the city offers which makes a very genu-
‘ine contribution to the welfare of the
child. It is not at all too much to ex-

] pect that every child be regularly meas-

ured and inspected at school, and par-
|} ents and teacher should find the time for

| cooperative discussion, with the welfare |

| of the child in view, whenever these re-

| ports indicate too great divergence from |

{the normal.

Next, on the mental side,
|ments may be taken with equally good
‘purpose, providing the teacher, who

|should be child specialist enough to do,
| this, takes other factors into her con-|

; clusion beyond the mere gauging of the
| Binet and Simons’s test. ‘The laggard
and the precocious as well are both very

TT" Polytechnic Preparatory Coun-

affectionately styled Poly Prep,

known as a fathers’ § dinner, All
fathers having sons in the four
upper forms were invited, and more than
eighty of them gathered on Monday eve-
ining at the school at Dyker Heights,
| Brooklyn, N. Y., to meet the trustees,
headinaster and teachers. The visitors

of the boys, who escorted them about the
building. To simplify introductions via-

name cards, prepared by some of the
pupils, which were worn conspicuously,
After a preliminary welcome from Mr.

gathered in the gallery above the beauti-

\

{ful pool to watch an exhibition of swim- |

ming and dwing by members of the
swimming team, whose work was very
good and was much applauded, especially
, some ofth e fancy diving by Capt. Jel-

gathered {n the Commons Hall, where

| places were set for about one hundred

the big fireplace and the room was taste-
fully decorated with flags and banners
conspicuous among which was the new
service flag recently presented by the
Oasis in honor of the 350 Poly Prep men

Among those present were of the trus-
tees of the school Messrs, White, Post,

clean character, and this in turn makes
its fundamental and vital contribution
towards good citizenship.

Socially and lastly, gregarious in-
teréste, team work—especially in sports
—right social intercourse between boys
and girle, a budding perception of our
social obligations to one another, are
constructive factors in the making of a

and responsibilities of that office.

And now I have presented, as space
permits, some things for us to regard
in our experience as teachers. It would
‘seem to me very difficult, in fact, swell
nigh impossible, to teach patriotism as
such. But I am equally sure that it
may be “caught'’; that it is, in fact, as
| infectious as measles or as contagious
}as smallpox, for it is indeed an influ-
‘ence which parents, teachers and social
|} workers may radiate, leaving it to fol-
‘low its magic incubation through the
power of personality. On the contrary,

 

tion to these no little thought should be
given to the cultivation of unselfishness
and self-control. Surely if history be
oo it was greed and avarice that
brought the downfall of the great repub-
|lics of Greece and Rome, and in our
own time and at our own doors—in a
| ®&™Mall way—we see those same qualities
making for instability in Mexico. Self-

and to the very last meeting one week
before his death a faithful advocate of
all that is fine, ennobling and patriotic
in our profession, Theodore Clarence
Mitchill rendered through this organ-
ization no inconsiderable part of that
great public service which character-
{zed his life. Always a devoted follower
of the Great Teacher he sought un-
flinchingly the truth, and when he felt
he had found it he fought for it with
zeal. To him is attributable in no small
measure the vast reform in the rela-

tionship of schoo! and college and the |

humanizing of the entrance require-
ments in Engliech, To him, moreover,
is due in great degree the development
of the high school system of
of New York into an instrument of
vast power “for the advancement of
the public good.” As teacher of Eng-
lish and as principal he exercised
throughout the formative years of this
comparatively new department a steady
influence for the highest and best, and
toward this end he frequently helped
mould through this association the pub-
lic opinion which fostered his ideals.
To record his sudden death on Decem-
ber 27, 1918, at the all too early age
of 52 years is peculiarly sorrowful to
his fellow members.
