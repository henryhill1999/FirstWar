TAPAN WILL HOLD
CHINA TO TREATY

ee eee

Also Wishes to Retain the
South Sea Islands “for Sen-
timental Reasons.”

 

HER POSITION IS DEFINED

Mineral Rights in Shantung
Province to Be Developed,
but Open Door Continued.

 

Special Despatch to Tap Sey.

SVASHINGTON, Feb, 1.--Japan’s peace
programme, her policy toward China tn
general and Kiao-chau in particular, were
explained authoritatively to-day. The
Japanese viewpoint as described here
constitutes a reply to the reports from
Paris indicating that the Tokio Govern-
ment had instructed its delegates to
tnsist upon the acquisition of the Caro-
line and Marshall islands for military
or strategic purposes and likewise takes
‘ssue with the Chinese version of
Japan's plans for dominance of China.

In explaining the Japanese attitude it

(9 first stated that the new Hara Cabl- |

net in Tokio has decided upon a policy
which it hopes will entitle Japan to
receive general commendation from the
Powers for fairness, faithfulness to in-

ternational obligations and readiness to}

embrace real democratic ideals,

The big outstanding fact which Tokio
wishes to emphasize at the peace table
ig the determination of the majority of
the Japanese to merit respect in every
full trust among the ‘eading Powers.
This the Japanese explain does not mean
that Japan is not going to press matters
which are of practical importance but It
does mean that the Japanese delegates
are going to attempt to drive “their
business bargains in the same spirit of
democracy actuating the European
Powers.”

Islands Sought for Sentiment.

Features of the Japanese programme
include:

First, acquisition of the Caroline
and Marshall islands for sentimental
reasons.

Beoond, retention of certain advan-
tages in the restoration of Kiaoa-chau
to China,

Third, guarantee of Japan's position
in the Far Bast, including the special
position which Japan enjoys with re-
spect to the resources of China, but
with the understanding that the “open
door” principle is to be adhered to for
the advantage of the other Powers as
Well as Japan.

Before particularizing wtih respect to
Japan's policy toward Shantung Prov-
ince and Kiaoa-chau wel informed Jap-
enese here cite the following features
of the Tokio Government's recent policy

toward China:

First—Tokio, together with the
Powers following her (Japan's) sug-
@estion, took steps to help China by
working for peace between the North
and South factions. As a result a con-
ference between leaders of Pekin and
Canton is to be held at Shanghai in a
few days with every prospect of end-
tme Chinese internal strife.

Second--—Japan has taken steps to
@iscourage reckless borrowing of money
By China and virtually has forbidden
the Japanese to loan money except in
eases where it is for the material ben-
efit of the Chinese.

Third—The Japanese Government
has made it clear to American finan-
elers that a joint financial policy of
the United States and Japan toward
helping China would be agreeable and
Beneficiai.

Policy Resta on China,

 

The Japanese do not deny that a cor-
nerstone of their national policy
upon the development of the resources
of China. This is in fact judged essen-
tial to Japan's economic existence. But
in developing these resources the Japa-
nese take the stand that they are helping
all Powers as well ag Japan and that it
is to the general interest of civilization
that China be developed and that Japan
is the logical nation to guide this work.

One spokesman here described the re-
lations between Japan and China as sim-
flar to the relations of “husband and

rests |

    
 
 

wife” in the sense that the wife must de-
pend on the husband just as China must
depend on Japan.

“Sometimes the wife becomes agi-
tated,” he added, “but in reality they
are inseparable.”

With respect to Kiaochou, Japan will
insist upon the validity of the treaty
with China of 1916; in other worus, the
so-called twenty-one demands. This
treaty is viewed by the Japanese Gov-
ernment as a sacred document, just like
any other treaty properly signed and
agreed to, China's contention that the
twenty-one demands should be declared
null and void at the Peace Conference is
not admitted by Japanese.

Will Retain Mineral Rights.

Certain advantages, like the acquisi-
tion of mining rights in Shartung prov-
Ince, the estab shment of an frterat-
tional settlement, &c., are expected to be
retained by the Tokio Government when
-eochou is returned to China, and the
Japanese believe that China should oc
well satisfied with this bargain.

The Chinese permitted Germany to
hold and exploit Shantung province at
the point of the bayonet for fifteen years,
the Japanese say, and the Germans
fortified Tsingtau and made this area
Into a military zone. Why then, they
ask, should the Chinese now feel they
are being imposed upon because Japan
gives her back this territory with only
such retentions as have been agreed
upon by the treaty of 19157

The question of the Pacific !slands
is more of a matter of sentiment than
of strategy for Japan, according to the
Japanese explanation. If other Powers
retain possessions captured from Ger-
many Japan wants to retain hers. The
Japanese delegates would not relish fac-
ing criticism in Tokio for having re-
; linquished the results achieved by Japan
| in the war and this criticism doubtless
would be made ff Japan alone gave up
| the rights she had captured

Paris, Feb. 1.—The Rev. Father Le-
mire, who sits in the Chamber of Depu-
ties from the Department of the Nord,
moved his fellow members in the Cham-
ber to-day by a speech proposing that
an avenue of trees be planted along the
entire battlefront, which would serve as
a place of pilgrimage for those who do
not know where their dead fell. He asked
tha. the Government buy the battlefields
and make a forest from the North Sea
to the Vosges Mountains.

Albert Lebrun, Minister of the Invaded
Regions, in replying for the Government,
| said that every honor would be done the
| dead. Cemeteries, he said, would be
! laid out at points where the fighting was
| heaviest and entire battleflelds would be

MOTIVES OF CHINA

 

‘Japanese Publicity Head Says
She Seeks to Renounce
Treaty of 1915.

DEMANDS A FAIR DEAL

Asserts That Asiatic Republic
Did Almost Nothing to
Win War.

Ai

The only noise from the Far East
heard nowadays in the world is the voice
of China, which did almest nothing to-
ward winning the war, said Dr. T. Iye-
naga, a Japanese and head of the East
and West News Bureau. He took ad-
vantage of a meeting in the Bankers
Club held yesterday to discuss trans-
Pacific cable communications to point
out that the inadequate connections with
Japan left that people silent at a time
when all the world is ra{sing its voice
in protest or demand.

“Among many felicitous utterances of
President Wilson,” he said, “none in my
mind so clearly and forcibly has etruck
the keynote of the new era that has
dawned upon the wor!d as the remark
he made at the Peace Congress in pro-
posing the league of nations. He said
in effect that the destinies of mankind
are now in the hands of the plain people
of the whole world and therefore it is
necessary for the peace delegates to sat-
iafy the opinion of mankind. The old dl-
plomacy is thus committed to obiivion
and the people’s diplomacy has come.
The new diplomacy cannot, however, be
put Into practice unless the people have
at their command the means of making
themselves fully conversant with the
world situation and of forming thereby
thelr opinions about it.”

Japan’s Press Hampered.

Dr. Iyenaga pointed out that between
this country and Japan there is only one
line of cable communication, and a

wireless plant, altdgether inadequate to |

papers of Japan he said could not print
full and illuminating articles on world
politics and conditions without going
into bankruptcy becauso of the present
rates.

“So vital has become the role played

by the cables and the wireless in the |

growth of democracy and in the realiza-
tion of ‘people's democracy’ that no ef-
fort should be spared
efficiency and multiply thelr services.
“In concluding, you will permit me
to illustrate the point I have been
dwelling upon, The great Senate of the
United States is complaining to-day
through the mouths of its eminent mem-
bers, that it is kept in the dark about
the peace proceedings. How much more
will the Japanese people feel so! They

across the Pacific. It is, therefore, hard
to gauge thelr feelings. The only noise
nowadays heard is the noise made by
China, Now that the war is over, Cnina,
which during the war was warned by her
allies for her failure to serve efficiently
the allied cause, seems to have started
on a venture to captivate the world by
her tongue and pen. Wer delegates and
agents in Paris, Washington and else-
where are Industriously engaged in set-
ting up her claims. Were words without
the backing of deeds sufficient to cap-
ture the world, what a cheap job it
would be! It is weH to remember that
the words of President Wilson, eloquent
as they are, derive their driving force
from the immortal deeds of 100,000,000
Americans who contributed to the win- |
ning of the war. ‘

Defends Treaty of 1015.

“It is reported that Dr. Wellington
Koo has asserted at the Peace Congress
that the China-Japan Treaty of 1915 |
nugatory, for, he argues, it was con-
cluded under duress. Does Dr. Koo
mean to intimate that China is so weak,
so helpless that she could not help sign-
ing the treaty under compulsion, and
that the treaty, which she, after elimi-!
nating what she considered objection. |
able, namely, group V.. has signed in
good faith, is to-day, after four years
of operation, to be thrown into the waste i
basket? s China going to repeat the
story of Germany in tearing up treaties
as ‘scraps of paper’? Is the interna-
tional order, which is based upon the
faithful fulfillment of treaties entered
into between nations to be upset by the
vagaries and whims of the time serving
diplomats? I hope not. I was aware
that Bolshevism is running riot in
Russia, but I did not imagine that it
is spreading so fast and wide to other
portions of the globe.
| “Japan is silent. She has done her
part in the war to the best of her eabil-
itv; shevfeels assured that her task. loy-
ally and faithfully performed, will re-
| ceive due recognition by her allies. As
| she has made sacrifices during the war
so she js i*af@v jo make more sacrifices
| for the cattee of harmony among the
Powers and for the realization of the
| league of nations. T am disposed to think
|that she might agree with good grace
to a compromise plan evolved by the
congress for the possession and ad-
ministration of the South Sea Islands,
which she now occupies, if this is to be
for the good of all.

 

Expects Equal Treatment.

“Japan hails the league of nations, for
{t stands upon the foundations of justice,
equality and fraternity. As Japan is
ready to render justice to other nations,
so she expects from them fair, just and
equal treatment.

“Japan has kept every international
pledge she has made We are assured
by her Foreign Minister that Japan will
restore Kiaochow to China. This, how-
ever, I arm confident she will do of her
own accord—-not because of any pres-
sure exerted from outside, least of all by
China, which has neither shed a drop of
blood nor expended a cent for the re-
duction of the (German fortress. The
| German lease of the territory would
jhave run for seventy-odd years more
jhad not the Japanese forces in conjunc-
tion with the British troops wrested it
jfrom Germany. It would, therefore, be
;none but a graceful act on Japan's part

if she restored jt to China at the con-
‘clusion of peace.

Austrailia Also Cumplains.

lic men between the two countries, and
better reciprocal news services #o that
they might become better acquainted.

The relationship between foreign trade
and news was the theme of Roy How-
ard, head of the United Press, who
pointed out the superiority of the British
in this respect. He said that one reason
Great Britain had so long been preemi-
nent in foreign trade was because of the
codperation between the Government,
trade interests and the press. The Brit-
ish, he said, even limited commercial
cable service so that the press might
have a fair amount of time in which to
transmit despatches,

Brirast, Feb. 1.—The strike situation
herg is assuming an uglier phase. The
Strike Bulletin, got out by the strikers,
announces that because of the refusal
of the employers to consult with the
Lord Mayor regarding the situation
“serious consideration is being given to
the question whether a more drastic
policy should not be adopted.”

Strike pickets have intimated to the
owners of two of the big shipbuilding
plants that they will not be allowed to
visit their works without a permit from
the strikers’ committee.

SS NS SS

Several highway robberies have oc-
curred in the Yashionable suburbs of the
city.

The refusal of the Government to in-
tervene In the strike and the nonaccep-
tance by the employers of the Lord
Mayor's invitation to confer ‘with the
strikers brought about a complete dead-
lock. The men's leaders declare that
they will not give way and are devot-
ing their energies to strengthen their
position by obtaining the cooperation
of labor tn other parts of Ireland.

They say that the refusal of the em-
ployers to discuss the situation with
them has aroused bitterness and re-
sentment. In their official organ, the
Strike Bulletin, they declare:

“If the employers think that the work-
ers of Belfast are going to submit to
be treated like a pack of disobedient
children, their error will @eoon become
apparent, The federation is now con-

sidering what answer shall be given to
the challenge and the the rank and
file look to their leaders to express
worthily their determination not to re-
fuse the gage of battle. It is too carly
to forecast the line of action likely to
be adopted by the general strike com-
mittee, but it is certain that it will rise
to the occasion and take such further
steps as the situation demands.”

GLascow, Feb. 1.—-The city was com-
paratively quiet this forenoon, {n strik-
ing contrast to the incidents of the
strike situation yesterday. <A grave re-
minder of the doings of yesterday was
afforded by the presence of thousands
of soldiers who were patrolling the
railway bridges and vulnerable points in
various parts of the city. The soldiers
were attired in full service uniform,
wore steel helmets and carried guns with
fixed bayonets,

Except for many broken windows the
streets of Glasgow to-day bore a nor-
tral aspect. The street cars were run-
ning aa usual and only fifteen cars were
unfiit for service,

Councillor Shipwell, a tailor, who is
chairman of the strike committee, and
who was arrested this morning, is con-
sidered to be one of the extremists.
Bail for his release has been refused
and he is being held on charges of
inciting to riot

LONDON, Feb. 1.--There was no im-
provement in the strike situation in the
United Kingdom to-day. If anything,
there seems to be a probability of
the trouble spreading, although the In-
tervention of the military at Glasgow is
considered likely to dampen the ardor
of the eleinents inclined to resort to
rioting.

Ship repairers on the Thames side,
who have been out during the week
without strike pay, have received prom-
|

isea from their unions of fifteen shillings |

aman weekly. Therefore the possibility
of a shortness of funds ending the strike
has disappeared.
