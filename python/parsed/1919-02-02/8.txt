Steam Sizes Will Drop Probably
36 Cents a Ton.

Delos W. Cooke, State Fuel Adminis-
trator, said yesterday that the removal
of the Federal restrictions on prices and
movements of anthracite does not affect
the regulations governing the sale and
distribution of coal in less than half ton
lots in the city and State of New York,
‘The prices for the balance of the winter
of coal in less than half ton lots in the
greater city, he explained, must not ex-
ceed 60 cents a hundred pounds at the
cellar when called for and 70 cents when
delivered. Wagon venders and other
pedlers must sell at the same price. The
trice at retail vards is 55 cents on the
as}: and carry basis.

Tt was said yesterday that as the re-
sult of the removal of restrictions it ts
likely retall prices in Manhattan and
The Bronx of domestic sizes, including
pea coal, will be reduced an average of

5 cents per ton to-morrow. The price
of anthracite steam sizes—buckwheat,
rice and barley—will be reduced 35 cents
a ton, it 1s understood.

Cable Rules Hamper Business.

A good many business men are ask-
Ing Postmaster-Genersl Burleson why
{it is, now that the war is over, that
they cannot use the well known codes
instead of the French or English
language in cabling to European points.
They say that they are needlessiy ham-
pered in transacting legitimate business
by the continuance of war time rules
imposed by the British censorship.
They appeal to Mr. Rurleson for relief
because he now controls the American
cable service.
