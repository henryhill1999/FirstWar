BROOKLYN PITCHERS
FORMIDABLE ARRAY

Pfeffer, Grimes, Smith, Ca-
dore, and Marquard Keep
Robbie Smiling.

CHENEY, ACE IN HOLE

Dodgers Also Have Mitchell
Mamaux and Miljus to
Call Upon.

By SHORTSTOP.

No manager in baseball had greater
worries during the war than Wilbert
Robinson, the rotund manager of the
Brooklyn Dodgers. Almost every day
that Robby
Field he received notice that some
pitcher had signed up with Uncle Sam.
In fact Brooklyn almost had enough
pitahers in service to supply the entire
army and navy.

When the war closed Big Ed Pfeffer,
Rube Marquard and Burleigh Grimes
wore the wide blue pants of Uncle
Sam's sailor lads while Lieut, Leon
Cadore, Sergeants Sherrod Smith, Clar-
ence Mitchell and Jolin Miljus were
fheaded for the Rhine in a garb of khak!.
Larry Cheney, Al Mamaux and Dan
Griner did their best to help the sol-
diera get across by making ehips.
Cheney was not in the same category
with the others He is a family man
and stuck to Brooklyn until Labor Day,
when he complied with the work or
fight order and got a job with a Staten
Island shipbuilding company.

Robinson is likely to reap a reward
next season for the patriotism of his
pitchers. As Robby lost pitcher after
pitcher, he had to replace therm with
other material. Now that he is likely
to have the whole staff back it looks
as if the rolypoly manager from Balti-
more will be able to piece together one
of the ablest Minging corps In baseball.

Every Man a Star.

Under the new twenty-one playing
limit it is figured that major league
teams will carry about seven pitchers.
Robby can fill out his staff with seven
men, all of whom at one time or an-
other were stars, or near stars, in their
profession. They are Ed Pfeffer, Leon
Cadore, Sherrod Smith, Burleigh Grimes,
Larry Cheney, Rube Marquard and Al
Mamaxx.

For a pinch hitter, utility outfielder
and first baseman and extra left handed
pitcher Robby may carry larence
Mitchell. Many a managpr would spend
@ Lappy winter if he could contemplate
etarting the season with sucb a staff.

Perhaps the best part of it for Robby
fa that five of these men—-Pfeffer, Ca-
dore, Smith, Grimes and Mamaux—still
are comparative youngsters. At least
three of them have the best part of their
career ahead of tiem.

Judging from the work of Burleigh
Grimes, the young spttball pitcher pro-
cured in last winter's deal with Pitts-
burg, he ts likely to blossom out as the
star of the staff. Grimes's pitching was
one of the features of a rather dismal
season last year. Grimes got off to a
bad start when he went to Pittsburg in
1916 and he had a losing streak of four-
teen straight league games before he put
ever a victory for Brooklyn last May.

Burleigh, however, evened up this ac-

count when he won ten straight games |

for the Dodgers last season. the highest
run of the year. The winning streak is
all the more commendable when {t is
realized he made !t with a second divi-
sion team. After Grimes got started last
season he was almost unhittable, and in
the matter of earned runs, as we!! as in
fames won and lost, he stood right up
with the best in the league.

Robbie Heard a Sigh.

Last spring when Ed Pfeffer quit the
Brooklyn training trip Robinson sighed,
“The big fellow was in better form than
I ever saw him. He would have breezed
right through the league with the stuff
he was showing in the spring.”

Pfeffer was one of the best pitchers in
the league before he went to war, and it
hardly is likely that he lost any of his
effectiveness while serving in Undéle
Sam's navy. He !s only 29 and still
should be on the top of his form. Pfeffer
had his beat year tn 1916, when Brook-
lyn won !ts pennant. Ha won twenty-
five games and lost eleven, for a per-
centage of 694. There is no reason why
the big fellow will not go ase strong this
year.

Leon Cadore is a youngster who be-
@an to reach his priine last season. He
etill is in the army, a Lieutenant con-
nected with the Ninety-second Division,
the negro unit, but as the Ninety-second
fe s)ated for early return to this country
Lieut. Cadore may be released from ser-
vice in tlme to go to Jacksonville with
his teammates.

Cadore, a Brooklyn boy, {s regarded
by Robinson as one of his biggest assets
in the upbuilding of the Brooklyns. The
young Lieutenant pitched several
games for the Flatbush clan last sum-
mer while he was on his vacation, One
@ame resulted in a shutout, while in
another he held his opponents to two
rune.

Sherrod Smith, the lefthander who
wave Babe Ruth such a battle in the
longest world's series game ever played
fn the 1916 series, may not be on hand
when the season starts unless the base-

wandered out to Ebbets |

The veteran, Rube Marquard, did some

atart and still is a very handy man to
have around. And despite the fact that
Rube came Into the National League
eleven years ago he still is {n his late

Mamaux an Enigma,

Varry Cheney is beginning to show

the big leagues, and he was at the foot
of the class in earned runs last year
But Larry just missed getting an ‘even
break in games won by one game, as he

last season was a poor year to judge a

By CROSS COUNTER.

Despite the fact that a pugilistic title
fever has been forfeited in America
since the Queensberry rules went into
effect, and that a championship never
'has been acquired by claim unless the
previous incumbent had formally retired
or died, claimants continue feverishly
active.

The chief offensive appears to be di-
recied at the middleweight title of Mike
O'Dowd, and if a few more 160 pound-
ers file claims to the honors of the class
there will be but one dissenting voice—
that of O'Dowd.

If Mike, who has been battling with
the Huns for a year, were in this coun-
try, the claimants might not be so per-
@istent, but the fact of the champion
being on the soil of France seems to
embolden the claimants.

O'Dowd scarcely had reached France
when Jeff Smith, a valiant boxing in-
structor at Camp Dix, announced
through his manager, Al Lippe, that
O'Dowd need not bother about the title
that he won through knocking out Al
McCoy, as he (Smith) would assume
all responsibilities of {ts defence in fu-
ture.

The merriment evoked by this pro-
nouncement hardly had died away when
Tom Gibbons, brother of Mike, declared
that as Mike was about to retire he
(Tom) would act as floor manager of
the middleweight title in future. Tom
never even mentioned O'Dowd. Not
much attention was paid to Tom and
when Mike O'Dowd went over to London
and mauled three light heavyweights,
including the champion of the class, it
was thought the pretenders would cease
troubling.

Johnston the Original.

Now comes Jimmy Johnston with a
claim that®Tommy Robson, whose man-
agement he took over recently,
middleweight champion. Johnston says
that Robson will defend the title until
Mike O'Dowd returns and then if O'Dowd
is at the weight, he will permit the
champion to attempt to regain the title.
Johnston says that O'Dowd no longer
can scale at the middleweight Hmit.

This bit of presumptuousness {s truly
worthy of Johnston. O'Dowd was fight-
ing in the trenches while Robson was
over here, but that doves not stop John-
ston from making a play ‘or the title
while the rea? champion stil! is overseas.
And to cap the climax, Robson takes
part in a™bout in Cleveland tn which
he ts said to have knocked out Walter
Laurette, while the real Laurette was
in New York. Johnston and Robson both
knew that the man in the ring was not
Laurette, and dre likely to be handed
something by the Cleveland Commiseion
on Tuesday.

The offictal report of the bouts in Al-
bert Ha!) declare that O'Dowd weighed
156 pounds and went into the light
heavyweight class because there was
none else to defend American honors in

that division,

tenders to a title to which they have

not the remotest claim will do well to
sing low, for when O'Dowd returns he
will have an angry glare fn his light
blue eyes that will bode {11 to the men
who have taken advantage of his pres-
ence on the firing line and attempted to
strip him of his well earned laurels as
the world’s middlewelght champipn.
Another flagrant offender in the mat-
ter of a baseless claim to title ia Walter
Laurette, a welter who has been quite
freely beaten all along the line; Lau-
rette through his manager lecently had
iit announced that he was the welter
{champion of England. He hoids no such
i title, as it is formally in possession of
Johnny Basham, who was one of the

Albert Badoud, who was the welter
champion of France, beat Basham pre-
vious to the war for the welter cham-
pionship of Europe, and Kid Lewis, the
welter champion of America, knocked
out Badoud in this city and thus be-
came the welter champion of the world.

Valger at It Too.

A little Frenchman named Benny
Valger, who has done all his boxing,

Frederick W. Rubien, president of
the Metropolitan Association of the A

delegation, presented a plan whieh pro-
vides for a quarter mile running track
with a 220 yard straightway, enclosing a
fleld large enough for a regulation in-
tercollegiate or soccer football game,

Mr. Rubdien pointed out to Commis
sioner Hennessy that the fleld ig so
planned that it can be developed

lexpense, leaving for the future the co:
{struction of a stadium. It is suggested
that as early as convenient one portion
of the stadium be built which would seat
15,000 persons, with provisions under-
neath for a gymnasium, tndoor handbaN
