Peerless Closed Cars
and the Double Power-Range

Closed cars that bear the name
Peerless have ever been notable
among the finest coaches built.

This season’s models are no ex-
ception, in fact, in many respects
surpass previous Peerless attain-
ment.

The coach bodies—Coupe—Se-
dan--and Sedan-Limousine—-are
Peerless built by workmen who
have made coach building an art-
many of whom worked on the first
Peerless Limousines that set the
standard by which the fine Closed
Cars of that day were judged.

The most distinctive advantage
offered in any motor car today
two distinctly separate power
ranges—gives the Peerless owner a
contrasting performance that is es
pecially desirable in Closed Cars.

7 passenger Touring, $2760
4 passenger Coupe, $3320

In ordinary driving the thrifty

‘loafing’’ range givesa soft,

smooth, easy performance that is a
delight.

And its “sporting” range is in-
stantly available to “ pick up”’ these
heavier bodies and lift them out of
traffic jams, ahead of other cars-
even those with the lighter open
bodies.

And as a matter of fact, it is of
importance to note that the Peer-
less Closed Cars are lighter than
most open body models of cars of
like class.

Let the Peerless dealer show you
the luxurious Peerless Closed mod-
els—-and demonstrate the special
advantage they have in their Two-
Power-Ranges.
