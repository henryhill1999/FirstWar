The Scientists Recreate

By GEORGE GORDON.
HE. diseovery of the displacement of
water by Archimedes as he floated _
in his bath at Syracuse is of ali scientific
discoveries the one that has always most
delichted me. It was a great discovery
and it was promptly and fittingly cele-
brated when the painstaking physicist
rushed naked onto the strects shouting
Eureka! Eureka!

The scientific mind is not ofien so spon-
tancousiy freed of restraint. Before enu-
merating the varivus theories of Moore,
Allen, Piluger, Schafer and Osborn con-
cerning the origin of life upon this planet
Professor Woudruff in his lecture on the
subject, delivered at Yale last year, warns
us that “the theories are not advanced by
their authors of the
problem, but rather as gropings toward a
formulation of the conditions which con-
ceivably might have attended and contrib-
uted to the genesis of life.” Huxley in
his presidential address before the British
Association for the Advancen:ent of Set-
ence, 1870, satd: “Looking baek tt

night. Who would not siand in awe and
admiration before nature, knowing her
seeret history, the majestic horror of her
birth?

Then the tale is taken up by Professor
Woodruff and we study the theories con-
cerning the origin of life. We begin with
Aristotle. We know that life is procre
ated at present only by hic. Did the first
germs float through spaee, tiny atoms of
energy, to rest and slowly increase in
strength, finding here a fit breeding
ground? Or were they born of inert mat-
ter? And how was man evolved through
the ape, the archaic mammals, the earhest
vertebrate from the invertgbrate ercatures
of the sea?

The volame before me closes with a dis-
eussion by Professor Huntington of the
influence of climate upon the progress of
Gvilization. “Climatie energy is one of
the great factors which must be reekoned
with if any attempt to understand the
evolution of civilization.” Tt made neees- *
sary the first fires that, quite by accident,
melted the first ore from which iron eame.
It made possibie the abundant grasses
that advised man to domesticate the horse,
It has a
powerful effect upon human vitality. It is
a giver and destrover of life. Tt will in
the end make the earth as inhabitable as
it was in the beginning.
