Other signs of the sudden revival of
the military spirit are not lacking. For/|
s@veral days the German newspapers
have been discussing the question of re-|
sponsibility for the war in surly lan-
guage and with « sarcastic tenor, in
which they seem to reflect exactly the!
state of mind of the ‘public.

Some of them denounce the charge,
thet Germany is responsible for the war,
and again place the blame on Russia. |
Relgium, they say, merits ali that she,
has suffered because she is herself to)

Old Generals Get Hearing. |

Generals of the old caste again have
gained the ear of the public and are
Ajseussing tore and more each day the
auestion of the future of the German
army. All seem to arrive at the con-
clusion that the army of the German
republic must be at least as good and
as powerful as that of the German Em- |!
pire in 1914. This idea seems to domi- |
nate every movement of the present
government, which is seeking to ex-
ploit the divergencies of views that it
pretends to discover between France,
Great Britain and America, '

The French view of the present situa- |
tion in Germany is plainiy one of|
alarm. T’revailing opinion favors the!
full use of the powers under the armis- |
tice to cope with a menace which is}
regarded as decidedly dangerous. Will |
Rerlin be oceupied by the allied troops?
is the question now being asked.

Lonpos, Feb. |.—The Gernian Imperial
Rank denies that its $4625.000.900 goid|

'odged in provincial branches, especially |
in South Germany. An official statement |
explaing that the bank, in accordance!
with a custom of long standing, always
keeps a large portion of its reserve in|
towns remote from Berlin. Two-thirds |
of the total reserve is lodged in various |
Maces throughout the country for gold)
payment necessities. !
This system prevails to-day. Thus
only a fraction of the aggregate reserve
ie in Berlin. If conditions in any com-
munity ever become dangerous, as at
Posen at nresent, the gold ie removed

sentative of the War Trade Roard's in-
telligence department, said there {@ ap-
proximately $100,000,000 in savings of
Hungarians and other foreigners in the
United States which is hidden away in
tin cans, old clothes and other uneafe
places.

Asked by Chairman Overman if George
Creel, chairman of the Committee on
Public Information, had not organized a
bureau for thé purpose of Americanizing
Hungarians, Mr. Steiner said:

“Really the Creel organization did |
more to Evuropeanize the Mungarians
than {t did to Americanize them.”

Asked by Senator Nelson ¢(Minn.) if
My. Cree] were not a Hungarian Mr. |
Steiner said that he was not. He said
that the methode of the organization
fostered by Mr, Cree] were not success-

LanpDoN, Feb, 1.—The British Ministry
of Commerce has already established a
department and is ready to commence
operations immediately. One of’ the first
matters to be inquired into {s that of

expediting the issue of permits for Brit-
{sh exports,

 

 

“There are already enough Britishers

big business possible, but difficulties
which now should be things of the Paat
are cropping up conatantly and are mak-
ing actual trading a heartbreaking oper.
ation,” said an official to the correapond-
ent of THe Sun.

“Personally I have heard of several

, cases where British manufacturers hold |

they have not been abla to convince
somebody as to the wisdom of issuing a
permit.

“We desire, naturally, to help our allles
first, but we must keep an eve on coun |
war and now are waiting to exchange
their money for British manufactured
articles.”

The Absorbing Question of Dress

Aten pervading spirit of Fashion has vividly impressed
itself upon the countlessly lovely articles of dress
for women and the younger set.

inspired by the indications of an unusually prolonged social
season, the collection of frocks, suits, wraps and hats continues to
be dominated by all the capriciousness and fascination of this
supreme arbiter. For street wear, forenoon shopping, or morning
musicale; for matinee-iuncheon, tea-hour or promenade; for the
leisure moments that mark the dividing line between afternoon
activities and evening formalities; for mideseason dinners and
dances; for the theatre and exclusive supper-parties there are
modes eminently appropriate and pre-eminently charming.

sunny-weather frocks—an_ ear-
nest of what the feminine world
may look for when the warmer
days are actually here.

Wonderfully pretty are these
fascinating creations—in which
cotton assumes a luxuriousness
that may well excite the envy of
silk.

Here are simple little morning
frocks of organdie, dimity and
voile (and some of linen that
are distinctly chic); luncheon
and apres=-midi frocks of supple
Georgettes and fine nets, exqui-
sitely hand-embroidered; and
in fact, frocks for every hour of
the Spring or Summer day,
whether it be spent within doors
or without.

A mumber of these are copies of
imported models and may, there-
fore, be accepted as a reflection
of the gay spirit that is begin-
ning to dominate the world of
fashion across seas; but many
others-—no less appealing
