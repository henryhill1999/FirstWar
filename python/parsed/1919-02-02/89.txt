“Portrait of Mrs. Moore,” by J. S. Sargent; recently shown at
Knoedler’s.

By HENRY McBRIDE.

He was studying the laws of motion,

and had struck two large question of |

vital importance to America—inertia of
race and inertia of sex.—-'The Educa-
tion of Henry Adams,” page 444.

O disentangle a single thread
from such a complicated weave
as “The Education of Henry

Adams” would be impossible, so the
conspicuous and important fact that a
Bostonian jn the pursuit of art has

finally, like Walt Whitman, mentioned |
the word Sex, cannot be ‘presented |

without admitting that he mentioned
several less classic words, such as

“Aynamos” and “X-rays,” in the same |

breath.

This will seem peculiarly and amus- |

]

ingly American to foreigners who, al- |
ways having had Art andgalway's hav- |

ing had Sex and generally finding them

indistinguishable, will regard the ef- |

fort to reduce cither one of these terms
to algebraic equations, as something

more Shandian than even poor Lau- '

rence Sterne ever dreamed of.

. But the fact remains, and [I am in-
clined to regard the occasion as an his-
toric one, that no matter how Mr.
Adams may have mouthed the word,
he did pronounce it, and as the word
must be pronounced many times on
this side of the water before our great

put inexperienced public loses its fright!
of the word sufficiently to enfranchise |

our artists whose very lives and souls
depend upon a little knowledge of this
subject, I hasten to quote him.

But first I suppose IT ought to ex-
plain how this writer, who sprang
from that House of Adums that sup-
plied so many early Presidents to this
nation, came upon his cl lear perceptions |
and thirst for truth, Adams is sur-
passingly frank, franker even thant

the promises or threats, and resolving

everything finally into the highly char-

s0 on and on.

Mr, Adams is very exact with his|
coal figures, and long befof the late
unpleasantness with Germany had
been considered by any than roman
ers and poets had awarded world su-
premacy to the nation that got most
power from her coal. The particular
nation he had in mind need not be
mentioned here, but at least it can be
atated that the picture he gives us of
its future does not seem any more
alluring than our knowledge of its
present:

“He could see that the new Ameri
