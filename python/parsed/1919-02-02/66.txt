As the Peerless Motor Car Company
evters upon the fourth year of its pro-
eduction of the Two Power) Range Kight,

Mclals look back with pride upon the
results of tes which have proven its}
remarkable economical advantages

They point in particular to the success
of the Two Power Range model in the
T.os Angeles-Camp Curry economy run in
which this car, the only multiple cylin-
der entry, carried off the honors. With
\ total weight of 4,860 pounds, including |
massengers and baggage, the Teerless
made the 644.4 miles over boulevards,
‘arough canyons, across desert and up
nountain roads, averaging 16.6 miles to

Manage: New York branch Mavritell-

Imagine a giant steering wheel encom. |
passing the whole of Greater New York,
with lines of magnetic contact extending
out from one man at the centre, and
you will have a grasp of the new and
successful method carried out by the
New York Maxwell-Chalmers organiza-
tion to maintain service and further
owner satisfaction among New Yorkers
possessed of these makes of cars.
The keynote—and the new note—in
this giant wheel of owner touch is that
il takes service to the owner, instead
of putting it in one place where the
has to come to it In that re-
spect the development is something dif- |
ferent in Atrerican automobile retailing
practice. |

zation, and corresponding to the car's

J. De Bear, manager of the New York
Maxwell-Chalmers retail branch, which
is at Broadway and Fifty-ninth street

In wn years of automobile retailing in
New York, Philadelphia and other points,
and ‘with eight years of first hand ex-
perience with New York car buyers, Mr.
De Bear has put beyond question in his
own mind and throughout his own or-
ganization that the most important fac-
tor in the sale of an automobile is the
continuous satisfaction and enthusiasm
on the part of the owner after the car
goes into his service

“One car sold can destroy numberless
succeeding sales if the service the owner
has a right to ts not given, and if his
griginal enthusiasm for his car is de-
stroyed through a lack of performance

of our own plain duty to our owners,”
Mr. De Bear asserted. “On precisely
the same basis, one car sold can result

in numberless other sales for our organ-
ization if we do our duty to owners.
That fact has been abundantly proved
to me—so much so that practically every
plan we enter Into in accomplishing sales
must be based on a full understanding
of what Maxwell and Chalmers owners
are to receive from us in treatment after
they buy their cars. One car sold from
our branch is, in other words, ten or
twenty or possibly fifty sales just begun.
takes a car from our
place of business he Qecomes just so much
of the ‘publi¢s The automobile owning |
public can make or break any motor car
buisness, since it is this public that we
depend on and come in contact with.”
Having convinced the executives of
the Maxwell-Chalmers factories in De-

| troit, as well as himself, of the wisdom

of developing to the utmost the big fac-
tor of owner satisfaction, Mr. De Bear
now heads what is declared to be one of

“The one outstanding characteristic
of an automobile is its ability to get

necessarily racing speed, but rapid mo-

personal transportation. Now when you
have speed the machine which produces
it must be well made or the rapid mo-
tion will soon wear it out. To prevent
this requires a higher grade of work-
manship with more rigid inspection than
obtains in almost any other line of man-
ufacture, \

“Then, too, automobiles could never be

not built one at a time, but made in
great quantities. To do this means that
all similar parts must be so nearly alike

the desired results.
