Dr. Nicholas Murray Butler
‘Tells What Other Nations
Are Doing and What
Our Needs Are Now

 

By EDWARD MARSHALL. |

HROUGHOUT the civilized world |
| to-day the subject of after the |

War education is receiving at-

tention. The war itself has empha-

sized the value of the school in an ex-
traordinary way. }

It was tho fact that the best edu-}
cated young men of Britain made the}
best fighting men unquestionably— |
although IT never have seen this state- |
ment made elsewhere—that put the,

amazing Fisher educational bill

through Parliament with a rush at a}
time when the appropriation of the |

vast sums it required for anything

other than the prosecution of the war

seemed too much for the father of the

splendid legislation even to hope for,
4m France*there is almost as great

anh impulse toward perfecting plans for

the development of the average hu-
man being.

In Italy, at the
break, when the Austrians were flow-

time of the great

ing over the boundary and the nation
was in a state of dismay, a Cabinet!

Minister and a professor met in my

|
hotel to discuss ways and means of |
getting from the}
° : ‘ |
United States, which at that time had |

not declared war on

certain supplies

Austria and |

therefore was not working fully with |

Italy, and almost imnmediately the dis-
cussion shifted to consideration of |
Italian education for the masses. Both |

|
men realized that Austro-German |

propaganda had been able to do its;
work because Italy had no compre- |
hensive plan of public education in
the past. |

In other words, one thing which the |
war has emphasized has been the need
for education newly effectual, newly

democratic, newly, internationally

comprehensive.

The man in the United States who
has given to this matter the most |
earnest thought, L was informed by |
various people whom I consulted with
regard to the situation, is Nicholas |
Murray Butler,. president of Colum |
bia University, which probably may |
be regarded as the most democratic, |
as it is the largest, university in all)
the world; which in its student body |
embraces men and women of practical- |
ly all the world’s original nationalities
and which, it seems to the best think-
ers I can find, links the American mass |
with the American university as effec-
tively as is possible at present.

“It is certain that education must be
reconstructed to meet new national
and international conditions,” Dr,
Butler said to me when IL sought his |
views. “Perhaps this educational re-
construction is the most far reaching

of master of arts and doctor of

world ts faced, The solution of other
problems will have quitker and more
obvious results, but the. solution of
this one will make a more durable and
more jnfluential contribution to the
new world order than any other. |

“In an inarticulate way the world
eeems already to be realizing and con-
sidering this fact, for the relation of
national education to national ideals
and national efficiencies has been very
much in the minds of men since the
war began, sharpening them and driv-
ing them to unacenstomed reflections.

“German’ was able to show” the)
world extraordinary results from a
highly organized and wholly undemo- ,

jeratic system of education which had

been bent to the purpose of providing |
an abundant and subservient lower
class, an equally subservjent and an
efficient middle class and a dominant
and teehniclly trained upper class.

German Plan Became Plain.

“About 1890 it became plain that
German science and German. scholar-
ship had lost that disinterestedness |
which onee had been so marked. They |
had been brought to heel in the service

 

j}of the military and autocratic ideals

ef a policy of world domination. We
may well leave to the German people

|the contemplation of the results of

that folly with the full asgyrance that
the next generation will reconstruct
the entire German educational system
in order to find place in it for the
expression ot those popular needs and
democratic tendencies which class and
oligarchical systems in this generation
so carefully have excluded

“At many points the German educa-
tional system produced excellent re-
sults worthy of imitation in other
lands, but these were sporadic and
not general, and were quite over-
shadowed in importance by the wrong
spirit and false ideals at the founda-
tion of the whole educational under-
taking. It will be a long time before
the German universities, for example,
can hope to be as attractive to ad-
vanced and ambitious students from

;other lands as they were to young

Americans «and Englishmen

ernment started the general massacres
of 1894-6, during which over 100,000
innocent Armenians were murdered.

Again in 1908, when as a result of
the Reval conference between the late
Czar and the now deposed Kaiser the
disruption of Turkey seemed inevit-
able, the Turks once more appeared
with a constitution and glowing
promises of reform, but as soon as
the danger was warded off by the
usual subterfuge they started upon
the most fiendish plan ever conceived
by any Government, a plan which
called for the virtual extermination of
all the subject races of Turkey.

The first conspicuous result of this
plan was the massacre of 30,000
Armenians of Cilicia only nine months |
after the adoption of a constitutional |
Government by the Young Turks. The |

States to come in and help him to re-|
form his empire with the hope that by
this means he will be able to continue
his domination over the subject races.
It is hardly conceivable that the men |
sitting at the peace table will seriously |
consider his promises to behave. |

There are, however, well meaning |
persons, both in this country and on |
the other side of the Atlantic, who!
seem to have a weakness for being im- |
pressed by Turkish flattery and to be!
prone unwittingly to play into the
hands of the unscrupulous and shrewd |
Turkish politiclan. These men are ad- |

Intact and governing it through a|
commission of the league of nations
or of the United States alone for a}
limited length of time. |

It is difficult to know what they |
expect to have the commission achieve
during their period of administration, |
but It {s not so difficult to tell before |
hand what such a commission gov- |
ernment will not be able to accom-
plish, namely, the harmonization of the |
aims and aspirations of the rival races |
ot the Turkish Empire.

Turkey is anything but a melting

jpot. Fire has been raging there for

centuries, but the result has not been |
the amalgamation of the confilcting |
elemente; on the contrary, it has re- |
sulted in making the principal races |
inhabiting the country highly refrac-
tory and absolutely incompatible and
irreconcilable. How anybody could
expect good from forcing murderers
and the relatives of their victims to
live together ts beyond comprehension.

tions showed them to exist at the mo-
ment, and dealing with them in the
very best Way possible

“In England as in France the na-
tional educational system has strik-
ingly revealed the predominant na-
tional characteristics and excellences,
and whatever may be said in deroga-
tion of the English system of educa-
tion from the theoretical and adminis-

that in its own way it has produced
a larger proportion of first rate leaders
of men than has the educational sys-
tem of any other country.

“Its progress, of course, has been
very uneven. Many gaps have waited
long to be filled and many desirable po-
sitions have long needed to be taken;
but take the product of this system
by and large, and one cannot fail to
seo that it contains an exceptional
proportion of excellence and distinc-
tion.

“In considering the English situa-
tion as it stands to-day it must not

jtroubled the French greatly until
about 1882. It still vexes English edu-
cational reformers, but now seems to
be well on the way to a satisfactory
solution.

“The serene self-confidence of the
British nation never showed to better
advantage than when Parliament took
} time in the’ darkest days of the war,
when England’s very existence was
threatened, to recast the entire educa-
tional system of England and Wales
under the leadership of Sir Herbert
Fisher. The British nation had time
(aoe thought for this task even in the
‘midst of war, and no other great na-
| tlon ever has approached the grandeur
;of an achievernent of this sort in
circumstances even approximating
those in which Great Britain accom-
plished it.

“This is not the place in

itself produce admirable national re-

doubted.

and diverse economic needs and ami\)i-

“The schools, being highly organized
and wellnigh universal, have been
seized hold of by reformers and prop-

have been diverted from their funda
