impression on bert L. Moran, Presi-

L. Dowling, president of the Borough of
Manhattan, and Frank Wilsey, Presi-
den: of the Board of Education, were
induced fo attend meetings, and they
assured the people that they would favor
the proposition and get behind .he
movement in their respective organiza-
tions. Mayor Hylan has been tnvited
to attend another meeting which will
be held Tuesday night.

Borough President Dowling says Su-
perintendent Shallow has recommended
that the high school be put up some-
where in between 175th street and 183d
street and that estimates and plans aa |
‘the building will be placed before the
