. Two Years Saved by Planting Four-Year-Transplanted Roots

The Asparagus is one of the oldest as well as oné of the most
Gelicious of our garden vegetables. It was cultivated in the time of
Cato, two hundred years, B.C.; and Pliny mentions a sort that
gfew in his time mear Ravenna, of which the heads weigh a pound,
From these accousts it appears that there is nothing vew under the
sun, in the line of Asparagus, except the saving in time,

A great many more people would grow their own Asparagus if
it were not for the two years of waiting. We eliminate this for the
planter by cultivating and transplanting the roots till they are four
years old, strong and healthy, Downing, no doubt the highest
authority, says roots of this age will produce fruit the same season
planted.

When we talk about tender Asparagus on your table this com-
ing June, fresh from your own garden, we know that your mouth
not only waters, but that you look incredulous. Too good to be
true, you say? And yet it can be easily done if you plant some
extra large Asparagus roots, such as we have worked over and
transplanted for the last tliree years purposely ready to get imime-
diate results,

Asparagus may be had any time during the winter if these
strong, four-year-old roots are stored ina cold place until wanted,
They are then covered with a few inches of soil in a hot bed or
greenhouse and kept very wann. In two weeks the shoots will be
several inches long, and cuttings may be made for a month,
