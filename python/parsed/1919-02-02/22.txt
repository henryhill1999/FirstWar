HEN PHEASANT IN
JERSEY NEEDS ALD

Attempt Made to Open Season
on Female Bird Whose Pro-
tection Ends April 15.

 

 

SPORTSMEN ARE OPPOSED

 

The five years’ close season on female
ring neck pheasants in New Jersey ends
en April 15 and unless the Legislature
continues the protection both the hen
and the cock birds nvay be killed next
fall. It is understood in legislative
circles that an attempt will be made to
permit the shooting of both species at
the present session, but sportsmen and
conservationists are urging the Board
of Fish and Game Commissioners to in-
troduce a bill to continue the protection
to the hen pheasant.

Sportsmen point out that at the
present time twenty-eight States, raising
and stocking their covers with pheasants,
allow no shooting at all, and New York
and f[ilinols, States stocked with
pheasants and having an open season,
permit only the killing of the cock bird.

New Jersey permits the shooting of
the male bird from November 10 to De-

ember 16, Imiting the sportsman to
three birds a day.

In New York State hunting up-State is
culy permitted on the last two Thurs-
days in October and the first two Satur-
days in November, four days in all, the
sportsman being limited to kill only
three cock birds In a season.

On Long Island, where pheasants are

ora plentiful, the season lasta from
November 1 to December $1, and the
day limit is four birds and the season's
limit thirty male birds. It might be
remarked that New York has four State
canie farms, while New Jersey has
but one to supply birds throughout the
twenty-si:) counties of the State,

Oregon's Experiment Killing Hens

Oregon, the first State in the Union
to begin the propagation and Iiberation
of pheasants, had splendid shooting after
the birds became acclimated and the
law permitted the shooting of the male
rl. There was clamor, however, be-
cause of the great increase of the birds,

to allow the shooting of both the hen
and the cock. Oregon legislators ac-
ceded; within a few years the birds were
shot out and Oregon had to begin the
work all over again.

At the present time, the Introduced

pheasant may notbe killed anywhere in
the State with the exeception of ‘the
Chinese male pheasant in Union county
between October 1 and October 10.

What has happened in Oregon will
happen in New Jersey, conservationists,
outdoorsmen and sportsmen say, particu-
lariy with a State of the size of New
Jersey having 100,000 gunners who take
out licenses yearly.

If the females, the breeders, are killed.
there is no hope of increase, for no game
farm could hope to keep up with the an-
nual killings in the game fields. If the
fame farm at Forked River could raise
and liberate annually 25,000 birds, with
100,000 gunners in the fleld, killing off
the breeders, the covers would be de-
pleted quickly.

The State of New Jersey does not
raise 25,000 birds a year. Game Yirds
cannot be raised just as poultry, for
when kept tn close confinement diseases

appear and cut down the broods. Ae a| home, but at Cedar Point one of the}

matter of fact, while Duncan Dunn and
his assistants may hatch 10,000 eggs a
year, not all the young birds lives to
maturity.

Diseases among game birds are s0
common that fields where they are raised
cannot alwaye be used year after year
consecutively because experience has
taught the flelds must be rested. To ac-
quire more space to raise pheasants was
the reason why the Board of Fish and
Game Commissioners purchased addl-
tional farm lands at Forked River last
year. ~

What game farms depénd upon in
raising pheasants is to keep in the cov-
ers of the State sufficient breeders that
there will be a natural increase. To
keep up this natural increase {s the
work the Game Commission trieg to do.
For instance, a farmer, whg incidentally
's a eportsman, too, has found recently
on his New Jersey farm, fifteen hen
pheasants.
for cock birds. Three were sent. In
the natural course of events that means
® number of broods of wild birds.

When Duncan Dunn, superintendent

f the State game farm, was in charge

‘ the Rutherford Stuyvesant game farm
et Allamuchy, {in Warren county, only

ck birds were permitted to be killed
and they spread eo rapidly that half a
dozen farms were leased to give them

over, for usually from 60 to 75 per
ut of every brood are cock birds.
Then the experiment was tried of kill-
‘rg both the hen and the cock bird. The
frst yeae the gunning was good, the
second year the birds had been swept
away, the leases of the farms cancelled
end the work of the game farm had to
be done all over again.

New Jersey some years ago tried the
experiment of killing off both sexes of
deer. Under the buck law, limiting the
Sportsmen to kill only the male animegl,
the State had been restocked'with deer,
Deer was so plentiful that a demand was
made, just as is being made now, to
kill the mothers, the breeders of the
race. The New Jersey Leislature
agreed and hunting was permitted.

The breeding stock of wild deer was
so impaired that at the next session of
the Legislature New Jersey repealed the
law and once more became a buck law
6tate. It has been so ever since.

The New Jersey Game Farm at
Forked River hag been in operation for
Gye years, propagating game birds and
animals and sportsmen, conservation-
ists and experts tn game raising beliéve
that the whole work of propagating and
Mberating pheasants wil) go to nought if
the Legislature fails to protect the fe-
male pheasant, the breeder of the race.

servation League, made up of sports-
men throughout the twenty-one counties

cludes practically every club Interested

LAW STOPS COMPLAINTS.
Permit Needed to Kill Deer That

Damage Crops.

TRENTON, N. J., Feb. 1.—The Board
of Fish and Game Commissioners used
to be in receipt of many complaints
about the damage done to crops by deer
and asking pay.

For some years New Jersey has had a
statute which eaysethat when an owner
of land complains that deer are destroy-
ing his crops he must file a complaint,
which the Fish and Game Commissioners
will investigate,

If tt {s shown that deer have damaged
cfops a permit may be issued to ki!!
such deer, {indicating the time and man-
ner that such killing may be done. The
carcass of a deer killed in such manner
then becomes the property of the Board
of Fish and Game Commissioners. Prac-
tieally no one hag taken advantage of
the law.

“The second is the individual some-

lation to Take Protection From

) BUCK LAW PREVENTS

HUNTING ACCIDENTS

 

Greatest Safeguard of Human

Life That Can Be Provided
as Gunners Increase.

SAVES DEER HERD DRAIN

 

By GEORGE D, PRATT,
State Conservation Commissioner.
In connection with the game census,
the commission has collected statistics
of hunting accidents and the working of

the buck law that are of the utmost s!g-
nificance. They are drawn from many
sources and show with unfailirg uni-

formity the resulta of this law as it has |

been applied in State after State.

Besides protecting the breeding deer,
the buck law, when it is properly ob-
served, !s one of the greatest safeguards
of human life that can possibly be pro-
vided for the rapidly increasing number
of hunters who throng the woods during
the open season, |

For six years prior to the passage of
the buck law in New York State.

was fourteen. In the four years that
immediately followed the passage of the
law there were seven.

Figures compiled by the United States
Biological Survey for a period of ten
years slow that In ftve States where
does were allowed to be ehot the num-
ber of persons killed in mistake for deer
Was 128. For the same ten years the
number killed in mistake for deer in five
States that had a buck law was only
twenty-seven.

For the four years between 1911 and
1914 in Wisconsin, when deer of elther
sex could be lawfully shot, the number
of hunters killed in mistake for deer
ranged from twelve to twenty-four an-
nually, while the number {njured ran
from fovrteen to thirty-one. In that
State for those four years the practice of
shooting at anything that moved with
out locking for horns was responsibie
for a total of eighty-one deaths and
ninety-six injuries. In the first year of
the buck law, the only one for which
figures are available, none was killed
and none was injured in mistake for @
deer. . ‘

When Buck Law Not Observed.

It is perfectly clear, however, that the
buck law cannot protect human life

unless it is observed. Witness four cases |

in New York State during the last open
season, two fatal and two nearly so

1. A ma: and hie guide were hunting
in the vicinity of Star Lake in the Adi-
rondacks. The guide was in a stooping
position, when the hunter, belleving that
he saw a deer, shot the guide through
the stomach and spine The guide died
soon after. “The hunter mistook his
guide for a deer,” said the game protec-
tor who reported the case. He would
not have done so had he been sure that
he saw horns.

2. A Mineville hunter, seeing fome-
thing moving through the bushes, think-
ing that it was a deer and not waiting
to make sure—not even waiting to make
sure that {t was a deer, and regardless
of whether it was buck or doe—fired his
rife at it and wounded a fellow hunter
of his own village.

3. An automobile was running along a
highway at night in the Catskills during
the open season for deer, when {ts oc-

| cupants saw something moving in a fle!d

near by. They shot and severely wounded
a man who was walking tn the feld
They then slowed down, but on seeing
their mistake, put on full speed and dis-
appeared. Night hunting from automo-
biles {s a frequent occurrence, with no
{Intention whatever on the part of the
violators to look before they shoot. The
game protectors are constantly patrolling
at night to stop It.

4. Two young mer, one of whom was!
wearing light colored gloves, were hunt- |

{ng in the vicinity of West Chazy. It

was becoming dusk when one of them!

saw something white moving in front
of him.

screams of h{s companion told him of the
fatal mistaké.
removed to a hospital, but later died.
“It only shows the Benefit of the buck

law, if all hunters would strictly comply |

with {t,"’ commented the game protector
in his official report.

Buck Law Must Be Enforcea.

Years of careful statistical study prove
conclusively that the buck law safe-
guards human life. That Iffe is safer
in the woods under the buck law is
proved with unanswerable evidence when

 

the |
number of men killed in mistake for deer |

Believing it to be the tall of a)

The wounded hunter was}

 

 

 

 

of conscience of the most tragic
sort.

Each year the woode hold more hunt-
ers than ever before, and the time is
not far distant when the number of men
who hunt deer each season may even
exceed the deer. The figures of the
game census indicate this posaslbility.
Under more etrict observance of the
buck law, however, the deer will increase,
since the number of does killed even
under that law has been not inconsider-
able. The commission is convinced that
the law mst be maintained and vigor-
ously enforced, because:

Firet—The life of a singlf sportsman
or guide is worth more than all the
deer fn the woods.

Second—The deer herd will be unablo
to survive the drain if the breeding
females are killed.

[PRATT URGES CUT
IN DEER SEASON

Would Eliminate First Two
Weeks in October and Limit
Gunner to One Buck.

MORE RECOMMENDATIONS

 

An@any, Feb, 1.—In order to minimize
the accidental shooting of does and to
increase the safety of hunters, George
D. Pratt, Conservation Commissioner,
has recommended to the Legislature the

{shortening of the deer season by elimi-
nating the first two weeks in October,
when leaves are still on the tree@. Mr.
Pratt would also reduce the bag Imit
from two to one buck a season.

The Conservation Commissioner recom-
mends also increasing the hunting li-
cense fee in order that town and county
clerke may bo. better compensated for
their work in fesuing these licenses.

The recommendation that guides be
registered, as in Maine, is new to New
York, but the commissioner belleves it
will be of benefit to all vacationiste.

Except in boundary waters, Mr. Pratt
aqugmests that the Legislature extend the
closed season on black bass until July
1, in order that the closed season more
nearly cover the spawning time of the
fish.

Other recommendations include estab-
lishing fleld stations for the taking of
fish eggs and the hatching, rearing at
Aistribution of certain species; a marine
hatchery for the propagation of sea food
fishes that will respond to artificial prop-
agation; extending the jurisdiction of
the Conservation Commission to the
State's tidal waters; making the planting
of fish in private waters subject to the
commission's regulation; eiving power
to the commission to ee] fish at cost for
etocking private wafers and to furnish
without charge sufficient fish for the
initial stocking of farm fish ponds;
amending the private posting law so that
owners of fishing rights shall not be en-
titled to exemplary damages unless they
annually stock the portions of the
streams posted by them, and making it
iNewal to possess the plumage of pro-
tected birda.

Bills to carry out these recommenda-
tions have already been presented to the
Legislature or is being prepared for
early introduction.

Hen Pheasant'No Trumpers Offer

a

Dangers

By R, F. FOSTER.

One of the weaknesses which the be-
Ginner probably finds it most difficult to
overcome is the tendency to turn every |
hand into a no trumper, even when it?
na perfectly sound and much safer suit

e

 

It is an old remark that “anything
may happen to a no trumper,” and
strange things do happen sometimes,
even when the bid is a perfectly legiti-
mate one. There are many cases on ret.
ord of little slams being made against
the bid, but not always in spite of the
best defence,

There is no cage on record of a legiti-
mate sult bid having lost a little slam,
Dut there are cases of no trumpers that
should have been suit bids losing it. In
“Foster on Auction,” page 156, a hand
is given in which the dealer held three
top honors in spades, four honors in dia-
monde, two honors in clubs and king of
hearta guarded and lost a little slam.

What would be thought of a hand in
which an ace, two kings and two queens,
every suit stopped, lost a little slam?
Here is the distribution:

910748

an
ba
aw

Z dealt on the rubber game and bid
no trump. All passed. A opened with
& small club, which B won with the
king. Instead of returning the club he
took advantage of the opportunity to
lead up to dummy‘s weak spade sult.

Although Z held off as,long as he
could, A still had a spade to lead after
the king fell, so that B made two more
tricks in spades, upon which Z dis-
earded diamonds, expecting his hearts
to be led through.

When B was done with the spades
he led a small diamond and the finesse
of the queen lost to the king, A coming
right: back with a diamond, probably
placing the deuce of clubs with Z, while)
Z is placing that card with A.

At this point Z counts A for four!
clubs, and in order to avoid that suit,
thinking B has no club to lead, Z tries
the small heart. <A put on the queen
and returned the suit, B winning. After
making his jack of diamonds, A dis
earding the heart, B turned up with the}
long lost deuce of clubs, scoring a Hittle!
Slam againet the no trumper. |

While this looks Iike a serious lass it}
Is really a gain for Z, because A and B
could have made a little slam in spades
and won the rubber into the bargain.
Z lost 300 in penalties, 60 for the slam |
and 80 aces, total 880. At spades, B
would have scored 54, 36, 50 and 260,
a total of 390.

The spade contract might have been
arrive? at in two ways If A uses the!
conventional double B will bid two!
spades. If A passes B will have a good)
chance to ask for a lead by bidding two)
spades. Five by cards is easy, but It}
would take good play in the discards |
to make the slam.

Z's play, to avoid leading away from
his three card sults, headed by single |
honors, would be the ace of diamonds, |
Then a small diamond establishes the
queen. B would put himself in with the
king of clubs to lead the trumps, catch-
ing the king on the third round.

To get back Into his own hand for
the club finesse B must give up the ace
of hearts, and on the clubs he must
de careful to discard hearts ard to keep
the sult that dummy can ruff, the jack
of diamonds. By ruffing the hearts and
the diamond alternately Bb secures the
little elam.

If Z opens the hand with a small
diamond B wins, and it is still a Mttle
siam, Z making the king of hearts In-

6tead of the ace of diamonds.

CHECKER FNDINGS.

Problem No. 617, by H. ID. Lyman,
was a most instructive eud game posi-
tion, showing the possibilities of a draw
that would almost certainly be over-
looked in actual play. The distribue
tion ts:

Black men on 6 and 9; king on 14,
White man on 26; kings on 2 and 7.
Black to play and draw. Here are the
moves that solve, the starred plays being !
vital:

Black. White. Black. White.
14—18 Bi7—11 18—16* 11—18
A 6—10° 2—6 10—14

At “A” 9—14 loses as !t allows 2—9,
18—16, 11—18.

At "B" if white plays 7—3 we get:
18—15 CC 26—23 9—18 3—-7

6—10 2— 6 10—14

At “C” 26-—22 is no better, as black
still plays 6—10, and answers 2—6 with
10—14 and 14—17, or answers 3—7 with
10—14, 2--6 and 14—18.

THAT DIVISIBLE NUMBER,

It has been shown that the numbers
45, 48 and 50 can be respectively di-
vided into four parts, so that by em-
ploying the units 2, 3 and 4 to add, sub-
tract, multiply and divide the answer
is the same in each of the thrée cases,

8-4 2—10 64309 44-48

12——-2—10 12—3—9 12—4=8

5x 3—10 3x Bed 2x48

2042—10 T+8=09 B2-+ 408

45 48 f0

The problem was to find a single
number instead of the three numbers,

45, 48 and 50, which could be divided
into four parts in three different ways,
80 that by using the units 2, 3 and 4
the anewer would be the same in each
of the three cases

The solution can be arrived at. by
algebra, which will demonstrate that if
2 is the unit the final number must be
divisible by 9; rf 8, by 16, and if 4,

a

 

to Unwary

by 25; therefore the number sought
must be divisible by all three of these,
9, 16 and 25. The answer is 3,600.
Here is the demonstration:

79842800 672436675 §724.1=57
802—-2=800 G678——3=—675 580—4—

3600 3600 3600

Those who have studied this prob-
lem may be interested to know that the
same number, 3,600, may be divided
into four parts which will answer to the
three units, 1, 5 and 9. What are the
respective parts in each case?

Bridge problem No. 617, one of Jay
Reed's Little Sixes, had an tnstructive
little trap (an unnecessary discard),
tucked away in the first trick. Here ts

Clubs are trumps and Z leads. Y and
Z want all six tricks.

5

The solution ia for Z to lead his big-

spade, upon which Y discards a small
diamond. Those who insist that he must
discard the ten show that they failed to
analyse the situation as carefully as they
should, Y canediscard either of his
smaller diamonds and solve.

Z leads 4 small diamond and Y wins with
the King, leading the trump. All who in-
sist that B and Z must discard hearts
fail to see that Z can discard a diamond
and that when he wins the next trick
with the ace of diamonds the discards of
B and the discard now forced from A

| will solve the problem, as Z must make a

trick with the small spade or Y must
make two hearts.

Out of twenty-eight solvers who sent
in the play, “Cee Tee" is the only one
who saw thie, which leaves him the win-
ner of the prize offered by Tue Sun for
the greatest number of points to date, 61.
Jay Reed is to be congratulated on his
“little sixes," which looked innocent
enough, but had a gas attack back of
them. As polnts are deducted for miss-
ing important variatione, those who

missed Z's diamond discard and Y's dis-
a

ecard of the small diamond fell down
point on this.

H. B. says: A opens and B stays. In
the final betting B says he will cal) A,
but puts in a chip short of the amount,
A calling attention to the error. 13 then
says that as he is shy a chip he will
withdraw the bet. Is this allowed?

B must either make good the amount
he ie short of lose what he has put tnto
the pool.

 

J. O. A. gays: Playing deuces wild, A
shows three deuces and two aces. B
holds the fourth deuce and the queen,
Jack, ten, nine of hearts, which he an-
nounces as a straight flush, king high
Which wins, and why?

Five aces beats a etraight flush, be-
cause {it {s harder to get. All poker

hands are rated according to the odds
against getting or drawing them.

G. T. M. saya: Six men are tn the pot,
when the opener, L, chips in. C raises
him, and before D has time to say what
he will do, E calls ('e raise. Then D
also seer C's raise and raises again, the
limit. E says, “I called (*, but T will not
call D,” and takes down his bet. Can
he do this?

No; because {t {s the rule that chipe
once put Into the pool must stay there

B must pay for his haste by losing what
he has put up, unless he wil! also call D.

 

M. V. 'N. says: A intended to make
clubs trumps, but changed his mind
ane made it hearts) He led a diamond
and then a spade, putting the King of
clubsa.on the diamond led by B, and tak-
ing in the trick, as if clubs were trumps.
No one objected, and A led a card. Then
B eays, “You revoked. You did not
trump the last trick.” B also contends
that A loses the game, and that they
take the diamond trick on which the
club ‘was played.

There is no losing the game. Al! that
A loses is his score for cards. If his
melds cover his bid he cannot be set, It

does not matter, therefore, who gets the
diamond trick Ilie forgetting the
trump does not excuse the revoke

 

R. A. W. says: Four persons agree
to play for $2 a rubber tnstead of for
so much a point. The final score ie A
