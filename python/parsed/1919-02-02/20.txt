HIM

 

 

Jake Schaefer and Welker Cochran,
who are engaged in a hotly contested
series of 18.2 matches with the object of
rettling the question of supremacy be-
tween them, do not belleve that Hoppe
has any intention of entering a tourna-
ment with them. These noted young
players had just finished a block of their
match at National Recreation, Brooklyn,
when they were asked If they would take
part in a championship tournament if
{t could be arranged.

“T would Le willing to play Hoppe
elther {n a match or tournament,” re-
plied Schaefer, “but I do not believe
Hoppe will do either. So far as I am}
concerned I have been ready for some,
time past to meet Hoppe, but he eide-
stepped, and I do not see why I should
dance attendance on him any longer.
He has kept Cochran and me waiting for
a long time, now let him wait.”

Cochran subscribed to the opinion ex-
cressed by Schaefer, and added:

‘It has been aszerted in behalf of
Hoppe that I could not get the side bet |
of $2,500 demanded by Hoppe as the
chief condition for a match. That is
so Friends of mine in Detroit
posted the money for me and notified
Hoppe to that effect, but he never let
on that ha know of it. He and his man-
ager continued to tell of the necessity
of a large side bet for a match, but the
money of my backers lay in responsible
hands till it got rusty and still not a
whisper from Hoppe.

rot

Not Afraid of Hoppe.

“Gore people think Schaefer and I are
afraid of Hoppe. I don’t know any rea-
son we should fear him. We aver-
age as well If not better than he and
we make as large if not larger runs than
be does. Perhaps we don't look quite s0
mportant when we play.

"T take notice that while Hoppe con-
tinues to bill himself as the 18.2 cham-
cion he refuses to defend the title that |
he claims. He would be in better taste
f he refrained from calling himself the
champion. Schaefer and I are now
hooked for a long tour and we do not
feel that we shouid be asked to calncel
ton Hoppe's account. The public gets

run for its money when patronizing
eur games, for they see a real contest
Hoppe seems to rely on his past reputa-
tion to draw and plays purely exhibition
games, while a figurehead sits In a chair:
and watches him.”

Demand for Title Tourney.

Despite the fact of all the leading
Willard players now being ‘‘on tour” and
the announcement by the Brunswick-
Balke-Collender Company that it would
not be possible to arrange a champion- !
ehip tournament till next autumn there |
‘g a demand on the part of the natrons
ef the aame for a tournament nest
spring. The argument is advanced tat
the players who have been so gener-
eusiy treated by the public should re
spond by engaging in a tournament ard

 

 

 

veestablishing the chainplonshn that
apsed when Hoppe became the owner of
the 18.2 emblem.

The plea that the experts are plane
21] over the country and thue giving the
rnbliic a chance to witness their skill ‘s}
-ot accepted. The retort is made that
surely exhibition work does not satisfy
thoee who are willing to pay to see the
blest performers in genuine tests of
kill. Hoppe for several years hrs toured
the country playing “matches” with men |

e can easily defeat. If his opponent oc- |
-asionally won a game {t was due ‘to
ocident. =

 

Plan an Organisation.

Prominent room keepers are discussing
a plan for the organization of at asso-
elation to supplant the Brunswick com-
nany in the government of championship
onteste. If such an association is
‘ormed one rule would be to the effe |
hat the winner of a championship :nust
iefend his title for a period of to

ears for a side bet of $250, and if ‘he!
emblem still is in his possession at tho!
end of two years it {s mandatory on
the donors to arrange a tournament and
eeatablish the championship without de-
ay,

Thus it would be impossible ‘or the
Solder of a trophy emblematic of « cham-
nionship that had lapsed to travel about
‘he country and pose as champion for
he benefit of the box office.

Weak on Line Nurse,

Those who study the remarkable avyer- |
ages of Schaefer and Cochran and then
their play are puzzled to account
e figures. It fa true that in posi- |
., Masse and draw execution,

yn shots and nearly ail the techni- |
ties of the game Lhe youngsters have |

2? superiors and few equals. But in
one respect these players do fot meas-

BIG YEAR IS Speen

 

 

A revival of the International features
of the National Horse Show in Madison |
Square Garden next fall was foreshad- |
owed at the second annual meeting of
the Association of American Horse
Shows at the Biltmore last Tuesday :
afternoon. While the plans for the show, |

which {ts to run from November 10
through 14, still are nebulous, it is re-
ported that the officials intend to de-
spatch invitations to England, France
and Relgium to send their leading cav-
alry riders, just as they did in 1912,
when Lord Decies and other foreign
riders made the show a big social as
well as equine event.

It is quite likely that Reginald C. |
Vanderbilt will offer a new interna- |
tional trophy. Some time ago it was,
stated that Mr Vanderbilt had an-
nounced that he would never again
offer a cup for a horse show. This was!
deniead by Mr. Vanderbilt last Tuesday. |
He declared that just as soon as the!
time was ripe be would offer another
trophy |

Mr. Vanderbilt once more is head of
the American association. and that in
{teelf promises plenty of activity in the!
horse show world this year. Laet year)
and in 1917 many of our leading shows |
were cancelled because of the war. The}

BASKETBALL BACK
ON PRE-WAR BASIS

Return of Court Game Amazes
W. A. Barbour, Coach of
Yale’s Squad.

OUTLOOK ROSY

New Haven, Conn., Feb. 1.—College
basketball's rapid recovery from war con-
ditions in spite of financial difficulties is
remarkable, according to Coach W. A.
Barbour, Yale's delegate to the Intercol-
legiate Basketball Association. Though
the association's basketball schedule had
to be somewhat curtatled because of the
lack of funds, the game practically !s
back on the same footing it enjoyed be-
fore the war.

“It has been hard, very hard, for all
the colleges to get their athletic, as well
as their academic work, running on a
prewar basis," Mr. Barbour says. “The
progress made {n most the colleges un-
der my obeervation has been nothing
, less than astounding.

“The great difficulty {n al] the unf-
\versities is tinanctal. The income from
‘sports during the war was so curtatled
, that all the surplusee have been con-
sumed; and now we are all starting in
again at a time when the great money
makers, football) and baseball, are not
being played
. “The result fs that the echedule of the

1918 REVIEW

 

| Fonr Men Good for 9 4-5 in
| 100 Yard Dash—Some

Crack Distance Men.

 

War influence adversely affected athe
letics in Bweden, although that country
remained amoug the comparatively small
class of neutrala High costs of com-
modities staggered all of the Scandina-
vian countries, and so for a number of

Swedish athletes {t had to be business
before pleasure and many had to give
up athletics for the time being.

Yet the tabulated results of last sea-
son'a athletics in the land of King Gus»
tav V,. as published in Idrottabladeft, the
great Swedish sporting publication, are
Most interesting. They are especially
{mportant to followers of American ath-
letics just now in view of the promised
coming of a group of Swedish athletes
for international! athietic competition itn
the United States.

Glancing at the accompanying records
one finds some of the 1918 performances
were not up to the 1917 standard. Span-
ish influgenga and hard times are ac-
counted responsible.

Review!ng the results for purposes of
comparison 4..d taking first the sprint-
ers it is shown that progress was made
at 100 metres (110 yards) and the op-
posite of progress at 200 metres. Dur-
ing 1917 but two men got under 11 aec-
onds for the shorter distance; four beat
that time last year. The time is good
for 94-5 seconds in the 100 yard dash,
In the 200 metres, on the other hand,
seven Swedes reported Mside of 23 sec-
onds in 1917, against only four in 1918.
For the firat time In Swedish athletic
annals-~and those reach far, far back—
two runners got under 60 seconds for
400 metres in last season. But the 1917
average for the best elght waa 50 2-5
seconds, compared to 504-£ tn 1918.

Bolin got in the champion clase witn
a@ mark of 1 minute 542-5 seconds for
£00 meters. Of the others five got under
two minutes for that distance iast year
86 against only three {in 1917. Reduced
numbers considered, such showings are
most encouraging to Swedish athletic en-
thusiasts.

Zander “Too Good."

Since Zander broke the worlds reo-

ord for 1,500 meters in 1917 things have
Deen at a etandatill for that distance fn
Sweden. Oniy Lundgren approached the
|eeeers of the champion, negotiating the
distance under four minutes.) Seven men
beat 4:04:12 for the distance in 1917,
while under that time only four were
marked in 1918.

Five distance men did better than 16
minutes 80 seconds over 6,000 meters in
1918, two more than were timed under
that in the year preceding. it ts eig-
nificant that all five last year did better
than 15 minutes 20 seconds, thereby get-
tIMge into the International class. This
l{2 one of the showings in which Sweden
takes greatest pride among last years
recoras.

Backnian made a new Swedish re cord
}at 10,000 meters, his time being the seo~-
fond best in the worlj’s reco that
| distance. In 1917 only three Sw
lover the ground in fewer than 33
utes, but ilaet year seven did as wel
