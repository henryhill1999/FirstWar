CITY MAGISTRATES

Mounting Toll of Killed and
Injured Brings Demand
for Protection.

HELP

 

After several years of discussion, dur-
tne which the number of persons killed
or crippled by automobiles has mounted
steadily and amendments to the lenient
laws of the State have proved shuck-
ingly inadequate, an earnest effort is
to be made to have this year's Legis-
lature pass a measure with “teeth in it.’

At a meeting in the Traffic court, at-
tended by Secretary of State Hugo,
Magistrates and representatives of the
police and motor and civic associations,
a committees was appointed, with Magis-
trate Cobb as chairman, to draw up
a bili.

The Chief Magistrate thus pictured
the situation:

“The casualties occurring in the city’s
ftreets are like what we get from the
lattleflelds in France. When I stand at
the corner of Bleecker and Lafayette
streets, where the traffic is enormous,
the people somehow give you the im-
pression of chased animals who have be-
come quite expert in dodging vehicles.
They have acyuired a sort of vehicular
elusivenesa.

Careless Drivers Not Cared.

‘The selfish, heartless, reckless or
careless driver, who was at first dined,
later jailed, has not been cured, though
I am frank to say that with a leas
zealous Magistrate than Judge House,
who presides over the Traffic court, the
casualties in the city would have been
100 per cent. greater. With 6,000,000
people in the city we have got to do
something.”

He said that under the licensing sys-
tem used in London and the strict
powers of the police, from 5,008 to 6,000
crivers are continually on the suspended
list and a traffic court is unnecessary.
He sajd Magistrates here should have
the power of revoking or su®sending
licenses, as an immediate decision. when
the evidence was before the Judge and
the memory of witnesses clear as to
what had occurred, was better than hav-
ing an additional hearing before the Sec-
retary of State.

“It is similar," Magistrate McAdoo
a higher court with many of the facts
forgotten in the laybrinth of the Grand
Jury and trial held some time there-
efter.”

All the speakers said there should be a
law Compelling all drivers of motor ve-
hicles to be tested severely as to their
criving ability and mental and physical
-ondition. It was predicted, however,
that up-State legislators would not tol-
‘Tate such a law and that if one were
passed it would not extend beyond the
city line.

Secretary Hugo, contending that the
power which creates should also be the
huwer to destroy, said he would be will-
ing to have the law amended permitting
hint to revoke or suspend licenses on the
recemmendation of a Magistrate.

He said the present law was inade-
quate, and even it was hard to enforce,
as although New York had ore-ninth of
a)l the automobiles in the United States
he had only six inspectors. He denied
that there were many criminals among
chauffeurs and said it was not right to
cast aspersions upon their profession.
Rut he coneeded that safety lav ina free
application of the revocation and sus-
pension of licenses and added, “1 would
like to make it possible that no person
shall be killed.”

Magistrate McAdoo remarked that no
legislation could be passed without Mr
Ilugo’s approval and that cooperation
might bring results.

Police Ready to Help.

Deputy Police Commissioner Harriss
taild the Police Department would be
flad to create a division of men to jn-

\estigate the characters of candidates
for licensts, He thought five mén would
be enough.

Several spokesmen for the New York
State Automobile Association approved
the revocation of licenses by City Mag-
strates, but said the 1,100 Justices of
the Peace in the country districts shouid
not have such sweeping authority.

Albert W. Seeman, secretary of-the
association, said he had been unable to
ascertain why upstate legislators op-
posed a strict motor law, except they
thought members of their families ought
not to be inconvenienced by examination
as to fitness.

At this point Magistrate McAdoo said
that perhaps the most powerful opposi-

tion to the proposed law comes fromm cer- |

tain manufacturers and dealers who feel
that it would be “unfriendly legislation
fn restriction of their trade.”

Total Deaths Here in 1918|

Reached 748.

Forty-nine persons were killed in au-
tomobile accidents in New York city
streets during the month of January,
elght were killed by surface cars and one
was killed by a wagon, according to a
report made by the National Highways
Protective Society yesterday. In the
state outside New York city nineteen
were killed hy automobiles and three by
trolleys, The total, 58, is the highest
fatality figure yet recorded for January.

In New Jersey seventeen were killed
by automobiles, four by trolleys and two
by wagons. Six persons were killed at
Frade crossings in New York and four
in New Jersey.

Figures compiled for the year 1918
show an increase of fatalities from auto-
ile accidents of 30 per cent. over
917, Col. Cornell said, with 1,189 killed,
Against 837 In 1917.

The Milwaukee men testified that the

Pulously to that covenant. ~

Mrs. Iebaudy was recently named to

that Lebaudy recovered a_ verdict of

pany in connection with his suit, which

ing out of the sale in France of lands
in which he had a controlling interest.
Only 40 per cent. of the verdict was

the section, In Paterson and at Cohoes,
however, the workers are insisting that
they be pald on a fifty hour basis. In
Lawrence the operatives demand fifty-
four hours’ pay for forty-eight hours
work, The Everett mills have decided
to operate on a basia of forty hours’

Several New England Plants
and Those in Cohoes and
Utica Capitulate.

 

Although the progpect of an early
settlement of the demands of 25,000 tex-
tile workers in Paterson was farther
away than ever yesterday, the union
achieved a series of victories in New
Prgiand and in Central New York by
gaining concessions to the forty-eight
hour week. In other plants along the
Atlantic seaboard where more than
750,000 workers are employed a strike
is expected at the close of work to-
morrow night.

Certain plants in Lawrence, Lowell,
Fasthampton and Boston, Mass., and

150,000 workers, Of these 104,090 are
said to have won the forty-eight hour
week,

John Golden, president of the United
Textile Workers of America® said that
he has wired all members of the union
to stand firmly for the forty-eight hour
week. He said there was good reason
to believe that other manufacturers
will meet the demand and accord the
union's ‘silent victory.”

Will Quit After Eight Hours.

“This does not mean that the workers
will not report on Monday,” he said
“Our instructions are for them to return
to work, but to refuse to work more
than eight hours, It will then be up to
the manufacturers. If there is any at-
tempt to take retaliatory measures a
etrike certainly will be called. The vie
tory won by the Lawrence operatives }:
a good sign.”

Manufacturers operating seventy-five
millg in Paterson refused flatly yester-
day to accede to the workers’ demands,
which are for a forty-seven hour week
Louis Magnet, chatrman of the union
committee, at once announced a strike of
16.000 operatives effective to-morrow

“With regret and deep disappoint

do>- to meet the unknown perplexities
vhich confront us we cannot fail to look

UNIONS WIN ELSEWHERE BARNES DENOUNCES

‘DRY’ LEGISLATORS

Says Republic Is in Danger of
Being “Prussian-
ized.”

—,.

 

William Barnes, New York State Re-
Publican leader, last night told the Al-
bany Society of New York what he
thought of the “cowardly legislators’
who helped Saharalze the United States.

The society's annual dinner #aa in the
Motel Plaza and. Mr. Barnes was the
chief speaker. He said:

“Our republic is in danger of being
Prussianized into State socialism by the
acts of our legislators and the acts
of Congress. The members of those
bodies respond not to the thought of
Lincoln, in behalf of government for
the people, but government in response
to the demand of the most punitive
group of the people.

“We have recently seen our Constitu-}

tion, which should ever be a bond of
union and a universally accepted instru-
ment, debased by a tumultuous mob of
legislators under the whip and lash of
the Anti-Saloon League. Cowardice
or Intolerance led these men to violate
the liberty of their fellow citizens, not
only for the present but for so long
a time as a fraction more than a
quarter of the States of the Union may
decree.

“It is not the prohibition amendment,
evil as it is, because through its enact-
ment legislation has invaded the realm
of constitutional law, but the spirit of
those who advocated it and the spirit of
those legislators who succumbed, that
shocks the true American. The first
were actuated by that same passion
which brought into life and efficiency the
Tnquisition.

“They disclosed nothing more nor leas
than the will to power; nothing more
nor less than the Thing that we had sup-
posed we had killed on the battlefields of
France; nothing more nor less than the
use of the instrument of freedom to Im-
pose their will upon cthers who sup-
posed they were equally free, and, under

| the flag of America have been up to thie

time; nothing more nor less than the
passionate demand which tyrants always
have, to make others believe as they
believe and do as they wish them to do.

“And what of the spirit of those who
succuinbed’? It was due to lack of ap-
greciation of their individual responet-
bility. to a perversion of the idea of rap-
resentation into the thought that repre-
sentation involves individual annihila-
tien.

“We do not want legislators in Con-
gress who shall become mere puppeta of
anu executive wil! or a supposed popular
will” And then Mr. Barnes pointed
with pride to the vote cast by the rep-
tesentatives from Albany who weren't
bulldozed into voting dry.
