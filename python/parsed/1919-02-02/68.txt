Dear Dad
The purpose of this letter is en-
tirely different from that of preced-

ne ones, and I want you to pay strict
ittention, for T am going to make an
astonishing statement.
The Owen Magnetic transmission
vould have saved a great many lives
¢ it had been installed in the tanks.

The American tanks are much bet-

that all future

electrically driven -

The significance of this lies in the well-known fact that, because of the
great resistance of water against a propeller, no high-speed (or automobile)
engine has ever been serviceably successful in driving even a small speed
boat. No greater demonstration is therefore possible of the efficiency and
economy of the electrical drive. The new series Owen Magnetic with a
higher powered Engine coupled with the Magnetic Transmission prevents

The New York dealers’ automobile
show this year will go down as the
most important and popular one in the
annals of the industry's history. The
distributers along the Row have at last
realized that aithough the New York
public has always attended the annual
event in goodly numbers, there has been
something lacking—a something no one
until recently hag been able to clenrly
define or understand, namely, the in-
ability of the New Yorker to claim the

show as his own or accord to the en-
oF of local brains,

his, although a purely psychological
aspect, has been one of the determining
factors in the dealers’ decision to hoid
ij the show themselves. Many of the
dealers have now reached the point,
financially and commercially, where they

time the one at Fifty-seventh street and
Broadway was selected.

The year 1916 saw this company
thoroushly established In the eyes and
hearts of New Yorkere. Many storms
along the rough path of progress had
been weathered and the business again
demanded an increase in faci ities. Five
floors were leased in the new building at
109 West Sixty-fourth street for the gen-
eral offices and geervice station, while
the building at 1847 Broadway was
taken over for the showroom.

Dodge Brothers in the summer of 1917
passed another milestone in their history,
In less than three years they had placed
approximately two hundred thousand
motor cars in the hands of owners. The
most impressive part of this record
breaking sales growth was the remark-
able spirit of friendiiness that existed

Ask your garage man

—what he recommends to keep your radi-
ator from freezing.

Then ask him if it is a chemical compound

—if he doesn’t know, find out before you buy,
because the U. S. Bureau of Standards
warns: “Calcium chloride compounds
should be used with caution if at all, on
account of their corrosive action.”

And most chemical non-freezing compounds
are based on calcium chloride.
