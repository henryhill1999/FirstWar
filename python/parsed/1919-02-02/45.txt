WASHINGTON SOCIETY FOLK DANCE GAYLY
AND WORTHY CHARITY PROFITS THEREBY

 

Cabinet Women, Except Mrs. Baker, Do Not Grace }

the Floor as

a Rule, but Always Appear in

Receiving~Lines—Gossip of the Week.

 

Wasutnoron, February 1.

INING and dancing are evi-

ID dently to be society's favorite

indoor sports from now on to

the Wednesday at the far end of the

month. And it’s not the middle aged

only who dine, any more than it's only
the young who dance.

The number of gray haired dancers
on the floors of the national capital
has often been a subject of comment.
It was amusing the other night at the
ball for the Episcopal Eye, Ear and
Throat Hospital to see a pretty girl
in pink and silver whisked away from
her parents, just in time to release
mother in black tulle and jet as her
partner claimed her, leaving father
free to stroll blithely over and whirl

off with a lady fair in green and gold

Of the nediate administration cir-

  

cle I believe Mrs. Baker {s the only
One who actually dances now the Mc-
Adoos are gone. They were both

avowedly fond of dancing, and did it
well As for Mrs. Baker, she's de-
voted to it. Dances with all the en-
thusiasm of a girl, and most grace-
fully, and the last time I talked with |
her was frankly regretting that her |

illness of the fall and early winter had |
made it {nadvisable for her to dance |
until her strength should more fully |
have returned.

Going Ont Occasionally.

She !s going out to some extent;
there are occasional dinners for “The
Secretary of War and Mrs. Baker,”
and they occasionally attend dinners |
for other notabilities; she goes to the |
big concerts, and she takes part in
small ones. (

Singing for the soldiers at hospitals ;
or cantonments, or at entertainments |
arranged for them elsewhere, has been
Mrs. Baker's spectal war activity, even
as it has been Miss Margaret Wilson's
—but she has to go a bit slow for
the present. and is cutting out the,
dancing, which is a real sacrifice for
her.

Of the others, the Marshalls attend |
balis now and again, as do the Presi- |
dent and Mrs. Wilson, when tn Wash-
ington—though the President hardly
encourages dancing ag a feature of
White House entertaining. There has
been practically none at the Executive |
Mansion since the beginning of the
present regime; whereas, in the last
Administration there were many for
Miss Taft and her friends, espectally
during the holidays when Robert Taft
was home from college. Even the big
atate receptions wound up with danc-

 

eee

ing in the East room.
One sees Mrs. Gregory and Mrs.
Daniels at dances, but not dancing. |

Bometimes, if it is a charity ball, thr
an organization !n which they are in-
terested, they are in the receiving line |
—as both are likely to be for the
Southern Relief ball of next Monday. !
Sometimes they are decorating boxes

and not infrequently Mrs. Gregory
chaperons Miss Jane Gregory and
some of her girl friends. Mrs. Lane Is

not given to receiving lines, although
she and Secretary Lane quite fre-
quently establish one of their own, as
they watch a and their friends
visit with them {n,a box. Once ina
great while Mrs. LAne is chaperoning
her young daughter Miss Nancy, who
as she is not yet out, does not go to
many of the big dances except during
the holidays, when rules are more or
less in .abeyance,

ae
ball

The Houstons Do Not Dance,

The rest do not, so far as,I know, go
to dances. Mrs. Houston, in response
to a question of a couple of weeks ago
as to whether the Houstons were go-
ing to the Russian ball, which many
who never dance were attending as a
spectacle, said: ‘'Nu-o, we don’t go to
dances. We dine; we don't dance.
You see, my husband ts a very busy
man. And anyhow at present the chil-,;
dren are just getting over the chicken-
pox and we are more or less quar-
antined!”

Taking them as a body, the Cabinet
neither go to dances nor give them,
except the Marshalls and the Daniels.
The Marshalls, up to the time the
United States entered the war gave?
one or two big evening receptions with
dancing each s¢ The last one was
on inauguration night two years ago,
when they gave a dance in compliment
to the Culver boys, who had twice
formed the Vice-President’s guard of
honor tn the inaugural parades, Every-'

is a usual feature. For there is nearly
always a bunch of young people at the
hospitable home of the Secretary of
the Navy.

There are several charity balls
scheduled for this month. The South-
erm Relief Association's comes Monday.
It ts the bal] above all others that the
White House has made a point of pa-

organization which seems to have
taken on a new lease of life with the
coming of the war, and the consequent

; coming of many nationally and Inter- |
| nationally known writer folk to Wash-

ington.

It nearly always has some tnterest-
ing feature on Fridays at its weekly
afternoon teas. A few weeks ago it
was Mrs. Barnett just back from
France and the first American woman
to get to Metz with the American ad-
vance guard. She had succeeded in
getting permission to go over to her

| husband, Mafor-Gen. George Barnett,

commandant of the Marine Corps, who
had developed influenza on his way to
France and landed there in a serious

a tour of the battleflelds where the ma- !
rines had fought and took a carload of
flowers with her to scatter. |

Mrs. Walsh the Star.

This last Friday Mrs. Thomas F. |
Walsh was the bright particular star
She told about the reconstruction work
the last
setts avenue. She has turned it intoa
regular reconstruction factory, the par-
ticular variety being reconstruction of

  

| Sarments for the d@stitute in Belgium

and France.

When this country entered the war |
Mrs. Walsh organized a committee of
industrious folk, largely recruited from
among or at least by her personal ac-
quaintances. They have been working
in her home for the better part of two
years now, except during the extreme
cold weather of last winter, when the
coal shortage was so serious that Mrs.
Walsh preferred to close the big house
for a while rather than insist on hav-
ing the coal necessary. Hundreds of}
packing cases, meaning thousands of
garments, warm and useful, have been
sent over to relieve suffering. -Mme.
Jusserand took over a iarge consien-
ment with her just recently, and Com-
mander Eva Booth of the Salvation

' Army, who was here a month or two

ago, is said to have taken to Belgium
several carloads.

Perhaps the one thing in which so-
clety was most interested this week
was the benefit for the Working Boys
Home, a charity in which many influ-|
ential women are interested. The ben-

Mrs, Harold Walker, who with Mrs,

connection with getting up the benefit,
had Mrs, Newton D. Baker in her box,
and Gen. Menoher, head of the air ser-
vice; Mrs. Willlam A. Slater and Col.
Gilmore, also of the alr service. Capt
Noble E. Irwin, chief of naval
aeronanti¢és, and Commander Bteele
were among Mra. Willlam McClellan
Ritter’s guests. Others who had boxes
mostly filled with Britons were Mrs.
Richard Crane 3d, Mrs. Alexander
Mackay-Smith, Mrs. John Jacob
Rogers and Mrs. Paul Hudson. By the
way, Mr. and Mrs. Paul Hudson, who,
live here at the Shoreham, are the!
parents of Lieut. Donald Hudson, the |
fifth American ace, who has the unique |
distinction of having brought down |
three enemy planes inside ten minutes.
He is still in France.

Dia Wet Sail After All,

Which reminds me that one of our
recent popular brides whom Washing-
ton thought {t had permanently lost,
Sara Price Colller Fellowes Gordon,
who had expected to sail for England
on January 30, is back in town. She
and her husband, Lieut. Charles Fel-
lowes Gordon, R. N., left Washington
a week ago Sunday. They expected to
meet in New York the other officers
of H. M. 8. Warrior, who were coming
up from Washington on their ship and

. | going to take a regular liner from New |

York, sending the little vesse} home in|
charge of her crew,

But she got all tangled up in a sub-
marine net down near the entrance to
Chesapeake Bay, and eventually had
to send divers down to cut the net
away from the propeller, and then
tow the Warrior into port, where she
is laid up in dry dock. Apparently the
officers are not to go till she is ready.
The Fellowes Gordons departure is in-
definitely postponed

Another benefit in which soclety
yenerally, and the set around the dip-
omats particularly, is interested, is
that for the British American War Re-
lief to be given at Mrs. T. T. Gaffs on
the 26th, a week later than originally
announced, The benefit {s to take the
