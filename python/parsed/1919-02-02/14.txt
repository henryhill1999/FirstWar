Opposition to Head of Repub-
lican County Committee
Veiled Except in Albany.

-
SUCCESSOR IS

 

 

Parsons’s Support Needed to
Throw His Protege Out
of Leadership.

 

Some of his enemies, those who have
never forgiven him for supporting
Charles S. Whitman for renomination,
are beginning quietly to talk about a
movement to force Samuel Koenig out
as president of the Republican County
Committee. Taking their cue from an
editorial attack on Mr. Koentg’s leader-
ehip appearing itn the Albany Evening
Journal of Willlam Barnes recently,
these men are beginning to whisper |
about that there should be a change.

This talk is heard most frequently in
the Republican Club where the benti-
rent for the nomination of Merton E.
Lewis, Attorney-General, for Governor

was strong. But so far the talk has
not developed into any concerted move- |
ment, and no one is ready at this time,
to eupport it openly. Some attempt is |
being made to find a leader and also a!
man who can be put forward as a suc-
cessor to Mr. Koenig. In this connec-
tion the name of Charles D. Hilles, for-
merly chairman of the National Com-
mittee, has been used, but it is not be-
lieved he would consider for a moment
going into such a fight.

The anti-Koenig men point to the
small yote at the last election for Gov.
Whitman in Manhattan and to the fact
that not a single Republican Senator
was elected in that party's delegation in
Congress and in the State Assembly was
cut down, They clalm that this is due
to the fact that Mr. Koenig ta out of
touch with Republican voters in the
county.

They say that the Republican organi-
vation should maintain a strong oppos!i-
tion to Tammay Hall at all times and
that it should be equipped to follow the
Tammany city administration and make
capital out of its ehortcomings. The!
Republican members of the Board of
Aldermen for some time have complained
that they were handicapped in their
work by the fact that they had no or-
ganization to supply them with the nec-
essary material with which to fight the
Democrats, The Socialists have a well
equipped bureau for this purpose, the
result of which {is that they are con- |
stantly harrassing the Democrats, ace
cording to a carefully thoug%t out polity.

To meet this very need Mr. Koenig got
authority at the last meeting of the!
county committee to name a committee |
on civic affairs which should hand!e just!
such matters. This committee probably | |
Will be named this week.

Mr. Koenig has been head of the
county committee since 1911. He was
put in througn the efforts of erie t
Parsons, who always has «tood back
of him. The present enemies of the
county leader acknowledge that they
should not make much headway against
the opposition of Mr. Parsons and are
anxioua to know what attitude he will
take. At present he {ts a Lieutenant-
Colonel in France, but the advices are
that he will return to this country with-
in a short time.

FEDERAL RESERVE
BANK STATEMENT

Reflects Large Liquidation of
War Paper and Reduction
of Circulation.

 

 

Special Despatch to Tue Bun,

WasuiIneTon, Feb, 1.—- Substantial
iMquidation of war paper and other dis-
counts, also further reduction {fn out-
standing note circulation, are indicated
in the Federal Reserve Board's weekly
bank statement.

The banks’ gold reserves show an in-

crease of $10,800,000, largely through
gold deposite made by the Treasury.

j}hand, Government short term securities
went up $119,100,006, the increase repre-
senting certificates of indebtedness taken
by two banks to cover temporary ad-
vances to the Government. A decrease
of $81,600,000 in Government een is
iargely offset by a gain of $68,700,000 in
members’ reserve deposits, which, with
the larger float, accounts for a decline of
$20,100,000 in net deposits.

The week saw a further decrease of
$15,800,000 in Federal reserve note cir-
culation, against a simultaneous gain of
$11,300,000 in cash reserves. Accord-
ingly the banks’ reserve percentage
shows a rise from 62.3 to 53 per cent.
Aggregate liabilities on Federal reserve
bank notes in circulation increased $3,-
600,000. Increases of capital and sur-
