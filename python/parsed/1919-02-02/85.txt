mained for Mme. Yvette Guilbert and
the Neighborhood Players of the
Neighborhood Playhouse in Grand
street to play to the limit “le nouveau
jeu" by presenting “Guibour,” a four-
teenth century French miracle play.
Its original title was “Un Miracle de
Notre Dame; Comment Elle Garda
Une Femme d'Estre Arse” (A Miracle
Play of Our Lady; How She Saves a
Woman from Being Burned—-i. c., at
the stake). This French miracle play, |
which Is now being presented for the
firat.time in English, is so very old

 

that it is quite the newest dramatic}

| Mme. Guilbert, “is very primit!

everything that was done in the vari-
ous arts was in narration of the beau-
tiful religious legends

“And there were two points on
which the French people of the Middle
Age were insistent and were hard and
fevere against delinquents ey were
the honesty, that is, the faithfulness
of their women and the bravery of the
knights tthe chevaliers)

about 1352, so music has been pro-

music, some of which antedates even
the period of the play's first presenta-
