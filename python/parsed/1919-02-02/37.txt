Miss Westley, who has an !mportant :
role in the new Sinclair Lewis comedy, |
‘fs a Brooklyn product. As she puts|
it, her appearance and disappearances
on and from stageland are but similar |
to the daily life of the subway travel-
jer. studied with Sargent, trav- |
elled on “the road,” married and re- |
tired from the stage fust like so many!

attracted immediate attention, only to;
Aisappear from Bohemia and land onj;
Broadway in “The Lassoo,” “Crops and

Miss Westley confesses that she has
two hobbies—second-hand books and
second-hand clothes. “I never buy @
new book or a new dress,” says this
remarkable young woman. “An old
cover cannot spoll a good book nor
an old dress a good woman, In-

Mr. Conroy and Mr. Meltzer in the,

new play pokes fun at that truly
happy land it only helps to show the
real spisit that sets the Village epart
