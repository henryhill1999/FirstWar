“Patriotic Drama
. y r ”
in Your Own Town
By BARRETT H. CLARK.
T is gratifying to see that the amateur
plays and pageants now being writ-
ten are far different from the run of pro-
fessional war plays. Through the greater
part of them runs a deeply patriotic
theme of serviee, not of hate; of construc-
tive ideals and not of destructive preju-
dice. Larlier in the year the Drama
League of America organized a patriotic
play contest, among the rules and regula-
tions of which was a clause calling upon
contestants to preach the doctrine of pa-
trivtic service; no “war plays” were
wanted, no hate propaganda wonld be
considered, The result was gratifying.

It now beeonies clear that the theatre,
and particularly the amateur theatre, in
and elsewhere in the

ing the “reconstruction period.” Ameri-

that the sale of these has been rather in-

The latest contrbution to the list is
Constanee D'Arey Maekay’s Patriotic

a practical guide to the subject. Notice

A Matchless Little

By W. B. McCORMICK.

T HERE is, we like to think, sufficient
of Un iupish quality in every

man’s spirit to prompt him to a desire new
and ayuin to stand aside from the current
of events and the clamoring of speech
and print and say with immortal Puck,
“Lord, what these mortals be!”
Surely some such desire as this must
spring up in the thoughts of the well-
balanced reader as he tums with quick
delight the pages of From Isolation to
Leadership, by John Holladay Latané,
professor of American history in the
Johns Hopkins University, whieh is
further and precisely deseribed as A Re
view of Amertcan Foreign Policy.

To approach a work of history in the
sprit of Shakespearian humor may seem
to be treating it with too mueh levity. But
our excuse is that Prof. Latané awakens
such a mood by the very sparkle of his
wii.

What other reaction could there be to
a historieal text which deseribes the se-
cret treaty ot Verona (of November 22,

©1822) as an “attempt to make the world
safe for autoeracy” or explains away Lerd
Salisbury’s failure to deal more seriously
with President Cleveland's intervention in
the Venezuelan boundary dispute in De-
cember, 1805, as “being due to his sense
of humor”?

part in foreign affuirs since the Ameri-
can colonies “deliberately sought” a for-
eign alliance with the French in 1778.

Prof. Latané divides his review proper
into nine chapters with an additional one
devoted to The War Aims of the United
States. This is too familiar ground to
drill upon, rather is it in the major part
of the text that the reader will find his
chief reward. Here is traced the Origin
of the Policy of Isulation, the Formule
tion of the Monroe Doctrine, The Monroe
Doctrine and the Lurepean Balance of
Power, International Cooneration With-
out the Sanction of Force, The Open Door
Policy, Anglo-American Relations, Im-
peralistie Tendencies of the Monroe Doc-
trine, The New Pan-Americanism and The
End of Neutrality and Isolation.

It would appear that the very title of
our author’s last named chapter negatived
all that had gone before. But, based on
the President’s address to the Senate of
Jannary 22, 1917, Prof. Latané shows
that “the abandonment of isolation” does
not mean that we propose “to abandon
the great principles for which we have as
a nation stood, but rather to extend them
and give them a worldwide application.”

Not the least of the gratifications af-
forded by this review of our foreign policy
is to be reminded afresh of how many of
the great principles of international law
were born of the American fathers. Thus,
when Jefferson wroie of our treaty obli-
gations with France, “the Treaties be-
tween the United States and France were
not treaties between the United States and
Louis Capet, but between the two nations
of America and France, and the nations
remaining in existence, tho’ both of them
have since changed their forms of gov-
ernment, the treaties not annulled
by these changes,” he established “a prin-
ciple which is now one of the fundamen-
tal doctrines of international law.” We
are reminded of how, so soon after Wash-
ington’s farewell address as Jefferson's
Presidency, Monroe was sent to Paris to

a contingency thai was averted by the un-
expected cession of the entire provinee of
Lenisiana to the United States. There
was no neeessity for us, therefore, in
Jcfferson’s phrase, “to throw away the
seabbard.”

Again we are reminded by the corre-
spondence between President Monroe and
Jefferson ant! Madison in the autumn of
1823. how ready the three Fathers were
to consider am alliance with Great Britain
against what Jefferson styled “the equally
tawless allianee, calling itself holy.” This
episede resulted eventun!ly in the fornnula-
tion of the Monroe Doeirine. But does
not the apparent willingness of this creat
trio of American stafesmen to enter into
an “entangling alliance’ with England
rather ent the ground out from beneath
the feet of thosd who protest against sach
a course (o-day?

In fact we believe that an alliance with
Great Britain would not only be lecked
upon with favor by most Amerieans to-
day but would also be regarded as the
createst safecuard against war that we
could have. It is one of the happiest
memories awakened by Vrof. Latané to
be reminded of the fact that Bismarek
once called the Menree Doetrine “an in-
ternational impertience.” What bad ronnd

Teutonie oaihs might he not have witered
against our abandoning our policy of iso-
lation and cending an army to Frances to

aid in whipping the German army and
taking, unaided, his treasured Sedan!

Two of the most interesting and in-
struetive chapters here, and the ones rieh-
est in reward for readers with open minds,
are those devoted to The Monrod Doctrine
and the European Balance of Power and
International Cooperation Without the
Sanction of Farce.

In the first of these the writer touches
on the Clayton-Bulwer treaty and the
Maximilian episode in Mexieo together
with the Venezuela ineident, showing how
European affairs,uneonsciously interfered
in behalf of the Monroe Doctrine. In the
second chapter mentioned we read of the
slavery question as it affected our rela-
tions with England, the establishment of
Liberia and our unofficial participation m
the affairs of the Congo and in the AL-
geeires conference where we swayed the
balance of power agninst Germany in fa-
vor of our ally, Franee.

In addition to its other tonie qualities
we feel that this admirable review has a
special one for all Americans who read
contemporary historieal works and who
have a deep seated admiration of and
friendship for England.
