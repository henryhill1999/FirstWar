Opera Itself as Produced by the Chicago
Organization Proves Conventional
Except in Few Spots

 

HE first week of the season of the Chicago Opera Company having
| come to its conclusion, it is convenient to cast a slow retrospec-

tive gaze over its achievements. It began with the first per-
formance in this city of Henri Fevrier’s “Gismonda,” produced for the
first time on any stage in Chicago, on January 14. It was confessed in
THE SUN of the morning after the revelation of the new lyric drama
that the chronicler of musical doings was not prepared to offer a review
of the work.
There had been no opportunity to study it at rehearsals, Sian |

to the custom of local writers about opera. The present writer admits |
without a blush that no just critical comment on an operatic score can
be made by him after one hearing. There may be men who can grasp
the entire artistic plan of a four act lyric drama at a single sitting, mT

By W. J. HENDERSON. |
|

 

THE SUN’S scribe is not of their fortunate number.
It has always been his sad and laborious task to bury himself—or |

at least his nose—in the score for days at a time and to follow with |

vainful attention the development of a performance by conductor and |
stage manager at rehearsals. |

|

In the course of time he began to feel that he might venture to |
assume his customary office of intermediary between the interpreters
and the listeners who had not had the time or the inclination to make |
similar preparations for a first public performance.
With “Gismonda” there was no chance at all for the poor chronicler. |

The whole content of the work was poured in one flood upon his head.
But now comes the moment when that frequently advocated plan of de- |
ferring all serious criticism to the weekly review, may be triumphantly |
tested. So many good friends, who are unaware of the methods of
preparation for the writing of a column of more or less inconclusive
comment the morning after a production, tell ys that this is all wrong

and that we should wait till Sunday and then let the well disgested views |
proudly take the stage.

Well, on this occasion, they decline | Mr. Fontaine, who sang with Miss!

eth | dozen different types of voice produc- |
harps and sighing fiddles, a ve rett |
and fanciful ballet scene in which the | ton and which he ended with @ high C/
music was highly undistinguished, and
a good duet of conventional operatic
type. Of genuine invention there was
little or nothing tn the score.

But there was Mary Garden, for
whose histrionic art this writer’s ad-
miration has always been great. The
rt has grown splendidly and the ad-
frown with it, where-
re the commentator has been roundly
abused for inconsistency. Which
troubles him not at all. If Mary Garden
does not know any more than she did
ten or even five years ago, she !s be-
yond the help of the gods.

But merely as a reminder that Mary
Garden's art and personal power never
escaped the notice of THe Swun’s
chronciler refer to the issue of No-

of quality,
‘Absence of musical tone.

story was untrue.

an angel, nor a visitor from Mars, but
just a rather pleasant looking little
Italian woman, who has a beautiful
voice and sings extremely well. But

art. In the use of pose and
she excels most of the ac-
tresses of the speaking stage. It is
precisely this skill that makes her far
and away the most interesting of the
operatic stars who have ventured into
the fleld of the silent drama. In the
moving picture Miss Garden's action
is as eloquent as it is on the operatic
stage,

In Chicago {t is now the rule to as-
sert that Miss Garden does wonderful
things with her beautiful volce, which
assertion {s perhaps a trifle ambigu-
ous. The fact is that Mary Garden
never had a truly musical voice or

syle. As a singer she cannot be taken
seriously. As an interpreter of dra-
matic music by her own peculiar
tuethod she becomes interesting. One
ioes not call Yvette Guilbert a singer,
ut one is captivated by her interpre-
tation of a French chanson, which is
sung more correctly as to pitch and
phrase by a dozen dull and fleeting re-

talists in Aeolian Hall,

No one will accuse THe Sun ob-
ecrver of making a plea of extenua-
tion of bad singing. Opera is to be
sung and that is all that Is to be said
about the matter. But it is only hu-
