the bullding of the celebrated Cole

Since the original Cole eight made {ts
Aebut in January, 1915, the career of
the car has been crowded with big
achievements, However, at no time has
1 more pudical yet logical improvement
in desif¢n been inaugurated than the
ene which characterizes the styles
adopted for the coming year.

The Cole Aero Eight, open models; the
‘ourster, the roadster and the sportster
will be recalled from last year. The
new toursedan, tourcoupe and towncar
complete the line,

SERS HUGE DEMAND
FOR MOTOR GARS

 

Maxwell-Chalmers Sales Head

Perhaps.

| ny T. J. TONER,

ae: of Sales Marwell-Chalmers
Motor Companies,

| When hostilities ceased in Europe last

| November the automobile industry of

| America found itself standing in some-

| thing of a daze at the station platform,

so to speak, suit case in hand—just back

from a long trip away from home.

All the world knows now that it had
been away to war, and whenI say ‘t went
awny to get into the war I mean that it
not only got in but it rot clear in. No
industry back of Uncle Sam gave more
than the automobile industry, and our
industry gave doubly, since it gave
quickly and effectively,

| What the aggregate production of the
motor car factories amounted to In turn-

E the tide to victory already is pretty
generally known, It was a big job well
done

Something to Remember,

So much has been said about it, how-
r, that the average nan in the street
ly ha lost sight of one factor

 
  

 

tance during the last ten weeks. I mean
thi:

In those weeks, from the middle of No- |
vemnber to tt present day, the automo-

bile ind y has faced and conquered a
i te as hure, in many of its aspects, as
Was our Work of crowding the fighting
fronts with Its instruments that brought
to our armies

 

 

That ts, we have made ready for peace-
t! production and have switched our
planis from war work to a schedule of
regular production which we hope will
be suffictent to keep up with the demand
for passenger cars and trucks until we
have stered the next big task ahead
of us, which is to further expand our
nanufacturing resources ta meet the de-
inands that will accrue from the greatest
era of prosperity this country has ever
seen
1 question right now {ff there is
another predominant industry in the
| country that has grasped the task of
| reconstruction and readjustment within

 

 

 

 

which has been of transcendant impor- |

 

 

 

{ean buyers had war not interrupted
everything, In England to-day thou-
sands of car buyers are so anxious
to get new automobiles that they are
making deposits with dealers with the
understanding that they are to get their
cars if, as and when the factories pro+

duce them. The price is not stated, and

the best the dealers can do is to guess

at some approximate price. That state
of affairs could easily have obtained
here were it not for the resourcefulness
of the automobile Indutry as a whole,
With peace arriving Just at the begin-
j Ding of winter it was possible for the
factories to keep up with dealer de-
mands during the succeeding two months

hat a voleani¢ demand for more cars

conditions—ready to burst into actlon

when the public had had a few weeks |

in which to recover Its poise.
The great demand now is on. From

an almost certain knowledge of what lit 3 |

ahead of ug in the next few months and
during the next few years I predict that
the New York show this week will see
| the greatest degree of interest that these
events have ever known.

Why This Demand Is Sure.

There are various logical reasons for
this belief which any well informed ob-
server of conditions can discern. It is
