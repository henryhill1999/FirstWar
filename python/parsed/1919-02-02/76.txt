Why This Should Be
Your Car

Doubtless you will pause before the Oakland Sensible Six Coupé
on view at the Show to admire its good appearance and comfort —
these are apparent to even the casual glance.

     
         
 

What should concern you most, however, is this car's capacity for
constant and economical performance, for gasoline and tire mile-
ages surprisingly high.

The foundation of the Coupé, as of all Oakland models, is the
standard 44-horsepower Oakland Sensible Six chassis Which in the
service of more than 100,000 owners has thoroughly made good.

 
       
   
   
 

The merit of this chassis, and the comfort built into the roomy
body above it, represent a value not exceeded anywhere in the
present automobile market.

 
     

 

 

Oakland occupies Space 22 at Madison Square Garden. The
models on display are: the Touring Car, $1177; the Roadster,
{ $1177; the Sedan, $1766; and the Coupé, $1766. Additional for
wire wheel equipment, $75. All prices delivered in New York.

The expert engineering talent of this country
has registered t the belief that AC Spark Plugs

are the best spark plugs. :
You may readily check this statement by in-
vestigating the spark plug equipment of the

¢

 

various automobiles on display at the Automo-
bile Show this week.

You will see that the majority of these cars are
AC-equipped.

At the AC exhibit vou will tind cross sec-
tions of the AC Aircraft Plug and of the
standard AC Titan Plug for motor cars.

You will notice that basically,
these two plugs is the same.

the design of

One was standard equipment on Liberty and
Hispano-Suiza airplane motors during the
war, the other has been standard equipment
on most makes of motor cars for years.

When United States army engineers sought
a dependable spark plug tor aviation service .
they conducted rigid tests. “AC Plugs proved
their superiority in terms so unmistakable
that they were promptly adopted.

The automotive engineers of this country
have been conducting similar tests for years.
The result has been the adoption of AC Plugs
by most of them.

So, men who know, believe AC Spark Plugs
are the best spark plugs.

You may be sure theretore that AC Plugs
will serve you best, just as they served the
United States Government best’ in the most
exacting service that spark plugs have ever
been called upon to pertorm.
