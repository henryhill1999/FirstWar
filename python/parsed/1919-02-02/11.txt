“THE COWBOY’S PRAYER.”

 

A Poet Grieved by the Wanderlust

of a Child of His Braln.

To THE Eprror or THe Sun—Sir: A
while back, it seems, you printed some

Western verse entitled “The Cowboy's

Prayer" and by you attributed to “M.
Clarke.” At least the Omaha World-
Herald copied it in that form and the
obliging editor of the Sioux City Journal
sent the clipping to me with an interro-
gation point pencilled upon it.

“The Cowboy's Prayer’ was born
about ten years ago. He was a good
and pious child until he got to asso-
ciating with editors and other reckless
characters, and then he developed a
malignant form of the wanderlust, and
for years since then I have heard of
him in the most unexpected places. I
do not mind his taste for travel, but
he has got so weaned away from the
simple surroundings of his childhood
that he appears. to be ashamed of
his father’s name and in a sneaking
attempt to conceal his poor but honest
paternity changes and deforms it in
various ways, and at times even mas-
querades under such hackneyed aliases
as “Anonymous” or “Author Unknown.”

Inasmuch ae he is the only one of
my children who has won any particu-
lar fame, or at least notoriety, this
habit of his grieves me more than I
can tell you. Once, in hope of win-
ning him back from his waywardness,
I put bim into a printed book with a
number of his less brilliant brothers
and sisters, in which respectable vehicle,
with my own proper name emblazoned
on the panels, I reckoned he would be
content to ride down tke ages. But
no; it is too slow for him, and pe-
| Tlodically T get a glimpse of him tear-
) ng across the country in some alr-
:plane engined racer of a newspaper,
‘and sporting some absurd variant of
\his father's staid, square toed name,

I don't know what [ can do about
it. I don’t know what you can do
about !t. This plaint of a neglected
and sorrowing father's heart is just

 

addressed to the fathomless universe |‘

in general, like the soprano solo of the
coyote up the gulch, and perhaps the
sheer unbosoming of !t will bring me
some relief.

It is tough enough to be a poet—
with prices as they are fn these prof-
Iteering times of peace—but to have this
serpent's tooth of thankless and unduti-
ful progeny gnawing away at my vitals,
in addition to the pangs induced by an
unhappy attempt to devise a balanced
ration of alfalfa and dog biscuit that
will mitigate the h c of 1, I feel myseif
in the Prometheus class.

Perhaps, if you have ever had one
of your sleek and beautiful editortal
articles eviscerated by a despised con-
temporary and later seen its essential
organs unnaturally functioning in a
pale solution of the stealer’s thought.
after the manner of Dr. Carel'’s famous
eatless cat of a few years back, you
can form some notion of my passion
and my pain.

Thanking you, sir, for your atten-
tive attention up to this point, I am,
properly speaking, Bavorr Clark.

Barroom Fixtures Do Not Now In-
terest a Former Saloon Keeper.

To THE Epitor or THe Scn-—Str: The
reply of Cit” Marshal Tiernan to my
j letter in which I briefly described my
many tribulations while in the saloon
business contains this remark by way
;of sarcasm:

“He does not say what kind of furni-
jture he is now selling—barroom or
j other fixtures."

|} What a preposterous remark, when
jhe knows that on January 16, 1920, all
| barroom fixtures will be so much junk.
Does Mr. Tlernan know of any brewer
in New York who would now advance
$100 on a mortgage on the most artistic
;and palatial fixtures? Does Mr. Tier-
{nan know of any vender of whiskey or
beer with confidence enough in the
future to rig out a caf4? Not one.

These indisputable facts should rat-
{sty Mr. Tiernan's mind that I am not
