BACK TO EARLY ENGLISH

MOTIVES FOR FRESH INSPIRATION IN HOME DESIGNING

Seek to Combine
Homely Attract-
iveness of the Brit-
ish House With
Ideals of Ameri-
can Home Life

America has about passed through
her adolescence of nondescript archi.
tecture. The day of suburban home hor-
rors has reached its twilight. Atrocities
euch as two story cottages, built in
stingy and tawdry imitation of Grecian
ampitheatres and Moorish castles, are
coming to be regarded with a proper de-
sree of abhorrence. Even by the lay-
man purity and simplicity are now rec-
ognized as the cardinal principles of
home construction,

Year by year the American public
shows an increasing appreciation of

the artistic qualities of domestic build-
ings, and when a new note is struck in
architecture or a revised style reasgerts
{taelf the American home builder wants
to know about it. In view of this archi-
tectural reawakening—not to say refor-
ination—It fe interesting to note the re-
cent trend {in American domestic build-
ing toward early English architecture.
Ths realization of this tendency need
not come as a shock to the lover of}
tradition, for the good old Colonf&l, the|
oldest form of architecture in America,
came from England and is nothing more
or less than an outgrowth of the Eng-
iish Georgian school. }

The growing enthusiasm for the early |
Vinglish, therefore, cannot be regarded |
as a violation of nationalistic sentiment |
er ag an attempt to supersede the Co-
onial, w will live forever as an
American visualization of what a gen-
tleman's home should be. In the strict}
sense of the word it is not even a re-/!
vival, but an attempt to blend the better
qualities found in houses large and/|
smal] throughout home loving England
with the essentials necessary to modern |
American life. It has this decided ad-
vantage, that !t gets away from the use)
0% Wood as the principal material in the
eonstruction of homes. The too liberal
use of wood was, of counse, dictated by |
necessity in the earlier stages of Amer-
ica’s architectural history, and to it may
be attriouted most of the tawdriness |
end non-permanency of construction in}
the average American suburb.

In their attempt to do away with |
this flimsiness and at the same time hit |
upon a style that will be adaptable to
domestic work, many American archi-
tects are following the lead set by their
British contemporaries, and are going
ack for inspiration to the period before
the Renaissance, when domestic archi-
tecture was

simple, and men built homes that were
homely in the literal sense alone.
Some excellent examples of early Eng-
lish motives and forms, employed to
inject a new note into American home
designing, are shown in the pictures

accompanying this article. The fllus
trations are photographic reproduc-
tions of recently built homes, designed |
by Lewis Albro, an architect of |
2 West Fo econd street. The most |
Pretentious is “‘Hillbrook,” the resi- |
dence of George Arents, Jr., at Rye, ,
cir This is a “great house" of the!
Tudor period, built far back in a park, |
as the English l@ed to place their!
manor-houses: yet it is a hous® with!
every American conventence and all |

those luxuries, such as sun parlors, eie- |

rooms, which are
rapidly becoming essentials in American
country life.

The residence of Jerome Mendleson,
at Albany, N. Y. is also a large house
and is typical of the simpler kind of
English domestic work antedating the

| days of Inigo Jones

Here the high pitched roof gives a
wonderful skyline and the English chim-
neys become a most fmportant note in

the general design. The white marble
entrance in reality belongs to a later
period, that of the early Renalssancs,

but this blending of periods is charac-
teristic of much of the finer class of

RESIDENCE of PRANK D. POTTER, Esq.
et LYE ,

ALBANY , NY, N.Y.

' In Mr. Albro's smaller houses the
early English spirit is particularly
happy. Here the architect went to the
farm houses of the Cotswold district
of England, and to the cottages found
in Surrey and Kent for his inspt!ration,
and how well and almost lovingly they
transplant themselves to American
soil the pictures plainly show The
jot thet of the roof lines and the detail

of the unusual chimneys ali contribute
to a wonderful picturesqueness, which
|{s neither forced nor playful

} Aside from its artistic qualities and
{ts possibilities for developing the pic-
turesque in domestic architecture, this

 

| @tyle is urged by the architect as espe-
| clally adaptable for the modern Amer-
| foan home. Of course,
mands in the first place that the exterior
walls be built of stone or brick or fin-
{shed !n stucco. But here any
expense over the frame Colonial building
ceases to exist. The homely the
material, the more imperfect the brick,
the more radical the departure from
|the mechanically correct in line and ser-
| Vice, the nearer does this type of dwell-
jing approach the old work fn charm,
;color and feeling.

| Not only the cheapest
lbrick, but often refuse brick {s used,
!and laid in irregular bond Slate that

that is applied by inexperienced, rather
than experienced plasterers’ hands, help

Artistic Effect Is

Brick Laid in Ir-

regular Bond by

to form the charm of texture and oolor.
But—and it {s a very important “but”
from the standpoint of the architect--—
this use of imperfect and therefore non-
costly material must be devised, con-
trolled and explained by one who knows
how, and that of course means the
capable architect. In other words the
artisans and craftsrnen of the old days

have disappeared Then it was the
mason, the carpenter and the
joiner, who executed the details of a

design and who wrought the individual
something that gave the crude material
a soul, But he didn’t work for a union
jin those days, and the materials were
| fashioned by his hand and not at a
factory.

| To return again to the practical, the
larchitect points out the simplicity of
| all the details !n the early English
types which call for no multitudinous
details such as the classic Georgian and
Colonial works demand. Form, mass,
line, color, texture-—-these are the
| foundations of the charm in the earlier
| English work, and ornament of every
kind, except in {solated cases, 19 super-
) fluous.

; The minimum of wood {s used on the
j exterior and hence there ts little to
|paint vear after year, except the sash
jand frames, and even these should be
‘metal if the architect's advice is
| followed.
