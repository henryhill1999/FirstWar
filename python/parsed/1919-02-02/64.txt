Word of Cadillac achievements during |

is sort is that so far aa can be learned
the Cadillac was the first motor car of
the allled armies fo cross the Rhine after
the armistice had been signed

Crossed at Alt Briesac.

In addition to detailing the trip into
nd out of Germany, the letter recounts
some of the officer's previous experiences
with the Cadillac. Lieut.-Col, Johnson
writes, under date of December 18, to
the Cadillac Company :
“T send you herewith two photographs |

The Show’s Only New Car—The Essex

New in Name and Type—Expected for Two Years

Has Special Position at the Show

 

 

Not Room for It and the Hudson on the Main Floor of Madison Square
Garden, They are Given the Largest Space in the
Building, in the Concert Hall on the Second Floor

Take Stairway at Either Right or Left of
Main Entrance of the Garden

Everyone who goes to the Automobile Show will
want to see the Essex, the only new car of the year.

Thousands have seen and ridden in it in New York
since it was first shown two weeks ago. No space
available on the first floor of Madison Square

Garden could accommodate the crowds who would
want to see it.

We were given the largest exhibiting space in the
building for Essex and the Hudson.

Four Essex cars will make examination easy.

If only one were shown thousands would be disap-
pointed.

Has Economy of the Light Car, Comfort
and Endurance of the Costliest

The Essex combines the wanted qualities of the
two most distinct types of cars.

It has the economy and moderate first cost of the
light car. And it has the performance, refinemént

and richness, the sturdiness and comfort of the large
costly car.

It is receiving the praise of all who have seen and
ridden init. Men who can afford only the cheap cars
but who appreciate the finer qualities that appeal

to pride of ownership hail the Essex as one to be
proud of
