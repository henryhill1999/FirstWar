Why Excess Weight Means Motoring Waste

Heavy Weight in a motor car is distinctly a liability—not an as-
set. Unnecessary weight is bound to mean waste. Weight requires
power in proportion to move it; and represents excess costs that can-
not be justified by performance.

What Franklin ‘‘Easy-Rolling’’ Means

The entire result of Franklin lightness, balance and flexibility is
summed up in the phrase, ‘‘Easy-Rolling’” which means minimized
friction. It explains, not only the remarkable Franklin economy, but
also its riding-comfort, its quick responsiveness, its ease and safety of

The Franklin—America’s First Light Weight Je Car—is based handling.
on the engineering ideal of Lightness with Strength—on the principle
that mere weight does not mean strength. That, on the contrary, the
highest motoring efficiency can only result from light weight, sctenti-
