“IT have been asked why the the-/|

atrical enterprise in which Nigel Pldy- |

fair and myself have joined has been!
located at Hammersmith. There are!
two reasons, The first is that West |
ind theatres cannot now be obtainad

number of people seem ready and |

stage, and the gonsequence is ‘that |

makes ample allowance for ground |

per cent. on the total capital repre- |

more. The tenant has sublet the the-|

West End theatre whatever can be

not last; but it exigts, and during its

at and taking the money of the simple,
ones. I never proposed to rank among;
the latter, i

And let me note in passing that pro-
vincial ‘repertory’ theatres (as they
are called, though they are no more
repertory theatres than the Lyric
Opera House will be a repertory the-
atre) are now doing gxcellent busi!-
ness, with plays that beyond doubt
are immensely superior to the average
play sent to the same cities on tour.

“Tf you ask me how our Hammer-
emith enterprise originated, I answer
that it originated out of a deep dis-
faction with the West End stage

will patronize something different. I
do not object to the West End stage
because it is commercial. The stage}
must be commercial. A play ought]

thing else.

“Il am intimately aware that I wrote
plays for ten years before I got a
production—and even then I only got
a production through the enterprise
of the Stage Society. One of the old-
est and most celebrated of West End
managements has refused every, long
play I ever wrote, and is still politely
expressing the hope that one day I
may write a play that will suit it.
1 will not pursue this distressing
topic. Thetlackeof faith of the com-
mercial manager certainly did a lot
to kill the dramatic revivaj which be-
gan to be apparent some years ago.
The Hammersmith venture will any-
how have faith. If it fails, as it may,
it will not fail through being im-

pee to new ideas.” ‘

ILLIAM COLLIER, who for
| comedy purposes has in-
i veatigated lying so fully
{in “Nothing But Lies” at the Long-

| acre Theatre, says he has
covered the fourth dimension and the
| fifth estate of the practice. He calls
{it the tongueless lie and has had some
amusing experiences with tongueless
Mare.

“Fortunately,” smiled Mr. Collier
yegterday, “the press agent, who, Is
generally regarded as pretty” good
liar, is only a second rate expert.
Were he to get into the difficult
| tongueless class he would be a much
| greater nuisance than he already is.

“Lying, one is led to fear as the
years of observation increase, is
growing lamentably popular. Once

him I thought she should know.

“*You are so kind to do this,’ she
said, with an inflection of gratitude
that would have deceived the very
elect had it not been for her fan, one
of the honestest fans with which I
have ever conversed. ‘It is the act of
a real friend, and I thank you for It.’

“*Yah—you!’ exclaimed the fan,
looking me right in the eye ana raising
a cyclone with its mistress’ front hair

he will take/‘You, I'd like to shake you till your
teeth rattle out, you intermeddling old

don't wear that kind of teeth. We do
not speak now as we pass by--the
mother and myself.

healthy life of the theatre depends
ultimately on the latter, The purely

PRODUCING DUNSANY.

By STUART WALKER,

From the standpoint of the pro-
ducer nothing could be more dissimilar

than the staging of Lord Dunsany’'s

plays and of Booth Tarkington's
“Seventeen.” In lighting, decoration,
emphasis they stand at opposite

 

theatrical poles. Yet I find that the

that she made a poem and became
thereby a powerful force that moved
kings and prime ministers,

On the other hand, Mr. Tarkington
draws Jane, the child tn “Seventeen,”
with such detail that you can’t possi-
bly think of her in any other way

than,\as Jane. You .know how she
looks, what she likes to eat, how her
mind works. Though she is a force in
Willie's life, your greatest interest
centres 0. the way she does things
rather than on the effect of what she
does. She is a definite person, and
you will probatly remark to some
child of your acquaifitance, “You're
just like Jane!" Whereas you would
never say, “You're like the child fit
“The Golden Doom.'" ;

Tarkington is interested in the per-
sonal peculiarities or eccentricities of
people for the oddity of the things
themselves, And his genius lies in
that he can portray a number of in-
dividual characteristics and also show
the soul beneath them which makes
the character a person. Dunsany Is
interested in human tendencies only in
so far as they lead to some ultimate
catastrophe. His genius lI!es in pro-
senting a generality in such personal
form that every one who reads or sees
hts story feels a kindred understanding
not of the person but of the emotion
that is being experienced.

| To preserve Mr. Tarkington's em-
dis-

phasis in staging his story the utmost
reallsm must be employed By that I |
do not mean crowding the scene with
odd bits of “local color.” I mean that the
stage should present a picture which
seems reminiscent to the audience—
the Baxter home should seem similar
to some home they’ve ‘Atnown. And
proceeding toward the ideal of simple
realism for all gfaghe scenes in “Seven-
teen” I have introduced none of the
mechanical illusions of the theatre,

In Lord Dunsany'’s plays the scene
should present a picture such as you
never actually saw, but such as you
haVe or could have imagined. That
scene must be imaginatively simple.
because the action of the Dunsany

plays is so concentrated and the stage

HENRI LAVEDAN.
By WALLACE MUNRO.

Henri Leon Emile Lavedan . was
born in Orleans, France, in 1850. His
father, Hubert Leon Lavedan, was a
well known Catholic and Liberal jour-
nalist, who came of a family which,
although bourgeois as to social stand- |

Ing was cultivatetl jn taste, where the |
highest ideals and the strictest sense |

'of what was fitting were of long and}

traditional standing. Henri, when |
comparatively young, was sent to a
small seminary near his native town;
from there he went to the Lycee!
Louls-le-Grand and the institution |
Bossuet at Paris and later to the
Jesuit schools at Nantes and Poitlers.

He returned to Paris from the prov-
inces to finish his studies just as the
Franco-Prussian war broke out in
1870. Henrt's father at this time was |
so valiantly defending his country |
from the Hun that he placed his eon |
in the care of the priests, with whom’:
Henri remained during the terrible |
siege and the terrifying days of the
Commune which followed.

At the end of the troublous times he
graduated and submissively agreed to
the wishes of his parents, who had de-
termined to make a lawyer of him;
but one year of law was so distasteful

vardier life created a sensation and
“he was made.”

One afternoon he reatl some of his
petite effusions to the enterprising
Antoine, who immediately produced
two of them at his Theatre Libre with
enormous success. This was Lave-
dan's stepping stone to dramatic liter-
ary fame, Their success urged him to
write more weighty themes and aim
for more ambitious results,

His first real play was “Une Famille,”
which was accepted and produced at
the Comedie Francaise in 1891. Then
followed “Le Prince d'Aurec” in 1892;
“Les Deux Noblesse” in 1894; “Vi-
veurs” in 1895; “Catherine” in 1898,
which was produced by Annie Russell
in this country in October the same
year; then “Le Nouveau Jeu” in 1899;
“Le Marquis de Priola” in 1902, with
the great Le Bargy as the Marquis,
the play Leo Ditrichstein is now
playing. This was followed by “Va-|
rennes,” which he wrote in collabora-
tion with G. Lenotre In 1904; next)
came “Le Duel” in 1905. Otis Skinner)
produced this play in America in Feb-
ruary, 1906, and it was followed by ‘Le |
Bon Temps” in 1906 and “Sire” in 1909. |
Mr. Skinner also produced it here in
January, 1911. “Le @out du Vice”)

PAPAL P APIA AAA |

 

 

His short stories of Boule-|innocenco with sympathetic reverence

and boldly discloses profligacy with in-
trepidity. His satire is brilliant, his
wit scintillating. He is fundamentally
sound in all of his reasoning and his
language is forceful and direct. He is
French to the core in precision, com-
pactness and directness, and his plays
disclose that he is a past master in
the art of writing intimate and con-
vincing dialogue. Lavedan is not an
idealist; he is human and real. Like
many great writers in the realm of
modern drama, Lavedan achieved his
greatest triumphs early in his career.

 

To-night Yvette Guilbert will give
the eighth performance of “Gulbour,”
a fourteenth century French miraclo
play. The demand for seats is so great
that additional performances are an
nounced for Friday, Saturday and

Sunday evenings.

    

BROOKLYN VARIETY.

Nance O'Neil will be seen this
week at the Orpheum Theatre in
“The Common Standard,” which
was written for her by Alfred
Hickman and acted with great
success at the Palace in New
York last week. Muriel Win-
dow and Dorothy Toye, as well
as Jean Adair, will be among the
other entertainers on the pro-
gramme.

Pat Rooney and Marion Bent,
ever amusing and popular, will
be at the Bushwick Theatre this
week, with Mr. and Mrs. Jimmie
Barry to help them amuse the
spectators. Lillian Berse will
sing in “Sweeties,” and there will
be other well known entertainers
on a long programme.

The Lid Lifters are at the Star
Theatre this week and those who
have seen them say that they
deserve this stimulating name.
Harry Lang is their chief funny
man, and has his opportunities in
“Delivering the Goods,” which
Jack Springer wrote for the com-
pany. Bonnie Lloyd and Violet
Penny are also in the company.
