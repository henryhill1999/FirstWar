MANY NEW TORKERS
IN ANNAPOLIS CLASS

—

Fifth Group of Reserve ot.
ficers Completes 15 Weeks
Course, |

MOST ARE SEA VETERANS

 

Some Will Return to Fleet for,
Further Active
Service.

ANNApours, Md. Feb. 1.—The last
class of reserve officers to complete an
intensive course at the Naval Academy
during the present emergency was com- |
posed of 851 young men who were
handed their certificates by the Secre-
tary of the Navy last Friday. They are
a part of the 2,760 young men who have
been trained for temporary duty as
naval officers at the Naval Academy
since the United States entered the war,

forming a body nearly as large aa the
whole complement of naval officers of
the United States prior to the war. |

The whole work of training these
young men is one of the great achieve-
ments of the Naval Academy. They have
been of almost every kind—deck, engi-
neer and pay officers, civil and electrical
engineer officers and officers of the avia-
tion intelligence service.

The present class is the fifth to be
carried through the fifteen weeks course
for deck and engineer officers. They
were designated by the commanders of
the different naval districts, and repre-
sent nearly every State and most of the
larger institutions of learning in the
country.

The members of the present class have
jn most instances had actual sea service
during the war. They came to the acad-
emy for further instruction in order to
perform duties of a higher grade. The
class was assembled prior to the signing
of the armistice, and {ts members ex-
pected to return to the fleet for further
service. Some will remain in the service
for a time, and others later will return
to their civilian employment.
