sition the college team has been up|
against this season

Holmes, Harvard's goal tender. had a}
great day He made more than!
twenty-five stops, many of them sensa- |
tional. Bigelow scored two of Har-;
vard'’s goals, one after taking a pass}
from Clark. Both were made in the!
first half. Clark bagged the final goal}
three minutes after play started in the
second period. The summary:

muoh difficulty tn scoring. Thereafter, |
however, the Navy had things all its,
own way. The first half resulted, 27 to;
6, in favor of the Navy. |

The Naval Academy did not have the
services of their left forward, Farwell, |
who is suffering with the ‘‘flu.” Derin-
j wer played a particularly fine game and
| Lewls and Byerly were fast and accu-
| rate.
| Kram was the only New Yorker to
ecore more than once from the court.
