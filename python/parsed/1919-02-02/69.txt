Hupp Molor Car Corporation,

“Few people understand,” said Mr.
Watson, “the vital part that the science
of metallurgy plays not only in? the
, designing of the automobile but inf its
actua] manufacture and service.

At the Hupp factory every piece of
Material that is shipped into the plant
has to undergo certain fixed laboratory
tests as to its chemical, physical and
estructural qualities. These tests are
“pased both on Government standards
(and our own experience before the ma-
terfal is accepted for manufacturing
Purposes

Nowadays, as many people doubtless
; know, the Government will furnish to
f any manufacturer a sample of almost
any product he desires accompanied
i “with detailed analysis of the material
' and samples which show an average
“standard and which give the manufac-
turer a working basis on which to check
‘the correct proportion of his solutions

Every piece of metal that comes into
‘the Hupp plant is checked against the
Government sample as a standard, and
“on its chemical analysis is based ac-
ceptance or rejection of the material

For instance the hardness of the steel

Quality Goes Clear Through

   

The war period just passed has given to the Dort new
and greater prestige.

The lesson people have learned as to the value of thrift
and conservation has awakened within them a deepened
respect for the Dort.

They have always held it in high regard as a smooth-
running, competent motor car.

They have prized it for its driving ease and riding comfort.

Now they are quickened to an intense appreciation of the
solid virtues that characterize it—its economy, its re-
liability, its faithful performance.

They are conscious, as never before, of how really good
a car it is.

They perceive more sharply than ever how desirable a ‘
car it is to own. .

At the Dort exhibit you will find a full line of the
various models.

We urge upon you the importance of setting aside suffi-
cient time while there to become acquainted in detail
with these cars.

They are fine examples of able engineering practice and
sound, careful construction.

They will impress you as worthy automobile investments.

MOTOR CARS NOW

Hudson Super Six Helped Fos-

ter Their All the’ Year
Use.

te

When every automobile was a ‘one
lunger"—and that was only a compar-
atively short time ago—the first touch
of frost on the “pumpkins” witnessed a |
feneral exodus of cars from the streets
and highways to safe winter lodgings.

In those days automobiles observed
the same hibernating habits as grizzly
bears and ground hogs, and while own: |
era impatiently awaited the coming of
spring and dealers swapped “funny”
stories at the village emporium or city |
club, the builders occupied themselves |
each year with the designing of brand
new models.

“One of the most potent factors in so
changing this condition of affairs that
an automobile has become even more’
of a necessity in winter than it is in
summer,” said Harry S. Houpt to-day,
“has been the policy of the Hudson com-
pany in standardizing its cars and de-
signs. Few people know that besides
being the largest builder of fine cars in
the world, Hudson is also the iarsest |
builder of fine enclosed body types—
having been a pioneer in this fleld |

Now all of the Hudson models are |
built for use the year round. The shut-
ters on the radiator keep the engine |
working at its most efficient tempera-
ture even in the coldest weather. <A
thermostat on the water circulation sys-
tem automaticaly regulates the flow,
also facilitates winter driving by en-
abling the motor after starting to
quickly warm up to the exact tempera-

ranges aré@|tyre required for its best performance.

“All of the Super-Six models are de-

from one to th®other is instahtaneous. signed to afford full comfort and protec-

tion to passengers in any kind of
