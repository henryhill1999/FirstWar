Philadelphia Takes Poughkeepsie’s Place as College Regatta Centre---Dempsey’s Victim Charges a Fake

 

AMERICAN HENLEY
IS SET FOR MAY 34

At Least Four Colleges and
the Navy Will Send Crews
to the Schuylkill.

 

 

COLUMBIA IS ENTERED

 

Penn, Princeton and Cornell
Also in It—Quakers
Are Ambitious.

 

By DANIEL,

Philadelphia will take the place of
Poughkeepsie as the scene of the grand
finale of the intercollegiate rowing sea-
eon next spring. At least four colleges
and the Naval Academy will be repre-
eented in the varsity, junior varsity and
freshman races at the American Henley
on the Schuylkill River on Saturday,

May 31. hat entry was assured and
the date the regatta fixed at the
annua] meeting of the Board of Stew-
ards of the American Rowing Associa-
tlon. at the Columbia University Club
yesterday afternoon.

As Columbia, Pennsylvania and Cor-
nell, which compose the Intercollegiate
Rowing Association, already had decided
not to revive the big regatta at Pough-
keepsie this year, they were free to con-
sider the invitation to take part in the
Diggest American Henley yet arranged.

When the final roundup of entries was
made at .yesterday’s meeting it was
found that the three members of the
Poughkeepsie company and Princeton
and the Navy would send crews to the
May 31 regatta and that Yale and Har-
vard were possibilities However, there
meems to be little chance of getting the
Tlis agd the Crirason into the regatta
since it practically has been settled that
they are to row on June 6 at New Lon-
don.

Club Events Too.

The American Henley will include not

only the three races for college crews,
but many events open to all oarsmen
Single sgulls, fours, club eights and any
other events which may be justified by
the demand will be added to the pro-
gramme. The crew races will be at the
Henley distance of one mile and 550
yards,
: The Union Boat Club of Boston, which
gent a representative in the person of
Charles C. Lund,.promised to enter an
eight and other oarsmen. Lund will be
remembered as the stroke of the Har-
vard seconds who won the Grand Chal-
lenge Cup at the Henley in Mngland.
The following year he stroked the Har-
vard crew, but it lost to Yale.

All of the stewards «poke in most en-
thustastic tones regarding the outlook
for the regatta on May 31. John Ar-
thur Brown of Pennsylvania said that
{t loomed up as the diggest intercolle-
giate regatta in the history of the sport.
Charles Halsted Mapes, representing Co-
lumbia, declared that Columbia was
quite certain to send three eights to the
Schuylkill and to make the regatta just
as big an objective as it used to make
the old four mile races at Poughkeepsie.

In addition to Messrs. Mapes, Brown
and Lund those present were Lieut.-
Commander J. R. Morrison of the Naval
Academy, Francis S. Bangs.

Rotert
and Dean

presided.
Dr. Cabot Is Chairman,

The election of officers of the associa-
tion resulted in the following chotces:
Chairman, Dr. \Hugh Cabot of Union
Boat Club and Harvard; vice-chairman,
Julian Curtiss, Yale; treasurer, Russell
Johnson, University Barge Club, Phila-
delphia; secretary, J. A. Brown, Penn-
evivania.

In addition to arranging for the Amer-
san Henley the conferees talked rowing
schedules in general and a number of
events were arranged. However, as the
final decisions rest with the various ath-
letie and rowing committees of the col-
leges nothing definite could be issued.

It was cecided that the Childs Cup
race would be rowed again on Lake Car-
regie at Princeton, but the date was not
set, Most likely it will be Saturday,
May 10, with Columbia, Princeton and
TPennsylvania as sure entries. Pennsy l-
vanla won the cup last May.

Mr. Brown announced that Pennsyl-
vania had arranged to row the navy on
the Severn al Annapolis on Saturday,
April 12, at the Henley distance, with
events for varsity, junior varsity and
freshman eights. It will be the sixteenth
consecutive meeting of Penn any Navy
crews—a record for continuity of com-
petition which Mr. Brown said was
equalled only in IMarvard-Yale history.

 

Penn’s Big Programme.

Mr. Brown added that Pennsylvania
bad arranged to row five varsity races
within seven weeks. This programme
never has been equalled in college cir-
cles. Pennsylvania last spring rowed
four races in five weeks, and won three
ef them. The Penn idea--and a sound
ene it ts—has for {ts object plenty of
racing at ehort distances instead of few
races over long courses.

Dean McClenahan refused to talk of
Princeton's rowing plans, but it is known

vat the Tigers will row Harvard in
April, aud will take part in the Childs
“up race and the American Henley, The
Tigers would like to break into the Har-
vard-Yale doinge on the Thames, and
that proposition will be discussed at the

ing

Mr. Mapes said that rowing at Colum-
bia was going along prettly smoothly
under Fred Plaisted, who had been as-
gistant to Jim Rice. Columbia is not
ikely to raw in other than the Childs
Cup and American Henley races. Cor-
nell and Princeton may row Yale on the
Housatonic in May.

MONTCLAIR FIVE WINNERS.

Paul's School Falls
Academy Lads, 31 to 21.

Montclair Academy's basketball team
yesterday defeated the St. Paul's School

Stauffer and Snyder played a fast game
for Montclair. Their passing was espe-
cially fine. Tyson played best for the
Long Islanders. He bagged five fleld
goals, while Stauffer and Suyder each
caged five. he lineup:

to-day issued a statement here to the ef
fect his fight with Jack Dempsey at Har
rison Park, New Jersey, July 27, 1918,
WAS @ prearranged affair to the extent
that he and Dempsey were to box an
elght round “exhibition,” and that Demp-
sey won in the first round by “double
crossing” him,

Fulton declared that he was guilty of
complicity in the alleged fake and hoped
that by making a clean breast of the en-
tire affair the public would forgive him
and grant him the privilege of fighting
sh the title with Willard, or at east
with the winner of the Willard-Dempsey
bout. He said he knew he could beat
either Willard or Dempsey and that he
realized the mistake in doing what his
manager told him to do at Harrison.
Therefore with a chance in view for a
title Aight he decided not to keep quiet
any longer. Fulton's statement in full
is as follows:

Falton’s Statement.

“When the match with Jack Dempsey,
which was to have been Staged at Dan-
bury, Conn., July 4, 1918, fell through I
went to Minnesota on a fishing trip. A
few days later, while at Ore, Minn., I
recelved a telegram from my manager,
Mike Collins, telling me to return to New
York, thet-everything had been arranged
for a fight with Dempsey to be held at
Harrison, N. J. When | arrived in New
York four days before the afternoen of
the fight I explained to Collins that {[
was in no condition to fight.

“Don't you worry,’ said Collins; ‘it's
all been arranged and you are to go
ahead and make an eight round exhibi-|
tion. Then we will go to Minneapolis |
for a ten round bout that will net us
$10,000 more.’

KEARNS RIDICULES
FULTON’S CHARGES

Declares Fred’s Statement a
Publicity Project.

 

 

 

When Jack Kearns, manager of Jack
Dempsey, was shown the statement by
Fulton yesterday, he said:

“There is not a*word of truth in what”

that big yellow hound says about Collins
fixing it with Dempsey for an ‘exhibi-
tion’ match. It may be possible that
Collins had to tell Fulton something of
the sort in order to get his ‘ferocious’
fighter into the ring, but eo far as
Dempsey or myself is concerned there
was not a syllable uttered as to a fake
bout.

“Dempsey's consisteht record of quick
knockouts is proof that he fights on his
inerits, while Fulton's record is full of
queer affairs. Fulton tried to leave the
ring three times during his bout with
Carl Morris at Canton, Ohjo, and his
seconds had to drag him back in order to
prevent him being disqualified.

“This lying statement by Fulton was
cooked up by a new manager of the
plasterer in order to boost his depre-
ciated stock in the East. No one who
saw the bout at Harrison will believe
that there was any ‘exhibition’ work on

Spcectal Despatch to Tae Sox.

CrerstNut Hitt, Mass., Feb. 1.—Bos-
ton’e lawn tennis teams, matched in
mixed doubles against New York's chal-
lengers this afternoon, won three of the
jfour matches pleyed at the covered
|courts of the Longwood Cricket Club.

The ability of Mrs. George W. Wight-
man, playing with Harry C. Johnson, to
win both matches, one against Miss
Molia Bjurstedt and Fred Alexanuer
jand the other against Miss Eleanor Goss
}and Merrill Hall, was what turned the
result to Boston's favor. Miss Goss and
j Merrill: also lost to Miss Marion Zin-
jderstein and Nat W. Niles, who later
were beaten casily by Miss Bjurstedt
and Alexander.

The match in which the most interest
centred was that between Mrs. Wight-
man and Johnson against Miss Bjurstedt
and Alexander. The New York pair
ref@esented New York last winter against

the same Boston players and beat them
in a five set match after the Bostonians
{had won the first two seta. Three years
ago Mrs. Wightman and her partner won
the mixed doubles championship and
twice they have been victorious in the
inlxed doubles at Longwood.

To-day Mrs. Wightman and Harry

the office *in an indignant mood and
asserted h@? would be seen in the

According to Vaughn the terms asked

‘GHOST’ SHOOT FOR
N.Y. A.C. GUNNERS

Bauer, McLinn and Walter
Smash, White Targets at
Travers Island.

 

 

 

 

DERRICK NOT FORTUNATE

 

George J. Corbett, chairman of the
shooting committee of’ the New York
Athletic Club, is a “live wire’ who is!
always trying to dig up new stunts.
The latest innovation in shooting at
Travers Island appeared on the pro-
gramme yesterday. Judging by the way
the new shoot was received by the field
of forty-eight gunners, it is going to be
one of the moet popular of the season.

The event is known as the Monthly
Ghost Trophy, At intervals during the
shoot, a white target is thrown from
each set of traps, making four targets
thrown in all. The contestants do not
know when the white clays are going to
be thrown. If the gunner manages to
break one of the white targets, he is
eligible to shoot in the Ghost Trophy
event at the end of the month. If he
misses, he is fined 25 cents and cannot
compete in the shoot at the end of the
month, unless he manages to hit a white
target {n another shoot before the final.

Three hit and one missed the white
targets yesterday. The “gunner who
failed was G. W. Derrick. He missed |
on trap No. 4. On trap No. 1, the white
target fell to W. Bauer's steady aim. J.
McLinn was successful on trap No. 2,
and the white “bird” thrown from trap
No. 3 waa hit by A. W. Walter.

Stein High Straight.

The shooting committee had planned
on giving a high scratch as well as a
high handicap prize in the shoot for the |
club trophy each month. Instead, there
will be a special shoot at 25 targets in
which both a straight and a handicap |
prize will be awarded. Yesterday, C.
Stein ran straight and won the scratch
prize. The handicap prize was taken
by ©. A. Brown,

W. B. Ogden won the high scratch
prize. He took the event with a total
of 95 out of a possible 100 targets
Cespite the high wind. W. R. Delehanty
won both the high handicap and the
Travers Island cups. The latter is a
“take home" trophy. In the Haslin
Club and Accumulation cup shoots, legs
were scored by all gunners with full

GIBBS BOXING BILL

 

Measure, Ready for Senate,
Provides for Ten Round
Contests.

TO BE INTRODUCED SOON

 

One Man Commission to Con-
trol and Limit Is Placed
on Arenas for Bouts.

 

Special Despatch to Tam Svs.

Burrato, N. Y., Feb, 1.-—Senator
Leonard W. H. Gibbs did not discuss
his boxing bill with Gov. Smith here to-
day. When the Governor held open
house at the Mayor's office at City Hall
this afternoor the crowd was so greai
that the spacious office and corridor
would not accommodate all. Senator
Gibbs, schooled in the art of football,
took one look at the crowd and re-
marked:

“This surely is the Governor's busy
day. He has his hands full. I will dis-
cuss boxing with him when he gets back
to Albany, My bill will be offered in
the Senate next Tuesday afternoon.”

Throngs ‘Eager to Talk of Laws.

There were so many persons, men and
women, frorh all parts of western New
York so eager to discuss prospective leg-
islation with the Governor that Sena-
tor Gfbbs decided mereiy to pay his re-
spects to the Chief Executive. Senator
Gibbs announced he would give all who
are interested in boxing a chance to be
heard after his bill is before the Sen-
ate.

Senator Gibbs's bill, contrary to re-
ports, provides for official decisions, The
Umit of rounds is set at ten, a one
man commission {s to control, with box-
ing only in buildings maintained for
athletics. Outdoor bouts would be per-
missible only in arenas bullt and main-
tained for boxing.

Rules adopted by the_United States
Army and Navy are included in the Dill.

The ennouncement by Senator Gibbs
that his bill authorized decisions by bf-
ficial referees came as a distinct sur-

} prise to those interested in the sport, as

it was generally understood that the de-
cistonless feature of the Frawley law
had been incorporated in the new meas-
ure It was also believed that it limited
the rounds to six.

It was conceded by experts in this
vicinity that the proviso legalizing ref-
eree decisions would result in a bitter
controversy among promoters and box-
ers, many maintaining that decisions
would open the door to a return to un-
savory ccnditions prevalent during the
life of the Horton law.

 

 

See End of Crooked Work.

Supporters of referee decisions
serted that if the control of the referees
and their compensation were placed in
the hands of the Commissioner, and the
third man in the ring completely re-
moved from the club owners and man-
agers the chance for . crooked work
would be largely eliminated.

It was pointed out that baseball um-
pires when they were dépendent on club
owners were wont to decide in favor of
the home teams. But as soon as they

BROOKLYN SENDS

wore | CALLS FOR DECISIONS} - DAUBERT TO REDS

 

Famous First Baseman Ex-
changed for Lorry Kopf and
Tommy Griffith.

BAN OFF SHIPBUILDERS

 

National Commission Restores
Caldwell and Baird to
Good Standing.

By FREDERICK G. LIEB,

The deal by which Brooklyn obtains
Shortstop Lorry Kopf and Outflelder
Tommy Griffith from the Cincinnati club
in exchange for Jake Daubert, its vet-
«ran first baseman and captain, was con-

summated yesterday. The deal was
closed by wire by Charles Ebbets of
Brooklyn and August Herrmann of Cin-
cinnatl,

The trade, which had been hanging
fire for some time, was put through as
s800n a8 it was approved by Pat Moran,
who was appointed manager of the Reds
lasi week. WBarlier in the winter Ebbets
said he would not trade or dispose of
Daubert unless he dismiased the suit for
$2,150 against the Brooklyn club. The
amount represents the salary loss Dau-
bert sustained by reason of the leagues
closing their season last Labor Day.

Kopf, who comes to Brooklyn, also
had a salary grievance with the Cincin-
nati club last spring and refused to join
his club, saying he could make more
money making ammunition than pliying
baseball. Later, Kopf entered the army.
He is still with the colors.

Kopf is a product of Fordham Uni-
versity, where he attracted attention as
a third baseman. While a student at
Fordham he played a half season with
the Cleveland Americans under the name
of Brady. Later he spent two years
with the Athletics. Playing with the
Reds itn 1917, he looked like one of the
test shorstops in the game.

 

‘

GriMth Reliable Player.

Tommy Griffith, who comes to Rrook-
lyn with Kopf, is a reliable outfielder
with a good throwing arm He was
with the Braves in 1913 and 1914, but
drifted back to the minors because of
poor hitting. Cincinnat! purchased him
from Indianapolis in 1916 and he hit
-307 in his first year with the Reds.

With the exception of a brief tryout
with the Cleveland Americans in 19098
Daubert spent his entire major league
career in Brooklyn. Ho first played with
the Dodgers 'n 1910. Jake hit over .300
in gix of his eight years in Brooklyn, and
in 1913 and 1914 he led the National
Teague at bat. In 1913 a committee of
sports writers voted Dauvert an ‘auto-
mobile for being the most valuable player
in the Nations! League

During the Federal League raids
Daubert “held up’ Ebbets for a five
year contract calling for $9,000 a year,
In hig last two years in Brooklyn Dau-
bert's work fell off and after the 1918
season he had a hot tiff with his em-
ployer, It then became apparent that
Daubert would not continue in the ser-
vices of the Brooklyn club.
