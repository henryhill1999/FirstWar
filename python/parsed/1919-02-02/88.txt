Village, Sam Fraunces, Black |
Sam to his-crenies, fixed up a tavern |
that was the gathering place’ of the |
Moods of his day, the fashtonable and |
iitramondaine. He was proud of his |
place and so was New York, which was
apt to point to it as a worthy suc- |
cessor to the Stadt Hys. He once}

his notion that some day his hotel

When Stevens went to A. T. Stewart
to propose that Stewart furnish the
hotel and take his interest out of the

It is in an innovation of service that
Mr. Statler thinks he has the most dis-
tinctive thing in a new hotel. He be-
lieves that the'one thing which causea
more trouble in hotels than anything
else 1s the possibility that soon after
a man has registered at a hotel some-
one may call him from outside and be
told that he is not there yet, becaure

The ideal back of all this is the
perfection of service, and as Mr. Hub-
bell led the way through a part of

the mechanical devices by. which that
end {is aleo sought. At the entrance to
the kitchen there is a long, flat tele-

though the ideals back of the different
