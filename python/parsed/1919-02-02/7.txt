Brunt Fell on Infantry.

Examination of the
ments shows clearly that
the fighting fell on the infantry. In
every division which got into action
losses were many times greater, even
proportionately to the strength of the
units, than those of the artillery, ma-
chine gun battalions, trench mortar bat-
teries or engineers. A score of regiments
lost fully one-third of the ful! strength
of 3,790 men in killed, diet of wounds
missing and prisoners. When figures
on the wounded are available, officers
believe, the total casuaities in several
regiments may equal the ft!! strength.

Committee to-day that the agency would
pase out of existence within three weeks.

The Grain Corporation, with offices in
New York, was designated to handle the

year’s wheat has been liquidated it must
be continued. Under existing law the
Grain Corporation, it was sald, could

NARRAGANSETT AND
PIAVE CREWS SAVED

Both American Ships Prob-
ably Total Losses Abroad.

By the Assoviated Presa,

SourHampton, Feb. 1.—In the early
hours of the morning in a calm sea but
a blinding snowstorm the American}
steamship Narragansett ran on sub-|
merged rocks off the east end of the Isle!
of Wight, which have claimed many
victims of the past. The crew was
American, and the ship carried 2,000;
soldiers, of whom sixty were Americans.

Most of the men were in their bunks!
when the crash happened. Bugles called
them to the decks. All were ordered to
stand and to put on lifebelts. Tugs at-
tempted to draw the ship off the rocks,
but failed. Then destroyers took the!
troops off without loss. They were|
Lrought to Southampton.

The Narragansett was so badly dam-

 

be a total wreck. All speak in the high- |
est terma of the conduct of the captain
and the crew. :

ean steamship Piave wrecked off here.
have been accounted for. There is no
lose of life. |

The first regular division. built up out
of the original forca Gen. Pershing took

alties, with a total of 6,244 recorded in
to-day’s tables. This division was firet
to reach the line and was almost con-
stantly in action until the end. A strik-
ing feature ia the losses of the Twentr-
eighth (Pennsylvania National Guard)
Division, which stands second in the list
with a total of 3,890 casualties

 

New York Losses.

The records of the Twenty-sixth (New
England National Guard), the Twenty-
seventh and Seventy-seventh, both New >|
York divisions; the Thirty-second, the
famous Forty-second (Rainbow) and the
Seventy-ninth (Pennsylvania, Maryland
and District of Columbia troops), with
more than two thougand casualties each,
tell of the work they did. These and
every other National Guard or National
Army division that got an opportunity
at the front won its ground despite
losses in men,

Analysis of the strenuous service rec-
ord of the Twenty-eighth Division, army
officers said, would explain its high cas-
ualties. The Twenty-elgh'h was ordered |
overseas about June 1, 1918, spent tne
fortnight of June 14 to July 1 in a train-
| ing area and then moved up to the front
line, taking its position northeast of |
Parnay on July 16. From that date un- |

the armistice was signed, with the |
| exception of a brief rest period from
| September 4 to September 30, the Penn-
sylvaniana were in the forefront of the
fighting.

HULBERT APPROVES
AIRPLANE PORT HERE

Dock Commissioner Says He
Has Proposal for Ten Com-
mercial Hangars.

 

 

An official proposal for the &..*truc-
tion of ten hangars on the New Yo.
waterfront for the use of hydroairpianes
to be employed in an aerial service he-
tween this city and Boston and Philade'-
phia has been placed in the hands of
Murray Hulbert, Commiastoner of Docks
and he intends recommending the
ceptance of the offer, #o he sald last
night at the forty-seventh annual din-

ner of the Silk Association of America in
the grand ballroom of the Hotel Astor.
Mr. Hulbert also advocated the erection
of & national memorial to Theodora
Roosevelt in the form of a water gate on
Riverside Drive. The proposal met with
vociferous applause from the silk mani-

ac-

facturers, more than a thousand of
whom were seated at the tables.

Referring to the propored commerrial
airplane @ervice from this city Com-
missioner Hulbert said:

“One man who embarked in the aut)
mobilo business so far back in its {)-
‘ancy that hie immediate friends a)!

ught it wae the first sign of {nciplen:
insanity called upon me a few days ag
and made a proposition to the city of
New York to construct ten hangars tipon
the waterfront, which he agreed to leasa
at a subsiantial rental for twenty vear:,
in order to put into active operation an
airplane service between
Philadelphia and Boston. T do not know
what the city fathers wiil say to me
about my sanity when I recommend th's
thing, but T am going to recommend }t

“There is just one point of difference
between the proposer and myself and
that j@ as to the desirability of the loca-
tion. He had not taken into accoun’,
as I must, the fact that you have got
to be a little bit particular in landing ‘>
a hydroairplane in the congested section
of New York harbor, and [I want {¢ 1
can to induce him to set up these han-
gars at a point where the water is deep
enough for their accommodation but not
deep enough for competition on the part
of old fashioned boats that stay on *)
water all the time until they sink.”

Mr. Hulbert urged the creation of a
“free zone’ here where {mporta could
be stored without payment of custoins
charges and declared that euch a system
was necessary for the commercial deve
opment of the port.

Other speakers were the Rev Warren
Giles, pastor of the First Reformed
Church at Orange, N. J., and Major Tan
Hay Beith of the British army, author
of “The First Hundred Thousand.”
