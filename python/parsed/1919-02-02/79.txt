« There is a world of pathos in that
tword “missing.” Whereag the word
“killed” in the official reports means
athat the officer or soldier in queetion
has had his body interred in duly
marked and oft consecrated ground
by his comrades, the word “missing”
leaves the bereaved relatives in doubt

The Allies lent themselves to every |

endeavor to relieve the anxieties of
relatives of their captives by furnish-
ing information through King Alfonso,
through the Vatican and through
Gustav Ador at Geneva (now Presi-
dent of Switzerland). The Germans
sought to add to the frightfulness of
their methods of war by withholding
any such information.

The London Times and other Eng-
lish, French and Itallan papets are
filled with -advertisements in ° “which
parents and wives entreat for news of
“missing” eons and husbands of whom
all trace has been lost e{nce the sum-
mer of 1914. These advértisements
abound during and subsequent to
every international conflagration, and
it would scarcely be belleved that even
to this day the London gimes atill
prints advertisements asking for news
of British officers who have been
“missing” since the Boer war, nineteen
years ago.
