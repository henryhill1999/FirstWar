“Edgewater People”

By DOROTHY SCARBOROUGH.
GEWATER PEOPLE, by Mary E.
Wilkins Freeman, is an interesting

and well written collection of shori stories,
but it is searcely one of Mrs. Freeman’s
best books. The stories possess the quiet-
ness, the leisured ease, the analytic char-

 

 

- acter drawing that we have long enjoyed

in her New England studies but they have

Jess of the drafhatic than some of her

work. The effect here is a bit too leis-
urely.

In the present volume Mrs. Freeman
‘writes of four villages, to show that places
as well as people exist subject to “change,
increase, final dissolution,” that they have
character, complex but still individual.
She wishes to represent these four vil-
Jages, sub-divisions of one former small
village, as a fourfold individual standing~
out against .a rural background. The
author's thfeme as sct forth in the foreword
is that the strongly rooted fan.ilies of the
locality have impressed their individ-
uality on their environment, so that the

. life is in a fashion patriarchal; but the

reader does not receive a definite impres-
sion differing from that given by Mrs.
Freeman’s other village stories.. Some of
the characters here are Jess simple and a
shade less vital than in her earlier vol-
umes.

The Reng With a Green Stone, for in-
@tance, seems a “made” story rather than
a record of real life, not beeause of the
element of the unexplainable im it, but be-
cause the characters appear mechanical
In comparison with this Sour Sweetings
and The Soldier Man have distinet veri-
similitude. Mrs. Freeman seems certainly
at her best in writing of people with
strong New England eccentricities of
brain and temper, with the idiosyncrasies
of warped prejudices. The nearer she ap-
proaches the conventional in her char-
acters the less individua] her work is.
Sophia Ludd in The Soldier Man, with
her intense and crafty egoism, her subtly
concealed obstinacy, who sits with folded
hauds yet dominates the lives about her
with Jadylike brutality, is unforgettable.

THE SUN, SUNDAY,

 

The domineering mother in Sour Swert-
ings, with her courteous atrocities goward
her daughter-in-law, is almost Sophia
Ludd’s equal. Mrs. Freeman has au un-
canny power of depicting selfish middle
age tyrannizing over youth.

The war stories in the volume, The Liar
and Both Cheeks, are less impressive than
the studies of ordmary simple life, as The
Flowering Bush and The Old Man of the
Fields, where lovable, quaint old men are
pictured.

No writer in America has rendered the
short story more significant service than
has Mary E. Wilkins Freeman, who has
never lowered her. ideals, never cheap-
ened her ert for publicity or money, but
has steadfastly maintained her high stan-
dards of sincerity both in substance and
in form.

The ease and quiet humor of Mrs. Free-
man’s style may be suggested by a pas-
sage like the beginning of Sarah Kdge-
water :

‘Dorena went out of the room. She went
airily, leaving a trail of sirong perfume,
her first minor assertion of real emanci-
pation, and Sarah Edgewater realized that
the beginning of the end, which she had
secretly dreaded for years, had come.

‘Dorena had given notice. -

“She had given it regretfully, even
emotionally, She was too much like her
mother, who had lived and died in the
service of the Edgewater family, not to
feel misgivings at leaving her ‘Miss
Sarah.’ But Dorena was in love with a
handsome young man as light colored as
she and he was insistent.

“«Pd rather be daid than tell po’ Miss
Sarah,’ Dorena had wailed—but she had
told her.”

Mrs. Freeman’s pholasophic comments on
character are suggestive and illuminating,
as for instance what she says in connec-
tion with Old Man Edgewater:

“People as well as flowers escape from
gardens and legitimate environments.
They stroll, either from perversity or idle
wantonness, outside palings and specified
abiding places and remain outside through
the generations. No particuiar stigma at-
taches to them for so doing. The birth
bar is not sinister, simply mildly differ-
ential . . . Old Man Eli Edgewater
of the present day wms like a small, no
account sprout from the grand old family
root.”

“The Crimson Alibi’
and “Room Number 3’’

oo stories are starting the

new year very well indeed. At
least those who pick up Octavus Roy
Cohen's The Crimson Abbi will be pretty

sure to think so. Three evening hours
may be agreeably dedicated to its perusal.
The identity of the murderer of old
Joshua Quincy is not diselosed until page
272—and that is only thirteen pages from
the end of the book itself. Perhaps we
ought not to say this; weakly curious per-
Sons may turn to page 272 immediately.
If so they are bound to be disappointed.
They will not understand what they find
there without having accompanied David
Carroll, detective, through all the sur-
prises that have gone before.

Mr. Cohen has written an unusual and
extremely puzzling tale. He treats his
reader exactly as the murderer treated
David Carroll; and both reader and de-
tective are pretty well disarmed in their
quest for the criminal. The difficulty—
one difficulty—in solving the murder of
Jbshua Quincy was the number of persons
who had strong motives for killing him.
Mr. Cohen handles this phase of the story
skilfully and he is particularly good at ex-
ploding a surprise at the end of every
chapter.

Koom Number 3 was first published in
1913 under the title Masterpieces of Mys-
tery. It is a colicction of nine suort
stories of crime detection by Anna Kath-
arine Green. Thev vary in length and
merit, but all will engage the reader.
There is not much to say about the book
except that any one who lkes mystery
stories will Lke these, or most of them.
