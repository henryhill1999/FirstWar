Could Have Lower Rates Even

Than Ontario Towns—
Cheaper Money Needed

 

By ROBERT G. SKERRETT.
HE continued Industrial su-
premacy of the State of New
York depends upon a suffi-
ciency of motive energy. New York's
ability to hold its own commercially
with foreign competitors is going to
hinge, in the last analysis, upon an
abundance of relatively cheap me-

chanical power,

The general public may not be
aware of it, but we had a pretty close
squeak a few months back at tie

height of the war's demanas upon
our manufactories. Not only were
many plants either closed or very

much curtailed, due to a deficiency in
eVailable energy, but our Common-
wealth was crippled, actually denied
the chance to do its productive ut-
most, simply because it was physi-
cally impossible to supply the State
with all the coal required.

During the hearings last summer in
Washington upon the Emergency
Power Bill the engincering experts
revealed the disquieting fact that a
considerable section of New York
State—the eastern portion of it—lay
right in the so-called congested power
district. Difficulties of rail transpor-
tution of fuel were the crux of the
problem.

warranted in thinking

growth in power installations ranges |

from 10 to 12 per cent. Eight years
ago the total power installations in
New York State aggregated substan-
tially 5,500,000 horse power, and the
laily consumption of energy, upon a
toad factor of 40 per cent. was 2,200,-

laid upon the existing plants,
could not support it,
sulting in the main from the inter-
rupted flow of fuel from the mines.

Our industrial success hereafter will
be determined in large measure by
the degree to which we make our-
selves independent of coal as a pri-
mary source of power. That Is to say,
we must draw upon our falling waters
to a much greater extent than hitherto
and in this way generate energy
a form that can be distributed broad-
cast without the railroads. Happily
for us, New York State is in a posi-
tion to develop some hundreds of thou-
sands of horse-power in hydro-electric
energy, and, to just that extent, to
speed up our industrial activities with-
out adding a pound to our fuel needs.

The question is by no means new.
Time and again the subject has been
discussed from various angles, and in
varying moods, by the State Legis-
lature. But only now has the situa-
tion become. sufficiently critical to
promise remedial legislation. Even 60,
the full fruit of the present agitation
will be garnered only if the general
public takes an active interest, and
does its part in seeing to it that we
utilize promptly and to the full all
the water power resources at our dis-
posal.

Text Books Improved 100 Yrs. Ago

A certain originality in textbook

making began to show itself early in|

the nineteenth century. The influence
of French mathematics began to re-
model American textbooks of mathe-
matics and American teaching of
mathematics about 1840, while German
university methods of research began
filtering in through the barriers of
distance and language about 1859,
rapidly growing dnto a veritable flood,

“So true was this that when the
American university movement took
ape in the organization of Johns
Hopkins University at Baltimore in
175-6 and for some time afterward
German university methods were taken
as the model to be followed, From that
time 1914 the relationship between
America-and the German universities
was much closer than that between
American untyersities and higher in-
stitutions anywhere else, England in-
cluded,

“This intimacy of relationship will
no longer be a factor to be reckoned
with. From now on the strong ties
will be those which hind the American
university to like institutions in Eng-
land, France and Italy.

it is entirely feasible to draw 2,000,000
more horse-power from the Niagara
River, below the Falls, half of which
would be on the New York State side
of the stream; that an additional 200,-
000 or 300,000 horse-power could be
tapped from the river above the Falls
without seriously damaging their
scenic beauty; {hat 500,000 horse-
power could be had from the St. Law-

foregoing:
“The cost

of money, displaying itself

factor in the cost of hydro-electric |
power, precisely as the price of fuel,

with its accompaniment of expense, de-
termines the cost of steam power. The
cost of money in this country, on a
strictly commercial basis, is high. The
prevailing rate of interest demanded of
waterpower developments is around 7
or 8 per cent... whieh with discounts
taken into consideration normally
‘means a demand amounting to 9 or 10
per cent. on the working proposition.

“Estimate after estimate, the coun-
try over, has gone to show that only
