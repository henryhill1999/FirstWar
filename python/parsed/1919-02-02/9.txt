Mr Whistler, himself, were he here

second look.

A little touch here, the straightening
of a line there, the bringing of a fender

walnut dash before you as you sit at the
wheel, the strength lent by putting the
gas tank in the rear, the multiplication
of bonnet vents, the adding of three
more painting coats, the increased thick-
ness of the seat cushions—these, though
but a few of the many changes made,—
show the tendency of the new beauty.
