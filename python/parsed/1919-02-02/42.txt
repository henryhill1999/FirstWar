PRINTER’S SUCCESSFUL GARDEN PLAN A GOOD ONE TO FOLLOW

In the spring of 1918, spurred to the] peas and string beans!

I forgot the

effort by Government urging and the backaches, the hot sun and numerous

example of many of my neighbors, I
planned a “war garden” on a@ plot ap-
proximately 40 by 50 feet near where
1 live in Flatbush, The soil was in
poor shape, the place having been more
or less of a dumping ground for years,
but ag the weeds grew as high as a
man's head I figured there must be
some virtue left in that bit of earth if
one had the perseverance to bring it
out. “Nick,” the ice man, tackled the
jub with his horse and plough, but suc-

blisters in contemplation of results,

We kept a very conservative record
of the returns from the garden, al-
ways putting prices well below those
of the pedlers and green grocers. The
following table accounts only for vege-
tables consumed at once or canned
and makes no allowance for surplus
amounts of various kinda handed over
the fence to neighbors who were |
sceptical at first, but afterward be- |
came appreciative:

I believe I would have given up more |
than once if it were not for the idea
that in this way I was “doing my bit.”

It will not be necessary to submit
a chronological statement of the plant-
ing, for I give a rough chart of the
garden. I wish to call attention to the
fact that it {s possible to obtain more
than one crop from the same ground:

plants could be set out on July 19;
beets followed onion sets; lettuce suc-

small place somewhere to sow a bit of
radish or transplant more lettuce.

There were many disappointments
and the green aphis were especially
troublesome. I lost the early blos-
poms from my tomatoes before I knew
what was the matter. The pests got
cn everything, seemingly having no
particular choice. One could turn over
f& radish leaf or a turnip leaf and
there they were—as thick as pins in
a pin cushion and about the same
size.

I want to say just a word in com-
parison of vegetables fresh from the
garden and those from the huckster's
wagon: There isn't any comparison.

POTATO IN MILLER’S GAR-
DENER’S DICTIONARY.

In the edition of “Miller's Gardener's |
Dictionary,” edited by Thomas Mar-
tyn, professor of bot#ny in the Uni-
versity of Cambridge, published in two
parts of two volumes each. London.
1807, a large number of solanums are
listed.

It states that: “The name of this
family, solanum, was given by Pliny
and others, although the derivation
is uncertain. Some derive it from So!
the sun. Others say it ts Sulanum,
from sus, being supposed to be of ser-
vice {n disorders of swine; both con-.!
Jectures are improbable. |

“The potato, now so generally cultl-
vated {n Europe appeared at the end
of the sixteenth century, as a curiosity |
{in botanic gardens. Gerarde (in 1597) |
informs ts that he received roots of {t
from Virginia, otherwise called Nor-
embega, which grew and prospered in

 

 

his garden as in their own native
country. He calls ft Poteto of America
or Virginia to distinguish {t from the
Spanish potato (Convolvulius Batatas)
which was then much hetter

and called exclusively potatoes, pota

tus or potades, from the S;
Batata.

shire gentleman, recommending the
planting of potatoes in all parts of|
the kingdom to prevent famine. This |
was referred to a committee, and in|
consequence of their report Mr. Buck-|
land had the thanks of the society;
such members as had lands were en-
treated to plant them, and Mr. Evelyn!
was desired to mention the proposal
at the close of his Sylva.

“I do not find that this truly pa-
triotic gentleman complied with this
desire, or that he has mentioned the
potato, except In the appendix to his |
‘Actaria,’ where he says that the!

the fruit, to Vienna in the beginning
of the year 1588, and the year foliow-
ing @ @rawing of a branch with the

“Lister in his journey to Paris
December 10,1698) informs usthat the
potato was then scarcely to be found
in the French markets, which was s0
great a relief to the pecple of Eng-
land: but there was store of Jerusalem
artichokes; which root seems to have
been almost as commonty cultivated

in England at the end of the sixteenth }-

and beginning of the seventeenth cen-
tury as the Virginia potato has been
in the eighteenth

“It was cultivated in France about
the year 1742, but in 1749 it was
treated with great contempt both in
the country and at Paris and left
wholly to the lower people. After-
wards, however, it became quite the
fashion for a time and then fel! again
into disrepute. In 1771 M. Fai suet} |
presented to the Academy of Sciences |
a loaf of bread made of wheat, rie and}
potatoes in equal quantities, In 1778
M. Parmentier made bread of potatoes
only.

“The potato made its fortune in}
Germany much sooner. Bread is said}
to have been made with it there so
early as 1731. I saw it cultivated in
the open flelds of Suabia in 1780.

“In Italy the potato has never heen

England some years since to Naples,

They have, however, since grown,

at least in the northern veil
of that country.

“The most probable account seems |
to be that the celebrated and much
to be lamented Sir Walter Raleigh
first introduced this very useful root
into Ireland on his return from Vir-
ginia in 1684.

“In Holt’s characters of the Kings
and Queens of England 1s an apocry-
phal account of Sir Walter's mistak-
ing the fruit for the part that was to!
be eaten, and despairing of its ac-
“| quisition upon finding that to be un-,
palatable; but that he afterwards dis-,
covered the root to be grateful and,
nourishing, on ordering the ground to
be turned over.

“It is generally agreed that the
potato quickly passed over from Ire-
land into It
