German Physician Asked Analy-
sis Required Before Put-

HIS SERUM

Wasuincton, March 8,—-Government
authorities have become sceptical of
the efficacy of the Friedmann tubercu-

losis treatment as a cure as the result of |
confidential reports that have reached |
them from official representatives in|
Berlin and from a prominent Western |
surgeon who witnessed the clinics on

formed by Dr. Friedmann in New
last Thursday, This surgeon came to
Washington to-day expressly to report
to the authorities

York

 

on the treatment as

he saw it administered
While the Berlin reports are under-
stood to be before the Public Health |
Service authorities neither denials nor
confirmation of their existence could
be obtained to-night. |
It was sald that the Public Health

Service holds it to be its duty fully to
investigate the alleged cure on its mer-
Its, regardless of reports of its failure
or success, and in the meantime will
withhold reports which might prejudice
the public mind and do Dr. Friedmann
an injury in case the tests which are to
be conducted in Washington prove suc-
cessful.

 

 

 

 

The Public Health Service, accord-
ingly will occupy in relation to Dr
Friedmann the position taken by the
Royal Geographical Society of Hel-
gium in the investigation of Dr. Mred-
erick Cook's claims that he had dis-
covered the north pole. That society
rejected Dr. Cook's claims

The Public Health Service has been
; Hterally swamped by appli ms of
persons from all parts of the country
to be first to obtain the Friedmann
treatment, and inquiri s have come
;} from medical societies and private
practitioners from all parts of the
world seeking Information on the re-
sults of this Government's Inyvistiga
tion

While the merits of the Friedmann
cure may be a matter of oj mn be.
tween medical scientists, t! German
doctor may continu» to treat patients
even in case the Public Health Service
experiments should | prove disappoint-
ing. but Dr. Friedmann’'s = supposed
cure is being put to an “acid” test by
the Government to prove that the “se-
rum is neither harmful nor dangerons
