The Chicago Interior's story of the crime
of the Forty Cocktails is too thin. A lady,
“an intimate friend of the Fairbanks fam-
ily,” came into the dining room where the
feast was spread for President RoosEvet,
noticed and deplored the absence of cock-
taile, ordered a crew of the miscreants to
be sent from her husband's club. Mr.
Farrvanns, like a chivalrous gentleman,
will not blame a woman. He suffers in
silence.

Mr. FAIRBANKS must be very weary of his
friends, who are finding excuses for what is
nobody's business but his own, It seems
strange that a man who extends «so far into
free air and space should be so hampered and
tied down. Mr. RoosrveLtt could quench
his thirst from a “growler” on the steps of
a W.C. T. U. clubhouse and he would gain
friends and votes by it. Whereas Mr.
Farrsanks can’t have cocktails, although
he drinks none, in his house without being
nipped by all the geese of gossip. So runs
the world away.

North Carolina's statutory provisions are

daily indicted and convicted for violating
the penal clause in the law and sentenced to
the cell or the chain gang.

To avoid these inevitable inflictions the
railway company. a foreign corporation,
exercised its constitutional right, under the
Constitution which the State of North Caro-
lina ratified in solemn assembly, by appeal-
ing to the Circuit Court of the United States
having competent jurisdiction of the dual
questions—of law and equity—instead of
appealing to the State court, which had no
jurisdiction.

Section 2 of Article IIT. provides that the
inferior Federal courts shal) have jurisdiec-
tion over all c@ses in law and equity in con-
troversies between a State and a citizen of
another State and between citizens of differ-
ent States. In the Alabama case this con-
stitutional provision strictly applied, but the
railroad company was threatened with ex-
tinction for removing the case in which its
constitutional rights were involved. Here
also the offending railroad was a foreign
corporation.

In the North Carolina case the suit was
instituted by: the railway company, net
against the State of North Carolina but
against certain of the State officials and all
other persoos--excepting no “person,” but
not naming the Executive. The State had
no interest in the property question. It
would neither gain nor lose any revenue
whatever by the enforcement or the failure
of the legislative enactment in controversy:
The Supreme Court has clearly established
the legal proposition that a suit to restrain
State officiala from enforcing or executing
a law is not a suit against the State. The
charge that this sult was an attack upon
State -sovereignty ia not - sustained, It

for their excellent wervice. Nevertheless,
the fact remains—and it wae this which
the article explained in detail—that the
traveller who accepts the guide's proposi-
tion to pay $10 a day for each person, all
expenses included, for the excursions
around Naples, will give about twice as
much as he will if he settles all the bills
himeelf and hands the guide merely his
daily fee.

Well, in some cities those horse flogging
drivers would not have been arrested, much
less punished. Asa matter of fact, the in-
spiration of Henny Beran and the. inde-
fatigable labors of his successors have
created euch a tender feeling for the horse
among the people of New York that no man
can abuse his beast without running the
riek of instant arrest. The horse ie really
well cared for and protected in New York.

cle III. provides that in all cases in which
a State is a party the Supreme Court has
original jurisdiction. After the Icarian
flight, however, we find the apostles of State
rights in the arena below, patiently submit-
ting to the ponderous routine of procedure,
first before a referee for the finding of fact;
secondly, in the trial of the case on the
master's report in an inferior Federal court;
thirdly, in a final hearing upon the whole
record of law and fact before the Supreme
bench taking appellate jurisdiction!

The Legislature of North Carolina en-
acted the law in controversy, to take effect
July 1, 1907. In that assembly the rail-
roads doing business in the State were
arraigned and tried ex parte. They were
not invited to present facts nor to give
information pértinent to the discussion.
As in the Alabama Legislature, they were
adjudged guilty of practising extortion
upon citizens of thé State by imposing
unreasonable charges for passenger and
freigh® service and transportation; and a
rate law was passed and approved by the
Executive reducing the passenger rate for
intrastate travel from 3% to 2% cents a
mile. The rate law also reclassified com-
modities and reduced the freight tariffs.
The railroads in their complaints in the
courts sought to show that the law.was un-
constitutional because it confiscated their
just and reasonable earnings over their
expenses. The Constitution of the United
States declares that no State shall pass
a law impairing the obligation of con-
tracts. To revoke the charter of a rail-
road in Alabama is to prevent the fulfil-
ment of obligations undertaken by it under
contracts with citizens of Alabama and of
othér States. The action attempted by the
Governor of Alabama is face to face with the
expreas provision in her State atitu-
tion that the forfeiture of a charter is the
province of the courts, and that no person
or collection of persons, being one of the
three coordinate departments of her State
Government, shall exercise any power
properly belonging to either of the others;
and that the State cannot interfere with the
contracta of foreign corporations with
ditisene.

Likewise the Constitution of North Caro-
lina, declares that the legislative, judicial
and executive powers of the State Govern-

is

by innumerable suits for damages for al- |

heen attempted, some of the things that

that may be done by individual .
through their respective Lggisiatures, courts
and Executives:

A railroad traverses Georgia, crosses into
Alabama and enters Mississippi. It is
doing bysinese with citizens, under con-
tract and otherwise, and carrying citizens
from and to and between various States
of the Union. Under State statute or al-

doing business in the State. If it obeys
under strese it breaks its contracts and
forfeits ite business; ite stockholders are in-
jured or ruined; the United States mails are
halted; shippers and consignees of freight
are damaged or ruined; the business of the
country is more or less deranged.

Citizens of a State with political designs
procure the enactment ef confiscatory rate
laws and geek their enforcement to the point
of actua) (threatened) conflict with United
States Marshals or Federal soldiery. Some
time there i® quite certain to be a collision,
and then more collisions.

In the meanwhile the. railroads are har-
assed by suits, oppressed by hostile and
extortionate State legislation; bullied by
communities which they serye and whose
passions and resentments have been stirred
to the point of action by demagogic agita-
tors; suffer loss after loss, along with their
real patrons, without relief and without
remedy; their credit is impaired by confis-
catory State rate laws so that they can no
longer borrow money and can therefore no
longer increase their transportation facili-
ties. The railroads are thus made the foot-
ball of political schemers and mercenary
speculators.

It seems to the writer that the ultimate
consequence of State aggression and op-
pression of railroads must force an inter-
pretation of the Federal Constitution
whereby the Interstate Commerce Com-
mission will absolutely control all the rail-
roads operating in two or more States, the
State railroad commiasions to be subor-
dinate. To continue to tolerate present
conditions is gradually to alienate capital
from railroad support until the service be-
comes decrepit; and to stagnate, especially
in the Southern States, the commercial,
menufacturing and agricultural intereste
there, which are even now clamoring for
better and greater railroad facilities.

Sugerstion to MedMiesome (Citizens.

To tae Eprron or Tur Sux— Sir: What
shall be said of a people that, enjoying univer-
sal suffrage, with all power to make and un-
make laws, elects, largely by sale of votes or
influenced by petty personal advantagé, only
State and national legislators and officials who
throw every obstacle in the way of develop-
ment until it shall be overcome by bribery
and deter such development by every form of
blackmail; and, when a few enter, ing men
have accomplished great undertakings, add-
ing a thousandfold to the advantages of that
people, turns upon these men and denounces
and vilifies them and still further restricts in
every possible way their usefulness?

I say such a people is actuated by anvy and
malice and is a nation of hy ites. 1 offer
to this people the suggestion of an interreg-
num of five years of minding each his own
business and reforming himself.

The Virtues of Mr. Reckefetler.

To Tur Eprron or Tae Sun—Sir: A few years
ago my wife and I were boarding at the same house
with John 1). Rockefeller In Morristown, N. J,
where he was staying at the time to benefit some
throat affection, I believe. One of his keen enjoy-
ments was applies, and he went to much trowble tn
Obtaining cholce varieties, of which he always kept
a supply in his own room, and courtcousiy urged
my wife to indulge in them freely during bigabsence
In town and to Invite the others to do go.

He went Into the city as regularly as any com-

muter, and In his walk down to the stailon fre-
quently asked me to join him; and when I wished
to. leave on the train, so that he could have the
Opportunity to meet other men with whom he
might wish to discuss business matters, as ours
was only a slight acquaiatance, he invariably in-
sisted on my remaining. :
* One little experience was an instance of his feel-
ings of detlcacy for others. It was before they
had the general system of street car transfers in
New York, and both happening to be going uptown
we took a crosatown car from the Christopher
street ferry, on which | pald the fare, and when
we changed to the Siath avenue car be paid it.

Just these constant evidences of Mr. Rocketel-
lor’s entire lack of ostentation and evident desire
to appear in no way able to do or have more than
the other guests made them admire bim.. It ts
hard mot to beileve in the sincerity and honest,
upright dealings of a man with such gentle and
kingly courtesy, and though I have never met him
since, it is a pleasure to give this slight tribute to
one who is now undergoing harsh criticism. No
doubt many, many others could tell of innumerable
experiences of this gentieman's genticmantiiness,
entirely aside from his goodness and generosity.

A Paritan Sentence.

To Tas Epttoa or Tag SUN-Sir; I send you an
eatract from a London magazine which is Inter-
esting as bearing on our new law on the subject.

New York, October 11.

From the Political Magazine, November, 1787>

Whatever was the custom of ancient time, or the
propriety of the thing Itself, it does not appear
that tbe crime of adultery now provokes the igno-
miny of public punishment anywhere but in Amer-
fea. The following is an exact copy of an American
paragraph in » Heston newspaper:

“ At the Supreme Judicial Court held at Worces-
ter, lobabod Hayward and Patience Twitchell were
convicted of the crime of adultery and received

*‘wentence ‘as fol'ows:

“ Hayward to sit one hour on the gallows with
& rope about his neck, one end thereof cast over.
the gallows, to be publicly whipped on the naked
back tWirty stripes and suffer three months im-
prisonment. Patience Twitchell, to ait one hour
on the gallows, with a rope about her neck also one
end thereof cast over the gallows and to be pub-
licly whipped twenty stripes on ber bare back.”

This sentence was titerally executed in the
presence of 4 gentieman just arrived from America,
and ag it bappened to be the first circumstance of
tye kigd an innumerable quantity of people were
assembled. The culprita were both young and
handsome and by no means in low station of life.

Defence of Business Morals.

To Tar Eprror or Tae Sun— Sir: Business men
are, as a class, scrupulously honest. I have moved
among them continuously for nearly forty years
and have found this to be a fact. The very nature
of their occupation develops the principles of hon-
esty and fair dealing. Like truthfulness with the
mathematician, honesty with the business man be-
comes a second naluse.

Does Mr. Conway tmagine that profit taking is
essentially @ishonest? If so, he ts wofully mis-
taken. It would be Interesting to know, by the
way, how he bimeeff makes his itving. Perhaps
he has inherited sufficient weaith to be beyond
the necessity of engaging im this “fundamentally,
radically dishonest” business. Or mayhap he ts
a “laboring man,” employed by some obnosious
“business man,” part of whose Iii gotten gains he
rabeltiously accepts in the ahape of wages.

ory is more interesting, to our mind, than
the part which deals with Lord Jack afte:
he had thrown over the didtasteful buminess
of being a peer and had settied himself in
California for the purpose of trying his hand
at American politics, Isabel was a Uali-
(she was mistreas of a great ranch
. on which she raised armies of white
chickens), and eo it was natural
she, too, should live in California and
natural that she and Jack should see

iscover that it amounts to very

iy remote, of course) and there was
Spanish in their blood, but if there had
not been any, or if it had been there and the
fact had been concealed, we are sure that
reader would have liked Jack and Isabel
| just as well,

Jack did not find when he came over
that he was prepared to like America imme-

of her native land, asked him, of course,
the great American question. His reply
was: “I hate Y! Washington is a crude,

leums for people go old and so dried up

tion. There is nothing picturesque in those
old towns, for they were dead before thev
were civilized. Some of the cities and
villages of the South are certainly attrac-

sort, but they are as lifeless as their negroes.
The cities of the West are hives, and when

the Sen Francieco earthquake occurred
Jack was considerably interested. It is
notieeable that this earthquake is treated
| with moderation in Mrs. Atherton's account.
