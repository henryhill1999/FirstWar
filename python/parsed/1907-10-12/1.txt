Vr Porker paid bie reepeote sharply
to John P Keeney of Woburn, chairman

@ the Pemoeratic State commitiae. for
his failure to put the negative on the qnees-
tien of electing Kiley temporary chair-

man of the Springfield convention. In
acornf)! tones. and looking straight at
Faeney he declared that he (Feeney) had

then and there. in base betrayal of his duty

yention
hody to the lawless elementa in front of
him

Atterney Mayberry opened for Bartlett.

Re insisted that the commiasion limit the
hearing strictly tothe same rules of evidence
that govern court procedure. The question
before the commission waa not how any
delegate might possibly have voted had he
got into Lhe convention but how those dele-
gates whe actually got in did vote. Mr
Mayberry had a word to say about an unfair
press, and declared that now and for the
first time the Bartlett men have an oppér-
tunity to get their side of the controversy
before the public. He contradicted Park-
er's contention that Feeney had refused to
putethe negative on the question of electing
Kiley temporary chairman of the conven-
tion. He declared that Feeney did call for
the nays and that there were very few.

Chairman Cunningham said that the cer-
tificate of nomination which had been filed
first should take precedence in testimony
and proof according to the usual custom.
Whitnev’s certificate was filed October 7
at 0:05 A. M. and that of Bartlett at 0:37
A. M. This practically puts the burden
of proof on the Bartlett men.

After the chairman had read the severai
proteéts against the Bartlett and Whitney
ticketa counsel for both sides asked who
was to appear in the case, and E. Gerry
Brown said he was to appear for himself
to protest both tickets as illegal because
. claimed that no convention had been

e

Attorney Parker stated what he thought
were the substantial grounds upon which
the Whitney contest rested. He said that
not only the facts of the Springfield ogn-
vention ought to be Brought out, but also |
facts of the past which had their bearin
on that incident. He said that he intendec
to show that the majority of the delegates
at Springfield were supporters of Mr. Whit- |

i ee --

"lWe shall introduce evidence to thie |
effect,” he said, “which will of no
ather conclusion on your part than that
there was a conspiracy.” ,

Mr. Parker said that he would show in
evidence that for many years the Demo-
eratic State committee had ——
what means the delegates should be ad-
mitted to the convention.

“The State committee this year provided
lawful) credentials to the legates,” he
said. “It would appear that the credentials |
this year have the words ‘this entitles dele- |

to admission to the convention hall.”
his committee never did anything to |
revoke that authority, but set to work
through machination and manifest breach
af trust a scheme to favor a certain candi- |

« .

. Parker declared that he would show
that Mr. Kiley bad certain ticketa printed
which alone would entitle admission to the
hall and that these tickets were in the pos-
session and control of Mr. Kiley, and that
1 were distributed to those who were
in the secret that a emall minority were to
pack the convention next morning.

“Mr. Kiley distributed the red tickets,
badges of his menials. As the delegates of
demanded entrance they were told they
roust fall into line and get their tickets
at the window. At the theatre box office
the delegate was obliged to surrender the
credentials he carried. it was then scru-
tinized by men who were not legally
mmembers of the Democratic committee.
“We claim that if a delegate who had a
t to enter that hali was refused ad- ;
the convention was illegal, void in
Jaw and in fact as well.
Mr. Parker called as his first witness John
. Coulthurst of Boston, sec of the
ratic State committee, to submit the
records of the meetings of that body. Then
ex-Congressman McNary, a Whitney man |
member of the State committee, was :
walled. He testified that in making the .
arrangements for the convention the custom
of ious years had not been followed. mg |
he selection of committers for the con-
vention had been left until the night before
and the naming of the officers and commit-
tees had been delegated to a committee of
five Bartlett men. When the Whitney men
endeavored to secure recognition of the ,
convention committees they n
voted down
Mr. McNary was on the stand when the'
hearing was adjourned until to-morrow ,

In introducing the guest of the day Con-
aul-Genera! Koiche referred to him aa one
who had been making a special study of
difficult problems for the benefit of his
Government and who had endeavored to
aee conditions in the West with the most
optimistic epirit. Mr. Ishii had nothing to
report to hie Government, said the Coneul-
General, that would bear out in any de-
gree the jingo apprehension of further
trouble between the two countries.

Mr. Ishii replied in quaint English. His
brief address embodied the only official
statement of his mission that he cared to
give ta N@® Yorkers, he said. He would
apeak plainly.

“I have made an extensive tour through
the United States,” said
agen “and I haye come through it with

where heen assured by American gentie-
men that the Japanese people are quite
| welcome in this country, and almost every~
| where I have witnessed the most cordial
relations between Americans and my
| countrymen.
“I have oome to the conclusion
| where is no conflict of interesta be-

| gween
the Americans the two peoples ought to
ow oloser in friendship and cordiality,
wever hard some of the hoodlum ele-
ment have tried to stir up trouble. It seems
to-me that the skill and diligence of the
Japanese is peculiarly well suited to go
| along side by sid® with the capital, the in-
| fluence and the enterprise of you Ameri-
cans. For that reason | feel so thoroughly
optimistic for the future.”

When sy ~ f of the Treasury Leslie
M. Shaw was called upon he put the com-
pany in good humor with aome simplified
jokes which even the Japanese could under-
stand. Then he let drop a very gmail fly
| inthe ointment. It was such a little fly that

Stanmnont, La, Oct. 1. ~ Uneucesseful
in his aearch for hear near Stamboul the
President hae decided to leave here on
Sunday and moge southward about forty
five miles, where camp will be cetabliaherdt

in Tensas parish, not far from Newellton.

The two guides who have been trying to
put a bear in the path of the President are
sutivfied thas there are none in the upper
Tensas region, no matter how many there
may have been beforé the arrival of the dis-
tingulghed hunter.

After five daye in the cane brakes the
President not onf? has had no opportunity
to killa bear, but he has not even seen one.
Once or twice it was thought that the dogs
had fouhd a treil, but pursuit proved un-

i availing. Some tracks of Mr. Bruin were

found, but aceording to the opinion of the
experienced hunters they were old, and
Ben Lilley believes that the extensive
preparations which were made for the
President's coming, such as cutting paths
through the cane, must have frightened
the bears away. r

Accordingly, when the President left
the camp directly weat of here early this
morning he had decided not to return.
The day was spent in hunting bobcats near
Dear Lake, ten miles to the south. The
President and his . with the exoep-
tion of John M. Parker and the negro hunter,
Brutus Jacksoy, will spend to-night and

| to-morrow at a clubhouse on the lake and

come into Stamboul Sunday morning.

Mr. Parker came in from the camp thie
morning to make arrangements to have the
President's special train brought here
Sunday morning, when the entire party
will bid good-by to Stamboul and next

| week the portable capitol will be located

near Newellton. To-morrow the horses
and camp effects will be brought in and
preparations will be made for the depar-

| ture from Stamboul.

Reports from Newellton are to the effect
that there are bears in the lower Tensas
and to verify this Mr. Parker telephoned to
some of his friends then and learned that

| within the last week sevegal bears had been

sighted a few miles from the town, One
report was to the effect that two good « -
mens had been seén crossing the railroad
track a short distance from the village, ap-
parently no more afraid of the slow moving
traing on the Iron Mountain road than they
are of the Presicent's rifle.

Brutus Jackson was aent on abead to-day
to select a site for the camp near Howellton
and to get things in readiness for the hunting

nus failure to get his prey. ing.nese regions
the President is determinea to make an-
other try. He is not satisfied with having
killed a buck and will count his hunting
trip more or less of a failure if he doesn’
succeed in getting a bear before his de-
parture from Louisiana.

Members of the party say that several deer
might have been taxen had itiey

gunnting. He came after bear, however

The people of Lake Providence’ and
Stamboul feel mighty bad over the failure
of the bear hunt, especially after they have
boasted so loudly that bears are aa thick
in East Carroll parish as dogs in an alley
