Weof Francois Rabelam that We Arthur
Tilley, in writing hie biography f the
“Brench Men of Letters” series i¢ to he

excused when he includes an analysis of

the Gargantua and Pantagruel to fill
out the volume. This serves to give the
reader unacqnainte! with French .some

it would have
ntented

idea of what Rabelais wrote
hwen better if Mr. Tilley
himaelf with a summary inst

niao the theories of modern

hat os
“cl of injecting
commentators

on what Rabelais meant There is plenty
of solid wisdom in Rabelais, as all who
read him know, anfl judicious commen-

taries showing contemporary events will

‘help to make him underst but it is
B® pretty solemn view thai presents him
ehiefy as ai reformer aud philosopher

Instead of putting stress on the qualities
for which men read him. Mr. Tilley is not
unappreciative of the fin and wit, but he
prefers fo turn.to more serious matters,
His book shows patient study of details
and much less grasp of essentials than the
previous volumes of the series

Tt is a thorough “appreciation” that Mr
Holbrook Jackson has written in ° Bernard
Shaw” (F.. Grant Richards; G, W. Jacobsand

Company'. [To an ingetuousiy burptious
preface he telis how he came to organize a
Shaw club in Leeds, after the fashion of

Browning clubs. Heegives a properly adu-
latory account of Mr. Shaw's life, and ven
tures on an explanation of him as a socialist
as a dramatist and as a_ philosopher
Whether Mr. Shaw will stand for this ex
position or not, it affords information to
those inoculated with the Shaw cult in suit-
ably reverent language

Despite the title and the author's im-

ressionistic method “The True Patrick
by George Morgan WJ. B. Lippin-
eott Company), is a readable book. The
epithet “true” arouses expectations
controversy. This the reader will hardly
find here. The author, to be sure, collects
various opinions, some from authorities,
othe®s from very second rate sources, and
puts them before the reader; he then selects
arbitrarily the one he prefers and goes
ahead as though it had been proved right
in some way. With his selection generally
there is no great fault to be found; he takes
that most favorable to the hero, andthe
reader will agreewithhim. Thechief faults
with his story are his wandering from the

Something more than refhifiscence is atp-
parent in Mr
the Make-believes” (Little, Bre .n and Com-
pany’. [The idea of the story is an expan-
sion of the philosophy of the Marchioness,
while the god in the machine is a blend of

Recles of “Ca " The story starts as a
fair imitation®f Dickens, for which we
might be gratetful, with modern sociological
touches, but with a number of queer people
who promise to be interesting. It turns
after a while, into a sort of burlesque of Mr.
Mallock'’s “Paul and Virginia,” with the

point on suppositions that he sets aside and |
bis digressions into the past and into sub- |

sidiary matters at the slightest temptation.
However interesting, they confuse the story
he is telling. For some strange reason Mr.
Morgan finds it necessary to apologize for
Patrick Henry's most famous speeches,
apparently because every well brought. up
American schoolboy is familiar with them.

Much material. for a life of “Dr. John
McLoughlin,” who ruled in Oregon when
Americans and British were tighting for
possession, will be found in the volume
written by Mr. Frederick V. Holman «(The
Arthur H. Clarke Company, Cleveland),
and perhaps seme day, when the author
has digested his material, he may write that
life. He tells us that having to deliver a
speech at the Portland exposition he started
in to study bis subject and has continued
hie studies since. His subdivisions show
admirable method in his researen and under
tach he finds some answer for each inquiry,
but the picture as a whole suffers from the
process. More familiarity with historical
style should induce Mr. Holman® to
eliminate himself and his personal opinions
from the narrative.

 

The Romance of Gentieness.

There is a temptation to hope that a
reaction has set in against mere adventure,
realistic squalor and fictitious pplitica
and sociology from the simultaneous pub-
lication of several pleasant stories that
Cescribe gentlefolk with their natural emo-
tions and the simple incidents in their
lives. They stand out in artistic work-
manship againat the glaring colora and
excess of energy of modern fashion and
will be found fully as interesting as the
offerings to the appetite for momentary
excitement. '

The most finished literary work that
Mr. ¥. Hopkinson Smith has turned out
yet w@ be found in “The Romance of an
Old Fashioned Gentleman” (Charles Scrib-
ner’s Sons). A pretty theme is developed
consistently and delicately and the author
stops when his story is told. Virtue is
rewarded at the end, a little too emphat-
ically it may be, and higher sentiment than
is probable is attributed to the stock market;
but that does not harm the story.

Another delightful study of New Eng-
land life is drawn by Mrs. Laura E. Richards
ju “Grandmother” (Daga Estes and Com-
pany). The ordeals of the heroine are
pitifully cruel, but they are described with
relentless logic, while the many persons
who surround her are photographs of a
fine civilization that is now little more
ban a memory, at least in the Fast.

, Pathos and bumor are blended naturally

pretty idea for his main plot and with the
skill in characterization he often shows, the
author should have written an exstrava-
ganza instead of a real story.

Three short religious tales by Mr, Arthur
Hoag Howland come to us in pamphict
form from the Nassau Publishing Company.
Spring Valley, N.Y. They are entitled * An
Artist,” “Saint and Sinner” and “The Cup
and the Book.” The form of publication
adopted seema better suited for distribution
among the author's friends than for attract
ing the attention of the general public.

A very slight humorous story by Mr. Owen
Wister, “Mother,” has been rescued from
anonymity by the author and is published
by itself (Dodd, Mead and Company). It
is amusing, but hardly justifies the elaborate
getup, for it belongs to the days before
Mr. Wister found himself.

The pretty pocket volume edition of
Anthony Trollope issued by Dodd, Mead
and Company progresses. The latest ad-
dition is “John Caldigate” in two volumes,
fourth in the series of “Manor House”
novels,

 

Hooks for Young Folks.

“Pegay., Betsy and Mary Ann” were
three happy little “every day girla” whose
last name was Perkins. Bell Elliott Palmer
has written all about them in such a simple
natural way that they do not seem like
story book paragons, but just the kind of
nice little girls that every one knows and
likes to read about. Their dolla and
picnics, their mischief and surprises, their
journey to Alabama will be entertaining
to all little girls who like to read booka,
The author has a quick, bright way of
telling her story and is very deft in intro-
ducing little moral lessons into her narra-
tive. The book is not great but it is whole-
some, “Peggy, Betsy and Mary Ann” is
published by D. Appleton and Company.

Another volume in the “Wee Winkles”
series by Gabrielle Jackson (Harpers)
called “Wee Winkles and Her Friends” de-
scribes the fairy schoolroom where Wee
Winkles studied under the idirection of her
remarkable bookmade mother. The ad-
venture of Wide Awake, Wee Winkles’
brother and his rescue by Jerry, the old
pie engine horse horse is also related to give
interest to the book for little boys as wellas
little girls, Of course there is a very bad
mother ia the story and a v@ry much abused
little girl to furnish the required contrast
to the ideal mamma who presided over the
big house where Wee Winkles enjoyed the
blissful children of book made little girls:
The purpose of the story is to instil love of
and kindness to animals.

“Flapdoodle, the stuff they feed fools on,”
is the chief characteristic of the juvenile
fiction of the day. When, therefore, an
author like Mary P. Wells Smith takes the
facta of the early history of this country
as a foundation for her tales of adventure,
in which young heroes figure, in which
old customs are described and old scenes
form the backgrounds, the books take on
a distinctive value. Mrs. Smith's new
series of stories is called “The Old Deer-
fleld Series,” and the latest volume added
to it, “Boys of the Border,” deals with the
period of the French and Indian War and
with the Rice family, who settled in the
wilderness west of Deerfield. Charles Dud-
ley Warner passed his boyhood in the
house standing on the site of Capt. Rice’e

are the attraction in “Nursery Rhymes |
from Mother Goose” (Charles Scribner's |
Sons). The comical smaller pictures ap-
peal to old and young alike and the very |
large full page pictures in colors are uni- |
formly good. The artist disregarda de- |

to insist, but the pursery will welcome |

The title of Mr. Charies Morria’s “Home
Life in All Lands” (J. B. Lippineott Com-
pany) ia somewhat misleading. The book
deals rather with ethnographical peculiari-
ties collected under various heads. One
chapter deals with food, others with dress,
with dwellings, with hunting, with per- |
sonal adornment and so forth, and in them
the oddities of foreign lands, of savage
peoples and of pastimes are described
