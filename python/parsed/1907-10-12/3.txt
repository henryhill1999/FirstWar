and O'Donnell went out to serve it They
found the clergyman and Mie. Baner at
the Sutton etree! parsonage The minister
turned pale when the Warrant Was ser ved
but he and Mire Bauer q kiv got inte the
coach and were taken yort, which thev
entered by a side door
The court proceedings were private
Me. Bauer said that be first beqgame sis
nicious several weeks ago. when he fonod

was taking frequent visits
to the parsoruege He tned to persuade
her to stay away from the clergyman
and the final result of his plea whe that his
wife left his home at 2 o'clock on Wednesday
morning and went to the parsonage taking
with ber, he said, $500 of his money

Bauer followed his wife soon afterwart
and tried to induce her to return home
W ben she vefused to listen to him and the
clergyman appeared to support her in her

that his wife

conduct, Mr. Bauer went to the home of
the Rev. Me. Walenta’s father, at 996 Graham
avenue. The elder Walenta has beeo

pastor of the German Emmanuel Reformed
«huren tor twenty-five years,

The elder Walenta went to his son's
parsonage as soon as he heard the facts,
and a stormy scene followed lt was
alleged in court that the young clergyman
told his father that he and the electro-
typer's wife were destined for each other
and that no human agency could part them
The attitude of both so disgusted the elder
Walenta that he took the action yesterday
which culminated ip the arrest of the pair

While the evidence was being given
against the couple they appeared to be
supremely happy, emaling at each other
frequently. ‘The elder Walenta was greatly
agitated. When the voung minister was
asked what he had to say to the charge
of barboring Mrs. Bauer against ber hus-
band's wishes, be sud

“Your Honor, | have an official room,
which is sometimes called the clergyman's
room. It is always open to the public.”

“All night?” asked the Magistrate

“Yes, sir, in case of emergency; It 1s Open

_ all night and it was in this room that this
lady waa welcomed with honor.”

Jalenta said that Mrs, Bauer had been
in the “official” room three times. He said
that when she finally came and told him
she had been estranged from her husband
he advised her to rake up chureh work

“I felt in Mrs, Bayer a living soul,” Wal-
enta went on to say, “and my own soul cried
out for some one who was alive in the twen-
tieth century. When T found her FE realized
that there was no sunshine in her home
and tried to give it to her. It was while
1 was trying & mend the brokea hearis
of these two people that I found her to be
the one for whee my soul cried out, whom
1 had revered in visions.

“When the emotion became so great in
my own soul Lt appealed to her and found
that she respohded. Wednesday morning
1 was seized with such emotion that | be
lieved I was dying. Mrs. Bauer os grogg
to me in spirit and said she wished to be

near me. Then I heard the knock at the
door and found Mrs. Bauer there. | ad-

mitted her and we sat in the official room
and ta'ked religion until 5 o'clock in the
morning. Mrs. Bauer finally became weary
and rested her head on my pillow. Our
relations are those of two souls held apart
by the civil law.” ;
When the Magistrate asked Walenta if
he thought it proper for a woman to come
to his home in that, way he said it looked
ar, but in reality it was not, as he

leved soul and soul should speak to each

“Sort of en affinity?” asked the Court.

ee. said the minister.

When Mrs. Bauer was asked what she
pe to say in her defence she admitted

ving her home at 2 o'clook in the morn-
while her husband waa asleep. ;
Why did you go” asked the Magis-

trate.
“Because 1 felt as if I had to go,” said
rs. Bauer. “It bad the feeling that Mr.
alenta was dying and needed me.”
Mrs. Bauer said she had been at the
ge on other occasions and had
Rept in a bed while Walenta occupied a
oouch. She admitted resting her head on
hie pillow Wednesday night. She said that
whenever ashe went to the parsonage she
ont called by God to do so. .
“1 believe you have been working over-
trae,” said the Magistrate to the clergyman.
“I have been working on human nature,”

anewered Mr. Wain >
_.“T guess you are ee under a men-
4a). strain,” continued the Court. .
* Ma O'Reilly said that sufficient
og yg AH been addnced to Justify
vhim in se ve their,
inqui: into,

engade peculiar,” the Court went
on tosay. “There is no proof of any wrong-
doing, but the facta are very suspicious.”

The case of the Rev. Mr. Walenta js not
v different from that of the Rev. Asbury
8. Wheedon, also of Brooklyn, who took in
the wife of his business partner, Charles W.
Moffet, about six weeks ago and kept her
away from her husband for six days be-
cause he tught her husband wasn't treat-
ing her right. It beara some similarity
alao to the case of the Rev. K. Lawrence
Hunt, formerly pastor of the Noble{Street
Presbyterian Church, not far away from the
Rev. Mr. Walenta’s church. Mr. Hunt

. #heltered Mrs. Fanny Rice Bassett, whose
husband had divorced her and named the
Rev. Mr. Hunt as corespondent. They
@®ayed in the parsonage until they were
ejected.

St. Lucas’a Reformed Church amounts
to little more than a miasion. It wae or-
ganized only four years ago and has a
membership of about 125, which has been
obtained fargely through t Rev, Mr

. Waleota’s efforts. “was thought in Green-
point” t pastor's conduct
might lead to the disbanding of the or-
gization,

POST OFFICE SAFE BLOWN OPEN.

Robber Molds tp Watchman Whiie His
Pais Do a $1,000 Job at Mineoia.

Minwouia, L. |, Oct. 11. Burglare en-
tered the Mineola post office at 2 o'clock
this morning, blew open the safe and stole
about $1,000 in cash, stamps and money
orders, The a office building is on Main
street, near the Long Island Railroad sta-
tion and about three city blocks from the
Nassau county jail.

Deputy Sheriff George W. Smith, the
village watchman, happened along while
two of the robbers were cracking the safe.
‘The third, who was on guard outside, step-
ping out from a shadow and sticking a re-
volver in his face, told him to throw up his
hands and stand still. Smith obeyed.

As he stood there he heard the sound of
va explosion in the post office and almost
immediately two men came running out,
one of them carrying a mail i ene
two and the watcher with the revolver then
started on a run down Main street, and as
they reached Third street turned into it
and were lost to sight.

An examination showed that the door of
the post office safe had been blown off,
probably with d ite. Postmaster Will-
iam McCarthy found that the tools used
in basing helee Sor the ohar; had been
stolen from a nearby th shop.

The mai bag in which the thieves had
carried off their plunder was found near the
fair grounds, a mile the scene of
the robbery, on the old country road leading

a horse

toward Westbury.

+ Lp f- the rebbere bed «| wes
and wagon, as persons living a
country road say that eovn after safe
was blown open they heard the beat of a
horse's hoofs on the and that the
animal was evidently ing at a good

clip.
This was the fourth time the local post
office has been robbed in two years.

House of Deputies to-morrow morning
J. Pierpont Morgan introduced a reso,
tion in the House of Deputies that a copy

to the Bishop of London, the library of

the Commonwealth of Virginia and
' several Northern institutions.

The house accepted the preamble to ihe
cohetitution as submitted by ita author.
the Rev. Dr. Huntington of New York.

The report of the committee on marria
and divorce was read, being practically
the same as that presented to the House of
Bishops several days ago, in which the ac-
| tivity of all Christian bodies in restricting
the remarriage of divorced reons is

ighly indorsed. [t ur t utmost
vigilance and discipline in the Church in
securing safeguards of the sanctity of the
marriage vows. It eapecially seta forth that
divoveed persons seeking remarriage are
at all times anxious to have their past
records made clear in seeking the sanction
of the Church.

During the arguments on the ad
of the preamble there were frequent
and pointed references to the celebrated
case of Algernon Cra . Deputy
McConnell of Louisiana exclaimed bitterly:

“In a celebrated case recently conducted
in which a clergyman of this church was
| removed it was proved that passages inthe
| New Téstament had been referred to as
| mere romances!”
| Chief Justice Andrewa of New York,
| chairman of the committee on courts of
| appeal, introduced the report of that com-
| mittee asking that the House of Bishops
be made a judiciary body for the considera-

to

that the board will heed the plea.

Prof F A. Seligman of Columbia
University, chairman of the Burean of
Municipal Research, asked the board to
grant the extra # riation of $60,000
applied for by the

plained, was to hire more auditors

of the various departments.

AS TO MULTIPHONE STOCK

 

WANLY WW. GILMAN SAYS
NEVER OWNED ANY OF 17

And That Neither He Nor Avy Member of
His Family Bought or Sold li —Served
as Chairman of Stockholders’ Meeting
by

Manly M. Gillam informed THE SUN yes- |

terday that there were some errors in se-
gard to him in the article, dealing with
Multiphone stock which appeared in yester-
day's Sun. '

Mr. Gillam said that he never owned or
traded in Multiphone stock and that no mem-
ber of his family had done.so. His only
interest in the company arose fromthe fact
that his sona,who conduct Gillams’ Service,
an advertising agency, for a time placed
the advertising of the Multiphone Operat-
ng Company. As to the men who are pro-*
moting the Multiphone proposition, Mr.
Gillam says he has never been associated
with any of them in business. He presided
at the meeting of stockholdera because he
was requested to do so, he said.

In regard to the Industria] Federation of
America, Mr. Gillam said that his only con-
nection with that enterprise was seven or
eight years ago, when its advertising was
placed through Gilliams' Service. He said
that he never owned stock in the enterpriee,
nor did he ever bear any official relation to
the company. If his name appeared as
director or otherwise it was without his
knowledge, he said.

As to the International Dash and Fender
Company, Mr. Gillam said that some of the
stock was presented to him. This was
eight or ten years ago, - no advertising
campaign was ever conducted to promote
ite sale, eo far as he knows,

Mr. Gillam was a director in the National
Barrel and eee Companv. but he says
