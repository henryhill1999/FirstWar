day).—A reduction in the prices of food-
stuffs and an inerease in the food pro-
duction were “especially demanded" by
the national convention of the Centrist
party at its anti-Reichstag session meet-
ing at Frankfort on Main.

The convention passed a resolution

Saying that “of the imperial authoritles |

the |;
| inordinately high prices be reduced to

we must especially demand that

a level corresponding with the means of
the consumer and that care be taken to
provide for increased production of the
necessities of life, especially by the aboli-
tion of all measures that hamper pro-
duction.”

The party members everywhere in Ger-

many were urged to subscribe to the war |
loan, thereby showing their confidence in |

the future of the empire and a determi-
nation to win the war,

The convention also urged the creation

of some kind of an imperial organtaation |

to prepare economically for the transition
from a war to a peace basis,

assembling of the Reichstag to-morrow,

will make no sensational variations of |

his previous utterances. Concerning
Pence, the question probably will be
touched upon without more explicit lan-

already been established through the
former Minister of War, Gen, Yanakit-

‘fer an early arrangement of the ditti-

as Admiral Condouriotis and Gen, Mos-

to have made the following declaration

to a correspondent at Athens after a

“The Cabinet can only await the re-

The news of the Bremen relieved the
protracted tension, which had grown In-
tense as the expected arrival of the sub-
marine Was delayed from week to week.
Apparently wuthentic rumors had been in
circulation that the Bremen sailed early
in August, Hence fears were entertained
in some quarters that something had
gone wrong with her, and the report of
her arrival has been wreeted by the
newspapers as paving the way for the
establishment of a regular submarine
service between Germany and the Untted

States, and us answering the alleged
taunt of Germany's enemies when the
submarine Deutschland returned home

from her voyage overseas, “You can't
jdo it again.”
