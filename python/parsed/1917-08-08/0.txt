RADICAL PLATFORM O. K."D

Municipal Ownership and
Operation of All Public °
Utilities Advocated,

The Democratic fusion committee of ,
170, including Tammany Hall and the
so-called independent Democratic ele-
ment represented by County Clerk Will- |
jam F,. Schneider, not only adopted a
platform last night. sweeping in its,
recommendations for radical changes in |
the government of the city, embracing!
municipal ownership and operation of |
all public utilities, but agreed on a tenta- j
tive city ticket, which, however, may |
be changed before it is accepted.

The city slate as it appéared last
night Is as follows : {
Por Mayor—William B. Ellison,
formerly Corporation Counsel. !

For Comptroller—John J. Fitzger- |
ald, Democratic Representative from |
Brooklyn and chairman of the Com- |
mittee on Appropriations of the House. |
For President of the Board ‘of |
|

Aldermen—Sherlf® Alfred E, Smith.
For President of the Borough of

Manhattan—Frank L. Dowling, now

President of the Board of Aldermen.

The platform, which was adopted by
the entire Democratic fusion committee
at & meeting at 50 East Forty-second
street, not only commits Tammany to
municipal ownership of public utilities
but binds itself to reorganize thoroughly
most of the present city departments
“to eliminate the waste and extrava-
gance and the fads and fancies of the
present administration.”

Police Inefficiency Asanatied,

The administration of the Police De-
partment is especially criticised, “the
Cruger case and the wire tapping ac+
tivities being emphasized as reasons
why a change should -be made. The
Health, Charities, Educational and civil
pre departments also come in for
harp criticlam, and the present ad-
ministration’s handling of thé Dream-
land, Rockaway Park, West Side plan,
the South Brooklyn marginal railway
scheme, the ¢olirt house gite and other
real estate actions and proposals
are flayed unstintedly.

After pledging loyalty to President
Wilson-and the national Admmjnistration
and stating that the»present fatlures of
the Mitchel administration justify a
restoration to. the people of direct con-
trol of the «ity government, the plat-
form launches forth on the main plank
in the document, municipal ownership.

“It Is the purpose,” states the plat- |
form, “of the Democratic voters of the
city of New York in the approaching
municipal @leetion to fight for municipal
ownership, the true principle of all mu-
nicipal reform.

Fustoniste Called Insincere.

“The Fusion administration say they
re for public ownership and operation,
( they quatify. this by ‘the statement
hat the ety ie yet ready to under-
take it. rity is recognized
by all the lie utility corporations of
the city, ¥ sare supporting the Fu-
sion administration. These corporations,
which have 9@ long fattened upon the
city, have a very clear understanding of
just how much, or rather how little, the
Fusion administration means in_ its
declaration,in favor of public ownership.”

After making it clear that the munici-
pal ownership plank Includes all public
utilities, including transportation, light,
heat and power, the platform proceeds to
point out what, in the epinion of the
Tammanyites, constitutes gross misman-
agement of the city government by the
present administration.

The increase in the budget and the
subsequent raise in tax rates are cited,
and the expenditures on the proposed
court house site and civic centre, in- |
volving, according to tne platform, a
loss of $12,000,000; a loss, or rather a
rift, to the “realty favorites” of $600,-
100 in the Dreamland Park transaction
and an alleged gift of another $400,000
in the city’s purchase of Rockaway
Park are among the indictments found
in the platform,

Concerning the Police Department the
flatform states:

“In the Police Department the splen-
did rank and file has been diverted from
the line of plain duty—the protection of
life and property and the detection of
crime—to the irritating surveillance of
Trivate business and unwarranted
*spionage of law abiding citizens, Time
end energy have been wasted in the
tapping of telephong wires of labor
Unions and private citigens and iin the
exhibition of diet squads designed to
Show the people how little they can eat.
fnd live. In the meantime crime has
tlarmingly increased, hundreds of dts-
@ppearances have remained unac-
ecunted for and scores of murders wn-
detected.”

Taking up the alleged control of tha
city government by the Rockefeller-Mor-
€4n group it is stated:

_ A vital issue of this election is:
Khall the control of the affairs of the
ety remain in the hands of @ financial
gnd social autocracy? The Rockefeller-
Organ group is the chief beneficiary of }

SWISSINCRISIS
WITH GERMANY’

Resent Berlin Demand for}
$50,000,000 Gold Loan and |
‘Coal Stoppage Threat.

 

 

Special Despatch to Tur Sun.
WASHINGTON, Aug. 7.—Intimations of

a threatened criSis in the relations be-
tween the Imperial German Government
and the Government of Switzerland
reached the State Department officially
to-day.

The crisis has been precipitated by a
German demand upon Switzerland for a
loan, said to be $50,000,000 gold, and a
German threat to cease all coal imports
into Switzerland until the amount is
paid.

Switzerland resents the demand on the
ground it is extortion. Swiss officials |
have appealed to Entente diplomats for

advice, and the Swiss Government has;
taken steps to apprise President Wilson
of what is happening.

There are evidences of a detérmina-
tion on the part of the Kaiser and_ the
German war party to strike terror into
the hearts of neutral countries contigu-
ous to the German Empire on the ground
that this is the surest means of keeping
these nations from listening to British ;
proposals aimed at tightening the block- j
ade. Diplomatic advices indicate that |
this subject has been taken up in re-/|
cent conferences between the German |
Emperor and his war lords, and that a,
new, threatening policy is being enforced
by German diplomacy.

Switzerland particularly has come
into disfavor with the German war lead-
ers because of the ousting of pro-Ger-
man Government officials, the bargain |
made by Switzerland with France to pre-
vent foodstuffs from reaching Germany
and the refusal of Switzerland to permit
the Socialist leader Grimm to remain a
tool of the German peace propagandists |
in Russia.

The German Foreign Cees is now >

, has been watching with growing
ert the lukewarmness of the Swiss
toward the active propaganda which had
ite headquarters in Berne. It was the!
spread of this pro-Entente feeling which |
caused the Swiss Government to recall |
Dr, Paul Ritter, the Swiss Minister at
Washington, when it became evident that
he was assisting Germany.

The démand for a loan appears to be
the first step in a new policy of firmness
which Germany 1s trying to enforce on
the Swiss. Switzerland cannot spare
gold to loan to Germany, and it is fully
realized in Berne that the Entente and
the United States will not look with
favor on the move. But Germany de-
mande it as a condition for coal ship-
ments into Swiss territory, and the coal
is urgently needed.

At the State Pepartment to-day it was
said that no decision had been reached
as to what immediate steps the United
States might take toward helping the
Bwies Ht is understood British and
French statesmen are considering means
of helping Switzerland, The first step
may be to arrange for giving the Swiss
a coal supply from some source other
than Germany. If this can be arranged
there afé assurances that the Swiss au-
thorities will tell Germany to keep her
coal and to cease further peremptory
demands. —

Diplomats here say that the German
aggressive attitude toward Switzerland
may mean the complete alienation of
Swiss sympathy for Germany. They
predict that Switzerland will be the first
of the neutral nations contiguous to
Germany to join the Entente cause,

WASHINGTON, Aug. 7.—Senate debate
on the House war tax bill, rewritten and
revised upward by the Senate Finance
Committee to levy $2,006,970,000 in new
taxes, is to begin Thursday.

After arrangements were made to-
night for disposal of the food legislation
to-morrow Chairman Simmons of the
Finance Committee eald he planned to
call up the revenue measure immediately
after the vote. The tax bill will have
the exclusive right of way until disposed
of. The debate is expected to last at

j least a fortnight.

Leaders are trying to reach an in-
formal understanding to limit discussion
ae much as possible and to pass the bill

within two weeks, with the hope of|factory on the basis of completion of | Physically

finally adopting the conference report
early in September and placing Congresa
in position for a recess of six or eight
weeks. :

Senator Harding, who is fostering the
movement to limit debate, said that
thirty Senators, Democrats and Repub-
Hcans, had given informal pledges to re-
strict the discussion as much ag possible

without interfering with any Senator's |

speechmaking plans, and it was hoped
to have fifty Senators ultimately join in
the “gentlemen's agreement.”
To-morrow or Thursday Senator La
Follette of the Finance Committee plans
to file his separate report on the revenue
Dill, proposing to raise many more mil-
lions by taxation imposed entirely upon
incomes, war profits, liquor and tobacco.
Senators Gore and Thomas are expected
to endorse that programme.

WASHINGTON, Aug. .7.—In line with |
the War Department's plan of concen-|

trating work on a large aeroplane build- |

jing programme Secretary Daniels an-
|Nounced to-day that the navy would |
| begin immediate construction of an alr-|
,eraft factory at the Philadelphia Navy ,
Yard on League Islanc.

The factory will begin operations!
within 100 days, and will have a capac- |
| ity of 1,000 planes a year. It will cost,
$1,000,000. The army programme con-
,templates 25,000 aeroplanes the first
| year,
| In taking this step to equip the navy
| wh aircraft Secretary Daniels has)
| Suarded against interfering with the
army's plans. He points out that the
establishment of the factory at League
Island will leave industrial facilfties |
throughout the country free to develop
approvee types to their maximum ca-
pacity. The navy'’s work will be cen-
tralized in this Government plant, where
experimental hydroaeroplanes, as well as
the most approved types, will be con-
structed. ¥

WASHINGTON, Aug. 7.—~ Provost Mar-
| Shal-General Crowder and his assistants
are at work on the final set of regulations
| to be promulgated this week to com-
jplete the organization of the selective
Graft war army. They will govern act-
ual mobilization of the men selected.

It is regarded as likely that the regu-
lations will show the surplus of drafted
men is to be used as a recruit reservoir
and that all the men will be put under
training as quickly as possible. A re-
cruit depot will be established in ‘France
from which regiments at the front will
be kept filléa up, drafts of men from the
main recruit depot in this country being
sent over to this distcibution centre as
| needed,

In the same way, sick or wounded
men will be returned to the front when
| recovered, and a sieady flow of recruits

to maintain active regiments at top
fighting efficiency will be provided in
this way,

Statements issued to-day by the War
| Department show that preliminary fig-
| ures place the total force of the Nations
{Guard taken into the Federal service
| August 5 at 13,093 officers and 419,834
j}men. Another statement showed that

180,766 war volunteers have been re-
|cruited for the regular service since
{ April 1, leaving only about 2,000 vacan-
{cies in the regulars at war strength.
| These ficures mean that approximately
1725,000 men are now under arms, ex-

clusive of the navy and Marine Corps, to
'be supplemented within the next few

 

ive draft bill. Of the latter number
about 600,000 will compose
|great element of the war army,

| weeks by 687,000 raised under the select- }

fort will be made to meet the wishes of
the drafted men in this regard, so far as
possible, when they are mobilized. It
can only be dote to a limited extent, as
the ranks of the regulars and guard, as

shown by to-day's statement, are prac-|

tically filled now.

The National Guard statement shows
that only the number of men short of
the 419,834 figure, shown by checking of
the muster rolls by department com-
manders and the rejection of any found
unfit, will be taken from the draft forces
for the guard service.

The recruiting service expects to fill
the regular army to full war service to-
morrow or next day, so that there
probably will be a surplus of 150,000 or
more men when the full 687,000 of the
first increment of the National Army is
assembled.

A reorganization of American army
units, under which the division totalling
28,000 men, found unwieldly for service
on European battlefields, is abandoned

for the Continental unit of about 19,000 |

men, has been ordered by the War De-
partment,

Under the new plan a division will |

include only two infantry brigades of
two regiments each, in place of three
brigades of three regimerw each under
the old system. Many other organiza-
tion changes are made, including a ma-
terial increase in the
machine gun strength of each Aivision.

The cavalry regiment now included in
each division is detached, a new trench
mortar battery is added, and the old
army corps plan, abandoned after the
civil war, again is put in operation.

The gixteen divisions of the National
Guard as now constituted will be re-

The Street was particularly pleased
with the emphatle way in which the re-
port of thé Senate Finance Committee
turned down the proposition of the
House fot retroactive income taxation
by which a tax would be imposed upon
incotes Yor the calendar vear of 1916.
Tt was known months Ago that the Seri-
ate would not permit retroactive taxa-
tion of the sort to become a part of any
war reverfue law, but that was so long
ago the financial community practically
had forgottert all about the subject.

The majority members of the Senate
committee believe that a retroactive in-
come tax would be in princtple both
morally and economically unsound,

Bankers were satisfied with the clause

companies, corporations, associations
and partnerships, while they agreed
with the Senate Finance Committee's

idea that in the case of individuals there |

should be an exemption of $6,000 of war

And the banking community was sat-
isfied also with the idea of substituting
for excess profits tax a war profits tax
in general, especially as tt proposes to
make the basie of the tax the difference
between the profite of the pre-war pe-
riod and the profits of a taxable year.

Charges that some lawyers and no-
taries have taken advantage of the
shortage of affidavit forms for exemp-
tlon dlaimants fo enrich themselves re-
ceived attention yesterday from Mr,
Conkling and Philip J. MeCook of the
Mayor's Committee on National De-
fence. Complaints are relatively few,
but are serious enough to cause Mr, Mc-
Cook to say:

“The Mayor's committee cannot con-
demn in too strong terms any attempt
by harpies and sharks to exploit the
young men called to their country’s de.
fence and their friends, particularly tne

Bronx Lawyer Accused,

Especially aggravating conditions have
existed in Division 18, THe Bronx, but
Mr. Conkling said last night they had
been corrected. The story he got was

ae follows:
Like other boards, Board 13 has
lacked sufficient blank forms. It had at

the start, however, about 100 copies of
the book of forms, from which appli-

| cants are supposed to copy the ones that

fit their cares in suv an emergency. In
the course of the copying all the books
disappeared. On Thuraday an attache
of the board began handing out slips
gaying that it had no forms and advis-
ing persons to go for assistance to Otto

“I can suggest no more easily under-

NO CHANGE IN SYSTEM

German Press Is Lukewarm to

of Officials.”

 

German Professors
Oppose Peace Offer

MSTERDAM, Aug. 7.——Sev-

enty-eight professors of Bonn
University have signed a petition
urging the German Government
never to make another peace
offer, “since Germany's recent
offer has been answered by the
British challenge to retire behind
the Rhine.”

The.-signers consider that an-
other peace proposal would be
mischievous.

 

Brruin, via London, Aug, 7.—Ger-
many’s press.is decidedly lukewarm to
day in its welcome to the new occupants
of the Ministerial bench and charac-
terizes the fourteen newcomers to execu-
tive and minor posts as a Cabinet con
stituted of officials whose appointment
does not betray a change in system.

“It cannot be denfed that the event:
eccurring in our internal politics lack
historic dimensions as compared wit!
our present military achievements,” says
the Tageblatt. “The great German na-
tion, which is the only ‘kultur’ people in
the world, exercises neither direct nor
indirect influence in the selection of its
servants.

“The present reorganization of the
governmental personnel, which is of lit-
tle moment as regards the internal de-
velopment of the empire, shows Chance!l-
lor Michaelis for the present facing the
question of democratization or parlia-
mentarization with the same bewilder-
ment as though he stood in the presence
of some exotic sea monster. With us
the mak'ng of history appears to be the
sole privilege of the army.”

Attack on Helfferich,

The Vosasische Zeitung discusses the
retention of Dr. Helfferich as repre-
sentative of the Imperial Chancellor,
member of the Ministry of State and
temporary Minister of the _ Interior,
branding him as a bad legacy from the
Bethmann-Hollweg administration, as an
inspiration for a pro-English current in
German foreign policy and further
charges him with having delayed and
then discredited the U-boat campaign.

“We cannot overlook the fact,” says
j} the newspaper, “that in Dr, Helfferich
net only has a member of the old sys-
tem been incorporated in the new Gov-
ernment which was to foreshadow a
change in method, but above all one of
| the strongest supports of the old system,
and that in a leading cflicial capacity.
“Dr

Helfferich’s ambition is to exer-
influence upon foreign politics,

 

and in this he has occasionally changed
| the outward method of his foreign
| policy. He at no time has substituted
for it a conscious determination to
achieve a firm Continental understanding
as opposed to the aggressive world
power policy of England and the United
States, Personally the new Foreign Sec-
retary is suited to yield Dr. Helfferich’s
views of world politics still greater rep-

resentation in the new Government.”

Men, Not’ Principles,

The Lokal Anceiger says:

“If parliamentarization has assumed
but modest proportions on this occasion
we can but welcome the circumaetance,
inaSmuch as we do not deem jt prudent
to reconstitute one’s dwelling at a time
when a world of enemies is trying to
break in. The selections prove that the
emphasis has been placed not on prin-
ciples but on men, as is evidenced by
the appointment of two chief magts-
trates and a Social Democrat.”

The National Liberal Boersen Zeitung
in its comment sayé;

“Is the result which we are now per
mitted to coutemplate that which we
and, with us, many others have looked
forward to? The question may promptly
be answered in the negative. We have
again a simon pure Ministry of officials
Two parliamentarians—Dr, Spahn, Prua-
sian Minister of Justice, and Dr. von
Krause, Secretary of Justice—-cannot be
considered an evidence of a eincere de-
eire for parliamentarization, Whiletheir
appointments are a compliment to their
parties the fact remains that thea wide
heralded change in personne! is wot
wholly satisfying.”

Old Time Fashion.

The Conservative Taeglische Rund
schau has this comment to make

“What has been created is a Cabinet
of officials after the old time fashior
with the addition of two parliamenta-
riana Chancellor Michaelis up to this
time has been noted for hia fortunate
selection of the men about him and his
faculty of securing their closa coopera-
tion, It is to be hoped that his good
luck has stood by him in the present
appointments and that he will soon be
able to demonstrate that the conduct of
our Government will be once more in
firm, capable hands.”

The Zeitung am Mittag gives the fol-
lowing view of the changes:

“One will look vainly for a new
method In this system of ministerial ap-
pointmente. The new Government does
not even suggest a@ definite programma
and the only positive guarantee the new-
comers offer is a pledge to carry out the
terms of the imperial message for elec-
toral reforms. ‘This, however, is an ob-
ligation, not a confession of fatrn."

OMcial circles point out that the sa-
lection of new men has been aniely
prompted by their personal qualifies.
tions and that the roster of tie
