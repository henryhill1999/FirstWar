the other was to be married to George
Gillen, another under arrest, in a few

The capture of the expert safe drill-

ers came about through a skilful plece |

of work on the part of a young
Mounted policeman, C. J. Meyer. Like
others on duty in The Bronx, Meyer
had been told to arrest on suspicion |

cog ratchet drill, a most effective and
powerful device for boring a hole in
the doors of safes Questioned by

time the detectives found there pawn

TERMS OF AGREEMENT

Trades Which Have Adopted It
Say They Have Had No
Trouble Since.

 

For more than two years the cloak,
suit and skirt industry in this city has
not been disturbed by strikes and labor
troubles because a “protocoh’ or peace
agreement, has existed hetween the
Cloak, Suit and Skirt Manufacturers
Protective Association, composed of
about two hundred firms, and the Joint
Board -of Cloak and Skirt Makers
Unions, which has 50,000 members.

Business men and conservative labor
leaders called attention to this yester-

day in connection with the strike of
125,000 garment workers which hag

| been ordered. In addition, it was learned,

the International Ladies’ Garment
Workers Union has decided to call out
more than 70,000 workers in the dress
and waist, kimono and wrapper and
white goods trades within ten days,
which will make, altogether, about 200,-
000 {dle men and women ‘[n the “needle”
industries, unless the strikes are settled.

But there will be no walkouts in the
cloak, sult and skirt trade, where the
manufacturer and the employee say
that the peace agreement is working
most satisfactorily.

One interesting feature of the present
situation ts that the International
Ladies’ Garment Workers Union, which
has organized locals in the dress and
waist, kimono and wrapper and white
goods trades, has decided to order
strikes for the purpose of bringing
about peace agreements between the
manufacturers and workers such as
exist in the cloak, suit and skirt in-
dustry. While the manufacturers are
not disclosing their plans. it is known
that many of the large firme, especially
in the dress and waist bus'ness, are in
favor of the so-called “protocol,” but
cannot get the cooperation of some of
the smaller manufacturers.

The question of the “protocol” has
not come up in the U:i.ed Garment
Workers’ strike, although Samuel Jom-
pers, president of the American Fed-
eration of Labor, and other labor leaders
say they are in favor of it. It is ex-
plained that so many diversified inter-
ests are represented in the United Gar-
ment Workers of America that {t 1s
almost impossible to bring togethor the
manufacturers and workers.

The sxirt and cloak makers’ unions
are In the International Ladies’ Garment
Workers Union, which is identified
with the Federation of Labor. The suc-
cess of the peace agreement in the cloak
and skirt trade has been such that the
international union feels that successful
strikes by the dress and waist, kimono
and wrapper and white goods ‘workers
will result in peace in these trades.
Strike funds have been collected and
unions formed, and a mass meeting
will be held in Madison Square Garden
on next Sunday night.

In the dress and waist industry there
are about 35,000 employees; the white
goods shops employ about 30,000, and
in the wrapper and kimono trade there
are about 6,000 workers.

“We have been organizing these in-
dustries,” J. A. Dyache, secretary of the
International Ladies’ Garment Work-
ers, said yesterday, “and we are going
to call strikes very soon. Of couree ft
wouldn't be policy for me to name the
date, But there will be strikes and we
will win.”

He continued:

Yes, it is true that we want an arrange-
ment similar to the protocol with the
Cloak, Sult and Skirt Manufacturers
Association. That has worked very well.
There have been minor differences, but
they have been settled.

The trouble is that the other industries
are not organized. So far as # know the
manufacturers in the kimono and wrapper
and white goods industries have no
organizations. There is the Dress and
Waist Manufacturers Association, but
how strong it is I do not know. There
are 33,000 workers in this industry and
only 5,000 in the union. That Is what
we are up against.

Two years ago the strike in the cloak
and suit industry lasted seven weeks,
What was the result? The manuface
turers became stronger and the workers
who were not already in the union joined
it. This is always true In a strike.

That strike and the signing of the
protocol were good things for the cloak
and suilé industry. Western manufac-
turers have come here because there ins
permanent peace; conditions are not un-
settled. Manufacturera who atarted
branches in other cities have abandoned
them. The great majority of workers are
satisfied, Sanitary conditions are better,
which is not only an advantage to the
worker, but also to the wearer of the
garment, who is less likely to be exposed
to disease,

Julius Henry Cohen, counsel for the
Dress and Waist Manufacttrers Asso-
ciation, sald:

“We believe In a system based upon
reason and justice on both sides. We
believe in a union of the workerg com-
ducted by sane leaders, We believe in
sanitary shops and cooperation between
employer and employee; but we are up
against a stone wall because of the
attitude of a large number of those |

engaged in the industry, on both sides,
