MURPHY'S FATE IN DOUBT

 

Wigwam Saved Only Three Of-
fices in Stunning Rebuke
Given by Voters.

 

Steps leading to a contest on the
offices of President of the Board of
Aldermen and President of the Bor-
cugh of Manhattan will be taken by
Tammany.

Beaten decisively in the election on
Tuesday Charles F. Murphy, “boss” of
the discredited Democratic organiza-
tion, through the chairman of its law
committee, anncunced that application
would be made. to the Supreme Court
for an inspection, of the ballots in cer-
tain districts.

It was a solemn conclavt of Tam-
many leaders that met yesterday to
go over the figures that spelled their
defeat and to try to find some districts
that would give any basis for a con-
test. If the application is made it
probably will be to-day,

The Republicans welcome a contest
and declare it will show an increased
vot for both G, O. P. candidates.

How the overwhelming defeat would
affect the leadership of Tammany was a
general subject of speculation in political
circles, both Democratic and Republican.
Mr, Murphy, who, whatever he is or is
not, never has been accused of not being
4 good sport, met the newspaper men
with a smile at the Wigwam in Four-
teenth etreet yesterday.

“What coniment have you to make on
the, tection?" Mr. Murphy was asked.

‘None whatever,” hé+repliied.

“Oh, that’s past,” he added, when
naked if he could tell why Tammany
Hall had met such a defeat.

Gov. Smith in Murphy's Boat.

It had been the Impression since the

dlection of Alfred E. Smith as Governor | tion other than that one district was | be ;
| brated in many a quaffing bow! in bar} by the war.

a year ago that he waa the logical candi-
date to succeed Murphy as leader of the
Hall. But the Governor, who staked his
political capital on the fight against
William Randolph Hearst in the hope
that it would pull the Democratic ticket
through, was badly scorched in the re-
cent holocaust.. He is in the same po-
sition as Mr. Murphy, having volun-
tarily assumed the burden of Justice
Robert L. Luce’s candidacy and that of
Irwin Untermyer. His friends would
have no issue on which to urge his sub-
stitution for Murphy.

There was a suggestion yesterday that
Edward F. Boyle, the defeated candi-
date for President of the Borough of
Manhattan, might succeed Murphy. But
the best thought {s that he might better
not bank on it. He resigned a good
place on the Municipal Court. bench in
the Fourth district to become Borough
President for the remainder of the
Year, At that time he will be free. It
may be that Mayor Hylan will hold the
vacancy open and reappoint Mr. Boyle
to it after January 1.

Late returns made only one change
in the list of candidates elected as
printed in Tums Sun yesterday. The
Democrats elected two instead of only
one City Court Judge. Henry K. Davis,
Republican, whose election was indi-
cated yesterday morning, was nosed out.

Judge Richard H. Smith, Republican
candidate, who was cast for a martyr's
Tole by the failure of Mr. Murphy to
Tenominate him, ran far in the lead, He
Was 16,659 votes ahead of Joseph M.
Callahan, Democrat, of The Bronx, who
Was elected to the second vacancy. The
Recond Democrat, who captured the
third place, was Louis Wendel.

La Guardia Got Manhattan.

Final figure; showed that F. H. La
Guardia, Repoblican, had been elected
President of the Board of Aldermen
Over Rohert L. Moran by 1,363. He
farried Manhattan by 2,604, a blow that

Tammany will be long in recovering
from. La Guvrdia also carried Brook-
lyn by 21,639, but Moran ran 17,141
ahead in The Rronx, 2,906 In Queens
and 2.825 tn Richmond.

Final figures on Henry H. Curran, the
Republican
the Borough of Manhattan, showed he
had decisively beaten Edward F. Boyle,
Tammany eancidate, by 9,703.

fia plurality in Manhattan, constituted

Jersey’s New Governor Says
He Will Do His Best to
Obey People’s Will.

VICTORY FOR A PRINCIPLE

 

Teetotaller Himself, He Feels
Others’ Personal Liberty
Should Be Respected.

 

 

The big question ‘in the minds of
rejoicing “wets” in New Jersey yester-
day was: “How is ‘Teddy’ Edwards
going to make it possible for Jersey-
men to get a perfectly legal drink in
that State after January 16, 1920, the
day for the beginning of operation of
the national prohibition amendment?”

The Democrat who has promised to
try to do this thing is Edward I. Ed-
wards, president of the First National
Bank of Jersey City, who defeated
Newton A. K. Bugbee, Republican
State Comptroller,
Tuesday, largely® because he made it
| clear during the campaign that, al-
though a teetotaller himself, he was
in favor of a “wet” order of things.
He is still “Teddy” to most of the
thousands of his fellow townsmen who
dropped into his office during the day
to congratulate him on his “victory
for personal liberty.”

who have been In the dumps for a long
time, perked up yesterday as they read
the election returns. The general senti-
ment among saloon keepers, a pronil-
nent Jersey City hotel keeper and sup-
porter of Mr. Edwards said, was that
they were hopeful the national Adminis-
tration at Washington would lift the Lan
on war time prohibition right away. ‘The
election of Edwards, he explained, meant
that New Jersey was “serving notice” on

IRISH COLLEENS FORBIDDEN
TO SPARK KING’S SOLDIERS

 

Penalty Proclaimed by Republican Army Is Loss of
Tresses—Bars Boycotted.

 

Dusiin, Nov, 6.—Love making by
the girls of Ireland with members of
the British Government forces has
been proscribed by the Irish Republi-
can Army. Any girl keeping company
with a Government soldier or police-
man will be penalized by having her
hair cut off. One girl already has
suffered the penalty, losing her locks
for walking out with a soldier,

A proclamation has been posted
signed by “The Competent Military
Authority,” saying: “Whereas certain
girls wanting In self-respect have
damned themselves by keeping com-
pany with the Army of Occupation, it
is deemed proper by competent au-
thority, both to safeguard morality
and to stop bad examples, to publish
the names of these culprits and also
to warn them that after the publica-
tion of this proclamation: those who
persist in the above mentioned scan-
dalous, unpatriotic company keeping

render themselves liable to the punish-
ment of being branded by having their
hair cut off.” The names of four “of-
fenders” are attached to the proclam-

ation.

The notification then goes on to say:
“The parents or mistresses are requested
to see that the above mentioned girls
are kept from intercourse with enemy
troops; All loyal subjects of the Irish
Republic are also requested to shun pub-
lic houses which entertain members of
the enemy army until such time as they
make reparation by a completa change
of conduct." Three names of offenders
are here given. y

“The first named person is earnestly

requested to dismiss the barmaid whvu
openly mocks loyal subjects by wearing
a policeman's cap and badge showing
the crown above the heart. In case of
refusal drastic measures will be taken.
All who persist in visiting these pro-
claimed honses are Hable to have thelr
names published as disloyal subjects whu
patronize houses frequented by the
enemy army and private punishment will
be meted out in due course.”

REED SPEECH IS BITING

 

Missouri Senator Denounces
Blind Followers of the
President.

 

Special Despatch to Tar Sun.

Wasutnaton, Nov. 5.—Unless there
is a complete reversal of every pres-
ent indication and sign the peace
treaty with Germany will be rejected
by the Senate in the form in which it
will come before it for the final vote on
ratification.

The feeling is everywhere apparent
in the Senate and is supported by
these developments:

The La Follette amendment to
strike the labor clauses from the
treaty was defeated, 34 to 47. These
clauses have been bitterly de-
nounced, and their retention makes
several votes very doubtful which
otherwise could be counted safely
for ratification.

Senator Thomas (Col.), Demo-
crat, who declared he would vote
against the treaty with those
vlauseg included, reiterated his
statement after the Senate refused
to strike them from the treaty.

A poll by leaders developed that
the preamble to the ratification res-
olution requiring acceptance by
three of the four principal Allies of
the reservations is certain to be
adopted. It has been strongly op-
posed by the Administration on the
ground that the treaty would have
to go back to Paris. To meet this
argument it has been agreed that
a specific statement shall be made
in thespreamble that acceptances
may be effected through exchanges
of notes,

Senator Borah's argument on
Tuesday that under Article X. the
President might send armed Ameri-
can forces anywhere despite the
Constitution has made a profound
impression,

A careful compilation of the atti-
tude of every member of the Senate
at this time has disclosed that there
is enough opposition to the treaty,
with the Lodge reservations certain
to be adopted, to insure its defeat,
with a few yotes to spare.

These polls include only Senators
opposed to the treaty and do not
take into consideration Administra-
tion supporters who may _ vyote
against the treaty on the ground
that it has been emasculated bv the
Senate’s actions. Unless Demo-
cratic leaders have been talking
only for effect or have been bluff-
ing a number of votes against rati-
fication will be “added from this
source, As carefully calculated by
Senate leaders but 54 or 655 votes
can be mustered for ratification,
whereas 64 votes are needed,

Senator Myers (Mon.), counted on as

the treaty with that part of it left in, if
there was any possibility of eliminat-
ing it. His speech was so vigorous that
it caused the switching of his vote on
ratification from the “sure Administra-
tion” to the “doubtful” column.

Pinch of Coal Strike
Being Felt in the West

CHICAGO, Nov. 5.—Beginning

of curtailed railroad service
to-day and the pinch of inade-
quate supplies of coal in several
States marked the fifth day of the
miners’ strike. Principal develop-
ments were:

Removal of six passenger trains
from service of the Chicago and
Northwestern and the Chicago,
Milwaukee and St. Paul railroads,

Appeals for coal made by sev-
eral Nebraska towns to State
Railway Commission.

Iowa Fuel Administrator's
complaint against railroads’ seiz-
urgs of coal while luxurious
transcontinental trains continue
running sent to Washington.

California coal dealers re-
quested Gov. Stephens to ask the
Fuel Administrator to release
confiscated coal to prevent a pos-
sible shortage in that State.

Release of coal seized in tran-
sit on orders of Fuel Administra-
tion for relief in some districts.

Topeka (Kan.) schools to close
to-morrow for one week; brick
factory closed; many coal deal-
ers’ bins empty and employees
laid off. 5

Missouri coal dealers asked re-
vival of the State Fuel Adminis-
tration.

Ry a Staff Correspondent of Tur Sex.

GuHarRLeston, W. Va., Nov. 6—If any
large number of the 92,000 miners of
this State want the thirty hour week
the fact was not apparent to a corre-
spondent for Tur Sun, who travelled
through thirty miles of coal flelds to-
day.

If any ljarge number of them ever
sanctioned such a demand or indeed
eyer heard of it until the demand was
made by the national officers of the
United Mine Workers, the truth was
subtly concealed by the scores of
seemingly truthful and free talking
representative men interviewed on the
trip.

If any considerable body of the
miners favored the thirty hour week
that certainly ought to be the feeling
of the miners of Cabin Creek, scene
of the sanguinary strike of 1912 and

regarded as the most “radical” ter-
ritory in the State.

To-day’s route followed Cabin Creek
for twenty miles, between hills that

the conclusions inescapable by

: And

this correspondent after visiting both
Cabin Creek and Paint: Creek are so
far as theSe miners are concerned:
First, the miners, union and non-union,
working or on strike, do feel that their

wages must be increased unless living
cost is greatly reduced. The union men
rely on the judgment of their national
and State leaders that the advance

ought to be 60 per cent. The men with
families are especially insistent in say-
ing that their margin over living cost is
not a safe one.

Working Ideas Vague.

Second, a majority of the miners either
do not want the six hour day, five day
week, or if they do want It have only
the vaguest idea of what it means, but
feel that as It was put into the national
ultimatum {t must be a good thing.

Third, the union men did not vote for
a strilso or vote at all, but now the strike
is on they feel that their leadership cin
be trusted and are disposed to stay away

from the mines until ordered by their
headquarters to return.
Fourth, although distribution of the

national strike fund is enjoined, few of
the miners are as yet feeling the pinch
of idleness with no revenue. The presi-
dent of one of the locals siid he had
enough money saved to last himself and
his one child two or three years and he
was willing to stay on strike that long
on the wage 'asue,

Spectal Despatch to Tre SuN.

WasHinoaTon, Nov. 5.—Advances by
labor representatives that seemed to
indicate a willingness to surrender the
strike weapon which the coal miners
consistently had refused to abandon
for any form of settlement apparently
were given a setback to-day by the
determination of the Government not
to recede from what it considers a
simple programme of law enforce-
ment.

Following Samuel Gompers's state-

day on apparently well founded au-
thority that he would head a delega-
tion of labor leaders to the Depart-
ment of Justice to suggest settlement
if the injunction proceedings in In-
dianapolis were withdrawn,

A prompt statement by Assistant
Attorney-General Ames was made,
however, to the effect that law en-
forcement would be prosecuted and
that the Government not only would
not withdraw but would prosecute
earnestly the injunction proceeding.
Whether or not this was an influence
is not known, but at any rate no ap-
peal was made to the Department by
Mr. Gompers or other labor heads.

Government's Stand Is Firm.
Though there are many indications

of a willingness on the part of labor ~

leaders ta recede from the uncompro-
mising position that preceded the
iovernment’s injunction proceeding
no definite move has been made. The

Sary preliminary to any settlement of
the merits of the controversy between
the mine workers and the mine oper-
ators,

Making it clear that the Govern-
ment could not accept any labor over-
ture for calling off the injunction pro-
ceeding as a first step, Mr. Ames said:

The strike is a violation of law.
As long as It continues we are going
to proceed in the courts. The dis-
pute between the mine owners and
workers is an entirely different ques-
tion that they can settle in thelr
own way. The Government cannot
tolerate continued violation of the
law such as the strike constitutes,

Edgar Wallace, legislative representa-
tive of the mine workers, replied that
calling off of the injunction would have
brought settlement of the strike, He
said:

If the injunction were withdrawn
the scaie committees representing
miners and operators could Ret to-
gether in twenty-four hours and set
tle their differences at one altting
The strike, however, would not be
called off until a new wage agreement
was reached,

Troops Asked in Kentucky.

As was indicated in THE Sun to-day,
the President signed an Executive order

The order will not be issued, however,
unless such a course becomes necessary

Kentucky operators asked the Fuel
Administrator for troops to guard the
coal mines that are working in the State
against disorder, which is said to be
threatened. The Fuel Administrator
turned the message over to the War
Department and told the operators he
lacked the power to act
