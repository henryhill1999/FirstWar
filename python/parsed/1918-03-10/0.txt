This week begins with the Demon Rum
upon his knees to the Legislature.
Likely enough {t will end with the|
jegisiature grabbing the Father of Evil;
by the collar and the elack of the:
breeches and booting him down the front \
gieps of the Capitol. . \
He's all in, all but down and out. |
Public Decency, refereeing the most

dramatic fight at Albany since the re- |
neal of the racetrack law, is standing a)

‘ttle to one side, cold and intent, ready |
to raise the right hand of absolute Pro- |
} bition, the new champion. |
Father Time, watch in hand, {is count- |
ing out the old master in syllables which
are the tolling of funeral bells for the
distilleries, the breweries, the saloons,
the public and secret haunts of vice, the:
gargmen and the gunmen, the thieves
and masterless men—for the whole Fal-
siaff_s army. The count is nearing ten.

\
Came Like a Prussian. |

And well the Demon knows It! What |
a change a week has brought in the |
pride of his demeanor! He, came,
haughtily to the Legislature. He}
cinked his gold and shouldered decent |
out of his path. He issued his will |
like a kaiser. He strode up and down
wwe Senate and the Assembly like a
German General in conquered States.
He summoned his tatterdemalions to,
s+reaten the Governor, to ridicule Sena- |
tor Hill and Assemblyman McNab, to)
laugh down or shout down reasoned
argument.

Ry methods and tactics in which he
never has been eurpassed he whistled |
honorable men to his heel and bade
them sing to his,fiddle. For hig first
Ine of deferfce he eet up the barb“wire
entanglements of ancient and comfort- |
able habit; of the navural and human
desire of mankind to ve tet alone in!
easy ways; of arguments sound only in
‘ir long time and thoughtless accept-
ance. For his second line of defence he,

ade trenches of threats—threats per-
sonal to Senators and Assemblymen that
wavered in their notions, telling them
that he would drive them out of public
life. injure them socially or financially,
make them sorry they had ever been
horn. And for his third line he has}
erected bastions of gold—-hard cash.

 

  

 

Beaten to Hin Knees.

Rut every one of these defences and
Protections has been broken or
turned. Sophistry failed. Threats failed.
Hrivery will fail. The Demon finds, as
this week begins, the week of his hu-
uliation, that he is no conqueror at all. |
He begins to eee with a sort of shock-
ing comprehension that he is merely a
‘oozy and broken down pugilist of evil,
beaten to his knees by the clean, young
champion of social, economic and politi-
cal progress. He is done for and in his
veart he knows ft.

The old arguments that absolute pro-
nibition-—-Federal prohibition—cannot be
enforced; that the people do not want it;
‘hat jt would result in a loss of millions |
‘09 a State which needs a greatly in-
creased income In war time; that it would
afeor delateriously the administration
of the schools and other public institu-

ons, that It would be rutnous to real |
ewate vyalues—all these have been}
‘mashed or brushed {nto the dustpan.
The old threats have falled to terrify. A

corruption fund of $1,000,000 remains
unspent,

 

lle Tarnsa to Pleading. i

  

ore, to-day John Barleycorn is
g and pleading, not thundering |
commands or breathing defiance. His/|

Suard is lowering and his old chin is |

"ooh the forces of order and decency
are aiming to send home. This blow
ait

he the adoption by both Assembly
and Senate of the Hill-McNab resolution
ratifying the Federal prohibition amend- |
ment, which is the only sincere and
Workable anti-liquor measure which the
*#€ slature has been considering.
Starting out with a programme to
anything and everything which
threatened to abolish or diminish their |
preofiis, tha Mquor interests have been |
driven from one hope of compromise to
frother, and now are realizing that no}
Con.promise or evasion js possible. |
A week ago, as has been sald, it
eved scarvely possible that the resolu-
ton ty ratify the Federal amendment to
Mace the whole country dry could be
‘arried through both Assembly and Sen-
ate either, for that matter. It did
hot seem possible that the bare majority
necessary tn each chamber could be ob-
tained, The power of the whiskey men
4nd the beer men loomed enormously.

  

When the Change Came,

At ‘hat time it looked as if the Gov-
frnor's prestige and influence had been
0 hard hit by the farmers’ resentment
4€ainst the townsh!p school law and the
cid Farms and Markets Council as to
Make the Governor's quiet support of
the resolution of questionable value.

here was an {dea that labor, speaking
tirough the mouth of Samuel Gompers,
had about settled the question as to
Whether New York should make the
thirtieth State to ratify the Federal
amendment. Easygoing, let well enough
&one influences had all but drugged sen-

nent to destroy liquor at a blow.

Then the situation changed, The
farmers, having had a heart to heart
talk with Mr. Whitman about the-Farms
and Marketa Council, got the Governor's
Dielge to let it alone; got what they
Santed in the reconstructed body, a ma-

The Committee on Public Information
still is standing by {ts guns and reit-

in its opinion were valueless from the
viewpoint of public information, The
War Department therefore decided to-
day to make the lists public through
the Adjutant-General’s office by posting
the lists upon a bulletin board outside
Adjt.-Gen. McCain's office.

Gen, March, acting Chief of Staff
sought to put matters in a new light
by explaining that the recommendation
from Gen. Pershing for the change in the
form of the casualty lista was based on
an urgent appeal by the French Goveri-
ment. Gen. March made the following

statement:

THEIR WAY OUT

No Thought of Yielding
to German Raiders.

WINS PRAISE OF FRENCH

Men in Training Give Clear
Proof of Morale and War-
like Qualities.

WaAsHINGTON, March 9. German
troops in their attack in Lorraine on the

'
;
!
‘

night of March 4 twice gained a footing’

;in the American trenches, only to be
| driven out in fletce fighting. An official
| despatch to-day from France giving the
) French view of the encounter said the
| Americans showed a “rare quality of
courage, self-possession and calm bra-
very which won them the admiration of
the neighboring French troops and the
| hearty congratulations of the French
| high command.”

| The Americans engaged were the
latest to enter the trenches, going in
to train with the French. First news of
| their presence on the battle line came
jin the French official statement of
March 5, which told of their brave con-
duct in repulsing the Germans. To-
day's despatch, which gave the first de-
‘tails of the fighting, said:

“after a very heavy artillery prepara-
tion, including shells of all calibres,
which completely demolished the ground
of the sector, a strong attack was made
upon the positions occupied by the
Americans. A few of the enemy suc-
ceeded in penetrating into a trench, but
an energetic and severe counter attack
threw them back In confusion.

“Meanwhile another section succeeded
in cutting the barbed wire tn front of
the positions where the fighting was go-
Ing on, but they also were dispersed
quickly by the precise firing from the
rifles and machine guns.

“A third company finally succeeded in
stealing their way into the lines and at-
tempting a flanking atack, which was on
the point of succeeding. Here, especially,
the Americans gave proof of splendid
energy and a morale beyond all praise.
Almost entirely surrounded, they did
not dream for one instant of surrender-
ing, and their efforts to extricate them-
selves were so determined that they suc-
ceeded tn displacing the enemy without
leaving a single prisoner in his hands.

“The same date, toward 4:30 in the
morning, an American patrol of four
men and one
enemy patrol that was cutting the
barbed wire, and which was composed
Jof nine men. Giving proof this time of
j Splendid offensive qualities and without

onsidering their numerical inferiority,

e American patrolea threw themselves
} upon the adversaries and after a furious
combat succeeded in putting them to
flight, bringing back with them two pris-
oners.

American ¥oldiers assumed the brilliant

the allied armies,

be confined to this form.

The witness admitted that not a penny
had been received in the general treas-
ury of the alliance for this purpose, but
suggested it was probable that the al-
liance members had preferred making
direct contributions to the American
branches of the Red Cross.

Four thousand soldiers were landed!
and numbers of officers continued to ar-

the newspaper. The Japanese Admiral |
assured the local Workinen's and Sol-!

The Spectator eays: “One question
that matters {s whether Japan by her ac-

to defeat Germany. The disilke of the pro-
posed action of Japan Is based upon
varying degrees of mistrust. So far as
we know there is no reason whatever
for this distrust. If it !s seriously meant
that every Japanese soldier should have
a policeman to accompany him and keep
the Japanese realistic ideas under proper |
control, all we can say is that the An-,

The Spectator points out the possibil- |
ity of Germany selzing stores along the
Trans-Siberian Railroad and in Viadivos- |
tok, and says that Germany always acts
quickly, and unless Japan acts quickly |
Japan always has
kept her obligations, says the Spectator, '
and as for jealousy between her and the |
United States it is a thing of the paat|
with the latter. The newspaper cone |
eludes: |
