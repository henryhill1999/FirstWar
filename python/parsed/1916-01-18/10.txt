Lead and Leather.

National Lead and Central Leather
are two stocks that have been quiet for
a long time. National Lead made a
new high mark, the previous top price
being established on May 1 last. The
company is said to be doing an excellent
business. The buying was supposed to
be related to the news last week that
the United States Cartridge Company had
secured a new order for a large quantity
of cartridges for a foreign Government.

CLOSING OF PLANT |

Many Manufacturers Said to|
Be Greatly in Need of
Coal and Metals.

 

 

The traffic situation tn the Eastern
territory is still most perplexing. The
New Haven is understood to have inati-
tuted another close embargo on all
freight shipments into New England
with the exception of fuel and perish-
able products. Many manufacturers in
Massachusetts and Connecticut are said
to be greatly in need of metals and fuel.
Consequently some of the plants have
suspended operations {n some depart-
ments, while others are closed down
entirely. The tendency {s to prevent
detailed information from belng pub-
lished. There are devious ways of se-
curing entrance into New England ter-
ritory, but these are more or less ex-
pensive and are utilized only when abso-
lutely necessary. Some steel products
are being shipped by way of Canada,
and pig {ron and coke, where possible, |
by water. Very little pig tron is being
shipped from the South even into south-
ern New England.

e e e

The New York State Steel Dredging |
Company, which recently secured the:
general contract from the New York
Central for building a bridge over the
Barge Canal near Rochester, has placed
the contract for the 500 tons of steel
required with the Phoenix Bridge Com-
re’ e ° o

The Baltimore and Ohio Railroad ifs
taking bids on the construction of an
outbound freight house at New York
which will require about 100 tone of
fabricated structural steel.

e . °

Bids for the bullding of a parochial
school at Coney Island, to be twelve
stories in height, are being t@ken from
general contractors. About 400 tons of
structural shapes will be used.

ee e

Bids are being taken on the construc-
tion of a nurses home at the Hebrew
Institute on King>ridge road, New York
city, calling for 100 tons of structural
steel. Tenders have also been sub-
mitted on seventy-five tons of structural
shapes to be used in the construction of
the Yonkers Masonic Temple, and on the
construction of the Yonkers Armory,
which will require about 500 tons of
steel.

eo e e

Fabricators have submitted tenders on
furnishing 150 tons of structural shapes
for a bank building to be constructed at
Middletown, N. Y. Porfith Bros. ar-
chitects, are receiving bids on the con-
struction of the Brooklyn Home for the
Aged, three stories in height, which will
require about sixty tons of fabricated
steel. Several other small building con-
tracts requiring a few hundred tons of
steel are pending in the metropolitan
district. Most of the recent large con-
tracts for structural shapes have origi-
nated in the interior.

e e e

Ocean freight rates on fuel have again
advanced enormously. Within the last
week one steamship was chartered at the
ratio of 115s. a ton to carry & cargo
of coal from this country to the west
oast of Italy. It is understood that
about 6.000 to 6,000 tons of steam coal
were included in the shipment. A little
more than a year ago freight rates on
coal to Mediterranean ports were only
9s. to 12s. a ton.

operates what is probably the largest bydraulic elec-

Ass ciat on,

The earnings over a period of four years have
shown constant improvement. The dividend on the
preferred stock of this company becomes cumulative
at the rate of 6° per annum. next December. The
earnings for the past year show wearly twice the
dividend requirements on the $2,500,000 of preferred
stock outstanding. The company will suow practically
$500,000 cash on band. Farnings for November and
December, which have just become available, show tha
full 6°% on the preferred stock as well as 4% earned
on the common. We believe dividends will be inaugu-
rated on the preferred issues shortly, and a stock of
this character ying such dividends would surely
seem to be worth at least $100. per share.

The present market is $7514 bid, offered at $77'4
per share

 

The company at the present time is controlled by
a Voting ‘Trust, which expires next December, and at
that time {it would not be surprising to see «a change
in the control of this company.
