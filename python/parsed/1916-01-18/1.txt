Preliminary to negotiations.

Both Budapest and Berlin greeted the
news of the first break in the allied
ranks with great rejoicing, Tt was given
Out here in a report by the Overseas
Newe Agency, as follows:

“‘Montenegro asks for peace,
Count Tisza in the Hungarian
tent.

“The proceedings under the first order
of the day had just been completed when
the Count asked for permission to In-
terrupt the discussion, He stated that
the King and Government of Montenegro
had asked the inauguration of peace
negotiations, The announcement cre-
ated a great commotion in Parliament.

“'We asked before hand that Mon-
tenegro unconditionally lay down her
arms,’ continued the Premier. Joyful

shouts followed this statement.

“‘Just at this moment the news has
arrived that the unconditional laying
down of arms has been accepted. Since
the preliminary condition has been ful-
filled, peace negotiations will be entered
into immediatety,’ he continued.”

It is understood here that King Nich-

olas of Montenegro and other members |

of the royal family will leave the coun-
try and go to Italy.

WHY MONTENEGRO FELL.

Italian Statesman Blames Allics’
Lack of Collective Action.

Rome, Jan, 17.-<In an apparently tn-
epired speech at Padua yesterday Signor
Barzilat, administrator of the territo-
ries conquered by Italy, laid the blame
for the Montenegrin disaster on the fall-
ure of the Allies to have collective ac-
tion

“Our enemies,” he said, “find aalvation
in silent, servile obedience imposed by
one man. We ehould have foreseen the
dificult nature of our task becauee of the
uncertainties inherent in a league of free
Peoples

“There ie no ground for the assertion

 

that Italy ie responsible for the errors
of last June. To prepare for the pro-
tection of a country without frontiers

before hostilities were preseing was the
common task, In the future this order
of argument will not be profitable, and
Governments making use of it to ex-

   

cuse failures will not merit or receive
@ pardon from their peoples.”
The members of the Serbian Cabinet

who arrived in Brindisi, in flight from
Secutari, were accompanted by the diplo-
mates of the allied Powers accredited to
King Peter

The Idea Nationale says that the Ser-
bilan Government will maintain {te
headquarters at Brirdist for some time.

operations In Bosnia and
Herzegovina with an army never esti-
at more than 60,000 men were
eminently successful. On September 22
the troops of King Nicholas which had
been working in conjunction with the
Berbians invested Sarajevo. Operating
ir. the other direction they seized Scutari
in Albania. Losses of what were re-
ported to be a third of {ts entire force
were coincident with still heavier losses
among the opposing Austrians.

From their furthest advances, how-
ever, the Montenegrin troops were slowly
driven back, until the Austrians took up

the siege of Mount Lovcen. With the
#reat Teuton drive on Serbla the de-
pleted Momtenegrin army, reenforced

later by the fleeing Serbs, was driven
further and further back and closed
within the fron ring about Cettinje. The
fall of Mount Lovcen last week led to the
camture of the capital and the dispersal
of the remnant of the army.

Tt is not definitely known whether or
not Montenegro ever signed the agree.
Ment between the Allies against a sepa-
rate peace, but it ls not supposed that
ehe did.

Montenegro has been a kingdom since
\ugust 29, 19106, when with the consent
of the European Powers her present
ruler, King Nicholas, took the title after
ruling as Prince for fifty years. He has
been practically responsible for the mod-
ern State. He established in 1888 a civil
code which had excellent results, He was
in command [In both Balkan wars—those
of 1876 and of 1912—when the principal-
{ty made the first declarations of hos-
tility.

As a result of the conflict in 1876
the State was recognized as independent,
and as a result of the second, ended by
the Treaty of Bucharest, Montenegro ac-
quired a large silce of the Sanjak of
Novi Bazar, to the northwest, and 4 con-
elderable addition to the west and south,
of the old province of Seutari, almost
doubling the territory of the little king-
dom. It is the integrity of this territory
that Austria is rumored to be willing to
guarantee now.

In 1389, when the ancient Serblan na-
tion was overrun by the Turks at Kos-
@ovo, Montenegro offered an unconquer-
able bulwark to Turkish advance. In-
vasion after invasion was stopped when
it reached the mountains about the patch
of sea coast. When the Montenegrins
succumbed in 1714 it was only to rebel
again, With Russian support they en-
tered upon another two centuries of war-
fare, constant!y harassing the Ottomans.

Until 1616 Montenegro was ruled by a
Prince of the old Serbian line. The title
of the ruler then became Prince Bishop.
The last Prince Bishop died in 1881, and
Danilio I, uncle of the present King, re-
Bumed the old secular title of Prince.

The present area of Montenegro |s es-
timated at 5,603 square miles, and the
population before the war at 516,000.

Special Cable Despatch to Tue Sun.

Lonpon, Jan, 17.—The second im-
portant British victory reported within
| two days in the Mesopotamian theatre
| of war was announced in ths House
,of Commons by Secretary for Indla
Chamberlain to-day. The British re-
lief force under Gen. Aylmer, on its
way to aid the British army bottled up
(at Kut-el-Amara, followed up its suc-
, cess of January 13 and 14 and drove
j the Turks to a position only six miles
\

from Kut-el-Amara,

A War Office statement issued , ester-
day 6aid the relief force, afier bLaving
driven the Turks on January 5 and ¥
to #& position astride the Tigris at Orah,
twent)-live miles below Kui-el-amara,
attacked the Ottomans there, driving
{them still further before them, To-
“ass ahnouncement @hows that the
British aince then have made a gain
of nineteen miles toward ther goal,

Turks Repulsed Twice,

Secretary Chamberlain etatecd jn his
| announcement to-day that the Turks
were driven by the British on January
, 11 to Easian, six miles east of Wut-el-
Amara, and that on the following day
the Turks advanced again to the so-

called Wadi position. The subsequent
British advance, in which the Turks
were again thrown back to Essian, |

was made between January 13 and 16

During the whole day of January 13
there was continuous fighting, Secretary
Chamberlain stated, it is evident from
his announcement that a battle of ter-
rific violence preceded the latest Britsh
advance,
that this battie will be renewed
mentarily, as the Turks are expected to
fight to the jast to prevent a junction
between the relief force and the be-
leaguered troops at Kut-el-Amara, as
such a junction would mean a new
menace to Bagdad,

The consensus of opinion is that the
fighting in Mesopotamia now in progress
is of as bitter and tenac.ous a charac.

‘ter as has occurred anywhere during the |

,war. The prize of victory for the Turks

is the opening of the drive against Suez
jand Egypt, while for the British victory
‘means averting that menace indefinitely
jand paving the way for a new attack on
Bagdad.

Decisive Battle Under Way.

In the six mile area that still separates
the relief force (rom the beleaguered
}garrison a decisive battle is believed to
be in progress. The British official re-
ports show the Turks to be in a perilous
‘ position If the main Kritish force at
Kut-el-Amara is as strong as is esti-
matedi—about 45,000—-a succesefu) sortie

The announcement of Secretary Cham-
| berlain follows :

| by the War Council, It would not be

the operations now tn progress. In-

formation of that kind in the present

circumstances would be far more val-

Kut-el-Amara.
