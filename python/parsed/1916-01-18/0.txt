Mexican immigration authorities at

Watson was notified that 1,000 Car-

and that the situation was safe for the

These particulars are set forth in a

ing as reporter on the Morning Regis-
ter of Newark, N. J. At the same time
ahe was Newark correspondent for the
New York Totbune

Then the Tribune discovered her sex,
according to her autobiography. In those
days there were few women engaged in

journalism, and for this reason, she
says, she was discharged, Through Miss
Kate Field, a well known woman re-

porter of that time, she got a letter to
the Herald, which secured her the po-
sition of book reviewer

Soon afterward, with her brother,

editorial staff of the old Scribner's Maga-
zine, which afterward became the Cen-
tury.

writer of the magazine and wrote criti-
cisms of music, art, the drama, turned
out essays and fiction, and at the same
time furnished special correspondence
covering the saine broad fields to the
daily newspapers, usually for the Sun-
day magazine pages.

Among the books she has written are

 

“Taken by Siege.” “Pen Portraits of
Literary Women,” “Essays From the
Critle,” “Representative Poems of Living

Poets,” “Authors at Home,” “The Auto-
biography of a Tomboy” (which is her

‘autobiogiapuy), “The Tomboy at Work"
‘and others

She wrote a drama, “Quits,” which was

produced in Philadelphia, and drama-
tized “Sevenoaks” and “A Wonderful
Woman.”

She was active in the anti-suffrage
ranks. She said she believed in the
mental equality of men and women, but
{n the physical, This’ difference,
she sald, was a bar to universal suf-
frage.

At the beginning of the recent dance
craze she manifested an active interest

that we will insist that it shall be done,”
said Judge Wadhams.

President Wilson as saying that he is
convinced that the office of deputy col-

would never creep in with his approval.

Special Cable Despatch to Tar Sus

Lonpon, Jan, 17.—Further evidence
of the far reaching nature of Capt. von
Papen'a financial transactions in con-
nection with German propaganda in the
United States has been disclosed by a
closer examination of the check stubs
and documents taken from the recalled
military attache by the Br&ish authori-
tes

The

dossier,

check stubs in
which

the now famous
waa turned over to the

American Embassy here, show many en- |

tries of payments to Paul Koenig, head
of the Hamburg-American Steamship
Company's secret service in New York,
who recently waa indicted for plotting to
biow up the Welland Canal in Canada,
The items are conveniently and signifi-

eantiv labelled “For secret service
work.’ The payments range from $100
to $500. There are many of them, and

they are the nost frequent of any pay}

ments noted in the stubs

Next in frequency is the name of G.
von Skal, to whom payments were made
through the Yorkville National Hank
and the Fourth National Bank of Phila-
delphia. There are frequent itema of
payments to the German Consulate at
New Orleans,

The extent of Capt. von Papen's activi-
ties is shown by a large number of pay-
ments through Knauth, Nachod &
Kuhne of New York and the Harriman
National Bank
payments were made
Ryan of Buffalo.

Other significant items show
to Max von Hoezen at New Haven for
“dumdum support.” Another item is
Glaser of Bridgeport, to whom payment
was made in December, Through Am-
sinck & Co. of New York a payment
of $800 was made to the Herg Fuse
Factory. The name of von Ingel ap-
pears many times.

The carefulness with which Capt. von
Papen recorded small items is evidenced
by the manner with which he entered
