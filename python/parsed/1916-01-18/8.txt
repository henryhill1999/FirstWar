Dorizas Breaks Bone
Shielding Opponent
HILADELPHIA, Jan. 17.—

Mike Dorizas, Penn’s

Greek all around athlete, may

be lost to the Red and Blue

wrestling team as a result of an
accident in the gymnasium.

Dorizas’s left shoulder is injured

and it is feared the shoulder-

blade is broken.

On Saturday night he was
grappling with a Greek friend,
A. Papsouris, in the wrestling
room of the Penn gym when the
accident happened. Dorizas had
thrown his opponent, who weighs
only 148 pounds, several times,
and on one occasion, rather than
fall on his light antagonist, Mike
threw his shoulder underneath
his opponent to break his fall.
In doing so he injured himself,
