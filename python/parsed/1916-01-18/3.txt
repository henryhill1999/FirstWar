MEXICO GAVE A SAFE

a from Secretary Lansing as to
authority of previous atatements re-
Ported to have been made by him to the
@ffect that he had been instructed to get

 

safe conducts for the Americans who |

were killed, said that the Department in
‘Washington had directed him on Jan-
,@ary 3 to request the Carranza Govern-
x jomt to protect the district of the Cusi
ae Company and that such protec-
“was promised immediately by the
Sarhoritice at Juarez.”
n view of the mixup growing out of
the steps taken by American officials to
assurances of protection for Ameri.

citizens it is probable that American,

Gonsuls in Mexico will be cautioned not
te take too much responsibility on thet:
@wn ehoulders in these mattora, and that
; n @ubordinates in the Department
j will be restricted to sending only
@uch communications and instructions to
\Gonsuls as are approved by the Secretary
, Btate.

High officials of the Department ex-

wil) eand to the Senate in response to
the resolution of Senator Fall of New

Mexico calling on the State Depart-.
ment for a full report of all facts relat- |

to the Mexican situation prior and

t to the recognition of Car-|

ganse by the American (Government.
Although admitting that this report
weuld include a list of all Americans
filied in Mexico since the revolution
against Madero began, and as far ae
pessible a summary of American owned
rties destroyed, the Secretary flatly
ned this afternoon to indicate the
acope of the report or the various
discussed. He explained that it
would be for the Senate to determine
whether or not the information should

fe made publia

Collecter Cobb’s Report.

The report which the Department re-
to-day from Collector of Customs

> and which it was announced was
ained from reliable witnesses from
eo, some of whom were associated

the Watson party,” was as follows;
Imes, the only survivor of the
™aseacre, has no knowledge as to
whether Wation and companions re-
a military escort or guard for

trip from Chihuahua to Custhutri-
acthic. He says that if they did so the
euthorities declined to furnish an escort
@@ guard. Hoimes adds that all of the
or, of the party felt safe in making

“It is reported by a person connec-
te4 with one of the companies operating
im Chihuehua that on the day ihat the
Americans who were killed started for
= works he had a conversation with

and asked him if a Mexican
escort was to accompany his party. He
weplied that such an escort would not
accompany them, as he had taiked with
the authorities ond i they told him it was
Mot necessary.

“As to what assurances, if any, Wat-
@en and companions had received from
Mezican authorities thut it would be
wafe to resume operations at Cusihuiria-
chlo, knowing that the mines were situ-
ated at Cusi and tbat the purpose of
the return of Watson and companions to
Mexico was to resume operation of these
mines, the immigration authorities in
Juarez, on aplication of the El Paso
agents of the Cusi company, gave a
general passport to the Watson party.
The Governor of Chihuahua also gave
@ Personal passport to Watson.

“Watson went to Chihuahua and war
there on Januery 4 to ascertain ff tc
would be safe to resume operations.
While there he got the de facto authort-
ties to send a gurrison and meintain it
at Cusi. On that day three trains of
troops of twenty care each supposed to
carry a total force of 1,000 men, in charge
of Gen. Jose Cavazos, of the de facto
Government, left Chihuahua for Cus! at
9 A.M and 1:30 and 4 P. M. tespec-
tively,
6 1:30 train also carried the Mexi-
ean civilians, the Hopes and Lowees, em-
ployees of the Cusi Mining Company;

wardo Enriques, employee of the Cusi

cana Company, and Pascual All-
aga, employee of the Minas San Juan
y Anexes Company, another American
owned compary in the Cusi camp. En-
riques is a brother of the de facto Gov-
uttior of the State of Chihuahua, After

Batisfied that a gartison wus going
to the camp and after the second mili-

tary train had left Chihuahua, Watson
left for El Paso at 4 P. M.

“On January 6 the Chihuahua agent
of the Cus! company, with whom [ have
just talked in my office, telegraphed
Watson at El Paso in reference to the
above named civilian passengers on sald
seoond military train the information
received by him at Cust by phone, as
follows: ‘Boys arrived Cusi safely last
|Might. They found everything quiet

over there.’

“As this telegram mentioned the boys

without mentioning the troops, Watson
to make certain that #
Warrison was established at Cusi, tele-
| graphed the Chihuahua agent: ‘Wire ir
troops arrived ut Cusi and trains run.

on the same dav,

ining Northwestern. To which the
Chihuahua agent replied on the same
day: ‘Troops arrived Cus. Since yes-

terday evening Northwestern trains suse
pended indefinitely account no fuel.’
“On the same day the Chihuahua
; agent also telegraphed Watson at El
| Paso: ‘Cust office reports everything
quiet’ and ‘Lopez telephones we have
just located two bags missing and we
are now receiving #ime in our office.’
“The missing bags referred to were
silver that had been stolen during a
previous Ipoting of the camp and per-
haps Indicated to Watson a restoration
of order with the establishment of the
military gurrison. Foregoing messages
are supposed to have been with Watson
on the trip to Cus!, as he took all the
records from E! Paso with him prepara-
tory to operating the offices at the prop-
erty.
| “Members of the party that rescued
the bodies etate these records and papers

the scene of the massacre. They did
not try to gather them because of ap-
proaching darkness and presence of Vil-|
lista bandits on nearby hills. Copies
from which the foregoing were taker
were furnished by Western Union offices
at El Paso.

“Having passports tssued by authort-
tles and & garrison having been estab-
lished which they understood to number
1,000 men, they had ample assurance
that It would be saf@ to resume opera-
tions at Cus},

“Upon the question of safety en route:
The de facto authorities had run three
military trains to Cusi on the 4th and,
as afterward came to the notice of the
party, was that day running a special
out to pick up and bring back the equip-
ment used for these trains.

Trapped the Watson Party.

“It wae this special that blocked the
track and trapped the Watson party.
The train which blocked the track at
Kilometer 68 on January 10 consistea

of engine 6507 and water car and
caboose, all National Railways, and
was operated by a@ crew of the
National Railways, which National

Railways are operated by
Government authorities. Therefore the
crew in charge of this train were em-
ployees of the de facto Government.

“The train left Chihuahua at 9:30
A. M. Before leaving the members of
the crew stated that the train was
going to Cus! to pick up and bring
back to Chihuahua the National Ratl-
ways equipment which had been used
in sending a garrison to Cusi a few
days previous.

“The first information that the North-
western liallroad officials had of it was
the notice at Chihuahua when the train
Was ready to leave Chihuahua that morn-
ing. This train was derailed ut kilometer
68 by treason of the fact that two rails
had been removed from the track. The
first information that the Northwestern
Railroad officials had of the derail-
ment was received at Chihuahua be-
tween 2 and 3 o'clock, positiveiy after
2 o'clock.

“As the

the de facto

passenger train
the Watson party left Santa Ysabel
at 1:20 and had only eight kilometers
to run, which i6@ usually run in about
fifteen minutes, it is seen that the In-
formation first received at Chihuahua

conta'ning

of the derailment of the firet train was
received after the massacre wf the
party in the second train.

“Gen, Carranza sent
here to-day the following communica-
tion which he said had been ant to
Gen. Jacinto B. Trevino commanding
the Carranza forces at Chihuahua, b)
forty-two Americans, who signed the
paper:

“DeAR GENERAL! The undersigned

E —_|$8,000,000 TRIBUTE

| CONDUCT TO VICTIMS| 10 HEMP MONOPOLY

 

Mexican Scheme Will Cost
U.S. Farmers That Amount,
Tt Is Said.

 

INQUIRY 1s INVITED

 

Wheat growers of the United States
will find their cost of production tn-
creased between $7,500,000 gnd $8,000,-
000 this coming harvest. They will have
to pay just that much more for the
binder twine they must use, and it wil!
go as tribute to the Carranza Gov-
ernment of Mexico and a group of
American bankers and Mexican business
men operating as the Pan-American
Commission Corporation.

The basis of it all 1a a monopoly of
the hemp, or sisal, industry of Yucatan,
Mexico, denounced tn Congress by Sen-
ator McCumber of North Dukota anc
Representative Cox of Indiana as absolute
in every respect. The two national legis-

lators have introduced resolutions call-
ing for an iavestigation of the Pan-
American Commission Corporation,
which hag a New York charter, and they,
with other Representatives in Congress
from the wheat growing States, declare
that they are being deluged with let-
ters from farmers’ associations and deal-
ers asking for some form of relief.
| Summed up, according to the declara-
tions made at Washington, the Carranza
Government, operating through Gen. Bal-
vador Alvarado, Military Governor of
Yucatan, a former Sonora merchant, has
rajeed the price of sisal, which ts an-
| other name for hemp, in New York from
5% cents a pound, which was the price
one year ago, to 7% cents @ pound,
the present figure.

This increase tn price of the raw ma-
terial will be reflected in an tne sreased |
price of finiehed product, and as the
United States uses about 200,000 tons
of twine annually the farmer must pay
at least $7,500,000 more, if the present
market price is maintained. It Is feared
that he will have to pay more than
that.

Confiecation Scheme.

The increased price does not mean
prosperity for the sieai growers of Yu-
catan. Reports received yesterday said
that the Government there has fixed a
flat price of 4 cents a pound to all
growere and in addition has been work-
ing out a scheme for the confiscation of
the haciendas, or eatates, which are to be
cut up into small parcels for growers
who will pledge themselves to sell only
to the Government. Many of the for-
mer landowners of the country are
now In New York city, exiled by official
or unofficial decrees.

Yucatan, autonomous by treaty which

Joined its fortunes with the Republic
of Mexico, has been called the most
enlightened and progressive of the States
of Mexico. Its inhabitants are of the
better class of Spanish descent, while the
peons are the peaceful Mayu Indians.
Yucatan never joined in any revolu-
tion against Porfirio Diaz, Madero

Huerta or became seriously
with Carranza or Villa. Only once have
the people of Yucatan appeared in arms,
and that was against the ten day regime
of Gobernador Santos and his band of
radicals, who had threatened the homes
and the families of the country with the
fate of the Mexicans of the north. The
people rose then and chased Santos out
in February, 1915, thereafter making but
a faint show of resistance against
Carranzistas who went into the State.
Gen, Alvarado succeeded in March,

EXPEDITION TO FIGHT
TYPHUS IN MEXICO

 

 

Guggenheims Will Finance It
—New York Surgeons
in the Party.

Ln Paso, Tex., Jan, 17.—Eminent au-
thorities on typhus fever will go into
Mexico to conduct experiments and stop
the typhus epidenie
to-day by Dr. Carl Ke. Husk, chief sur-
geon of the American Smelting and Re-
fining Company, that the Guggenheims
are planning to finance an expedition to
Mexico where a typhus hospital will be
constructed

Typhus ts menacing employees of the |

company in several of their plants. Dr.
P. K, Olitsky of the Mount Sinai Hospi-
tal i) New York, which was partly en-
dowed by the Guggenhelms, will join the
party at the border He worked with
Ir. Plotz, who was the discoverer of the
typhus germ. The discovery was made |
at the Mount Sinai Hospital Dr. Plots |
is now in Serbia conducting experiments
there with serum.

Dr. EK. Libman, another noted author-
ity on typhus and other fevers, will come
to the border at Laredo with Dr. Olitz-
sky in a special car equipped with ap-
1 satus for tighting typhus and will be
joined there by Ter, Husk, who has been
making his headquarters in El Paso,

Dr. Husk now has typhus serum and
{s inoculating the officials and employees
of the American Smelting and Refining
Company. The entire expense of the ex-
pedition will be met by the Guggen-
heims. Dr. Husk says this will be the
first time that the typhus serum will
have been used in an epidemic

“Dr, Plotz took the serum to Serbla,
but found that Dr. Strong, who had pre-
ceded him, had succeeded with the as-
sistance of the other American surgeons
in stamping out the epidemic before his
arrival,” said Dr, Husk to-day. “This
makes our proposed expedition all the
more Important, for it will be the first
time it will have been used in an epi-
demic,

“The expedition
with the Red Cross,
set for the departure of the expedition,
as we are waiting for permission from
Gen. Carranza and for the arrival of Dr.
Olitsky and Dr, Libmnan of San Antonio,

“Dr, Libman is superintendent of the
laboratory at the Mount Sinal Hospital
and is recognized as an authority In his
branch.”

Revolution breeds disorder, but with
revolution supposedly past Mexican dis-
order continues almost undiminished.
The damage done by the looting of pri-
vate property and the deaths resulting
from plain murder are far in excess of
all the damage done for anything resem-
bling a military reason.

Property has been lost in all revoiu-
tions, but it is not the customary thing
for the “patriots” to profit by this alr
cumstance. It is not customary to con-
tinue the practices of revolution simply
because the patriot does not wish to go
back to work and would rather mb.

To begin with, no ordinary citizenry
would tolerate the indefinite continu-
ance of the outrages when the last mo-
tive for them was gone. Mexico's 85 per
does tolerate it,
doubt will continue to be robbed and
raped and starved and murdered just
as long as the 16 per cent. choose to con-
tinue to do their patriotic duty toward
these ends. The question {s whether
Carranza can stop them.

MINERS TO DISCUSS WAGES.

Unton Offictals Will Confer With
Bitaminous Operators.

INDIANAPOLIS, Jan. 17.-——Officlals of the
United Mine Workers of America ac-
cepted a proposition of the operators of
Illinois, Indiana, Ohio and western Penn-
sylvania this afternoon which will result
in a resumption of the joint wage scale
negotiations for the central competitive

 

 

field.
The Administration's preparedness
policy, it ie known, will receive eoms

severe jolts when international officers
address the miners. The men are be-
lieved to stand in line with their English
brethren against war and against prep-
aration for war.

The miners, it was eaid, probably
would approve President Wilson's Mex!-
can policy.

The miners will demand a general tr-
crease in wages of 10 per cent, or over.

WILSON ON THE WIRE
TALKS TO BOYS CLUB

 

 

The public prosecu-| Wishes Youngsters of Ave. A

Suecess in Campaign to
Raise $500,000.

 

President Wilson in Washington last
night spoke to the boys at the Avenue A
Boys Club by long distance telephone,
wishing success to the campaign to raise
$500,000 in their behalf. The boys
cheered wildly for the President at the
conclusion of his short talk. The wires
were left open purposely and Mr. Wilson
heard the cheers.

The arrangements for the President's
talk were made by Robert &. Scarburgh
of the American Telephone and Tele-
graph Company, who also acted as
spokesman for the boys last night. The
beys, ranging from 7 to 15 years, who
had heard that the President was to
speak to them, were on hand hours be-
fore the scheduled time. By 8 o'clock
the large room of the club would hold
no more, but the boys still hung around
the doors. At one minute past § o’elock
a little red bulb on the table in the cen-
tre of the room flashed. The President
was on the wire. The 500 boys in the
room were eo quiet that everybody hear
the click when Mr. Scarbureh pickers
up the receiver.

“Mr. President,” he said, “this is Mr
rburgh, one of the committee to raise
100,000 to extend the work of the Boys

  

Club of Avenue A and the Newsboys
,Club, We have now about 5,000 mem-
‘bers There are several hundred of

phone receivers to thelr ears waiting to
hear you. These boys Ure sturdy, tnde-

{pendent little chaps whose only need is
;an opportunity

and an inspiration.
new quarters will afford them more op-
portunity and no tnspiration could be
greater than a few words from the
President of the United States, for they
are all real Americans.”

Then while the boys listened breath-
llessiy with the telephone recetvers to
thelr ears they heard the President say:

“T am very glad to have the oppor-
tunity to address a few words to the
boys. I hope you will have all success
in your great work. It !s one of the
i first signs of friendship for the young-
sters who bring us our newspapers. My
sympathy has alwaya been for the boys.
IT wish them all a happy new year.”

“Just a tmninute, Mr. President,’ Mr.
Searburgeh said. “Now, one, two, three,
| boys!” and with the connection still open
the boys let out a tremendous shout

  

which was heard all the way to Wash- |

ington.
The contrfbutions to the Boys
Association fund yesterday amounted to

‘$5,082, which brings the total for the
campaign to date up to $80,378.85. The
largest check of the day was from ld-
ward &. Hurkness of the standard Gu!
Company.

Comptroller Prendergast was the
speaker at the luncheon for team cap-
tains yesterday. Mayor Mitchel will be
