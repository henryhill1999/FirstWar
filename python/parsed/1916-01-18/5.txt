LOOKING TO CARRANZA.

The Fatility of the Administration's
Policy Is Already Manifest.

To Tun Epiror of THe SuN——Siry The |

Wilson Administration proposes in un-
exceptionable diction to do something
|}to Carranza unless the latter now

ready given ample evidence that he can-
not? That he is entirely futile and that
our Administration knowe tt and is help-
ing him cover up the fact Is proved by
the following deeds: Carranza’s second
most Important adherent, real or pre-
tended, is General Dieguez, in command
of the west coast of ‘Mexico, with head-
quarters in Mazatlan. I have in my,
possession a proclamation by General
Dieguez levying contributions on a great
many people in that vicinity, Including
$100,000 upon the Banco Occidental,
| which happens to be mostly owned by
foreigners, Only a few weeks after
Carranza had been formally recognized |
| the Wilson Administration telegraphed
| direct to our Consul at Mazatlan, Mr.
| Alger, to “make Dieguez reseind the |
order” about the Banco Occidental
That was just as if Sir Mdward ‘irey |
| should wire direct to the British Consul |
| in New,York to “make General Leonard
Wood rescind” some action he had taken,
It was currently reported in Mazatlan
that this remarkable demand upon
Dieguez was actually made at Care)
ranza’s request, which shows his own)

shows he can keep order, Hasn't he al-
|

estimate of his alleged control over his |
at

followers. There was no difficults
the time tn communicating direct
| Vera Cruz to Mazatlan. If Carranza
eannot control his own followers why |
expect him to do anything about this)
most recent massacre? This is only an- |
' other sample of the long series of con- |
cealments, evasions and downright mis-
leading acts and statements of the coun-
try by the Wilson Administration as to
{t# dealings with Mexico. It is time the
lid was ripped off and the truth let out. |

How many Americans have been
foully murdered in Mexico and the re-|
ports of their deaths buried in the
State Department? <A gentleman with
whom I spent severa; days in) Car
| Tanza territory alrout November 1

ast was atrociously murdered in his
| Ded by Mexicans «a few days after

 

|
I ieft him, I know it was promptly |
reported to our Consul at Mazatlan, but!
never a word of it has appeared in our

  
  

| papers so fae as I have eeen. He was
, W.S. Windham of Los Angeles and was
iu highiv cultivated gentleman Though !
}almost an invalid he could not accept)
Wilson's solicitous fnvitatio > "wet out)
‘of Mexico.” He had to et there and
! work Ils ranch or | s family in Los]
Angeles 60 hun while “watchful!

Waiting’ continued its placid way,

 
     

 

  

 

| How nmny more such cases are there
Jon reeord in the State Department:
| How many reports of outraged Ame

VICIOUS MAGAZINES.

With This Warning to Parents an)
Unpleasant Subject Is Dismissed.

To THE Epitor or THe SuN=-Sir; Une |
der the heading “Suppressing Fake |
Vice” you ask certain questions, which |
1 am disposed to answer, not eas an
individual but as the representative of
an organization and of a work, Our
young sons and daughters form a vers
iarge percentage of the element for)
whose benefit all prohibitive laws are |
enacted, These in a few years will be |
the men and women, the fathers and)
mothers of our country, These will be
supplanted after not so many years by |
their offspring, deriving their moral
calibre from their parents, the boye and
girls of to-day. lan't it worth while
in the interest of coming generations to
safeguard the morals of the children of
tueday?

Tt {s only within recent years that
serious effort has been made to stup the
promiscuous traffic in nareotic drugs

“

minds and bodies of those indulging in
The Insidious effect of vicious
literature upon the immature ie ten times
more widespread because in the guise
of current fiction magazines vicious
literature is so easily obtainable.

And so, when you say, ‘Tf they, vicious
magazines, have any steady read-
era, can such stupid gulls be really |
worth the vice suppressors too much |
heralded attention?” I take it that you,
write of gullible men, not of the young |
people whose welfare is affected by just!
such publications. If that which harms |
the younger generation Is not worthy of}
a suppressors attention, nothing in the |
world {s worthy of attention. If we are |

|

|
|

 

so immoral as to be oblivious to the |
of our own children, the |

sooner the race dies out the better. |
The stories fy hh publications may |
