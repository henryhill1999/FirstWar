But there are a great number of little unfortunates who
literally LIVE ON THE STREETS and who get the wrong
kind of training and education there.

It is for these other little boys that the Boys’ Clubs are

being organized and equipped.

To carry on this work properly we have undertaken to
raise $500,000. by January 21st for a new building, for
gymnasium apparatus, for books and magazines—for the
necessary equipment to care for the boys ina careful, effec-

tive way.

Won't you help in this splendid work

better boys?

of building

You are invited to visit the Boys’ Club at 161
Avenue A, to see for yourself what wonderful help is

being given the other little fellows.
