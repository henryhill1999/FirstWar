THE MUNSEY ARTICLE!

 

Publication Probably Will
Come Up at John Skelton
Williams Hearing.

 

ON IT

STORTES DIFFER

 

Weeks Believes Statement in
Washington “Times” Had
Official Earmarks.

WasurneTon, Jan, 18.—When the Sen-
ate in executive session takes up the
consideration of the nomination of John
Skelton Williams to be Comptroller of
the Currency, as it will probably do to-
morrow, it is likely that there will be
rome comment on the mystery surround-
ing the origin of a statement printed in
the Washington Times on November 22,
the day after the acquisition by the Mun-
sey ‘Trust Company of the United States
Trust Company.

hie statement was printed in Frank

A. Munsey's Washington Times under the |

caption; ‘Treasury backs the Munsey
Trust.’ The alleged statement from the
Treasury Department aroused ingigna-

tion among local bankers. For example,
{t contained the following:

eThe Munsey was the best qualified bank
jy) Washington to handle the situation.

This company has the largest reserve

fund—more cash on hand—than pernape |

any other Washington institution.”
It was this part of the statement to

which the local bankers objected and |

which appears to have been wholly un-
warranted when the financial condition
of the Munsey Trust Company, as shown
by its statement of {ts condition at the
close of business October 21, is com-
pared with the known condition and re-
sources and condition of other financial
institutions in Washington.

Denials by McAdoo and Williams.

Some time after this alleged official
statement appeared tn Mr. Munsey’s news-
paper an explanation was put out that
neither Secretary McAdoo nor Assistant
Recretary Williams had knowledge of It,
but that one of the private secretaries was
responsible for it. However, as late as
Dece:nber 7 the Times in a lead written
to an interview given out by Frank A.
Munsey while the Munsey deal was under
eriticjsm, said of Mr. Munsey's statements:

He states the facts concerning the re-
sources of the Munsey Trust Company—
facts which moved the Treasury to refer
to it as the concern best equipped to
handle the emergency.”

Milton BE. Ailes, vice-president of the
itiggs National Bank, sought to read this
statement before the Senate Banking
Committee last week as tending to show
that Assistant Secretary Williams had
shown favoritism to the Munsey Trust
Company, of which his brother, R. Lan-
caster Williams, Is @ director.

Senator Reed of Missouri raised a pro-
test against the reading of the statement,
but Senator Bristow insisted that it
should go in. Finally Stuart Oliver of the
Munsey ‘Trust Company of Baltimore,
whe was at the committee hearing and

who had carried on the negotiations on
behalf of Frank A. Munsey for the taking
over of the United States Trust Company,
asked permission to explain the state-

ment.
As members of the committee tell the

story
(Oliver) wrote the statement at the re-
quest of some one tn authority on Mr.

Munsey’s newspaper to use as an edi-
terial on the situation, and the statement,
» mistake, was published as an official
siatement from the Treasury Department.

his was the first time that such an
explanation of the origin of the statement
had ever been offered, Other explanations
nad been given, among them the state-
ment that one of the private secretaries
at the Treasury Department had writtea
it.

Senator Weekes Suspicious.

ter Mr. Oliver had made his disclosure

the statement bore evidence of having

“The Anti-Sulcide Association has come

object is the betterment of men and
women, grownups as well as young folk.
The association gives a guarantee to drive
away the blues and make life worth liv-

But the plan is to be undertaken seriously.

“Our alm will be to assist all persons
who contemplate suicide.”

“Do you mean exactly what you say?’
the judge was asked.

“TL mean,” replied the president, “that

will help them to forget !t.”

that Julian Hawthorne had written for

the prison. Price told his story while
waiting to take the train for his home in
New York.

“LT wish to God I could say something
that would help the boys back there,’
he cried. “They are being abused and mis-
treated and almost killed day after day. It
is just a hell hole of suffering and anguish

“The authorities just laugh at the tales
of cruelty, and McKelway, the investiga-

to tell you that no later than yesterday
there was a near riot at the prison when
the guards clubbed two negroes over the
