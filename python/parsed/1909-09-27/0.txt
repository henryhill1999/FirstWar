Matertal at Etah—Will Not
Send Proofs to Copenhagen Uni-
versity Until He Has Seen Whitney.

When Dr. Frederick A. Cook learned
- yesterday that Harry Whitney, the New
Haven sporteman who is returning from
the Arctic, having made part of his jour-
ney on the Roosevelt, had left all of the
instruments and data that Dr. Cook had
him in a cache at Etah, because
Peary would not allow any
of Dr. Cook’s property on the Roosevelt,
Dr. Cook said he was practically bound
hand and foot so far as his ability to prove
within the immediate future that he dis-
Covered the north pole.

Dr. Cook received this message from
Whitney yesterday:

@rnatucona, via Indian Harbor and Cape
Ray, N. F., September 25.
Dr. F. A. Cook, Waldorf, New York:

Started for home Roosevelt. Nothing ar-
Bived for me. Peary would allow nothing
belonging to you on board. Said to leave
everything in cache at Etah. Met Capt.
@am, North Star. Did not go back after
@oing schooner bound S8&t. John’s take
Steamer home. Hope you well. See you
goon. Explain all. Good shooting

“I can't very well do anything now
until I have had a talk with Mr. Whitney,”
maid Dr. Cook in an interview last night
at the Waldorf.

“Until I have gone over the whole
matter with Mr. Whitney I \shall not
gubmit the reports and memoranda
which I now have with me to the Uni-

versity of Copenhagen. I have proofs,
plenty of them, but I have waited for Mr.
Whitney to corroborate my statements
by producing the instruments and all of
the data which I gave him when at Etah.”

“Will Whitney's action seriously compli-
@ate mattérs for you?” Dr. Cook was asked.

“Well, I don't know,” he replied.

“You have said that without the instru-
ments which you left with Mr. Whitney
for safe keeping you would be unable
to corroborate conclusively the proofs
which you now have in your possession,
haven't you?”

The explorer was slow in replying. He
stared for a few minutes into blank space
and then said:

“I had counted on his bringing the in-
etruments and everything with him. Nat-
urally I am disappointed.”

“But if the|reports are true that Mr.
‘Whitney left all documentary proof be-
hind and that you will be unable to obtain
from him what you.bave been waiting
“Jor, how long wif it be after you have
‘talked with him before you will send your
statement to the University of Copen-
hagen?”

“I cannot say,” was the reply.

Dr. Cook did not object to being plied
“with questions and he answered all that
were put to him in his methodical way.

“What is the trouble with sending to
Etah for those things which are so valuable
to you and which have been left there by
Mr. Whitney?” asked one of the reporters.

“Nothing much except the ice and
darkness,” replied the explorer with his
smile, “but that is enough. It is im-

possible for any boat to reach Etah at
this season on account of the new ice
which is forming and also the darkness,
which at times seemsimpenetrable. Of
course I would send for everything if
it were possible, but from the way things
look now all thoughts of obtaining them
will have to be given up until next spring.”

“You have sent) or intend to send
for the Eskimos who accompanied you,

vido you not?”

“Yes, but Iam unable to say when they
will arrive. Probably many months
will elapse before they can be brought to
the pivilized world.”

Some one asked Dr. Cook whether he
had any cause to believe that Mr. Whit-
ney might favor Commander Peary
rather than himself in the north pole
controversy.

“Mr. Whitney will not favor either of
us. You can count on whatever Mr.
“Whitney says. I know him to be square.
He will not take the part of either Mr.
Peary or myself. He will tell the truth.”
‘ When asked what the relations were
between him and Peary at present Dr.
Cook replied:

' “I don't know.”

This was the favorite expression used
to answer most of the questions which
were put to the doctor.

“Has any definite arrangement been
made for a meeting between you and your
rival?”

“Not to my knowledge,” he replied,
laughing.

There was something about the ex-
plorer’s laugh which implied that such a
meeting might be a joke, but he did not
eay 60.

One of the reporters wanted to know
more about the instruments left with
Harry Whitney.

Dr. Cook said:

instruments as well as several
other things which would be very desira-
ble for me to have before submitting all
of my statistics to the University of
en have been packed carefully

in waterproof boxes.”

Here the doctor described
hands the sizes of the boxes.

“They are stored away in a place of
eafe keeping with most of the parapher-
nalia used by the expedition. It is made
up in part of furs, sleeping bags, sledge
runners and sledges.”

In response to a question as to whether
he used the same kind of sleds as Com-
meander Peary Dr. Cook said:

~ “Peary’s sleds were patterned after
those used by the Eskimos. If they
differed in any way from those made by
the natives it was in the wood. Mr.
Peary could not have modelled his sledges
after mine, for they were of my own
They were constructed in the far
h.”

When asked other questions relative
to his quest of the pole Dr. Cook said:
* “Gentlemen, don’t you think you have
gone far enough? What I have not ale
ready given out about the trip will s00n

in the story written by me.”

Br. Cook looked unusually well last

'

with his

evening. His resting during the last
day or two has brought fresh color into
his cheeks.

Many friends of Dr. Cook and others,
several notable visitors in town, it was
said, called upon him yesterday, but were
not admitted. No one was permitted to
see him until after 9 o’clook at night,
when he talked with the ' He

WHITNEY BELIEVES COOK.

Says Eskimes Corroberate His Claim
—Peary Wouldn't Carry Cook's Papers.
Special Cable Despatch to THE SuN.

Paris, Sept. 27.—The Paris edition of
the Herald prints a despatch from its
correspondent ~on board the steamer
Jeanie with Harry Whitney, sent by wire-
leas from Indian Harbor, giving Whit-
ney’s account df his meeting with Dr.
Cook on April 7, when Cook told him he
had passed two days at the pole.

When Cook left on a sledging trip to
Upernavik he intrusted Whitney with his
sextant and horizon finder, as Whitney
said a ship was certain to come for him.
Cook requested him to tell Peary only
that he (Cook) had passed Peary's record,
but not to say anything a about his finding
the pole.

This Whitney promised, and therefore
he did not tell Peary or afly one aboard
the Roosevelt what Cook had told him
about his success. Fearing that no ship
might arrive, Whitney determined to re-
turn with Peary. The latter told him
in the mdst emphatic way that he would
not take anything on board belonging to
Cook. He added that he would say no
more abeut it, but would trust Whitney's
word of honor that he would not take any-
thing with him belonging to Cook.

Whitney was therefore forced to un-
pack the instruments, flags and boxes,
of the contents of which he was ignorant,
and leave them on the rocks at Etah,
where they now are. Peary refused also
to take Cook's sledge, which Cook had
given to Whitney, on which Cook had
made his entire journey.

Whitney ends by expressing faith in
Cook's story, which the Eskimos corrob-
orated so far as Whitney was able to
understand. *

WHITNEY BOUND SOUTH.

Satis From Indian Harbor on the Jeanie
—Due in St. John's on Wednesday.

Sr. Joun’s, N. F., Sept. 26.—Harry
Whitney left Indian Harbor yesterday
afternoon for St. John's in the schooner
Jeanie. It is expected that he will
arrive here about Wednesday.

AUTOS KILL TWO CHILDREN,

Two More Are Injured, but Are Expected
te Recover.

An automobile owned by James T.
Lee, a lawyer, who lives at 666 West End
avenue, ran up on the sidewalk in 100th
street yesterday afternoon, killing a two-
year-old child and badly injuring an-
other girl. The machine was driven by
Mr. Lee's chauffeur, Frank Carlo, of 335
East 148th street. He was alone in the
car. The child killed was Marie De Marco
of 239 East 109th street. Dora Trom-
boni, 8 years old, who lives at the same
address, was severely cut on the head.

Carlo was on his way to an under-
taker’s shop to return some chairs that
Mr. Lee used on Saturday during the
celebration. A crowd of youngsters got
in front of the car and yelled at him.
To avoid running them down he turned
to the sidewalk. He didn't see the Marco
girl or Dora Tromboni. The car crashed
into an iron railing, pinningthe children
under it. Marie De Marco was killed in-
stantly. The machine is a wreek.

On the advice of his employer Carlo
gave himself up to the police of the East
104th street station, after he had run
away from & crowd of Italians who acted
ugly. He was locked up. His employer
said he was a careful driver.

Joseph McCarthy, 7 years old, of 241
West Forty-sixth street, was run over and
killed by a taxicab driven by Charles
Kopp of 501 West Forty-sixth street at
Eighth avenue and Forty-sixth street
yesterday afternoon.

The boy with his sister was on his way
home when the accident happened. The
children were playing as they crossed the
avenue and the boy ran into the roadway
as the automobile came along. Kopp
brought his machine to a quick stop after
the accident and took the boy's body to
the West Forty-seventh street police sta-
tion. He was arrested, charged with
homicide. ,

A third automobile accident happened
at Broadway and 13ist street, where Wi|l-
iam Portner of 1922 Broadway ran over
Amelia Gross, 14 years old, of 570 West
18iet street yesterday afternoon. She
was crossing the street on her way to the
North River to see the warships when the
machine knocked her down. She was

 

 

 

 

badly cut. At St. Luke's Hospital they
said she would recover. Portner was not
arrested.

GREAT SPANISH VICTORY.

Fortress of Nador Captured With Disas-
trous Losses to the Moors--End Near.
Spectal Cable Despatch to Ta® Sun.

MapDriD, Sept. 26.—The Spanish forces
in Morocco captured yesterday the town
of Nador, an important position on the
road to Zeluan. The fighting which pre-
ceded the capture was severe, and the
Moors again sustained heavy losses.

The native villages around Nador were
burned.

The Moors made an attack at night
upon the Spaniards in Nador, but were
repulsed and shattered by artillery.

The capture of this place is regarded
here as likely to have an important in-
fluence on ending the Riff resistance. The
Spaniards now surround three sides of
Mount Gurugu, the central] Riff strong-
hold, and with the capture of, Nador
Zeluan is regarded as doomed.

YORK, MONDAY

CONSENTS “FINALLY TO RUN
FOR DISTRICT ATTORNEY.

 

Candidate Bannard, Chairman Parsons
and Other Leaders Make the Request
and He Yields Under Pressure— Fusion
for President of This Borough.

Ex-Judge Charles S. Whitman will be
the Republican candidate fop District
Attorney. This was settled beyond all
doubt yesterday when Judge Whitman
gave his consent to the Republican
leaders to run. He will be indorsed by
the committee of 100 and by the other
bodies remaining in the fusion confer-
ence. The county convention will be
held on Wednesday evening.

Concerning Judge Whitman's nomina-
tion it was said yesterday that Mr. Ban-
nard had practically insisted upon Judge
Whitman going on the ticket with him
and that Mr. Bannard and Mr. Bannard’s
friends had added all] the influenge they
could muster to the already great pres-
sure that had been brought to bear on
Mr. Whitman to induce him to run. Mr.
Whitman's personal feelings were against
it, so some of his friends said, but as a
result of this pressure he finally con-
sented yesgerday to have his name go on
the ticket.

Mr. Whitman, according to the best
information obtainable, was the leading
candidate for Mayor in the fusion confer-
enoe practically every time an informal
vote was taken. In fact he remained s0
right to the end, but as the nominating
committee failed to agree on any of the
men discussed the Republicans then went
ahead and named Mr. Bannard. It was
intimated that the Republicans didn't
name Whitman for Mayor because every
time the nomination for District Attorney
was discussed all hands were unanimous
for him. No other name was mentioned
seriously, because it was asserted that his
strength with the voters was needed to
help pull out the New York county ticket.

Just as soon as Mr. Bannard had been
named on Thureday it is known that Mr.
Parsons and the other Republican leaders
besieged Mr. Whitman, but it was only
yesterday that it was announced that
they had been successful in getting him
to consent to run. Mr. Whitman, it is
expected, will be the most active figure
in the Republican campaign in Manhat-
tan and The Bronx, and the leaders pre-
dicted that the campaign would surpass
the campaign he made for Judge two
years ago, when practically alone and
unassisted he cut the Tammany vote
away down and ran nearly 15,000 ahead
of his ticket. He came within 9,000 votes
of carrying New York county and his
friends pointed out that Mr, Taft only
beat this record by 8,000.

Another old campaigner who is to come
to the assistance of Candidate Bannard
is William M, Ivins, who was the Repub-
lican candidate four years ago. Mr.
Ivins has informed Chairman Parsons
that he is ready and willing to take the
stump and work for the ticket. ~

Mr. Bannard will get back from Chicago
to-morrow. On that day his headquar-
ters will be opened in the Fifth Avenue
Building. The official notification of the
candidates is expected to take place
Wednesday or Thureday. George H.
Bell is to be at the head of the speakers’
bureau for the Republicans. Mr Ban-
nard has not as yet selected his persona!
campaign manager. According to present
(plans Mr. Bannard, “Mr. Mitchel, the
candidate for President of the Board
of Aldermen, and Mr. Prendergast, named
for Comptroller, will campaign most of
the timetogether. Mr. Bannard, although
not much of a speaker, has made up his
mind to get into the campaign like a
veteran and cover the city nightly when
things get going.

The fusion plan, it was learned from an
authoritative source yesterday, is to be
followed in selecting the Republican
nominee for President of the Borough of
Manhattan. He is to be an independent
Democrat and will be one of these three
men: Robert Grier Monroe, Calvin Tom-
kins and John J. Hopper. Mr. Hopper
is one of the leading men in the Hearst
organization, which has withdrawn from
the fusion conference. It was denied,
however, that the consideration which
his name was receiving was to be taken
asan inducement for the Hearst men to
come back. Even the Hearst leaders
admit that they have !ost control of their
county and borough conventions to Tam-
many and hence could not officially in-
dorse any fusion candidate now.

It is also the plan of the Republicans
to put up independents in some of the
Assembly districts to carry out the fusion
movement and strengthen the city ticket.

Instead of Killing Family.

Cutcaao, Sept. 26.—The fate of a man,
@ woman and their five-weeks-old baby
hung yesterday afternoon on a throw of
the dice.-

Albert Chrisman, 49 years old, a
barber who has been without work for
weeks, cast the dice. The outcome of
his throw was that he is dead, his wife
is dying at the County Hospital and the
baby is being cared for by neighbors.

According to Mrs. Chrisman, her hus-
band had not had steady work for several
weeks. Since the birth of the baby he
had been spending for liquor the few
dollars he bad made. She and her child
have not had proper food and whea her
husband came home yesterday she ap-
pealed to him for money.

“Twenty cents is all [ have,” he said
as he displayed a dime and two nickels
in his open palm.

“Where did you agt that?” she asked.

“I begged it.”

“Well, I don't want food bought with
money you begged. Why don't you go
to work?”

Enraged at his wife's rebuke, Chris-
man went into the kitchen and took down
a dicebox. He decided that should two
aces appear he would kill himself, his
wife and the baby. Should two sixes
show hé would look for work. He cast
the dice and the two aces lay on the table
before him.

he said to his wife as he reappeared in

BALLOON MASSACHUSETTS HAD
TO LAND IN JERSEY.

 

Two Boston Men and the Pilot, Van Skeet,
Left Pittsfield, Mass., With Ambitions
for Southern Record—Long Island
Their Goal, but the Wind Changed.

The balloon Massachusetts, which
atarted from Pittsfield, Mass., at 2 o'clock
yesterday morning, landed shortly before

| noon near Newton, N. J. Van Skeet, the

 

pilot, had set his hopes on landing in
New York, but had to be content with
New Jersey as a stopping place. With
Van Skeet were J. B. Benton and Walter
Flagg of Boston. F

Mr. Flagg said that soon after the start
the balloon crossed the boundary line
between Massachusetts and New York
and held a course down the Hudson until
near Poughkeepsie, when a slant 6f wind
carried them west until they were over
New Jersey. It had been the intention at
the start, Mr. Flagg said, to try to reach
Long Island, a feat that several balloon-
ists have attempted from Pittsfield with-
out success.

BERLIN AVIATION FIASCO.

Only a Handful of Spectators at Johannis-
thal——No Successful Flight.
Spectal Cable Despatch to TuE Sry.

Berurn, Sept. 26.—The international
aviation week at Johannisthal, near
Berlin, opened to-day with a promise of
failure. The tribunes and enclosures on
the fleld were almost deserted and al-
though Berlin usually makes a holiday
of Sunday there was only a fringe of
spectators around the arena.

The competitions, which were scheduled
to begin at 1 o’olock, did not start until
4, and Baron de Caters of Belgium and
Biériot of France unsuccessfully tried
for the $2,500 prize. Both failed to
complete the minimum distance, twenty
kilometers.

Besa of Chile also made an attempt,
but could not get his aeroplane to rise.
Farman of France had his machine out
and inspected it, and then had it returned
to ite shed. Orville Wright did not at-
tend.

Le Biano, a ‘pupil of Biériot, made an
attempt, but overturned his machine,
which was damaged.

 

EX-BANKER CHANGES PRISONS,

Wiliam Montgomery Taken From Pitts-
burg to Leavenworth.
Pirrssvre, Sept. 26.—William Mont-
gomery, the coffvict banker and former
friend of United States Senator M. S
Quay, was to-day started from: Riverside
Penitentiary to the Government prison
at Leavenworth, Kan, This man, who was
for many years the financial backer and
confidential adviser of Senator Quay, was
driven through the streets chained to
other convicts.

Montgomery had been a’ most unruly
prisoner and it is hinted that he was at the
head of a plot to liberate many prisoners
soon and that this hastened his departure
for the Government prison.

Montgomery, who was Sentenced to
fifteen years at hard labor for wrecking
the Allegheny National Bank for $2,000,-
000, had been head of the bankers’ colony
in Riverside Penitentiary since his incar-
ceration and it is said practically ran the
prison to suit himself until the recent
induction of John Francis, Montgomery's
former pal, as warden. Instead of
allowing him to continue to run things
in prison, Francis threw Montgomery
into the dungeon.

 

WILL USE CANE ON LOVERS

Father Xavier of Yonkers Gives Warning
te Spoony Couples From His Pulpit.
Yonxers, Sept. 26.—The Rev. Henry F

Xavier of Yonkers announced from the

pulpit in St. Joseph's Reman Catholic

Church this morning his intention to

publicly chastise every couple in his

parish that he finds spooning in secluded
streets and lovers’ lanes. He said:

“I intend in future to use my cane upon
all the couples whom I catch sitting to-
gether upon the wall along North Broad-
way. The sauntering of young people of
opposite sexes along shady lanes at night
and spooning in dark corners must cease,

There are too many long ocourtships in

the parish. Every young lady who is

keeping company should not hesitate to
ask her suitor what his intentions are if
he calls frequently upon her and yet shows
no disposition to ask her to be his wife.”

Father Xavier spdke strongly in favor
of early marriages. He said:

“An old maid is as good around the
house as a watchdog. An old bachelor
is an abomination, generally a ‘crusty
individual who lives in a hall bedroom and
is ill at ease with hia neighbor and him-
self, If I had my way I would closet him
in a cellar, the darker the better.”

took a train for Boston.

PITTSFIELD, Maas., Sept. 26.—In the
balloon Massachusetts, which was re-
leased from the aero park this morning
shértly after 2 o'clock, were J. B. Benton
and Walter Flagg of Boston and Van
Skeet, the pilot. The balloon was
stripped and groomed for a long flight.
Nothing was carried but what was ac-
tually necessary. Van Skeet said before
he stepped into the basket that he
to reach Long Island. There was a bris'
breeze and the shot up rapidly
and was soon lost from sight. A tele-
gram received to-night stated the bal-
loon had landed in Sussex, N. J. Mr.
Benton is the city editor of the Boston
Tranacript.

MiIppDLEeTown, N. Y., Sept. 26.—A large
buff colored balloon bearing the »sname
Massachusetts passed over this city at
about 9:30 o'clock this morning. The
balloon was more than five hundred feet
in the air and as it entered the outskirts
of the city several bags of ballast were
thrown out and the big gas bag rose
rapidly.

There were three persons in the car.
At Stony Ford, five miles from this place,
the balloon passed over the railroad
station and Harry Wood, the agent, was
called out of his office by the shouts of
the aeronauts, who asked him where
they were. The balloon was last re-
ported fifteen miles from here, sailing
rapidly south in the direction of New
York.

BIG SKY FOR NEW THEATRE.

Back Drop of Huge Preportions Is Quick-
ly Painted in an Armory.

What is said to be the largest canvas
cyclorama ever constructed was painted
for the New Theatre on Saturday after-
noon in the Twelfth Regiment Armory.
The sheet, which is 200 by 117 feet, is de-
signed for permanent use in the theatre
and will be so arranged that it may be
raised and lowered in front of the back
stage wall in a way to give any kind of
sky effect desired.

When it became necessary to build a
ecyclorama breaking all records for size
Claude L. Hagen, the technical director
of the New Theatre, sent to England for
23,400 square feet of extra heavy linen.
When this arrived he engaged a corps
of sailors and they were set to work with
needies and thread. When the canvas
had been sewed it was tacked upon the
floor of the armory, occupying practically
all the drill space,and fireproofed. Sup-
ports upen which the canvas will be
wound were then built and fastened to
the top.

The work of coloring this great white
fleld was accomplished by twenty-one
scene painters. These men, with tin
tubs of paint and long brushes, were
then arranged in line and at a signal
began the work, backing up as they
progressed until the entire canvas had
been covered. The work required great
dexterity as a moment's pause would
ruin the entire canvas.

When the canvas is dry it will be rélled
on the supports and hung in the theatre.
As it weighs 3,524 pounds this will be no
light task. The top of the canvas when
hung will show a deep indigo blue. From
this the color lightens until at the bottom
it is nearly white. Any sky effect can be
had by lighting or by raising or lowering
the canvas until the proper shade is
reached.

Henceforth she will devote herself
to religious work among the poor. Her col-
leagues say she has been increasingly
religiously inclined for two years.

Indeed she had been contemplating
withdrawal from ‘the stage for many
months. She said to an interviewer:
“The soul of anybody who servea the
cause of the theatre heroically as we have
done must go to eternal ruin. The thea-
tre means ceasing to be. My decision
was not taken suddenly. I was long de-
termined to leave the stage and the world
and to devote myself to my Saviour.”

She added that her determination was
sealed by attending a meeting of the Sal-

ago, when she went to the penitentse’

parated from her husband, Stabernack,

STUDYING HIGH ALTITUDES.

Weather Burean Sends Up Balloons That
May Rise Ten Miles.

INDIANAPOLIS, Sept. 26.—Under the di-
rection of the United States Weather
Bureau two rubber balloons bearing a
basket containing registering instru-
ments were sent up late yesterday from
Riverside Park.

Simultaneously with the sending up
of the balloons here others were released
at Omabe and a similar experiment was
being made with a kite at Mount Weather,
Blue Mount, Va.

The balloons are expected to rise eight
‘or ten miles, when one will burst. The car-
rying capacity of tho other will not be
sufficient to sustain the basket, but will
allow it to descend slowly, registering
the atmospheric conditions at various
altitudes.

A notice to the finder is attached to
the balloons asking their return to Mount
Weather.

forth any confirmation of the report.

CAR RUNS DOWN A DEER.

Electric Train on New Haven Road Kills
a Buck.

Provipence, Sept. 26. —Three deer,
two does and a buck, appeared on the track
in front of an electric train of the New
York, New Haven and Hartford Rail-
road this forenoon and before the
motorman could slow down the first car
had struck and run over the buck.

The anima! was out completely in two.
Hie companions darted up the hill into a
grove at the left of the track.

The train was one of the early ones
from this city to Fall River and when
in East Providence, leas than a mile fram
the city line, the cars shot around a long
ourve, coming upon the small herd grazing
alongside the track. All three appeared
comparatively tame and it was not until
the cars were upon them that they started
to flee. *

Communication With Warships to Be Made
From a Special Station in Town.

leas apparatus has been installed with an
expert operator in attendance.

convenience and loss of time attendant
on sending a messenger to the anchorage
when an unexpected invitation to dinner
or other entertainment makes a dress
