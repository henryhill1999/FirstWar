Spartacans Lose Many Killed
in Vain Attack on Chan-

CoreNHAGEN, Jan. 9.—-Government
troops have occupied all the public
buildings in Berlin, and thousands of
Government troops are still entering
the capital.

The Berlin correspondent of the
Berlingske Tidende, who sends this
information, declares the Spartacans
have been beaten and that quiét was
partly restored to-day.

Serious Spartacus riots are going
on at Dresden, Brunswick, Dussel-

dorf, Essen and Dortmund, according |

to the Munich correspondent of the

Politiken, Several towns in the Ruhr |

district are in the hands of the Spar-
tacans,

Bloody fighting occurred at the
Anhalt railroad station Wednesday
night when Spartacan groups tried to
occupy the building, according to Ber-
lin advices received by way of Frank-

fort. They were repulsed by Govern-
ment troops, who inflicted heavy
losses.

There was lively shooting Wednes-
day forenoon at many foints, includ-
ing the Brandenburg Gate, which the
Qovernment forces had captured dur-
ing the night. Several persons were
killed or wounded.

The troops of the Government di-'

rected an incessant fire from machine
guns on the roof of the Chancellor's
Palace in the direction of Unter den
Linden and Wilhelmstrasse, Later the
fring increased in intensity, especially
in the neighborhood of the Branden-
burg Gate, and many more people were
killed.

 

An Appeal to the People

Basset, Jan. 9.—Troops loyal to the
Ebert Government have arrived in
Rerlin from Potsdam and driven the
Spartacans as far as the Tiergarten
and reoccupied the printing works, ac-
cording to the Frankfort Zeitung.

The Government, the newspaper adds,
has decided to take energetic measures
end has assembled a large number of
trocps. Premier Ebert has !ssued a man-
ifesto to the “workers, bourgeoisie and
soldiers’ denouncing the Sparacans as
being responsible for many persons
being killed and wounded. The mani-
festo continues:

“We must now accept the fight
which we have been forced.
hesitated too long and must be prepared
to intervene without restriction for the
defence of revolutionary order, We
appeal to you im the view of forming a
‘olunteer republican defence guard. We
must not stop until ordér has bean re-
established in Berlin and the people
essured the possibility of enjoying peace
and the fruits of the revolution.”

CHicago, Jan. 9,—Party leaders from
nearly every State arrived here to-
day to attend the meeting of the Re-
publican National Committee to be
held to-morrow. The session will be
in the nature of a political love feast
at which the Republican victory at the
Congressional élections last November
will be canvassed and plans for the
1920 Presidential campaign discussed.
Practically every State will be repre-
sented by the National Committeeman
