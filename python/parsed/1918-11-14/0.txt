ALL GERMAN THRONES GONE; ANARCH Y ENDS

 

REORGANIZED ARMY

UNIVERSAL SERVICE

Subject Will Be One of |

 

the Most Important Be.
fore Congress.

PLAN BEING PREPARED!

 

Existing Law Provides for a,
Permanent Establishment
of 375,000 Men.

 

Wasninctox, Nov. 18.—Plans for the |
reorganization of the War Department
end the army itself now are in process |
of formulation by the General Staff
and soon will be before Secretary |
Baker. Orders for the actual break-
ing up of the army cannot be pro- |
mulgated until these plans finally are
completed, as the demobilization pro- |
gramme is dependent to some extent |
upon the adoption of a reorganization |
policy.

The Secretary has indicated that
new legislation will be neceasary to
carry out the reorganization and is ex-
pected to lay a definite programme be-
fore Congress at the earliest possible
moment. This will reopen the whole!
question of universal ‘military train- ,
ing and many officials anticipate a/
jong legislative struggle before the
passage of the measure.

Existing law authorizes the mainte-
nance of a regular army of approxi-
mately 375,000 men. While it is not
possible as yet to forecast the number
of American troops that must be em-
Ploved in Europe, even after the peace |
vreatics have been signed, military men
believe now that the authorized regular
establishment cannot Provide an ade-
quate force for all purposés at Home and
abroad.

Only 100,000 Obligated.

Of the 3,700,000 men now under arms
probably not more than 100,9Q0 are un- |
der obligation to serve beyond the res-
toration of peace. There were some 7,000
officers and about 120,000 men in the
Hegular Army when war was declared.
Lxpiration of  enlistmer héwever,
probably has served to r this con-
siderably, and all.war time eniistments.
are for the war peridd only. |

Thousands of the officers now in ser- |
vice are on temporary commissions in
the regulat establishment. These com- |
missions were issued for a definite pe-|
riod of years, and the men might be!

neld, although the general attitude of |
the Department would not Indicate any
intention of holding such officers against:
their will when the war emergency has
passed,

The number of men necessary to be
maintained in Europe probably will be
worked out by Gen. Pershing’s staff, and
since similar calculations for the United
States and its possessions are being
made here it is expected that the size of
the army, for which it will be necessary
\© provide soon, will be arrived at.

Untversal Training Probable.

The General Staff's recommendations
as to the way the army is to be formed
are expected to embody the principle of
universal military training. A bill pre-
pared by the staff just before the United
States entered the war outlined the gen-
eral scheme, which {s likely to be again
advocated, modified in the light of war
experience and the results of the opera-
tion of the selective draft system.

At this time it was planned to con: |
tinue the garrisons for the Philippines, |
Hawali and Panama on a voluntary)
basis by seleeting men who elected army {
lffe after they had passed through thetr)
periods of training. Outside of these
overseas forces, however, the staff pro+!
posed to remodel the standing army into |
a strictly training force, composed of |
oficers and non-commissioned officers, ;
who thould be developed into experts in |
getting raw material quickly into shape |
and through whose hands, year after |
year, sbould pass the classes called to|{
the colors for training.

 

President Is Uncommitted.

Both the commissioned and non-com-
missioned ranks of this training force,
ity was planned, should be recruited from
men who displayéd ability duting their |
training. There is reason, to expect that
some similar project will again be
brought forward, although neither Presi-
dent Wilson nor Secretary Baker is now
commitied to universal training as a
national policy. In his last annual re-
port Mr. Baker sald it was not a ques-
tion which should ve decided while tho
country was at war.

Demobilization of the existing Officers’
Corps, both Hne and staff, forms a sep-
arate element of the present problems of

Total U. S. Casualties
Will Not Exceed 100,000 |

WASHINGTON, Nov. 13.—

War Department officials
now estimate that the total of
American casualties will not ex-
ceed 100,000. This will include
the men killed in action and who
died of wounds or disease or as
the result of accident, as well as
those who are missing and who
probably never will be accounted
for. It also includes those who
suffered from wounds, slight and
severe.

It probably will be several
weeks before the records can be
completed. The 7 lists for
some time to come will comprise
about 1,000 names each. At
present the list totals 71,390
names.

Lonpon, Nov. 13.—Despatches from

relate many incidents of the Socialist
fury which has swept Germany.

The Sociallsts disarmed the fron-

start back for the French and British
interference. German
republicans have banned “The Watch

War work in Essen had been
stopped after some fighting, but the

cesses in Hamburg are confirmed.

Soldiers Need Smokes

pL JENTY of hard ‘work, weari-
ness and homesickness will
attend the task of reconstruction
that must be done. batch of

win victory.
