“What is that?” asked curiously one of |
the nurses at the junior Sea Breeze

She was looking at a baby’s bottle filled |
with an écru colored liquid, held by a young,
poor loca!‘ag woman wii

“It's weak coffee and milk, ma'am,”
answered the woman, attempting to put
the bottle to the baby’s mouth

Dexterously the nurse intervened, re-
marking pleasantly
“I will get him a fresher drink.” The

woman watched anxiously as nurse and
bottle disappeared and continued trying
to hush the fretful little bundle in her arms.
In a moment the nurse came back with a
bottle containing a small quantity of white
fluid. The baby drank it all.

“He can take more, I think, ma'am,” said
the mother with an intonation which meant
“What a stingy meal that is!”

But the nurse shook her read Tt isn't
aafe to give him more just now,” she said.
*Heistoo ill. ' two *-ar» he shall have

The nurse did not ok au. prised even,
It was evident that she had asked the same
question and got the same answer often.
The mother looked more anxious than ever
but eaid nothing. What could she say?
Her baby was certainly ill; ahe had brought
him to this place by advice of a neighbor;
she must not therefore find fault with short
rations.

Starting home two hours later, she carried

only the clothing her baby had worn and |

the rejected bottle. There were tears in
her eyes, but a hopeful look on her face:
for, clad in fresh linen, her baby was fast
asleep in a tiny white crib cooled by breezes
blowing in from the bay and up the East
River. It awed ber a little to think that a

But the mother beard only the Orst part of
the nurse’s speech and was for taking her
baby home with her-at-once.

This is the-eort of thing that goes on at
the Junior Sea Breeze all day long and
which has been, going on every day since
the last week in June, when the thermometer
began to soar and the-dabies of the-ten
ments began to droop.

The Junior Sea Breeze is unique among
the babies’ hospitals of the country, No
ope would suspect it of being e hospital at
all, That is its c' charm to many a
mother,

ernor and the other for the commissioners
The rooms over the east wing are for the
employees of the building. The large

greatly to the comfort and fine appearance |

of the building.

The State flag, which is draped over the
main entrance to the hall, is the same
that waved over the arsenal at Albany

when Roosevelt was installed as Governor |

of New York. There is a bureau of in-
formation and a room where wraps and
grips can be checked, both of which add

| to the comfort and convenience of visitors.

From the opening day the Empire State
has been well represented. Many New
Yorkers are directly interested in the yacht-

employed by the making their
rounds in the interest of these boys and
girls discovered a host of babies under®2
years of age suffering from ailments com-
mon ,o very young children in summer
What these babies needed, needed badly,
was 4 fresb air hospital, the society decided,
and it went to work to get it. Private purse-
strings were unloosed at its request, with
the result that at midsummer last year a
flag streaming from the roof of an old
frame building perched on a hill overlooking
the East River at Sixty-fourth street an-
nouncea that Junior Sea Breeze had gone
into commission solely in bebalf of babies
of 2 vears and under.

The main building of the hospital, said to
be 200 years old, was once the country house
of the Schermerhorn family, but of late
years it had been used for commercial

| purposes,and when the society took hold of

paint and plain, substantial furniture have |

transformed the place, however, into an
entirely comfortable, convenient head-
quarters for a doctor's office, a laboratory,
where all the milk given to the smal! pa-
tients is prepared and tested by experts: a
kitchen, dining room, sitting room, all on
the ground floor, and ten sleeping rooms
for nurses and physicians on the floorabove.
A wide hall runs through the centre con-
necting the front and the back porch, the
latter vine shaded and commanding a view
up and down the river.

On these porches visitors with sick babies
in their arms wait their turn to see the
doctor. Mrs. Ingram, superintendent of

| relief for the society, who personally super-

vises the work at Junior Sea Breeze, is
authority for the statement that on the
hottest nights of the season the small
patients have to be well wrapped up to keep
them warm while there or in their tiny
cribs, for there are no windows which may
be shut down in this hospital,

The five dormitories are separate from
the main building and each other, ana
they are built on a still higher eminence
and connected with a covered way. Each
may be described as a shack finished with
a double roof and with continuous window
Spaces on the four sides, protected only
with wooden slat blinds seldom drawn in.
There are twelve criba within and a con-
necting covered piazza without on the
end next the river. There is room for
sixty patients, but so far the beds have
not been all in use at the same time. The
other day forty-three babies were on hand:
the day previous thirty-seven were being
cared for. There are three day nurses
and one night nurse to a dormitory, and
anxious mothers are privileged to spend
most of the day near their offapring and
receive lessoris in up to date nursing
methods.

Every afternoon at half-past 3 there
is given in a covered pavilion next to the
dormitories a practical talk by a physician
or trained nurse on ways and means of

than subject it to the risk of having a re-

than the first attack. But over and over
again, because the baby seems brighter
and is a good deal better, his mother will

eighty sick babies in the dormitories for
periods ranging from twenty-four hours
to thirty days, and at least twenty of that
number would have died but for the prompt

THE OYSTER FUNGUS.
Superstition, Art and Poetry Inspired at
Times by It.

Wasnrnaton, Aug. 3.—Prof. Albert F.
Woods of the bureau of plant industry
thinks it was the oyster fungus (Pleurotus)
that caused a religious commotion in Bel-
gium some months ago, The news de-

spatches at the time said that a wave of |,

religious enthusiasm was sweeping over
Borgherhout, a suburb of Antwerp, where
} a fungus growth on an old plank had taken
the form of a statuette of the Virgin and
Child, It was said that the population was
greatly alarmed and that politicians were

as an argument in favor of compulsory
education to free them from superstition,
| The oyster.fungus is a very common
{ species in this country and Continental
Europe. It is found usually in high alti-
tudes, There are,many varietion, Man
On hemlock trees the back or shell of the
fungus is frequently of a boiled lobater

 

red. The under surface or face is covered
with a soft fuzzy substance, very delicate
and easily bruised. In many

it is pure white or cream colored

This soft surface hardens a few days
after the removal of the fungus from the
tree. While it is still soft it can be etched
upon with any sharp pointed instrument,
such as a knife blade or hat pin. Upon
seratching the surface a beautiful sepia
shade is produced.

Many etchings are thus made, Some
artists wait until the fungus hardens and
then paint sketches on the white surface.
Etched or painted fungi make odd mantel
or desk ornaments. Appropriate verses are
etched on them also. The fact that the
fyneue lives upon the dying tree suggested
this:

Reincarnation here you see—

Life born of death. A noble tree
Of tow'ring top, majestic girth,
Falls, dies, to give this fungus birth

Another verse etched upon the surface
of a fungus reads

The jackal of the woods am I

I feast I thrive when others die;

The life blood of a stately tree

Is meat and drink and all to me
A variation of the same verse is this

I am the jackal of the wood,
I feast when others die,

Miss Virginia Frazee, printer, believes
that her success in the printing business is
due more to perseverance than to any special
talent. She entered the.business entirely
without training and believes that other
women possessing Common sense and en-
ergy can make as comfortable a living at it
as she is doing

“T bought and fitted up this printing office
for a young relative,” she explained. “My
intention was to do the office work until
things got to running smoothly and then
turn over, the entire business to him.

“You know we don't always get what we
expect. The first hitch came the day the
office was formally opened.

“'T'll stay here and get things going while
you go and solicit orders,’ I told him.

“Why, I can't do that,’ he answered, look-
ing at me aa if I had asked him to commit
an unheard of offence. ‘You will have to
advertise for orders. That isthe way to get
business— advertise.’

“'There is no money to advertise,’ I told
him. ‘Lhave spent all that I can afford and
you'll just have to go and solicit orders.’

“I might as well have talked to the wind.
Within six months I had sunk all that I had
in the business and I waa forced to take it
into my own hands to save it.

“IT started out to solicit orders and the first
place I went to was a large office building. T

“I have gone up in my prices from those

which was growing 80 rapidly that I felt
myself warranted in opening a monthly
account with the paper firms. Before that
I had bought everything for cash and most
of my goods had come from one of the
largest paper firms in thie city. ;

“When I decided to open an account
never for an instant did I fancy there would
be any difficulty. I went to this firm and
after explaining the situation asked to open
an account.

“Do you know that man was uawiins
to give me credit? I didn't argue wit
him. I walked out and went to other firms
from whom I had bought much leas. Every
one of them waa willing to have my account.
Not very long ago I was forced to go to
that first firm for a special style of paper.

“'I don’t come here through preference,”
I told the man who had refused to let me
run an account. ‘If I could Ret the paper
anywhere else in town I would never come
to you.’

“"Why, Mies Frazee,’ he exclaimed. “What
do you mean by that? I thought you were
one of the best friends I had. know I
would do anything for you.’

“When I reminded him of his refusal he
tried to joke out of it by saying it was one
of his mistakes, that all of us make mis-
takes. Recently his salesman has come to
me soliciting trade. I have none for him.
There are too many fine men in the paper
business for me to buy at a house that once
was unwilling to give me the same terms
offered to every other reputable printer in
the city.

“There is one thing that I would like to
say to women going into business for them-
eslves. They must not i ine that they
can be more lenient with their workmen
than other business houses. That was one
of my errors F

“I had heard a great deal about the oppres-
sion of the laboring class by their em; ere
and I detertnined that my business dea’ ng
should be different. As a result I was al-
ways being taken advantage of by dishonest
workmen and when the honest ones wished
and really needed the privileges which the
dishonest ones had abused I was loath to
giveintothem. My experience has canes
me that those who ask the most are the
least deserving.

“As small as my force is I have had my
ups and downs on the labor question. My
solution is the cooperation in business
between the employer and the cmgraree,
I mean by that that every employee I
become a shareholder in the business con-
cern for which he works.

“Besides his reguiar wages he should
share in the profite, That is what I am
working toward. My aim is to ostablish
a great printing business in which every
man and boy working for it shall share
in the profits.

“On several occasions I have been asked
why I did not employ women. Women
have told me that being a woman owner
and manager of a printing business I should
employ my own sex,

sg maven't the slightest objection to
doing so provided the women were as com-
petent aa the men. It is a business propo-
sition with me. I am earning a living for
myself and those dependent on me and I
must make it pay.

“But there is one thing to which I should
object; that is having the two sexes workin
together. If my plant was larger I should
be tempted to try getting all women in one
department as an experiment. Then if
that succeeded I might put them in the other.
But in a small) plant all must work together,
and I feel that it is better to have only
one 8exX.

“I do not now employ cheap labor—boys. I
have found that skilled labor is the cheap-
est in the end and I would advise any woman
beginning the business to use it exclusively.

Another point on which I would like
to advise my less experienced sister busi-
ness woman is that she always aim for
the beat. I once had a man in here to help
me. He went around to all the shabby
little concerns of the neighborhood solicit-
ing their trade. The result was most un-
satisfactory.

“I have never asked an order from any
but firat class conoerns and | can truth-
fully say that I could number the unsatis-
factory resulta on the fingers of one hand
and then have more than half the fingers
left over. I do the very best work, not

}

| PROBLEM GROWING HARDER IN
COUNTRY HOUSES.

 

Room for Five Servants No Longer Enough
—Provision for Twenty Not Always
Sufficient—New Fashions That Old
Houses Don’t Fit --Demands of Servants.

“I'd buy your house,” said the lady to
the lawyer who wanted to sell the place
on Long Island that he had built for his
summer home, “if it were not for the ser-
vants’ rooms. You see, I could never get
along with them.”

“But there are five,” he said In astonish-
ment, not having lived much in the amart
whirl of the set he had happened to settle
among. “Surely one could not use more
than five servants in this house.”

“For our own needs, no,” she said. “So
long as my husband and I are here alone
we could get along with five. We might
do that even when we had two or three

guests down.

*But what in the world would I do if I
should invite four people down and they
came with four servants? They are very
likely to do that, too.

“If there were two married couples,
for instance, I ought to be prepared for
two maids and two valets. That does not
always happen, but it is likely to.

“Certainly the women will always come
with maids. Sometimes the men are
obliging enough to leave their valeta be-
bind, but one cannot count on that in buy-
ing a house.”

The lawyer in building the house had not
taken into consideration the servants
necessary nowadays in every family that
makes a pretence to fashionable life. The
question of housing the servants neces-
eary to the comfort of the family is not the
only one involved. There must also be
room for the small army of domestics that
invade the house when there are many

guesta. :

Since the older American country houses
were put up life has outgrown its old
simplicity and the retinues of servants
have greatly inc . They bear little
relation to the size of th® family. It is the
size of the house that nowadays determines
the number of the domestic army.

It 18 no uncommon thing for a man and
his wife to have from fourteen to twent
servante in the establishments, not inchud-
ing the nurse or nurses for the younger
children. Six servanta brought by guests
in addition to such a home supply requires
@ great deal of additional room. |

I should think,” said a woman in Weat-
cheater, who was confronted with the
problem of entertaining four servants
unexpectedly, “that guests would know
that they would be comfortably looked
after by the servants they find in the house
and would not bring their own with them.

“Of course there are sometimes secrets
of a woman's toilet that she may not want
any other woman's maid to know, and it is
not such a nuisance when she comes with a
maid. But men servante are entirely un-
necessary. My husband's man is per-
fectly capable of doing all that will be needed
by anybody who is going to stop in the
house only three days.

“It is my misfortune to live in an old
fashioned house built when porate had a
little more confidence in their host's ser-
vanta. I have been out to the stable trying
to persuade the coachman's wife to lodge
two valets. The women I can find room for
in one of the guest rooms, if they will stay
there. I have known them to refuse to
do that in some houses,”

The designing of the service quarter of
a house has become an important part
of the duties of the architect who
would build a successful country home.
In addition to the number of rooms now
required the average owner demands
that the wing intended for that Purpose
shall be concealed, or at all events partly
hidden.

The exactions of servants in large eatab-
lishments are not modest. y demand
a degree of comfort that they were never
acoustomed to abroad. Four maids not

All these problems make the question
of the service wing an important one now-
adays. In a number cases houses to
increase the accommodations for servants
have been added to old fashioned country

HELENA, Mon., July 31.—According to
the reports of the deputy game wardens,
who have been in Helena in conference with
Game Warden Scott, in every part of the
State the finest hunting in years is promised
during the open season next September.

The pi are not quite so auspi:
for a g crop of chickens, grouse
ongp hens as for big — The late
and the wet weather in many places crea
havoc among the chicks, and it ie feared
that if the wet weather continues it will de-
stroy the young. The outlook for good
duck shooting is splendid, and according
to the reports of the deputies is nowhere
better than at Lake Hauser and Lake Bewell
on the Missouri River. a few miles north of
Helena, This is the first year the ducks
have nested on the lakes in any great num-
ber, and the ducklings have been hatched
and are doing well.

The best big game shooting to be found in
the country to-day is said to be on the Flat-

ead and is and Clark forest reserves.
The reserves are a true iderness and
afford a fine haven for thebig game. Not
enough hunting has been done on the re-

serves to spoil it, Among the bi
animals which are lentiful are elk, Pack
tailed deer and all varieties of the bear
family, from the little brown and black bear
to the grizzly and silvertip. © The ties
say that elk shooting this year shou
icularly good. streams are full o'

rout and all varieties of small game are to
be found.

It is not generally known that moose
are to be found in Montana, but the depu-
ties reported their presence in fair numbers
on the Hell Gate River in western Mon-
tana, on the north fork of the Flathead
in northwestern Montana and in the Yak
basin, in the same district. There are
also caribou in the Yak basin.

Some idea of the plentifulness of elk in
northwestern Montana may be gained
from the fact that the fruit growers are
complaining that the animals are destroy-
ing the fruit trees. Ex-Gov. Robert B.
Smith, who is here from Sunset, where he
hasa fine fruit ranch, said that only last weeks
the orchard

and leaped and romped with bf
and did not pay any attention to the Gover-
nor, standing only a few yards off. No
‘© was done to the trees. However,
other fruit growers have not been so for-
tunate, the animals coming into the orchards
and rubbing the velvet off their horns
and the bark off the trees at the same time.
Deer seem to be cularly plentiful
this year, and it is these animals that
most of the hunters will give their attention.
. number of these animels have
killed on the railroad tracks around here
by trains striking them, and almost every
day passengers report having seen numbers
of them between place and Stryker.

“For years the Department has been dis-

of trees are now growing throughout the

these trees. ’

“By improvements in manufacturing
processes satisfactory resulta have been
accomplished and a large manufacturing
concern is now eating up a campho
grove of 2,000 acres in Florida. from which
