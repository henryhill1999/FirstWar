before the day was over many owners and
trainers that bad been on the fence decided
to race at thefWestchester course. According

sentative, these turfmen have secured stable

Seventy members of the Mets and thirty-
four “outsiders,” who have been operating
in the front line at Brighton, will go to Sara-
toga to-day on the Cavanagh special, —-
leaves the Grand Central station at 1:30 P. M
in three sections, of ten cars each. Rumor
was in circulation at the track that the Mets
would dominate the betting ring at Yonkers,
but this was positively denied by one of the
members, who said that the bookmukers’
organization would not cut away from the
Jockey (lub. In fact the impression pre-
wails that the bookmaking element at Yon-
kers will be practically mew to the Metro-
politan racing public. Schuyler L. Parsons,
who acted as a steward at Sheepshead Bay
and the Beach, has been selected as the third
@teward at Yonkers to assist Matt J, Winn
and H J. Morris

William H. DuBois came down from Sara-
toga yesterday to see Charles Edward win
the Derby and then hurried back. As his
great colt was leaving the paddock Du Bois
was greeted by Dave Gideon tn this way:

“Nervous, Bill’”

“Not a bit more so than if I turned a card!”
replied Du Bois with a smile,

“I've been there myself,” said Gideon.
“Let mo feel of your pulse.” Whereupon
DuBois held out his hand and Gideon, after
holding it for a moment, said that Williame’s
nerve was all right. After the race DuBois
was very happy and was surrounded by his

friends. He said that he would not sell
Charles Ed ward for $50,090, and that he believes
‘the colt would demonstrate before the sea-

son ends that he is the champion three-year-
old. He expressed much regret that Peter
Pan was unable to start in the Derby. Pre-
vious winners of the Derby were Watercolor,
Hyphen, Cha\les Elwood, Ort Wells, Sysonby
and Accountant. The plungers bet on
Charles Edward for the limit, even though they
had to take 2 to 5, but the small fry went to
Frank Gill at 11 to 5, just to take a chance.

Refore the second race was run Boots Dur-
nell tried to swap Saylor for Ed Ball even up,
but the latter's owner, Jack Bennet, suspect~
ing something, ran out. Saylor was entered
to be sold for $1,000, and when a bid of $2,000
was made Durnell let the Ogden gelding go
without a protecting bid. The bu turned
out to be State Senator John T. McCall, who
introduced a bill in the Legislature last winter
providing that the State Racing Commission
should have the appointment of paid stewards
at the local tracks. Durnell said after the
transaction that Saylor was, in his opinion, on
the verge of a breakdown. Saylor was backed
off the boards. He opened at even money,
but there was such a rush to get aboard even
at this short price that after the books had ac-
cepted many wagers at 3 to 5 they rubbed the
price entirely. But the ring had a life saver
in Reidmoore, who was backed from 4 down
to 18 to 5.

The books broke better than even to the
steeplechase, Jimmy Lane, taken by the
public, went up from even money to t to 5,
while Garret® receded fram &to & to 0 to 5
and Essex went upto 18to6from 3. Paprika,
meanwhile, was backed from 10 to 5.

Only the “insiders” got the coin with Sam
Emery’s Master Robert In the Winged Foot
Handicap. They waited until his price went
up to 10 and then backed him down to &.
The colt showed a glaring form somersault.
The public and many of the shrewd operators
went to James R. Keene's Frizette, backing
her down from t1 to 10 to even money. Live
‘Wire was also heavily played both ways, also
Rialto and Ziephen. W. F. Schulte and his
trainer, R. P. Brooks, thought that Ziephen
was a cinch and told their friends to bet.
The ring quit a big winner to-this event, the
previous winners of which were Voter, Don’t
Care, Autumn, Killeshandra, Princess Pepper,
arms. Africander, Hello, Tradition, George

. Bernett and Salvidere, -

“There was another cleanup for the books
in the fifth race when Smirker beat W. H.
Lyen. ae the big bettors and the public
backed W. H. Lyon, who was pounded down
from even money to 3 to Sat the last moment.
Smirker went up from 6 to 8 while Servile
receded from 5to7. There was astrong play
oa Dead Gone, Jack MeGinnis's colt, but he
ran a dead looking race.

In a desperate effort to get out on the day

the talent nade T. ©. McDowell's Lady
Anne a hot favorite in the last race, backing
her down from 2toltoxtos, The Western
crowd played Crackenthorpe, while R. E.
Watkins's friends went to Quadrille. Robin
Hood, the winner, was practically overlooked,
as he went up from 4 to 10, at which price
Rig Tim Sullivan got on $100 three ways and
recovered some of his losses incurred in
previous races

There wax trouble for several women in
the grandstand. Just after the Derby two
women began.to scream and pull the feathers
out of each other's hats

“she's got my woney!" cried one of them
as she grappled with her neighbor. The
erowd jumped up and hemmed them in until
a couple of Pinkertons dragged them away
to the “dungeon.” Jt turned out that while
the race was under way one of the women
trial to extract a lonesome dollar from the
other's reticule, but she was not arrested.
Soon aiter this incident it wae lewrned that a
woman who had bet a couple of dollaré on
Fronk Gill had fainted away and in falling
had broken her nose on the back of one
of the benches. She was taken home
by her friends Then an old lady, wearing
blue glasses, atiracted some attention by
ritting on the benches all the afternoon wait-
ini: fora man who had taken $5 from ber “to
get tt changed.” She complained to the
track sleuths end was waiting for a chance
to get her eyes on the swindler, But when
the raves were over she conchided that the

fellow was still running

ing the 1,000 feet in 28 1-6 seconde with his
45-00 horse-power six cylinder Stearns. He
also won the Class A event, making the fast

special cup for the fastest performance re-:

gardiess of classification.

The competitors were started from the foot
of the hill under the subway elevated struo-
ture and climbed up a winding road paved
with belgian blocks. The events were to
have been timed by an electric timing device,
but the electricians had not brought enough
atorage batteries to work the apparatus, 80
the clock times were taken at the starting
and finishing lineu and compared later to
‘ascertain the time af the various competing
cara.

William Watson wrecked a 3 horse-power
Simplex runabout before the events were
started when he was making an unauthorized
practice run up the grade just before 1 o ‘chock.
He and another man who had been working
on the car, which was to have been driven
by Al Poole, decided they would see how fast
the car would climb the grade and took a long
start so as to have the machine travelling
fast when it struck the rise.

The car skidded just before it reached
the bottom of the grade, swerved into one of
the pillars supporting the elevated subway
structure and elid along for about sixty feet,
turning clear around as it slid, The right
rear wheel was smashed, the rear axle broken,
the frame bent and the myo jarred off.

CHARLES EDWARD'S FAST TIME |

WENS BRIGHTON DERBY IN A
GALLOP IN 2:30 4-5.

 

 

A Better Performance Than That of Good
rich, Who Ran a Mile and « Half With
102 Pounds in 2180 1-4 Some Years Ago
~—Frank Gill Boaten From the Outect.

Thirty thousand persons saw Charles Ed-
ward, the noted three-year-old eon of Golden
Garter—Flora Mac, win the $156,000 Brighton
Derby, one mile and a half, at the Beach track
yesterday, Running tn. the colors of the
Patchogue Stable, which fs owned by William
H. DuBols, Charles Edward, 2 to 6, made a
show of J. L. MoGinnie’s Frank Gill, by Collar
Ravello II., 11 to. 6, who was the only other
starter, Charles Edward, with 126 pounds,
ran the distance in 2:30 4-5, and won with con-
summate ease. When three-quarters of a
mile had been covered he had Frank Gill so
completely at his mercy that Knapp began to
take the Golden Garter colt up. Near the far
turn Charles Edward had slowed down to
such an extent that Gill cut his lead down
materially. But even then Charles Edward
was not extended for a moment and breezed
home with four lengths to spare tn the most
impressive manner.

The world’s record for a mile and a half is
2:30, made by Goodrich, a three-year-old,
with 102 pounds at one of the Chicago tracks
in 1898. But Charles 3 Edward's performance
was announced by eee to [oo meri-
torious because of the weight he shouldered
and the fact that . simply galloped all the
way. Had he been he would surely
have created new figures for the distance.
snatontely, the conclusion was drawn that

if Peter Pan had been in the race he would
have been defeated, as Frank Gill, who was
fit and who defeated the Keene colt on two
occasions, looked like a selling plater in com- |
Parison to the winner.

Charles Edward will atart in the Great Re-
Public Stakes at Saratoga, and if he retains
his present form he will be a tough proposition
to beat, Leading all the way in the Derby,
after a quick breakaway from the post, the
Golden Garter colt waa officially timed as
follows: Furlong in 0:12 3-5, quarter in 0:24 4-5,
half in 0:48 8-5, five furlongs in 1:00 3-5, three-
quarters in 1:13, seven furlongs in 1:25 2-5,
Mile in 1:38 3-5, mile and a furlong in 1:61 3-5,
mile and a quarter in 2:04 9-5, mile and a half
in 2:30 4-56. He cooled out nicely after the race
and his owner was showered with congratu-
lations. DuBois paid $0,200 for Charlea Ed-
ward at the recent sale of Sydney Paget's
horses and since then the colt has won, in-
cluding $12,000 yesterday, a total of $18,73,
in three stakes.

BENSONHURST WINS AGAIN.

Lépton Cup Race by Goed
py yyy gt A

The Bensonhurst won the fourth race of ;

the Lipton cup series yeaterday in the regatta
of the Atlantic Yacht Club, This, victory
gives her 28 points in the contest, and the New
Moon and Nereid are tied for second place
with 20 points each. The Blue Bill was prommi-
nent in yesterday's race and she should have
won. The Blue Bill led at the start and at
every mark around the course, and she would
have been far in the lead at the finish, but
the skipper of the Blue Bill was too polite at
the turning marks and turned so wide that
the Bensonhurst was able to make big gains.

On the last leg of the course the Blue Bill
and the Bensonhurst, the first and second
boats in the race, had a pretty scrap, and it
was through the good handling of the Ben-
sonhuret that she won. She luffed the Blue
Bill into a soft spot and then seeing her rival
in trouble ran through her lee and won the
race by 11 seconds. The New Moon was
third and had made a big gain on the second
round. Had the two leaders luffed a@ little
more she would have won the race.

The Nereid was fourth, but she was not
well handled and lost on the last round
through making a wrong tack out into the
tide. At the start she was bothered con-
siderably by the Gunda, which for seme reason
or other quit the race at the firat mark. The
Goblin was last. She was sailed by her de-
signer, Morgan Barney.

The race was eailed in a light but steady
southwesterly wind and the committee sent
the yachts to the Sea Gate mark first, then to
oo a . to Bensonhurst.
