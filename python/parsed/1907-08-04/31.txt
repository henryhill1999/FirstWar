|™ GHOSTS IN
CASTLE LONELY.

Miss Nippers Tells “ the Colonel's
Troubles After He Got Back
to Staten Island.

‘Ind Seraphine make it up with Water
Ru lfrog when she found out that it was
hat little black faced coon that had been
eng all the atealing? Well, { should aay
' She said abe was going to teach him
¢ lesson if he never did learn another,
sod she would have done it, too, if the
lonel hadn't come back just about that

Here Misa Committee Nippers settled her
cluases on her nose, took up her quilt square
hooking the yarn over her thumb
,ovtied off some half dozen stitches before
resuming her story.

The Colonel was ao busy fixing up
‘astle Lonely when he came back that he
) he didn't have time to call on his best
‘reods, Instead of him and Seraphine
aking friends he never went near her,
~» people began to circulate the rumor that
ys was (ixing up that old place for hie bride.

{| was just about this time that the

sport got out that Seraphine had sent
for Water Bulfrog, that the ey had agreed

the day and that Mrs, Hopkins was
aelling things ready for their wedding.

OF course none of us would have let the
‘nen know it, but it was as plain as the
‘ail on a bobtailed horse that the Colonel
had jilted Seraphine and that she was
marrying Water Bulfrog to save her seatinee.

“It was about the middle of Au
shen Maria told it at sewing circle 1
\irs. Hopkins had sent over to borrow
her receipt for black cake. There wasn't
a woman at the meeting who could doubt
“hat that meant, for nobody ever did make
black cake in the summer time except for
a yak

{ had been promising to go over and |
spend the day with Mrs. Hopkina for

arid

— ee

{
ood long time, so the next day I weet |

Sure enough, when I walked in the front
sate there she was sitting on the side piazza
stirring a big pan full of cake dough.

‘I’m mighty glad to see you,’ said she,
he mintite she laid her eyes on me, ‘I want
vou to tell me if I've got enough flour in
this cake,

“My!” said I, when I'd tasted it,
put a good supply of brandy in it.’
“Oh, I did that on purpose,’ she answered
smiling. ‘Men are fond of cake with plenty
of brandy in it and I’m making this for the
olonel, :

‘For the ( olonel!’ And TI never was
more surprised in me life. I just saw at
onee that Seraphine hadn't given up hope
of getting the Colonel back and that Mrs.
Hopkins was doing her best to help her.

‘Yes,’ said she ‘me and Seraphine were
passing there the other day and we just
stopped at the gate to see how he was get-
‘ing on. He said he hadn't given up hope
of laying the gbost, but he’d about given
ip eating since that last nigger left and he
has had to do his own cooking
“*Has the ghosts been troubling him?’ I

‘you've

asked

“*Land sakes,’ said she.
anything like it. He's had ten cooks, white
and black, in two weeks,and the last one
of them left on account of what they've
seen and heard in that house.’

“Well, sir,” said Miss Committee, and she
hitched her ‘chair back frem the edge of the
piazza and began to rock and knit with
renewed vigor. “The tales Mrs. Hopkins
told me that the Colonel had told her and
Seraphine _e to have made my eyes pop
out of my head.

“He said the first night after he took
possession the negro woman he had brought
up from the South came screeching and
screaming out of the kitchen and ran half
way down the hill before he and her hus-
band could catch her, She swore she had
geen Mrs. Johnston cut her own head off
in the butler's pantry.

“While she was washing the dinner
dishes, the nig er said, she turned around
suddenly and there, standing at her elbow
was a little lady dressed in heavy mourning.
Thinking she was some friend of the Colonel
who had dropped in the nigger spoke to
her. Instead of anaweri the lady just
raised her hand and slashed her throat
with the carving knife the nigger had just
finished washing. When the nigger threw
out her hands to stop her the lady's head
‘tropped off and rolled under the table while
her body walked into the dining room.

“The Colonel said it was after midnight
hefore he could get those two negroes to
xo in the house with him to try to find out
what it was. Of course they could find
nothing only the old blood stains on the
meer of the dining room where Mrs. John-

eon had committed suicide with her
mother’s carving knife. The Colonel's
carving knife was in | F.. pies! in the knife
box, but the nigger she hadn't put
it there. She had left it just where the
lady let it fall, on the floor at her feet.

“Neither the man nor the woman would
stay in y 4 house that night cad een the next
morning they an
and would have gone inte New York ee he
Colonel hadnt agrees to pay them a whole

month's wages to stay another day so as
to give him a chance to get some one to

‘I never heard

take their places. It was the same with
them all, 1ey would stay a few hours,
see Mrs. Johnston's

host cut her throat
with the carving unite and then get out.

aan hte Colonel hadn't had so much aa a
! = at the ghost and for the first week
he didn’t hear anything. But after! Why,
that man awore to Mrs. Hopkins and Sera-
phine that he spent half his nights trying
to catch the persons who kept walking over
the house in their bare feet.

“Upstairs and downstairs he could hear
those bare feet pattering, but follow them
as he would he had never been able to catch
up. He said it sounded like a woman or
» child, and of course every ody on the
island knew it was either Mrs. Johnston—
vou know when ghe got up in the middle
of the night and dressed herself to go down
to the dining room to cut her throat with
her mother's carving knife she put on
everything except her shoes and stock-
or the little son over whose death she
was grieving. The Colonel said he couldn't
make out which it was, but he was sure it
vas not a man hecause the step was not
heavy en ugh.

‘Well, he got a new man that day after
Seraphine and Mra, Hopkins left, but no
sooner did the man take his trunk up-

virs than he came running down and

down for a whole rachettul of whiskey and
stuff, and when he got home and his wife
told him about the big hatch she and Sera-
shine had sent by Water Bulfrog he decided
fe had better go, "\ate as it wae, and eee that
no harm came to Water Bulfrog.

“When he got there it was after 1 o'clock.
The whole house was wide open and the
two men asleep in the dining room. Water
Bulfrog wae on a sofa and the Colonel had
mounted the table.

“Of course, when Mr. Hopkins found they
had eaten everyeuns his wife had sent and
crunk all that had come from Stapleton he

knew they must be drunk and leaving well
enough alone he went in the next room and
went to bed. Before he get to sleep good
Wa'er Bulfrog woke up and began to stumble
around the room talking to himeelf.

“Oh, good Lord,’ Water Bulfrog groaned,
after kicking a chair down and falling over
it, ‘Who'd a-thought it! Me, William B.
Fannin, drunk and falling down! I never
was ao before. The world’s a-turning
over and over. The Colonel got me into
it again. What will Miss Seraphine say if
she hears about it--oh, Lord.’

“Mr. Hopkins said he heard him, but he
just made up his mind he'd lay still and
see what came of it. The poor fellow after
struggling UR from the floor took hia seat
in the chair he had occupied at the table
and began his ejaculations of grief in close
proximity to the Colonel's head.

“*Ah! I wouldn't have Seraphine hear of
it for a hundred dollars. She said when
she agreed to marry me as certain as

“You're a liar! You didn’t marry the

Widow Wright!’ interrupted the Colonel,
sitting up on the table in the dark.

” dic Seraphine Wright; and she told
me——

“The Colonel at this jumped down from
the table and began to stamp around the
room, knocking over chaira and butting
into doors. ‘

“You tell me I lie!’ he yelled. ‘That's
what I won't stand from no man. Come
out in the road and I'll whip as much dog
out of you as will make a pack of hounds.
What are you doing playing ghost in my
house? Come out in the road.’

“Mr. Hopkins said it was so dark he
couldn't see, but he heard a mighty scufflin
about the room and when the Colonel ope!
the door he saw that he was dragging
Water Bulfrog by the slack of the trousers.
The next instant a sog tore down the stairs
barking and followed the two men through
the door on to the piazza.

“Such a screeching and ecreaming Mr
Hopkins said he never heard before in his
life. He got up and ran out and there
was Water Bulfrog and the Colonel runni ng
down the hill toward the cemetery wit
the dog barking at their heels. He called
to them, but the more he called the faster
er d run and the louder the dog would

When he stopped in at Black Horse
Tavern on his way home there was the
Colonel standing before the bar and every
man, woman and child in New Dorp around
him listening to his ghost story.

“Tl was sitting in my library readin
explained the Colonel when he saw r.
Hopkins join the group, ‘when I heard a
rattling in the knife box in my butler’'s
o— Realizing the awful tra ageny that

op ghout to be enacted I rushe

wMre, Johnston's ghost fled into the
dining room. I overtook her, and catching
her up in my arms ran with her out on the
piazza hoping to bring her here.

“On the ae I eet by a pack
of dogs. e ghost slip rom my grasp,
and as I ran down the hill she stood on the
piazza at the top of the steps sicking the
dogs on me. It was a whole pack of fox

hounds.’
“‘Fox bounds nothing,’ Mr. Hopkins
answered, ‘It was your collie, Jim Spe

and she’s got a whole litter of puppies in
that dark closet under the garret stairs
of Castle Lonely.’
“Of course that settled the pattering
of the barefooted woman or child that the
Colonel had heard going about the house.
It was Jim Sperry'’s collie visiting her

puppies.

‘Then Mr. Hopkine said as they had
tracked down one ghost perhapsif they went
back they might lay the others. Of they all
trailed to Castle eer Mr. Hopkins, Jim
Sperry and the Colonel in the lead and the
remainder of the neighborhood following
them.

“There could be no mistake about the
strange sounds heard in two of the up-
stairs rooms.

“Tap, tap in the evens room; then when
they went in, tap, in the back room
Jim Sperry told Be . ut it himself. He
said the women fot as pale as ghosts and
he joined with the other men in advising
the Colonel to give up trying to live in
such a place.

“Tap, tap, first in one room and then in
the other, Dut always a dead silence if the
crowd divided, some remaining in one
room, while the rest went in the other. Jim
said he was thinking of following the pest
of the crowd downstairs, not believin,
tempting a ghost too far, when Mr. Hop! es
turns to the Colonel. ;

“If you can get me a saw and a chisel,
said he, ‘I think can lay this ghost ina very
few minutes.’

“When the people who had gone down-
stairs heard what he was going to do they
all rushed back up and oe and pleaded
with him not to risk his life, to remember
his wife and the twins.

“‘Remember your children, Mr. Hopkins,’
said Maria Ducklib when all mention of his
wife had failed to move him. ‘They are the
plague of Staten Island, but since the Lord's
seen fit to give them to you its your bounden
duty to otruggle and raise them to man and
womanhood. It ain't every peer that can
have twine, not such as the Lord has given
you.’

“All the while the women were arguing and
persuading Mr. Sopere was sawingthrough
the wainscotin yhen he had made a
hole about as b z as a water bowl he asked
the pople to shut the door and goin the next
room, where the mysterious tappings were
still going on. Instead of doing as he asked
the last one of them, the Colonel and all,
ran out into the hall and banged to the door,
leaving nobody but Mr. Hopkins and Jim
Sperry on the inside.

“Maria Ducklib said the Colonel locked
the door and then piled tables and chairs
against it and was draggin out a high-

bed worn they heard Mr. Hopkins
nd Jim aug!
“ ‘Dnlook the door of we ‘will show you
your host,’ called Mr. Hopkins.
‘What is?’ asked the Colonel,
le °: eck the come ene see for yourself,’
Jim 8 answe

"Maria said they must have ke opt that up
for ten minutes before they could persuade
him to unlock the door. When they did
finally get it open there was Mr. Hopkins
with a little redheaded woodpecker, He
had caught it with his hat as it flew out ol
hole

“What became of Water Bullfrog? Why,
that day about 12 o'clock he tramped into
Tottenville, his clothes torn to rage and |
covered with mud, He swore to his mother |
and five maiden aunta that he had been
waymen, who after me 4
1 the thickest swam
taken his coat and ro bed
him of all hie money.”
