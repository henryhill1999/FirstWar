VAAT'S MEL SAYS ED WLEAN, OM
( HIGH CLASS MAN,

But tf You Want to Know the Particulars

 

 

Youll Mave to Pay High— Just Now He's |

Working Honestly fer His Passage
Mone) to England, Which Cast Him Out.

Ed McLean, the veteran crook, who got
here last week from London on a ticket of
leave considers that he was shanghaied
from England, with tue assistance of his
wife, and is going back there to have it out
with Herbert Gladstone, the Home Secre-
tary, who signed the order expelling bim
from England on the ground that he is “a
rogue and a vagabond.” McLean says that
he can easily explain the evidence against
him, but can't get back to England until
he can raise the price of at least a second
wlass passage. He promises that he will
earn this money honestly, and has given
@ssuraunces to the police that they needn't
bother watching him while he is in town.

Within the last week McLean has made
offers to newspapers to tell them the com-
plete story of his life, which, he says, will
reveal a career of crime that will be astound-
ing. He declares that for at least half of his
wixty-two years of life he has been a crook,
and a good one, too, but has carried on his
work on entirely different lines from those
‘of other criminals

“But I wouldn't expose myself for a
@mahi amount of money,” says McLean.
*1 don't care what anybody thinks of me,
and am not afraid to confess to the crimes
in which | have been implicated, because
I have been arrested for most of them and
was discharged for lack of evidence. The
only men who have really got anything
on me are Billy McLaughlin and ‘Tom
Byrnes, and they are both out of the Police
Department. I have got angold mother,
80 years past, who lives here in New York,
and thinks I have always been on the level,
but T guess | could keep the story away
from her.”

“Maybe you think I am not the high class
men | claim to be,” he continued while
telling about himself in his room in West
Whirty-fourth street. Then he showed
four suits of evening dress, several of which
had never been worn, two expensive mel-
ton overcoats, a stack of white kid gloves,
Several dinner coats and two doven pairs
of trousers, a!l nearly new. “And I've
got more than twice as much more over in
England that the police wouldn't give me
time to bring along. A good man at this
business has to change his clothes three or
four times a day, and there waan't one of
them togged out better than I was.”

McLean said he never could understand
how he came to bea thief. He never turns
@ trick until he is strapped, he said. He
was about 16 years old when the civil war
commenced and went to the front as a dram-
mer boy with the engineer corps of the old
Seventh Regiment. The happiest memory
of his wartime days, he says, is of his meet-
ing with President Lincoln when the Seventh
Regiment stopped in Washington at the
close of the war. He says that in some
way he attracted the President while he
was reviewing the regiment and that the
President came up to him, put his hand
on his head and said:

“You're a fine looking young man.”

“It has been said of me that | turned in-
former for Chief Byrnes and in that way
escaped doing a long prison sentence my-
pelf,” said McLean. “That statement ‘ia
falas, for | never knew anything about

other crooks that would make me of any |

value as aninformer. In all my life I have
avoided the company of other thieves. If
T had any job on hand, or was on the look-
veut for one, I went on my way alone, pick-
ing my own company and studiously avoid-
ing men like myself. When I turned a

triek no one knew anything about it but |

myself, and [ stood in no danger of
having some one else peach on me.

[ am one of the tew crooks who had
sense enough to keep all his doings from
his wife. Up toa short time ago my wife
and | were the most intimate of chums,
aod had | not been constantly on my guard,
T would have told her enou h to enable her
to send me up in England alone for ten
years. When the break between us came
she turned against me so bitterly that she
would have gone to Scotland Yard with
every speck of evidence she had.

“She has turned against me, notwith-
standing that I have always been most
considerate of her. For years she has
\heen the manager of one of the leading
jdressmakinging establishments in London
‘and has been earning not less than $35 a
jweek. Out of regard for her feelings 1
Dave always occupied a separate room in
leur house there, knowing very Well that
the police would have no cause to search
her apartment if we were living in different
rooms.

“This is how she repaid me. I had given
her upaard of £800 to put in the bank,
with full permission to draw on it if she
needed it. Up to about a year ago she had
been wi!ling to go to any part of England
or the Continent to deposit cash bail for
me when I was arrested, and did it fre-
quently. At that time I asked for some
of the money I had given her and she re-
fused me. Then I told her that if she would
give me £100 I would Fo away and never
we heragain. Then at her request I signed
a paper to that effect.

y_ wife's physician was Dr. Wood,
one of the court physicians. She went
to him with this letter and explained to him
that she had always been obliged td support
pe and would like to have me sent out of

ngland under the alien act, which was
passed in order to deal with the clase of
men in London , who live off the earnings of

Women Dr. Wood went to Home Secre-
tary Gladstone’ with my wife's story and

_the result was that | was sent out of the

country before I had even the opportunit

.to collect £35 I had on deposit in a bank

there. It is only now that I appreciate
e to do

with me if she had known all about my

career.

“When I landed in New York I had no
fear of the police, because 1 knew they had
nothing on me. In all my criminal career
I have done but two jobs in this country.
One was a $20,000 theft in Sixteenth street,
opposite ‘Tiflany's old place, for which 1
was arrested, but was released for lack of
evidence. Another was a $30,000 theft in
Boston, whero I also beat the case. I was
arrested two years ago and got three months
fn jail in Brooklyn for trying cabin doors
on a steamship, but the police had no case
egainst me and the small sentence I got
fa rraof that they didn't have me right.

“4 made no partiowiar efforts to dodge

en L landed here, but before
{ had been in town a day I learned that
nspector McCafferty wanted me. With the
idea of seeing him and letting him know
that I intended to live on the square while
here I wrote a letter to Detective Vallel
telling him that | would meet him at Broad-
vay and Seventeenth street on a certain
day and go to Headquarters with him.
Vallely was there with Detective Collins,
and as soon as | showed up they grabbed
me ond hurried he off to see McCafferty.
Theo they took the credit of finding me.
McCafferty said me was sorry to trouble me,
and said he guessed he conld let me go
without sending me to court. He broke
his word and had me remanded to Head-
quarters for the night. tt hadn't occurred
to me that I could get bail until 1 heard
another man making arrangements for it.
Then I sent for my old friend Jimmy Wakely
and he came right down.”

McLean said that his most successful
there had been turned off at Carlsbad,
Marienbad and other fashionable watering

places of Europe. There he mingled with
the best peeps of the Continent as one of
them and was able to carry off the part
successfully, he said. He declared that
he had aanced with dozena of duchesses
and other titled women and had hobnobbed
with noblemen in all rhe counrries of Eurape
