MR, SLODGILBY'S HAT SYSTEM,

It Might Not Commend Itself to All, but
It Scems to Give Satisfaction to Him.
“Pretty foxy, my way of buying straw

hats, don't you think?” said Mr. Slodgilby.
“I buy only one straw hat a year and I buy
that one always at about the middle of July
at the time of the first mark down in price
of the straw hat season; so I always get
my straws at about 25 per cent. off the
regular price.

“An advantage, that, to save a quarter
| in the price? Surely; and now see how
| buying at that time works out in other
| Ways.

“By the middle of July the straw hats

year, have generally begun to show signs
of wear, certainly so if their wearers have
ever been caught in a shower; and so then,
when everybody elee's hat is getting old
I spring a fresh one on 'em, a brand new
hat; like a man who, his first hat having
got dusty, had just casually sauntered in
to the hat emporium and bought a new
one. It gives me a lot of satisfaction to
run that new hat out in that way in the
middle of the season. *

“And this hat remains tolerably fresh
when I put it away in the middle of Sep-
tember, and is really in fair condition
to wear when I bring it out to start the new
season with it in the following spring.

“Other men getiing out hats which they
| had bought early in the previous season
and so had worn practically that season
through find their hata pretty shabby
looking, while mine really looka  Proviy nice
and will go all right till the middle of the
season, when 1 buy my new hat on the first
markdown.

“This may seem rather complicated to
you, but it works out all right, and it’s a
pretty good system, it seems to me.”

 

 

 

BON. APARTE AT JAFFA,

His Orders Regarding the Plague Stricken
Soldiers,

From the Britieh Medical Journal.

Prof. forgue of Montpellier in a recent
lecture on the respect thet practitioners should
have for human life told the story of Des-
genettes, which, though well known, is worth
telling again as it is told by Desgenettes him-
self.

When the French were about to evacuate
Jaffa the question arose what was to be
done with the plague stricken soldiers in the
hospital. Desgenettes says: “Shortly before
the raising of the siege--that is to say, on the
27th.-Gen. Bonaparte sent for me very early
in the morning to his tent, where he was alone
with his chief of the staff, After a short pre-
amble as to our sanitary condition, he said to
me, ‘If I were you | should end at once the
| sufferings of those stricken with plague and
an | should end the dangers which they threaten
us by giving them opium.’

“JT answered simply, ‘My duty is to preserve
life.” Then the General developed his idea
| with the greatest coolness, saving that he was
| advising for others what in like circum-
stances he would ask for himself,
|
|
i
i
|
'
|

"He pointed out to me that he was, before
any one elee, charged with the conservation
of the army, and consequently it waa hia
| duty to prevent our abandoned sick from

falling alive under the scimiters of the Turks.

‘| do not seek,’ he went on, ‘to overcome your

repugnance, but 1 believe I shall find some

who will better appreciate my intentions.”

Desgenettes goes on to say that opium waa,

as a matter of fact, given lo some thirty
patients

It happened, however, that a certain num-
ber rejected it by vomiting, were relievea,
got well and told what had happened, The
story has been told in various ways, and the
fact of the poisoning of the sick soldiers has
been accepted by the enemies of Napoleon
and denied by the defenders of hia memory.
Desweneties's narrative bears the stamp of
truth,

A MASCAGNI CYCLE TO BE GIVES

to an Mattan for #%,000—Ctordana’s
rau
| —Debuwy at Work om Another Opera.

| Manuscript of a Beethoven Sonata Soild

“Marcetia’ to Re Sung Next

Pietro Mascagni has recently become

reconciled with the Sonzogno firm of music
publishers, the most noted in Europe, who |
| Offered the prize that brought out “Caval- ,

leria Rusticana.”
sented on most

He is therefore repre-
of the Italian operatic

of Italy in his hand. Next season the
a Mascagni cycle in the hope of discovering
among the works composed since “Caval-
leria” one that will exhibit sufficient vitality

to survive. Both Mascagni and Sonzogno

chere," the only comic opera that the master
ever composed.

The next of his operas will be “The Har-
vest Feast,” on which he is now at work.
It will be given next spring. The work is
modern in character, the hero being a young
Socialist who ia ultimately killed by his
employer. The libretto by the poet Fausto
Salvatore won the Sonzogno prize.

Mascagni, whose overwhelming conceit
is thought by many to have caused his loss
of reputation, can be modest on occasions.
He has just written some “Confessions,”
as he calla them, and says that the ex-
traordinary success of his firat opera laid ,
great responsibilities on his shoulders.

“For seventeen years,” he writes, “l have
struggled to keep my position honorable.
If I have not succeeded the fault is with
my mediocre abilities and not with my
will.”

It appears that in his very first composi-
tion Mascagni was a rival of_ Beethoven
He sat to music as a cantata for soli, chorus
and orchestra Schiller’s “Lied an die
Freude.” His first opera was never sung.
It waa in two acts and called “Nella Filanda,”
| Mascagni writes that he trembles with wrath
when any one calls him anti-Wagnerian in
| his musical sympathies. He said that while |
| a student of music he deprived himself of |
| the necessities of living until he had saved
enough to buy the orchestral score of “Par-
sifal.” although his colleagues and even the
professors in the conservatory thought
that he was a fool for doing anything of
the kind.

 

Marie Barrientos, the Italian colorature
| singer, has married a South American of
| wealth and retired from the stage. She

| has been in New York, but not to sing.
Florence, has acquired for more than $8,000
the original manuscript to the Beethoven
' gonata opus 96, although its former pos-
seasor endeavored to have the manuscript
bought by somebody who uld keep it
in Germany. The manuscript comprises
twenty-three ges, all in Beethoven's
handwriting. fis own appreciation of the
work is shown by the fact that he wrote his
name in full on the first page, which was
| not his habit. The work was recently per-
formed in Florence from the manuscript
and created great enthusiasm.
Cilea'’s “Gloria” did not meet with the

| success of his “Adrienne,” and after several
| hearings in ney was withdrawn to be re-

 

in Ostend during part of July. He will
appear in the pxincipal Italian cities before
coming to the Metropolitan.

Giordano’s new opera “Marcella,” which
is founded on events in the life of Mme.
Sembrich, will be sung first next fall at the
Lirico in Milan. Massenet's “Thais” will
also be given there and is already announced
for production as the principal operatic
event of the year in a number of Italian
cities. Another opera that has enjoyed a
musical renascence in Italy is Ponchielli's
“La Gioconda.” It was sung last season in
all the foremost opera houses,

Leo Olschki, an Italian amateur living in

 

 

written. It will mot be sung again until
the season after next. The fate of “Madama
Butterfly” was not unlike this. At its first

| production it made go little impression that
ft was looked upon as a failure. Subse-
uent performances, however, reversed
that verdict, although of course many
lupervens changes made in the
work.

Although the works of Alfredo Catalani
are just coming into the knowledge of
other countries the composer has .been
dead since 1893, when he was only 39. His |

| first opera, “La Falce,” waa sung in 1475
} at Milan. His other operas are “ Elda,”
| 1980 at Turin, from which “Lorelei,” to
be sung next winter at the Metropolitan,
is taken; “ Dejaniza,” 1883 at Milan; “Edmea,”
| 1886 at Milan, and “Le Wally,” which is
) regarded as his masterpiece, 1892 at La
Scala.

 

Claude Debussy, whose “Péléas et
Mélisande” is to be sung next season at
oe Manhattan, is at work on another

ra which deals with the Tristan legend.

e text, by Gabriel Mouray, treats the
subject in a wholly owe manner from
the libretto of Wa The same dif-
ference may be safely ‘predicted about the
music.

Paris is to have a new opera house, in-
tended for performances at cheap prices.
| The Gaieté has been remodelled and will!

| be o pened as a municipal opera house,
| in which the most expensive seat will coat
only 80 cents.

Victor Maurel has recently returned to
the operatic stage and is said to have created
a sensation in Spain by his singing in
“Rigoletto.” He retired several years
to devote himself to teaching because
had lost his voice.

Roth Olive Fremstad and Emmy Destinan
were decorated by the French Govern-
ment with the academio Ims for their
success in “Salome.” It is to be hoped
that this honor does not have the same
significance in France that it does in Ger-
man There it indicates that there has
been little or nothing doing in the line of

salary.

The direction of the Imperial Opera House
in Vienna is apparently not in great demand.
Felix Mott] and Ernst von Schuch have
both declined it, and it is now said that
Ernest van Dyck may be invited to take it.
His career was made there, and as the singe

presario it is supposed that he will aoc

have the remaining two.
| The novelties to be sung next season at the
Royal Opera House in rlin will include
revivals of Gitick’s “Iphigenia in Aulie” end
“Iphigenia auf Tauris,” both in the arran,

YIGH PRICED BLOOD STOCK.

King Edward's Quartet 1 Newmarket Saics
—tiltedged Veartings.

King Edward disposed of four thorough-
breds the second day of the Newmarket
blood stock sales, held recently, and it had
the effect of making matters brisk for the
remainder of the fixture. For the quartet
hie Majesty received the nice eum of $14,275,
and thers was more than one good price.
The biggest figure obtained, and it was also
the best figure of the day, was $7,250 for
Osella, by Orme, out of Ecila, by Persiinmon,
This three-year-old won the Hurat Park
| Foal Plate last year, but was doubtless
bought for her stud value, as she fell to
the bid of Baron von Oertzen. Another
three-year-old filly, Alexandra, by Per-
simmon, out of Ambleside, went to S. Green
for $2,600, and the two-year-old Maid of

Norway, by St. Simon, out of Nunsuch,
| made $3,050. The smallest price—-$875—-
was for Peridore, by Persimmon, out of
Medora, and though a full brother to Zin-
fandel, he is seemingly useless for the turf,
jo he would not be knocked down at
euch a low figure.

On the fourth day the yearling market
reached ite zenith, and if was again proved
that there is always a ready sale for the
fashionable blood of the moment. Fifty-
four lots were disposed of for just under
$03,000. Among the sellers Mr. Swanwick
came off the best, he having secured a total

| of $37,878 for a bunch of nine, the top notch
figure being $14,000 for an own sister to

Sancy, by Diamond Jubilee, out of Dame

| Agneta. A Diamond Jubilee colt out of ,; rants.

Dame d'Or went to the same hands—Mr.
Buchanan—for $7,750, and a daughter of
| Diamond Jubilee and Sweet Balsam made
| $3,500, the purchaser being T. Leader.

Then a colt by Veles out of Ferelith was
| sold for $8,000, and a filly by Ayrshire out
| of Lady Agneta for the same money.

Sir Daniel Cooper sold a filly by Per-
simmon out of Edmee for about $3,000, and
acolt by Right Away out of Concertina for
| $2,750. Bell Irving bought a colt by Mackin-
tosh out of Stolen Love for $2,000. Major
Loder disposed of three animals, and evi-
dently the Gallinule stock is not losing
anything in the market. For a colt by
this sire out of Sibola he received $5,460.
Sidney Loder was represented by a Gallinule
| filly out of Masthead, by Yard Arm, and
she went to the Sherwood Stable for the
| formidable figure of $18,500, and a rather

dear purchage she was considered.
Capt. Greer had three on the catalogue
and he sold them for the moderate total of
$8,700. Botteril had ten on the list, but only
sold one of them, and a like fate befell McIn-
tyre. Mills sold a colt by the Duke of West-
minster out of Balsham Princess for $1,600,
anda colt by Rising Glass out of Lady Birdie,
| appropriately named Skylark, was bought

by Sammy Loates for $1,200. A Fowling
Piece colt out of Nada reached $2,500 before
being sold to H. G. Fenwick, while from E.
Leach's lot a colt by Ayrshire by Seadown
went for $3,000. E. Dresden bought another
colt by Avrshire out of Lisdownev for $3,900.

On the first day of the sale brood mares
filled the greater part of the programme,
and many of them were accompanied by
foals. Inall some eighty-eight lots changed
hands and for a total figure of $150,000.
Seven times during the day five figures
were reached, the top P price being $11,000,
paid by Sir Robert Jardine for on ‘Ayrshire
mare with a foal by Cyllene. Low prices
prevailed until the Henning mares came in,
when Eidothea, by Grand Flaneur out of
Seaweed, with a colt by William the Third,
was bought by James Russell for $2,700.
The mare is a sister to Merman and is 11

ears old, but a William the Third foal should

valuable, and on the whole the buyer
should have the best of the deal, though
Eidothea has bred nothing of note.

River Trent, by Trenton, with an Isi
foal, went to 8, Green for $2,400, and
again the dam is 13 years old and has bred
nothing,so that the buyer Peay paida
big price for a foal. Maze, by Royal
Hampton out & Stirrup Cup, by Melson,
with a filly foal by Foundling and stinted to
Floroze!l II., was sold to Baron von Oertzen
for $6,500 and, though a young mare, was
dear, for she is untried, and go, too, is Found-
yng who has no racing career to substan-

ate his claims asa stallion. The mare may
turn out well, but her paper value is not Very
high, and her buyer was ne a good deal
on trust. The mare Palmy Days did not
reach a reserve, which was said to be $16,500.

J. Wallace's mares sold well. Waugh
gave $4,600 for Cauld Blast, by St. Frusquin,
with a colt foal by Laveno. Capt. Bauer

Obeah and Queen Fairy are sisters, the

Persimmon, and etinted to Zinfandel,
Green gave $8,850; for Decres Nisi, by Wis.
dom out of Partition, with a colt foal by
Florizel Il. and etinted to Bachelor's Button,
Signor Casares gave $4,360; for Debutante,
by Queen's Birthday out of Belle Demoiselle,
Baron von OUertzen gave $1,600, and for
Flordelice. by Martegon out of Fleur de
Marie, with a filly foal to John O'Gaunt,
and etinted to him again, Count Szapary

gave $5,720.

Of the late Lord peorhee' 8 Mares, Queen
of the Brine, my, Te per and Salt, with |
a filly foal by Volodyovski, was bought |

by Waugh for $3,430, and La Petite Dame,
by War Dance, was taken by Baron von
Oertzen for $2,850. The next best price—
$2,580--was paid by the same buyer for

Affinity, b Juggler, | with wi filly foal by
Collar, and etinted to Love Wisely. Affinity |
is full of running blood, but is herself
untried as a brood mare, so it is evident |
she reached her full value. From the
same atud Treachery, by Kilwarlin, with
a colt foal by St. Serf, and stinted to Ladas,
was considered a good bargain at $3,430,
but she also has her name to make as a
brood mare.

Dolly Watts, by St. Frusquin out of
Javotte, with a colt foal by Carbine, was
sold for $4,100. Among the Aafordby |
Place lot Tendril was the topnotcher. She
is by St. Simon out of Sweet Water, and

knocked down to Capt. Bauer for $3,640.
Capt. Greer sold Corncrake, by Gallinule
out of Corday, to J. Buchanan for $7,300,
and W. Johnston sold Sweet Melody, by
St. Frusquin, to Baron von Oertzen for
$4,520. 6 stallion trade was poor, the
best price being $1,000 for Frustrator.

The Oldest Bank.
From 7. P'a Weekly.

There was a kind of public record office at-
tached to the palace and temple at Nineveh, in
which it was customary to deposit important
legal and other documents, such as contracts
for agreements for the purchase and sale of
property, marriage settlements, wills, Ac.
Among these there were discovered official
statements as to the history and transactions
of the eminent banking house of Egidu at
Nineveh.

Aasyrian chronology proves that these refer
to a date about 2,300 years before the Christian
era, when Abraham dwelt at Ur of the Chal-
dees, as is stated in Genesis, We may there-
fore claim for this firm the reputation of being
the oldest bank in the world, at leaat of which
we have any record, orare likely to have, The
accounts are very voluminous and cover the
transactions of five generations of the house
from father to son.

The tirm grew rapidly

 

in importance durin

this period, Cone which they atiained erent
wealth, for they had succeeded in securing
from the king the appl ntment of collectors |
of taxes, a position which in the always
leads to fortune. They afterward framed
the revep e for several of the Assyrian proy-

very great gain to the firm.

P4Y OF ENGLISH CHAUFFEURS
Ranges rom 85 to 812.50 a Week —A Very
Few Receive S15.

Chauffeurs will not be likely to abandon
America in a grand rush for England if
they should happen upon a certain article
in the Gentlewoman entitled “The Cost of a
Chauffeur” —meaning of course the cost in
England.

Regarding wages, seys the article, these
may be anything from 20s, to 50s, a week.
Much depends upon the car and the ex-
perience of the driver. For a small car, say,
up to 15 horse-power, a very good man can
be obtained at 258. a week. For larger
cars, however, you must have a good and
experienced driver, and you will not get one
of that description under 35s. a week, pos-
sibly more.

A fair average for a good man is 35s.
and the best drivers will not look at any-
thing less than £2 to £2 10s. a week. Those
at the very top of the profession, handlin
high powered, apeody cars, earn their £:
{a week easily, besides perquisites, but
the ony and demand of these is neces-
sarily li

I strongly ‘advise against the employ -
ment of the cheap driver. I should look
with suspicion upon any man who offered
himself for a pound a week. Ho may be of
excellent character, but it is probable that
| he wants experience, and I don't want men
| gaining experience on my car.

Tho very best livery that can be provided
isa good, stout driving coat. Itis necessary
to the driver on even warm days, and it
‘always looks smart.

Cap and goggles, a set of overalls for
cleaning purposes, a pair of rubber boots
for use when washing the car, and drivin
gloves will complete the outfit, all of which
can be obtained at such places as Dunhill's
| or Gamage 8 for not more than a five pound
note is is sufficient for the driver em-
ployed in general driving; if he has much
town work a smart jacket will be needed
and possibly a complete livery.

OPPOSITION TO TROUSERS,

Wearers, Many People Believed, Could Not
Be Religious.
From Chazahera’a Journal,

The modern custom of wearing trousers |

was taken from the mititary dress intro-

duced into the army by the Duke of Welling-
'

ton during the Peninsular war.
In early Cays these were known as“

ton trousers,” after the Duke. When they

were coming into general use at the com- |

mencement of the nineteenth century the
religious world and the fashionable were most
determined in their opposition. A
in the original trust deed, dated 1820, of a
Shefileld Nonoonformist chapel provided
that “under no circumstances whatever shall
any preacher be allowed to occupy the pulpit
who wears trousers,”

Lut this was not all. Some doubts were

expressed in many quarters concerning the |

question whether a man could be religious
and appear in trousers, One of the founders
of the Primitive Methodiat boa y remarked
to a colleague in the minisiry “that trousers
wearing, beer drinking, so-and-so will never
get to heaven,”

Father Reece, a famous Method) st minister,
twice president of the conference (born in
1765, died in 1850), could not be induced to
adopt trousers, and among the Methodista
was the last to fellow popular fashivn in this |
respect.
