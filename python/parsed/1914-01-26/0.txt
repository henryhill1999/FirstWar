As to questions relating purely to inter-

The question may be solved by having

It was the wish of the late Mr. Morgan

ultimate disposal of the collection was left
in the hands of the younger Mr. Morgan, ,

During a recent trip abroad it is un- |

TOO MUCH SPACE IN FLATS. |

CINCINNATI, Jan, 26,—-How flats may be

is to say, rentable, is the question now
engaging the attention of Cincinnati
architects,” Too much space is being
wasted, in thé opinion of owners, and the
architects will meet this week to discuss |
economy in design.

There is a proposal to abolish bedrooms, |
in the larger sense of the word, but this
does not necessarily mean that the new |
style of architecture will murder sleep,
The plan is to previde facilities for sleep- |
ing, cooking and eating by means of,
cleverly designed closets surrounding a!
central livjgg room, j

The gross waste of space in flats is}
pointed out by E. J. Beall, real estate
dealer, who lives in a five room flat that |
takes up only the area of one average
sized room. Reall's flat consists entirely
of closets built around the one room, |
which he uses as his library and parlor.
A mirror is in each closet door. When
Beall desires to eat he opens a door and
presto! he is in his kitchen, consisting of
china closet, a pantry and a gas stove,
all on shelves, Behind another mirror is
his dinner table folded against the wall, |
His bedroom and bathroom are similar |
