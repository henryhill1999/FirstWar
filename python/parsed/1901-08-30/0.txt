That Would Set Be Much of a Strain.

Sone spokesman for the Greater New

eehan is the head, issued a state

ment yesterday apparentivy  tatended

{ be a defiance to Senator Piatt

Mr Platt had authorized @ statement that
« Kepublican conferees who are to attend

‘ « Republican conferees would tak:

For vearly a year the idol of the Greater

een ex-Senator Hill, He bas also beer
« (oler nan, but It was announced in Tue
mn Monday that Mr Hill had rather
«| faith in Mr. Coler on the ground that
.* was coquetting with Tanunany Hall
Now comes this alleged statement of the
eater New York Democracy’ s posiit

We are in faver of @ complete coalition

however, support Seth low for Mavor
Mr Low receives the nomination. we will

whera@w from the anti-Tammany confer

Senator Platt has said that the Repitii
an organization would support any inde
pendent Democratic candidate for Mayor
rept Mr. Coler With this idea in view
influential Democrats gathered at an uy
town hotel yesterday and discussed the
best plan by which an independent Dene
erat could be presented for support These
Demoerata did bot want their names printed
a! thie time, but they said that they lad
started a movement by which all of the anti
Tammany Democratic organizations in
the city were to be got together and name
the independent Seen eorat for Mayo
at a city convention Then the name
f this candidate was to be submitted to
the conventions of the Hepublicans and
the Citizens’ Union organizations wit
the mxquest that he be indorsed: the point
was made that the anti: lammany Demo
rmtic organizations having & city cor
vention of their own and naming an lode
pendent Democrat, would ervetallize the
oppesition to Tammany The Ke !
and the Citizens’ Union men in their oor

 

 

 

lowers

ventions would then be requested to fll |

out the remainder of the ticket

While the Democrats who  discusmed
thie programme yesterday had no sole
candidate in view many of them were
favoratiy disposed to ex-Postmaster
(hnarles W) Davton, and they believed that
the Greater New York Democracy would
support Mr. Dayton or some other inde-
vendent Democrat of similar .
¢ Dayton was John CC Sheehan's candi-
jate for Mayor in 1897, when Mr. Sheehan
was deputy leader of Tammany Hall in
Mr. Croker's absence. Mr. Dayton had the
support also at that time of more than
one-half of the Tammany Hal! leaders

The declaration of the alleged position |

of the Greater New York Democracy was
interpreted variously The first uncer
standing of it was that John F Carroll,
lenuty loader f Tammany Hall, had capt
ured most of the organization Meo Carroll
~ known as a pacificator Another inte

pretation wae that Mr. (Croker, at the last

il aceept Mr. Coler as the candidate of |

Taeoamany for Mavor Tt was said hw
Democrats that Mr. Coler's utterances
: Croker personally had beer
“satiefactorily explained to Mr Croker
and Mr Coler has apologized to John Sean
ne There was certainly more Coler
centiment last night heard in Tammany
treles than for a long time If Tammany
vninates Mr Coler the Greater New
rk Democracy could easily “indorse
the Tammany nomination ”

Tt was said that Democrats who in the
ast have amnoothed out many ao wrink!.
have had talke with Mr Croker, Meo Cay
roll and others and beliewe that sore
thing should be done to heal up the fac
tonal differences caused by Mr Croker's
onduct sinee the Democratic national
\ietory of 1882

Iwo Democrats ing the confidence of
Vir Hill said last night: “Mr Hill now
telieves that Seth Low should be norm
nated for Mayor We cannot understand
why he takes this attitude, because he ha«
aiwave been for Mr Coler until the last
week or so. Mr Hill undoubtedty be
eves that Mr Low would be very strong
