> wanted me to sell my bust of Gari-

baldi Lazzari exclaimed in deep offence
ihey want it to keep here and put up in

Lnd did you sell it?®

“No! | would never sell Garibaldi!”

Ay in the pipe—a soothing and cone
a g puff—and thenPana speaks again

“lll give them the bust to keep here.”

So “the Garibaldi place,” the name by
which strangers have inquired for Lagzari'a
restau for a generation, will still be
marked by the name and features of the
Italian patriot, who has been a lifelong
object of honor by Laazari

Lazzari had his restaurant first down on
the shores of Narrows, at Rosebank,
in the house where Garibaldi made tallow
candles, in company with Meucci, his fellow
countryman, whom many persons believe
fto-day was really the inventor of the tele-
phone. Meucci did invent or devise a
telephone at about the same time that Bell
and others did so, and his defenders have
insisted that he was defrauded of his honors
and just dues when the patent was granted
to another, ;

Lazzari from the first was faithful to both
Garibaldi and Meucei, and when his dinners
proved so attractive that business outgrew
the humble building by the water's edge
he bought the larger house and a large
acreage up on the hilltop, named the new
place in Garibaldi’s honor, Caprera Park,
and removed to it the boiler which Gari-
baldi and Meucci had used to make the
candles, |

This boiler housed in brick, visitors to
*the Garibaldi place” used to go out and
look at, after looking up at the bust of
Garibaldi over the front door, and arrang-
ing for dinner.

That dinner, of replete memory, after
which Fate was pew ener to harm, dis-
turb or annoy! No halting, squeamish or
jaded palate but found in the VERE OF
ante-paali a provocative morsel upon w ich
to nurse appetite, and the hearty eater wel-
comed them all appreciatively in an indis-
criminate mélange. And the small and
tender lobsters Which characterized the
place! Lazzari belongs to a society for
the preservation of lobsters as & species
60 of course there could be no undersized
ones sold there; but wonderfully success-
ful he was in capturing the tender ones,
and he certainly was a good guesser at the
size limit. : ;

But the “fritto-misto," while not the
piece de résistence, was certainly the dish
of the Jove and admiration of the epicure.
There is no English equivalent for Laz-
vari's fritto-misto; the translation of the
words means nothing, The preparation of
this dish in its various combinations made
the pluce worth a visit in itself. The ten-
der, young, green BAPATAGUA, SPR from
papa’s brother's farm in Virginia and never
marketed; the careiofini, green peas, fresh
Mushrooms, calves’ brains and veal cooked
ko that it was tender as sweetbreads, and
fometimes the tenderest of green summer
Bquash—these prepared aa one table dish
by Mama Laazari mude converts of the
Philistines.

But no man may tell of all the courses
of the Lazaari dinner without cruelty to
the hungry. Indeed, it was a sava 6 joke
that was played sometimes to watch one6
ktranger guest feast on these earlier courses
and then struggle valiantly with each tooth-
Kone succeeding one, torn between appe-
tite and a retributiye conscience, ,

The patronage of Laczari's was varied,
Some years ago people used to go there
i) carriages or on horseback, residents of
the island often riding over there for re«
fresimonts, Stoall walking clubs, or a
few persona who enjoyed a walk, would

the only wav, and then the elusive restau-
rant, hidden behind a hill from the station,
was difficult, to find, ‘The trolley came

of the Garibaldi place, but for that of a
ry restaurant, and yet Lazzari’s ree

never cheapened his dinner, and
end it remained the bet table d'hété about
New York

In fine weather, with the sun setting
behind the higher hills and Lazzari's

lighted only by the indireet glow of the
sunset hour, there was no pleasanter place
to have a table set than on the uncovered
veranda, forty feet broad. Bankers, lit-
erary men, journalists, artista, city hotel
owners and managers secking something
different trom their own restaurahte,
theatrical stars and managers, and hosts
of plain, ordinary citizens who knew and
valued the Ltalian cooking (supervised,
Btrangely enough, by a German, for Sig-

Lavzari, always wrapped up in revolution.
ary Iwly, was not only act the executors
of the Garabaldi property here, but was a
charter member of the Mazzini Society,
and two or three years ago received a lov-
ing cup from the members of the society.
In earlier days, when there was some shoot-
ing on Staten Island, he used to gun for
birdé, in season, and there are some cur-
ious pictures of the sportamanship of those

days in his place now. Among hie friends
and patrons two have always n officers
of the transatlantio steamships, who

while their abips were here, used to go to
the Garibaldi place for dinner. They would
take along for Lagzari some boxes of choice
cigars and an occasional bottle of fine
cognac, whioh papa would later share with
occasional friends who came for dinner,
after a bottle or two of rich Italian spark-
ling wines which made brut champagnes
seem tasteless and not worth while.

Although out of health for several years
past, Lazzari haa retained his cheerful-

injunction was issued by Justice Garrett.

for by Henry T, Chapman, a taxpayer,
Yor whom Mr, Chapman was acting did not
appear. The order is returnable next
Saturday. Another temporary injunction
which was served on Commiasioner Steven-
son restrained him from awarding any
contract until bids for eye bar cables have
been invited. This order is returnable
on May 2.

As soon as the orders were served upon
Mr. Stevenson he went to Mineola, with
Assistant Corporation Counsel Burr, and
pointed out to Justice Garrettson that the
order fe renting the opening of bids would
virtually mean that the bids would have

be readvertised which would _ mean
another long delay. Thereupon Justice
CGarrettson amended his order so as to
permit Mr. Stevenson to reoeive the bids
and to hold them until permission to open
them is granted by the court.

This ig the third time that the specifica-
tions for the construction of the bridge
have been advertised and the resultant
bids held up.

Vice-President Reynders of the Penn-
sylvania Steel Company said yesterday
that his company had not inspired the in-
junction issued by Justice Garrettson,

Mr. HEINEMANN isn't a man to bungie;

Appears to have heard of a thing of two
About Chicago and what men do

Who live in that city «@ loathsome crew.

it's there that the stockyarde reek with bined,
And the poor man dies, as he lives, in mud;
The Trusts are wealthy heyond compere,

And the bosses are all triumphant there,

And everything rushes without a skid

To be plunged in a hell which has lost its lid,
Por a country where things like that are done
There's just one remedy, only one,

A latter-day Upton Sinclairism

Which the rest of us know as Socialiom,

Here's luck to the book! It will make you cower,
Por it's written with wonderful, thrilling power.
It grips your throat with a grip Titanic,

And scatters shams with a force volcanic,

Go buy the book, for I judge you need ir,

And, when you have bought it, read it, read ir.
