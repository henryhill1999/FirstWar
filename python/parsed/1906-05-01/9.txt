There was littie expectation that the 400
metre event would result as it did Ketore
the race ataried general expectation
was that it would be a grand « be-
tween Hiliman of the United States and
Halawell of bngiand The tirst part of the
race gave color to that theory. Hillman
ewept out in the lead, minning srandly, and
led the field by two vards at the 300 metre
mark. Here he began to waver and in less
than five strides broke down and began to
wabble. His weakened knee had played
him false A gran swept through the
watching Americans, for Hillman waa the
chief reliance. Halswell, full of running,
took the place of Hillman, who had retired,
Right hack of him was the lean Pilgrim of
the New York A.C.

Without apparent effort he swung clean
past the astonished Halswell and easily
etaved off all efforts to hold him. He won
by two yards from the English soldier.
Nigel Barker, the Australian, was third,
well up. The time was four seconds be-
hind a record of 49 1-5 seconds, held by
Hillman

The third American victory was that
earned by George Bonhag in the 1,500
metre walk, Where he came in to be a
walker is not known, as he never had
practised the art before coming here. He
stepped out in good style and won by a
good inargin. -

The injury to Prinstein's ankle in the
running broad jump on Thursday put him
out of the three standing jumps this after-
noon, Peter O'Connor won, with P. Leahy
second. Connolly of the United States
Was third. O'Connor, although the British
‘flag was hoisted when he won, walked
about the stadium waving his Irish flag to
show the assemblage where he hailed from.

Two Americans, Friend and Leavitt,
qualified for to-day's final in the 110 metre
hurdles.

The fact that Mitchel's injury prevented
him from taking part in the sports broke
up the American tug of war team, and the
representatives of the Stars and Stripes
took no part in the tng. The Germans
an, with the Greeks second and the Swedes
t ‘

O'Connor formally protested to-day
egainst Prinstein being awarded the broad
jump, alleging, first, that Prinstein jumped
out of his turn to gain the advantage of
an unspoiled track; second, that Matthew
P. Halpin of the New York A. C. assutned
the duties of judge and measurer com-
bined in the temporary absence of the
official measurer, and, third, that while
thus acting officially Halpin declared that
two of O’Connor's jumps were foul. One
of the foul jumps exceeded that on which
Prinstein was declared the winner. The
protest was not allowed. The matter has
occasioned unpleasant feeling.

To-morrow will witness the event which,
for the Greeks, eclipses all others. This is
the Marathon race. It is expected that
the Population of the capital will be at
least doubled by excursionists. There
probably will be seventy starters. The
Greeks largely fancy Kantzias of the
Pirmus Athletic Club. The lack of acclimat-
ization and unfamiliarity with the course
are expected to exclude anv foreigner.

The events of the day resultetl as follows:

400 Metre Run--Won by Panl H. Pligrim, Jr,,

Lonpon, May 1.—The correspondent of
the Daily Moil at Athens says the Ameri-
cans rely upon SRrne to win the Marathon
race. They say he has covered the course
in 2 hours 40 minutes, which is fifteen
minutes less than the time of Loues, the
Greek who won the event in 1898. This
-claim, however, is generally regarded as a
binff. Nevertheless Loues's achievement

Representatives Mave

Morray Howe, representing the Memphte

Raving Ase*ociation, has asked the hoard of

review of the National Trotting Association, |

which meets to-day att Murray Bill Hotel,
to poatpone the hearing the famons gold
cup case until the November meeting The
has heen made in writing and the
board will announce ita decision when the
case ia reached on the docket

the action hinges on charges of fraud
in the race at Memphie between Lon Dillon,
2, driven by C. KG. Billings, and Major
Delmar, 2014, driven by FE. F. Smathers
The Murray Howe faction -reated a turf
sensation by bringing a civil action for the
possession of the up which they obtained
by a sheriff'a attachment from Smathers,
who regained it by giving bonds, Smathers
has been vigorous in denving the charges
and at his request, to avoid the delays of

New York civil courts, the board of
review took up the investigation, owe tee
after the biennial meeting In February the
board had decided to investigate the matter
before the receipt of this communication.

1 am ready with my side of the cease,”
said Smathers vesterday
board of review meeting when the case is
called. T do not know on what ground the
vostponement is asked, nor what action the
oard of review will take on the request °,

William H. Gocher, of Hartford, secretary
of the board of review, arrived last night at
the Murray Hill Hotel. He said that a request
for a continuance of the gold cup case had
heen sent to the board of review by the Mem-
Phis representatives, which would be acted on
at the session,

HARVARD SNUBS QUAKERS.

Declines to Consider a Football Game With
Pennsylvania.

CamBripog, April 30.--Little surprise was
expressed by the Harvard undergraduates
to-day over the announcement that Harva
tad dropped Pennsylvania from her foot-
ball schedule for next year in case the college
plays football. Prof. White, chairman of
the athletic committee, announced last night
that the athletic committee had _ | otified
the Quakers, in reply to a letter askin’ of

Harvard's position that there would be no
football games next year. This is taken to
mean that there will not be another game
for at least a number of years. It probably
also means that Harvard will drop Penn-

| sylvania in all branches of sport

|

No reason was given out for the action on
Harvard's part, but the reason is well known.
Harvard thinks that the Philadelphia college
has a widely different ideal of sport than she
has, and that nothing can be gained from
playing them.

Harvard's spring football practice began
on Soldier's Field this afternoon and will
last for several weeks, as long as the weather

ermits. Fer the first time scrimmages will

e held tn epcing practice to give the coaches
an idea of the possibility of the new rules. A
number of former players were in the squad
that reported to-day.

Queen's Club, e defeated soahas Crane
of Boston easily in straight sets. e score

and the match was a disappointment. It
lasted only fifty minutes,

Brooklyn Yacht Club Opening.

The clubhouse of the Brooklyn Yacht Club
at Rensonhurst will be opened for the season
next Saturday. This is an informal opening,
just for the convenience of the members.
The club will go in commission on Saturday,
May 26, the day the ocean race to Bermuda
is to be started. This club is growing very
fast. At the last meeting of the board of
governors eighteen members were elected
making the total elections since the first of
the year ninety-three. There are now foure
teen applications for membership which are
to be passed on at the next meeting. The
new members are Gratz Nathan, John Alden,
Nathaniel H. Levi, William G, Foster, James

Squadron A Beate Seventy-firet Begiment
In Revolver Match.

The revolver match between Squadron A
and the Seventy-first Regiment, N. G. N. Y.,
took place in the squadron range on Saturday
last and resulted in a victory for the squadron
by six points. Each contestant fired ten
shots deliberate fire at thirty yards and ten
at fifty varde ata Standard American target.
Colt revolvers, calibre .58, were used by both
teams. The score:

Roper Head Football Coach at Princeton.

The man who is to be head coach of the
Princeton football squad next fall is one
who has won no great renown on the gridiron,
but who, it is thought, has the personality

and football knowledge to make the most
of the material. W. Roper has been chosen,

has | oper is a graduate of the class of '02 and

played end on the varsity eleven when at
tinceton, It was he who made the touche
down Agelna Columbia the year Columbia
defeat Princeton. Roper _ has coached
several fresiimen teams at Princeton. The
choice lay Between him and_Harold Short,
who played guard for the Tigers for four
years. Football results at Prinneeton in
recent years have not been very satisfactory
on the whole, and it was deemed advisable to
make a change in the coaching régime.

R. L. Rogera, owner of Garnish, the winner
of .esterday's handicap, was a greatly sur-

prised man when he saw his Rapallo gelding |

firet in front, so the paddock sharps said
Rogers did not believe that Garnish was
betting on him

Dave Gideon, Jes e Lewisohn and others
in their set backed Garnish at the last mo-
ment with surprising con dence Roma-
nelli, who ia riding for Gideon thes days,
bad the mount, and ie got every ounce of
energy and speed our of th» Rapallo gelding,
who, by the way, once beat the famous Bel-
dame in heavy going. In this race Jack
McGinnis thought t at he had a cha ce to
clean up with his recently acquire! Ma-
saniello, while the clubhouse contingent bet
heavily on Jack McKeon, chiefly because he
waa scratched out of the second event to
atart in the handicap. Just what ailed Bill
Daly's Sailor Boy, a good mud lark as a rule,
no ody could say, but the colt ran such a
bad race that even Father Bill opened his
eves in surprise

The Kraus family did not havea particularly
enjoyable afternoon from all accounts, It
looked as if Robador, one of the family's
pets, might win the second race, and he was
accordingly backed from 10 déwn to 5,:only
to finish absolutely last. Then the members
of the family, together with their allies, the
Sullivans, passed up Melbourne Nominee,
another of the Kraus horses, in the fifth event,
only to see him win at 10 to 1. The play on
Robador forced the price against Ebony, the
favorite, from 7 to 10 up to 4 to 5. But Ku-
gene Wayland, the owner of the black colt,
never weakened in his faith and bet $1,000
at the best odds obtainable. Ebony looked
to have the race at his merey on form and he
justified the support aceorded to him by
the hig operators, who backed him heavily
at the last moment. Consuelo IJ., who ran
in the place, was purchased from F. G. Cal-
houn hefore the races by an agent of Timothy
D. Sullivan,

James R. Keene's Oyama, who ran third
in the Dunton Stakes, is the Commando-
Ben My Chree colt who was highly thought
of last year until his firat race, when he showed
a tendency to run out. In yesterday's event
Ovama, who has developed into a big, power-
ful racer, had plenty of early speed and did
well under the circumstances. On a dry
track he may be worth looking up.

Walter Miller, the star jockey, had a narrow
escape from a fatal accident in the first race.
He had the leg upon R. T. Wilson, Fr.'s, Joyful,
a son of Mirthful—Lady Schorr, who rushed
to the front as eoon as the barrier went up
and was leading by a couple of lengths when
the turn was reached, Then Joyful suddenly
bolted, and before Miller could pull him up,
the youngster crashed into the outer rail
with terrifle force. Both horse and jockey
were knocked down, but neither was seriously
injured. The accident, however, may have
unnerved Miller, for he did not ride with
his usual energy the rest of the day. He
finished second with both Consuelo II. and
Belle of Pequest, and took third money with
Little Flea,

Aa if the burden of the talent wae not heavy
enough in suffering the defeat of four favorites
in actual races, the last straw came when
Starter Cassidy left Lester I. Hayman, 11 to5
favorite, at the post in the fifth event. By
some peculiar mistake there were many
persons at the track who confounded this
colt with Leonard Joe Hayman, a three-
year-old in the name stable and a good one
at that. As a result there seemed to be an
unoridled desire to bet on Lester L., who
did not race last year and is a son of Maddi-
son—Enamel. (Giovanni Balerio, a Pontiac
colt, who ran second, is said to have been
named for Johnny White, the former boxing
referee.

There was a hot tip afloat on R. T. Wilson,
Jr.'s, Silver Star, a colt by Ornament—Star
Dreamer, in the last race, the odds tumbling
from 15 to 6. But the stable connections
did not bet much, for it was believed that
the colt was not ready. Velocity, who ran
third in. August Belmont's colors and was
wholly neglected in the betting, is a filly by
Henry of Navarre--Lady Viola.

What has become of Jockey Eugene Hilde-
brand? He has not been riding at all lately,
and rumor has it that his services will be given
exclusively to the Whitney stable this year.
As the stable has second call on Lucien Lyne,
Hildebrand may find himself playing second
fiddle before long if Lyne continues to ride
up to his present high class form.

More screens were placed to obstruct the
view of the track from the street yesterday
and the poolrooms were again in difficulties.
lt is said that great pressure was recently
brought to bear upon the politicians who hold
stock in the Metropolitan Jockey Club to let
up in the fight on the rooms, but the anawer
was that there was nothing doing. “If the
keapers of poolroome find that they cannot
do business,” said a man in touch with the sit-
uation yesterday, “nobody will prevent them
from coming to the track, where they can
make book unmolested and without paying
acent for the privilege. It is as fair for them
inside the fence as it is outside of it.”

Frank J. Bryan, who was judge at the Pim-
lico meeting, which closed on Saturday,
arrived at Jamaica yesterday. He said that
Pimlico never enjoyed such prosp , and
that if the crowds that attended appear at
the next meeting the accommodations will
have to be increased There were 6,000 paid
aan teslons at the Baltimore track on Sat-
urday.

No wonder Bismark could not receive per- |
mission to book at Jamaica! The number of
the stand he drew in the Met's line was 23!

P J. Dwyer, president of the Brooklyn
Jockey Club, announced last night that he had
pede arrangements with the Long Island

ailroad by which the usual race trains will
be run from Thirty-fourth street to Graves-
end this season. 4

furlongs,and with hia stable mate, Emergency,
will be a choice to beat Accountant, Sir Brillar,
Tommy Waddell and others. Two-year-olds
will run in the first race at five furlongs,
with Donna Elvina, Chamblet, Odd Trick
and Dry Dollar having chances. In the
second race at six furlongs Sue Smith, Es-
cutcheon, Austin Allen, Hocus Pocus and
Ballot Box look best. Water Dog will he
played to win the fifth race at a mile and
seventy yards, with Lord Badge, Aurumaster
and Lilita the other factors, perhaps. In
the last race for maidens at six furlongs King
Henry, Waterbearer, Duenna and Nogi figure.

PHILADELPRIA (N. L.), 6; BROOKLYN, 2.

After their winsome work of Sunday
the Brooklyns faded away yesterday. The
Philadelphias made them do so. By better
batting and _ fiel ing, the dapper Duffyites
beat the disciples of Donovan handily. Eight
two-baggers were made, of which number
the Q sCers tore off five, and the doubles
figured extensively in the ran etting. Brans-
field doubled in the second inning and reached
home on an infield out and a double steal
A base on balla to Thomas, Ward's single
and Magee’s slam sent another Quaker around
in the third. The Brooklyns tied the soor
in the same inning on Bergen’s single an
two baggers by Lumley and Casey. :

Ward's double, Magee's repeat end Titus’s
tap scored two Quakers in the fifth inning,
and Thomas's etroll and Ward's two baser
accounted for a round trip in the seventh.

HANDICAP YACHT RACES,

Execative Committee of New Association
Tells Its Plans.

The executive commitiee of the handicap
yacht racing class has issued a circular to
all yachtsmen telling its plans and asking
yachtamen who own vessels that are eligible
to help to make the scheme a success. The
executive committee is G. P. Granbery, presi-
dent; H. A. Jackson, Jr,, secretary, and Dr.
J. B. Palmer, treasurer. In this letter thie
committee says:

“There has been organized a handicap
yacht racing class, the object of which is to
promote and encourage racing for such
yachts as have little chance of com Dg 6Uu0-
cessfully in the regular o classes.

“The time allowance wht be comduted ao-
cording to the relative past performances of

| the yachts and all yachts other than scratch

will receive asa pandicap a percentage of the
fastest apesd time made in the race.
handicap shall not exceed & per cent.,
yachts will be rehandicapped each week.

“The affairs of the class will be managed b:
oo executive committee consisting of a -

ent, secretary andtreasurer. Thecommittese
may classify yachts in two or more divisions,
according to their size and relative perform.
ances. With the exception of a few special
class rules the rules of the Yacht Raoing
Association of Long Island Sound will govern,
It is not intended to conflict in any way wi
the regular classes but to afford every yacht
in this class an opportunity to win during
season.

“The system of time allowance adopted has

been highly approved by several promin
naval arch tects and deslanare, end the \oeae

| ing yacht clubs have agreed to provide races

or this class.
“A number of yachts are already registered
gnc this class promises to become a stron
eature of the season's racing. Any y
owner who is a member of a recognized yabht

| olub may at any time register his yacht for

the current year on approval of the executive
committee and payment of the registration
fee of $5

“As we desire to make an impressive show-
ing in the early races we request you to regi¢-
ter your yacht at an early date, for whio
application should be made to the secretary.”

LIVELY LACROSSE GAME,

Cornell Beats Columbia in Contest That
Results in Broken Nose for One Player.

Iraaca, N. Y., April 80,—The Cornell varsity
lacrosse team defeated the Columbia twelve
in a rough game on Percy Field this aftere
noon by a score of 8to0. The ball was kept
in the New Yorkers’ territory throughout
the greater part of the contest, although the
Ithacans were unable to land the ball in the
net in the first half, chiefly because of the
clever defence of the goal put up by Lage,
In the second period, after a series of flerce
rushes, Odendhall scored the first goal for
Cornell, A few seconds later Darling sho
the ball past the goalkeeper for the secon
tally, Near the end of the half Odedhall
secured the third and last point for the Red
Frantz, Columbia's second ate
tack, had his nose broken in oneof the serlme
maces but refused to leave the game

Parry's Great One Hand Hammer Throw,

Ed Parry, the University of Chicago ham-
mer thrower, who won the special event et
the University of Pennsylvania relay games
last Saturday, achieved the marvellou
distance of 155 feet 1 inch with a one han
throw. Parry has many times made credit-
able throws, bul this is about the bigeest
to his credit. He throws with his right hand
only. Not since W. L. Coudon in 1890 threw
a etiff handle 16 pound hammer 128 feet 1
inches has there been any one hand recor
throw made. Presumabiv the difference be-
tween the modern tvpe of hammer and the
old broom handle kind accounts for some of
the difference in the tiirows But it seems
as if Parry should get credit for e record,
