TO THE INVESTORS OF THE WORLD:

THAT PANIC STEEL PREFERRED

Since December, 1904, and April, 1905, when, because of their newness Arrangements are about completed to lay before the world the astound-

Yesterday when my half page advertisement was filed with the Cable Simultaneously with its publication, organized effort will be made to

tricksters at a profit of $140,000,000 upon an original investment of
$250,000,900.

When the eyes of the American people are opened, this law will be
changed as quickly as were the much better protected life insurance grafting

I now ask the financial world and the American people if they require
any further demonstration of the abject weakness of that mighty ‘‘System’’
which before it was caught red-handed in its insurance robberies and a score

of other plunderings was all powerful. laws,

finish That under these circumstances any holder who sells at above par cannot lose, and when the crash comes

P. S. Widows, orphans and idiots whose funds are invested in steel preferred should keep this constantly in front of them. Rogers and the Rockefellers have given away dur-
