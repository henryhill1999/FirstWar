than Lightbody's record made in St Louis

There was little expectation that the 400
metre event would result as it did Ketore
the race started the general expectation
was that it would be a grand contest be-
tween Hillman of the United States and
Halewell of Fngiand. The tirst part of the
race gave color to that theory Hillman
ewept out in the lead, running grandly, and
led the field by two vards at the 300 metre
mark Here he began to waver and in less
than five strides broke down and began to
wabble. His weakened knee had plaved
him false. A groan swept through the
watching Americans, for Hillman was the
chief reliance. Halswell, full of running,
took the place of Hillman, who had retired
Right back of him waa the lean Pilgrim of

Without apparent effort he awning clean

ataved off all efforts to hold him. He won
by two yards from the English soldier.

well up. The tine waa four seconds be-
hind the record of 49 1-5 seconds, held by
Hillman

rned by George Bonhag in the 1,500
metre walk, Where he came in to he a
walker is not known, as he never had
practised the art before coming here. He
stepped out in good style and won hy a
good margin.

The injury to Prinstein's ankle in the
running broad jump on Thursday put him

ut of the three standing jumps thie after-

oon. Peter O'Connor won, with P. Leahy
second. Connolly of the United states
was third. O'Connor, although the British
flag was hoisted when he won, walked
about the stadiurn waving his Irish flag to
show the assemblage where he hailed from.

Two Americans, Friend and Leavitt,
qualified for to-day’s final in the 110 metra
hurdles.

The fact that Mitchel's injury prevented
him from taking part in the sports broke
up the American tug of war team, and the
representatives of the Stars and Stripes
took no part in the tug. The Germans

O’Connor formally protestec

 

 

against Prinatein being awarded the broad
jump, alleging, firat; that Prinstein jumped
out of hia turn to gain the advantage of
an unspoiled track; second, that Matthew
P. Halpin of the New York A. C. assumed
the duties of judge and measurer com-
bined in the temporary absence of the
official measurer, and, third, that while
thus acting officially Halpin deolared that
two of O'Connor's jumps were foul. One
of the foul jumps exceeded that on which
Prinstein was declared the winner. The
protest was not allowed. Tha matter has
occasioned unpleasant feeling.

To-morrow will witness the event which,
for the Greeks, eclipses al] others. This is
the Marathon race. It is expected that
