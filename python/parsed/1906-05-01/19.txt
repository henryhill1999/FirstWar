Senator Page was obstructing Assembly
bills in the Senate. Assemblyman Bur-
nett, Senator Ruines’s while haired boy,
jeined with Assemblyman Merritt in the
motion.

Assermblymen Prentice and Wainwright
pleaded that such should not be the case,
and Mr. Wainwright said that this was a
time for the supporters of the recording
tax bill to show their strength, But the
Democrats are opposed to the bill and

withdrew his motion to lay aside and moved
that the bill be reeommitted to the Rules

64 to 47.

In the Senate at Senator Raines's sug-
gestion the Senate bills were first taken
= It was hoped that either side in the Sen-
a would yield a point. The tip-State
members who represent real rural con-
stituents appealed to the city members to

jeld in their deadlock of the business of
he Senate and permit the West good roads
bill, which is in general orders, to be brought
up. They argued that the passage of the
West bill is important for political reasons
to the Republican purty up-State.

They were answered by the supporters
of the recording tax bill that the city meni-
bers cannot ge back home without pass-
ing a bill which will wipe the abnoxious
mortgage tax law |
and it was just as important for the suc-
ceas of the Republican party that this bill
be passed as the one for the benefit of the
country members.

was(taken up in the Senate to-night, and
evidences of the situation changing 1n

* OLARKK ON THE RATE BILL,

Arkansas Senator Saye Hepburn Measure
Would Not Satisfy the People.

Wasttinaton, April °0.-Senator Clarke
of Arkansas made his maiden speech in
the Senate to-day on the railroad: rate
question, There. was unusual interest
among Mr. Clarke's colleagues and hiv
words were followed closely.

Mr. Clarke said the Hepburn bill if it
became a aw would not satisfy the people.
It would show that Congress either mia-
understood the peoples wishes or was in-
capable of dealing with the subjeot. He
discussed the Bailey amendment to limit
the powers of the Federal oourts to issue
temporary injunctions suspending orders
of the Interatate Commerce Commission,
made pursuant to the Hopburn bill. He
approved Mr, Bailey's position. He de-
clared that the right to issue temporary
injunotiong was not an inherent power,
but that it was a rule of equity practice
regulatad by statute.

Mr. Clarke said he did not favor a court
review feature in the bill. The right to
review was given by the Constitution.
Congress could not add to or subtract from
this power,

struck up the “Marseillaise® and all the men
in uniform stood at attention while Admiral
Campion entered the room, side by 8i
with Admiral Comm who had gone to
meet him. Then followed in a group the
other senior officers of the French muneree.

A halt was made part way tp the room
about the silver punch bow] which the
Kaiser presented to Capt. Hemphill of the
Kearsarge at Kiel three years ago. Then,
properly. fortified, the French officers ap-
proached the ordeal of talking English to
the ladies. Some succeeded better than
others. A young and admiring officer
was introduced toa girl who, like him, could
xpeak only one language. He made several
leads in French, but it was no use. Finally
he remarked in accents of despair, “Fine
day, yiss,” and relapsed into silence. His
companion after a pause asked him whether
he had been to West Point. With his hand
on his heart he bowed, gratefully, evi-
dently under the impression that he was
receiving a compliment. ; ,

“No, no,” said his companion, “West
Point, on the Hudson River, you know.”

“Al oui, oul, e great Hudsonne Rivaire,
zat isa by here" he motioned expressivel
toward the Erie Basin and Gowanus Canal,
The room was decorated with the navy
vard's supply of forel banners. The
sunlight camein throught , and fell upon
the women's gowns, mostly of pure white
or faintly tinted eilks, making these flush

SCRANTON, April #.— The @good order
of the Lackawanna reigon, ere there
are more anthracite mines working than
in any other, wae maintained to-day,
with the exception of slight disturbances
of little moment,

The United Mine Workers’ officials were
kept very busy arranging for the con-
vention which will convene here Wednes-
day afternoon, John Mitchell sent word
to President Nicholls that he will transfer
his headquarters here early to-morrow
morning.

Several of the operators professed to
believe this evening that it would be pos-
sible to still avoid a strike without sur-
rendering anything to the miners, but

| they are now in a hopeless mivority and

the people of the community regretfully
believe there will be a strike

The officials of the United Mime Workers,
as well as some of the operators thought
that to-day there would be a falling off inthe
number of non-\nion men reporting for
work, but in this city they were mistaken.
The Lackawanna found more applications
for work from old men than for weeks,
and the Erie, Seranton Coal Company and
Delaware and Hudson companies reported
as many men at work as there have been at
any time since the suspension was declared.
A canvass has been made of these men to
see if they will obey a strike order from

| Mitchell, and almnoxt to a man they de-

clared that they will not.

Much speculation has been caused durin
the last few days by the fact that several o
the better informed operators have been
saying: “Take my word for it, there will
be no strike. Something is going to hap-
pen before Thursday that will change the
entire complexion of affairs.” Asked if
that meant that the operators were to

| grant concessions the officials referred to

maid: “No, it will all end in a complete sur-
render by the miners.”

President Nicholls of District No, 1 was
asked thix afternoon if he had any idea
what sich ataterments
operators meant, and be answered "Not in
the Jeast.” it appears that this was the
firet time that his attention had been called
to such statements, and he affected great
surprise,

The coal companies are now making
final arrangements for operating their col-
lieriess A party of Lackawanna officials,
including Vice-President E. FE, Loomis,
visited the company's mining property
along the Bloom division thik morning.
Col, Phillips of the Coal Mining Depart-
ment, Chief Special Agent Adamson, in
charge of the detective force of the com-
pany; Superintendent of Washeries Fred
Smith, General Superintendent Clarke and
Division Superintendent Rine were in the
party.

BARR EXPECTED HERE TO-DAY,

Coal Dealers Belleve That a Sirtke Will
Surely Be Declared.

President Baer of the Jersey Central
Railroad is expected in this city to-day
to have a talk with the presidents of the
other coal roads on the anthracite situation.

 

It could not be learned yesterday whether |

the operators will issue a formal statement
in reply to Mitchell's interview in which

he says that the freight rates of the com- |

| panies are exorbitant and suggests that

|

|
|
|

emanating from |

the advance demanded be taken off the
freight ratea. Nothing very definite, it
was learned, will be done by the operators
until the result of the convention of the
anthracite mine workers in Scranton on
Thursday is known,

The belief among most of the coal dealers
in this city yesterday was that no matter
what negotiations may take place a strike
will ultimately be officially deolared. This

view was shared by others as the demand ,

for smal! steam sizes increased and prices
went up.

The refusal of the soft coal operators in
Clearfield, Pa., to grant the demands of

their miners for the check off syatem does |
there may be ;

not mean necessarily that
no settlement in Clearfield, according to soft
coal operators who were seen yesterday.

If Mitchell decides to accept the terms
of the anthracite operators they say a
settlement will likely take place fn Cleav-
field, ax the suspension of work atill con-
tinues there and the supply of soft coal for
the New York markets, which has always
come from Clearfield, is coming from Weat
Virginia, where the operators have been
trying for some time to get_a foothold in
the New York market, . H, Wittenber

of the Acme Coal Company of Clearfield
said yesterday that the check off system
is the great stronghold of the union.

“We talk of drunkenness as a crime,” he continued, “but tea and coflee
drinking at meals is more injurious than liquor to some men.”

Tea and coffee drinking,

Yes, many of them know that with good health they can “do things” in this world, so when they find
stomach trouble, weak eyes, bad blood and muddy skin, or any of the many inciptent signs of disease set up by

Coffee they quit.

Because it furnishes
the Coffee flavor, charming color

HARD TO LEARN

Some Facts,

 

Many people joer at the idea that cof-
fee causes the aches and ails they suffer
from and ofien such people will go on
for years sticking steadfastly to the col-
fee and suffering month in and month
out but maintaining “Coffee don't hurt
me,"

Only an actual test will open their
eyes to what they throw away when they
oust aside the richness and power of
health for a cup of coffee now and then,
A lady saye:

“Tt did not learn the real truth until I
made the change, but | can now posi-
tively state that the headaches T had for
about seventeen years were caused by
drinking coffee, for when | changed and

place | experienced entire relief; T have
not been troubled with headache since |

“This tn brief has been my experience
on the coffee question, Among
friends I have seen many other wonder-
ful instances of the power of this food
drink when used in place of the drug
drink coffee. Among my friends there
are those who tell me of relief from
kidney trouble, neuralgia and eczema

*L readily believe these statements, for

again, Not only myself but my family
use Postum exolusively and we know
there is no hot beverage that can take its
