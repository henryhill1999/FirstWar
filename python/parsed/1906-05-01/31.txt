Special Exhibit of Paris Lingerie

Assembled for a Great May Sale

The present movement is the outgrowth of our semi-annual sales of white. For years we have
been working with the Paris manufacturers to get their cooperation along such lines as have made
our white sales of domestic garments so successful. ‘This year we have accomplished our desire.

We have secured the largest and finest collection of Paris Lingerie—Hand-made Undergarments,

Blouses, Negligees and Dressing Sacques that we have ever imported. We have undertaken the
responsibility of distribution solely because of the fact that we have secured the merchandise at a
quarter to a third below the regular cost.
»1 In addition to the saving in price, these garments are made up jn special manner with the full-
ness required by American women. The tight little garments, such as you would secure in Paris,
would need to be made over before you could wear them. These are finished just as you would like
them—in regular sizes, handsomely shaped, exquisitely made and beautifully adorned, Yet they
cost practically the same as domestic goods.

We have purchased quantities which we expect will last during the month of May, but, natur-
ally, there are many things that will be sold out during the first week, and these cannot be replaced.
In fact, it would be out of the question to purchase these garments today without paying a very
great increase in the prices for which they were secured several months ago, when we placed the
orders, Today the whole superb collection is ready and elaborately displayed on the Second floor
of the Stewart Building.

Some of the interesting details follow :

Nightgowns
Of fine percale or nainsook, in a multitude of charmin
models; high or low neck; long or short sleeves; trimm
with laces, embroidered, plaited, ribbon-decked; some
with the new rolling collars. Very simple to very elab-
orate. $2 to $18.

Today a Wonderful Collection
Of Womens SPRING WRAPS

At $14 Each; worth $18 to $35

Yesterday’s remarkable announcement about Women’s Spring Suits brought an enthusiastic |

audience almost as soon as the doors were opened. Today we present the second chapter of this

stirring story.

We purchased the entire surplus stock of high grade dresses and wraps from one of the best
concerns in the business. Practically all of the suits were sold yesterday. Today the coats and
wraps are ready, and there argseveral hundred handsome garments in the collection.

There are long tweed’ coats for-stteet, automobile or steamer wear, and there are almost unlim-

| ited varieties of taffeta and broadcloth boleros, Eton jackets, smart short coats and long taffeta
coats, trimmed with applique and embroidery. There is also a small but very choice collection of
finely tailored covert coats, dainty little short serge coats for golf and steamer wear. Also a small
group of finely tailored raincoats.

As the selling commences the variety of selectiun is probably the finest that has been presented
this season, as there are yery few duplicates, and the collection includes practically all the styles of
one of the vest manufacturers in the business.

The regular values of these Coats and Wraps range from $18 to $35; today all are marked at
$14 each.

One very important feature is that all of these garments are entirely new, many of them were
just in work when we made the purchase, and have been finished since. They are the newest and

best styles of the season. The'earlier you get here the better the garment you will secure.

Phonograph Language Method,
It's Easy—the Wanamaker Way

You get the proper German pronunciation; you learn the idioms and peculiar-
ities of German as you go along; no rules to memorize—you become familiar with
them and learn their application from examples as they occur. Result—in a com-
paratively short time you read, write and speak German like a native. The Ger-
man Embassy has endorsed this Phonograph method—the method which teaches
your ear, eye and mind all at once.

A knowledge of German will broaden your ideas, open up a wider sphere of
thought, increase your chances of success both in business and in a social way,
and give you access to the gems of German literature. French and Spanish just
as easily learned.

Cost, $80—that includes the phonograph, all accessories and text books.
Five dollars monthly if you wish.

We'll be glad to explain the system in detail to you and give you practical
demonstrations—if you'll drop in at the Language Phonograph Booth in the
Basement of the Stewart Building, Fourth avenue side. Or send us a postal card
and you'll receive booklet by return mail,
