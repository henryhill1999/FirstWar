Nevertheless" added the Recorder,

ecoentuating the unequivoeal responsibility
that now reate on the Distriet Attorney.”

The members of the Grand Jury did not
geem to know how to take the Recorder's
Mr Jerome would make no com-
ment on them

Some of the inaide history of what tran-
epired in the Grand Jury room in connec-
tion with the ineurance investigation came
cut as attached to the presentment was a
copy of the proceedings and a stenographic
repert of a speech made by Mr. Jerome.
In that speech reference was made to the
friction between Judge O'Sullivan, District
Attorney Jerome and the March Grand
Jury on the same question.

Mr. Jerome wanted to know if the Grand
Jury was willing to sit during the month

remarke,

ofMay. The answer was in the affirmative.
Then Mr. Jerome eaid that no evidence
about insurance matters had been pre-

sented to the March Grand Jury. He ex-
plained that the Grand Jury for March
imply submitted to Judge O'Sullivan some
hypothetical questions about the pa nt
of political contributions by corporations.
*The instructions of the Court were such,”
said Mr. Jerome. “that I am informed that
they could not comprehend them. They
were in substance that to steal is to steal, a
proposition tolerably elementary and one
on which I think no intellignt human being
cared to have any information or advice
from the Court. “The Grand Jury came
back in a very puzzled condition of mind.”
The second time the Grand ag A went
for advice, Mr. Jerome said, Ju ‘Sulli-
van spoke about “this case,” and when the
Grand Jury explained that they didn't
understand what case he meant “they
received more alo uence and no more
guidance than they did on the first occasion.”
Mr. Jerome said that an indictment was
a serious thi and then went over the
sroceedings in the case of George W.Perkins.
« seemed to think that there would be a
decision from the Appellate Divison on the
appeal from Justice Greenbaum's decision

holding Mr. Perkine for larceny on noxt
Friday. Mr. Jerome said that be had
talked with jud and lawyers on the

questions of whether the payment of politi-
cal contributions by officers of corporations
constituted larceny and they said {t was not
a clear or simple propsence of law. He
mentioned Benjamin F. Traore who repre-
sented no one connected with an insurance
company, who said that It did not constitute
larceny. Gov. Folk of Missouri and Gov.
Dineen of Lilinois would give no opinion on
the subject.

Mr. Jerome said that he canvassed the
March Grand Jury and was convinoed that
he couldn't get a vote to indict any one on
the evidence in regara to political con-
tributions, Judge O'Sullivan knew that
he said. Mr. Jerome couldn't understand
why so much haste was demanded. Mr.
Jerome added:

{ do underatand that there are strange
forces of character moving on the face of
the waters at timesdn this clty, and euch a
course as that -this eager, burning desire
to force matters Into the Grand Jury room
hefore an authoritative ruling of @ Court
is had to my mind Is, to say the least,
pecullar,

My personal opiniona or susploiona are not
to be laid before you, but you are free, white

and 21, and know something about this city.
You understand perfectly well that there
faa hitter oonfilct betwegg@e Morgan and
Harriman interests and you know that that
has been going on for sometime, You know
that the most prominent person tn oonnec-
tlon with this whole matter of politioal con-
tributions in the public eye is George W,
Jerkins, a partner of J, Plerpont Morgan;
but as a matter of fact It would involve the
chief financial ofleers practically of every
@reat financial institution in thia county,

We all know what waa done in 1896, In 1900
andin 1004, They gave, national banks gave,
Nome of the national banks actually entered
{it in full on thelr books of account what the
contribution was for,

Mr. Jerome was asked by Foreman Treacy
if it would be advisable to take up the {
@urance matters and Mr, Jerome sal
it would be inadvisable. Accepting Mr.
Jerome's advice the presentment aah

‘This decision of the Grand Jury was prompte

ed not because of any desire to avold per-
formance of their duty or to devoto all the
time that intght be necessary but because
euch an inquiry would in all probability re-
auire legal guidance and that for the Grand
dury to proceed against the advice of their
legal adviser might Involve their proceedings
{n mistake or miscarriage of Justice,

After listening to the presentment the
Recorder sald:

It appears from your report that the Dis-

trict Attorney nade a statement, You seem
fo have relied on that statement, It was
within your power to not rely on {it and to

have acted as your good Judgment would have
dictated, but having relied on it you may have
acted prudently

L will not now say that you did otherwise,
but it would not be the truth for me to say
that you performed your whole duty. Never
theless you have rendered a signal service in
accentuating the unequivocal responsibility
that now reats on the District Attorney. |

beset an investigation of this character by the
Grand Jury unless you were alded earnestly

by the cooperation of the District Attorney,

the evidence, to formulate it and to present
it to the Grand Jury.

Were it not that this special Grand Jury has
been suinmoned to meet but a week from toe

day, and that the District Attorney shall have
ever reasonable opportunity and undivided

Teaponsibility | would deem it my duty to con.

TO TEST PUBLICITY LAW.

Big Insurance Companies Getting Ready
to Fight It to the Last Ditch.

The indications are that
mutual life companies, the New York and
the Mutual, don’t intend tolet up on their
fight against making their liste of policy-
holders public, even though the Armatrong
committee bill, which provides for such
publicity, has been enacted into law. Some
of the important agents of the companies
are going to carry the new law into the
courts and teat its constitutionallty. It is
understood that they will have the sup-
port of the companies, if they are not, in
fact, representing the companies in the
matter.

It is said that they will ask within a few

 

 

days for an injunction against the provision |

of the law relating to the policyholder
jists. The law requires that at least two
copies of the list in each company shall be
filed with the State Superintendent of
Insurance not later than June 15, The
agente will contend that the law is per-
cious, that these lists, so far as they in-
clude the names of the policyholders in-
sured through their offices, represent prac-
tically an asset to them and that to throw
them open to the public would be tanta-
mount to robbing them of the results of
their labors. It would, in one sense, they
ore be depriving them of a property
it.

St is understood that the case will if neces-
sary be carried up to the highest court
in the State by the agente, Before the
Armstrong committee bills were passed the
Appellate Division handed down a decision
ACaeAs an action brought to compel
the New York Life to make public its list.
This provision for publicity of policy-
holders was fought harder than any other
by the Mutual and New York Life, New

ork Life officers worked openly in the |

lobby at Albany and succeeded in getting
an amendment through the Senate emas-
culating the bill, but such tremendous
reassure was brought to bear on the Senate
rom all quarters of the State that it re-
conside its vote and the bill was passed
with an unimportant amendment drawn
for the purpose of letting those who had
voted for the first amendment down easy.
The board of directors of the Equitable
wi!l hold ita regular meeting to-day. A
special committee appointed several weeks
ago to overhaul the soclety’s bylaws will
report, It is understood (hat one of the
recoinmendations which it will make will
be that the firat and the second vioe-
residenta shall inthe future be appointed
by the president instead of elected by
the board of directors. This will make
the two under officers directly responsible
to President Morton.

Gage E. Tarbell is second vice-president.
If this recommendation is adopted it will
mean that he will have to be good or he
won't be happy. It has been reported
several times that Mr. Tarbell was going
to get out of the Equitable, but this has
always been denied, The first vice-presi
dency hasn't been filled since Jamea Hazen
Hyde resigned.

20 EMBALMED BEFORE AUTOPSY

Coroner's Doctor Experiments on His Own
Hook on Corpses tn Hts Hands.

Coroner's Physician Edward T. Weston;
who is one of the medical witnesses for
Albert T. Patrick on Patrick's motion for
a new trial, isn't having a pleasant time
with District Attorney Jerome these days,
The examination of Dr. Weston was oon-
tinued yosterday before Recorder Goff.

Dr. Weaton has testified that he made
about twenty experiments on cadavers to
find out what effect embalming fluid had
on the lungs. He was questioned yesterday
about three of the experiments he made.
He said that he made the experimenta
at the Morgue and that they were made
on bodies in which the cases had been re-
ported to the Coroner's office. It was his
official duty as a Coroner's Physician to

investigate those casos.

In no instance could he remember the
name or cause of death. He said he had
made a report which was filed in the Coroe
ner's office. He had used the embalming
fluid before he had determined the cause
of death. He admitted that the fluid
would Geatroy yoxt-mortem evidences of
congestion of the lungs in many cases.
In each case, he said, he found congestion
ef the lungs and in at least one case there
was external evidence of it.

Dr, Weston said that the experiments
were made in September, 1004. Mr, Jerome,
who seamed surprised at the statements
of Dr. Weston, told Assistant District
Attorney Garvan to get from the Coroner's
office the records covered by the period in
whioh the experiments were made. Mr.
Garvan got them, Mr. Jerome asked Dr.
Weston to pick out the cases. There were
eighteen, and Dr, Weston picked out four
canes which he said he had handled, These
were all deaths from fractured ekulls in
which no autopsies were made, so they
evidently weren't the cases that Dr. Weston
had experimented in. Dr, Weston in-
sisted that he filed a report in every case,
and that the records should be in the Cor-
oner's office. Mr. Jerome said he would
make another investigation and all the
cases that Dr. Weston says he experimented
on will be looked up. It was brought out
that Dr. Weston had no authorization to
make the experiments.

“But why, as a publio official,” asked Mr.
Jerome, “destroy evidence of the cause of
death by using this embalming fluid?”

“Oh, [didn't destroy it,” said Dr. Weston,

The examination will be continued this
morning.

IMPORTED SHOPLIFTERS,

Police Theory of Two Women Caught With
Four Dozen Shirt Waist,

Charged with stealing four dozen shirt
waists and concealing them about their
clothing, Carrie Weiss and Victoria Rush-
vinsky were arraigned in Exsex Market
police court yesterday morning and held
for General Sessions. The Rushzinaky
woman is 27 years old and Carrie Weias 19.
Both live at 69 Green street, Greenpoint.
Neither has been in this country long.

Max Myer, who runs a department store
at 281 Grand street, testified that the two
women went. into his store on Saturday
afternoon and after idling before the hosiery
counter, at which they bought nothing,
went over to the shirt waist counter,
clerk at that counter was busy. In a few
minutes the women started for the door.
As they drew near it shirt waists began to
strew the floor, In all thirty-six shirt
waists, valued at from $4 to $5 each dropped
in their wake.

A couple of cash beya saw the waist
shower and called Mr. Myer. He grabbed
the women, and when an officer came com-
pelled them to Gisgorge fourteen more
of similar value, At t Eldridge street

of the women especially built for the buri-
ness. The police believe the women were
profesaional shoplifters in the old country
and came over here to find a better field.

BLACKWELL'S ISLAND A_ PARK,

Suggests the Grand Jury, and House of
Detention No Longer a Police Prison.

In a presentment made by the Grand
Jury yesterday it was recommended that
the House of Detention be taken out of
the control of the Police Department and
put under the jurisdiction of the Depart-
ment of Charities. A suggestion of Com-
missioner of Correction Lantry that Black-
well'’s Island be turned into a park was
favorably reported. The idea is to move
the prisons to islands further north.

The Grand Jury praised the manage-
ment of the boys’ reformatory on Hart's
Island, They learned that a large number
of the boys were cigarette smokers, y
found the Tombs clean and well handled.

Recorder Goff said that he thought It
would be a good idea to take the House
of Detention out of the hands of the police.
Witnesses detained there might be wit-
nesses against policemen, It will require
legislation to make the change.
