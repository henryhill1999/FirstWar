BRIDGE INJUNCTION AGAIN,

H. T. Chapman Prevents Awards for Man-
hattan Superstructure.

Injunctions were served yesterday on
Bridge Commissioner Stevenson and Cor-
poration Counsel Delany restraining them
from opening the bids recently advertised
for, for the building of the stee) super-
structure of the Manhattan bridge. The
injunction was issued by Justice Garrett-
son, sitting in Mineola, and was applied
for by Henry T. Chapman, a taxpayer.
For whom Mr, Chapman was acting did not
appear. The order is returnable next
Saturday. Another temporary injunction
which was served on Commissioner Steven-
son restrained him from awarding any
contract until bids for eye bar cables have
been invited. This order is returnable
on May 2.

As soon as the orders were served upon
Mr. Stevenson he went to Mineola, with
Assistant Corporation Counsel Burr, and
pointed out to Justice Garrettson that the

 

which Fate was

Bo ¢
chee sold there; but wonderfully sucocess- viet hey eee ee nn oo
ful he was in capturing the tender ones, | ¢> be ‘readvertised which would mean

and he certainly was a good guesser at the
aize limit,

But the “fritto-misto," while not the
piece de résistance, Was certainly the dish
of tho love and admiration of the epioure.
There is no English equivalent for Laz-
vari's fritto-misto; the translation of the
words means nothing, The preparation of
this dish in its various combinations made
the place worth a visit in itself. The ten-
Ger, young, green asparagus, fresh from
papa's brother's farm in Virginia and never
marketed; the carciofint, green peas, fresh
mushrooms, calves’ brains and veal cooked
60 Chat it was tender as sweetbreads, and
Aometimes the tenderest of green summer
kquash—these prepared as one table dish
hy Mama Lazzari made converts of the
Philistines,

Bul no man may tell of all the courses
of the Lazzari dinner without cruelty to
the hungry. Indeed, it was a sava, Soke
that was played sometimes to watch one's
atrangor guest feast on these earlier courses
and then struggle valiantly with each tooth-
fome succeeding one, torn between appe-
Ute and a retributive conscience,

The patronage of Lazzari's was varied.
Some venrs ago people used to go there
in carriages or on horseback, residents of
the island often riding over there for re-
freshinents. Small walking clubs, or a
few persons who enjoyed a walk, would
exercise pleasantly -apagierengehen (go
wolking for pleasure), as the Germans
have it-and with appetite so whetted
atop at the Garibaldi place for hincheon
or dinner, From the city the train was
the only way, and then the elusive restau.
rant, hidden behind a hill from the station;
was difficult to find, The trolley came
after a while, and eventually—irony of
fute-a new railroad station was made
200 feet from Lazvari's, not for the benefit
of the Garibaldi place, but for that of a
brewery restaurant, and yet Lazzari's ree
mained hidden; no sign directed the trav-
ellor to its delectable perch on the grassy
slope under the t.ees, Those only went
there who knew the place, Some of these
in the later days came in automobiles; but
although the patrons were many, Lazzari
hever cheapenec bis dinner, and to the
end it remained the best table d'héte about
New York

In fine weather, with the sun setting
behind the higher hills and Lazzari’s
lighted only by the indireet glow of the
Sunset hour, there was no pleasanter place
to have a table set than on the uncovered
veranda, forty feet broad, Bankers, lit-
erary men, journalists, artists, city hotel
owners and managers seeking something
different from their own Testaurante,
theatrical stars and managers, and hosts
of plain, ordinary citizens who knew and
valued the Italian cooking (supervised,
Birangely enough, by a German, for Sig-
nora Lazzari is a German), were to be
found on the piazza or in the dining room.
And lower down the hillside some Societe
Beneficcnea of one or all the saints might

another long delay. | Thereupon Justice
Garrettson amended his order so as to
permit Mr. Stevenson to receive the bids
and to hold them until permission to open
them is granted by the oourt.

This is the third time that the specifica-
tions for the construction of the bridge
have been advertised and the resultant
bida held up.

Vice-President Reynders of the Penn-
sylvania Steel Company said yesterday
that his company had not inspired the in-
junction issued by Justice Garrettson.

Hany T. Chapman is a member of the
Stock Exchange, living in Brooklyn.
