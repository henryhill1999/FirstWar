Special Exhibit of Paris Lingerie

Assembled for a Great May Sale

The present movement is the outgrowth of our semi-annual sales of white. For years we have
been working with the Paris manufacturers to get their cooperation along such lines as have made
our white sales of domestic garments so successful. This year we have accomplished our desire.

We have secured the largest and finest collection of Paris Lingerie—Hand-made Undergarments,
Blouses, Negligees and Dressing Sacques that we have ever imported. We have undertaken the

responsibility of distribution solely because of the fact that we have secured the merchandise at a

quarter to a third below the regular cost.
»y In addition to the saving in price, these garments are made up in special manner with the full-

ness required by American women. The tight little garments, such as you would secure in Paris, |

would need to be made over before you could wear them. These are finished just as you would like
them—in regular sizes, handsomely shaped, exquisitely made and beautifully adorned, Yet they
cost practically the same as domestic goods,

We have purchased quantities which we expect will last during the month of May, but, natur-
ally, there are many things that will be sold out during the first week, and these cannot be replaced.
In fact, it would be out of the question to purchase these garments today without paying a@ very
great increase in the prices for which they were secured several months ago, when we placed the
orders, Today the whole superb collection is ready and elaborately displayed on the Second floor
of the Stewart Building.

Some of the interesting details follow :

Nightgowns
Of fine percale or nainsook, in a multitude of charmin
models; high or low neck; long or short sleeves; trimm
with laces, embroidered, plaited, ribbon-decked; some |
with the new rolling collars, Very simple to very elab-
orate. $2 to $18.

Today a Wonderful Collection

Yesterday's remarkable announcement about Women’s Spring Suits brought an enthusiastic

concerns in the business. Practically all of the suits were sold yesterday. Today the coats and
wraps are ready, and there are several hundred handsome garments in the collection.

If I Could Only Speak German!

| That's an everyday remark—but with most persons the
thought dies with the wish. Why? Oh, too much trouble; takes
| up too much time; too difficult. Not at all—at least, not with the
Phonograph Language Method.

It’s Easy—the Wanamaker Way

You get the proper German pronunciation; you learn the idioms and peculiar-
