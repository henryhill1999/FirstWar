ADVERTISING FOR MUENTER,

Acewed Harvard Instructor's Sister Asks
3 Him te Reveal Himself,

Campnrbor, Mass, April 30.—Erich

Muenter, the Harvard instructor suspected
af baving poisoned his wife, has not been
Heard of by the Cambridge police.
~Muepter'’s sister to-night inserted adver-
tisements In the newspapers calling upon
her brother to reveal his whereabouts and
come to Cambridge and face his accusers.
She declares herself positive of his inno-
odnee, but offers no explanation of his hide
ing

Mrs. John F. Fales, a Christian Science
healer who attended Mrs, Muenter, is
quoted as saying Chat the patient remarked
to her: “[t seems to me as though my hus-
band was interfering with my plans for
recovery.”

“IT waa at the house for about two hours
the day before Mrs. Muenter died and talked
with her and saw her husband,” said Mrs.
Fales. “While | was there the patient
took some beef tea from Mm. Chane, It
re prepared from a jar kept in the house.
After Mrs, Muenter had drank some of the
tea and complained of the taste Mrs. Chase
aid, ‘I'm sorry, because I carefully skimmed
-offevervthing that looked like grease before

“bringing it in and think ji is all right.’

ot ®Mre. Muenter would not drink any more
of the tea, and this ended the incident,
wid not notice envthing at all out of the way

Good Estimates of the Salvage

A telegram received in this city yeater-
day from President William J. Dutton of
the Fireman's Fund Insurance Company,
which was one of the hardest hit of the
California companies by the San Francikoo
conflagration, said that while the losses
of the company aggregate about $4,000,000,
the directors have decided to make good
and have the company continue in business,

‘The total loss mentioned includes the
losses which the company sustained through
its subsidia concerns, of which there
were several. The original estimate of
the Fireman'a Fund Joss wae $6,000,000.

stroyed in San Francisco and that the line
carried by the company averaged loss

Franciaco, and although Gen, Greely hinted |

in a despatch to-day that it was up to the
army to save ite reputation In this great
crisia officials think that henceforth there
will only be harmony and good work. Gen,
Greely’s reference to the army's reputation
and the great crisis was at the tail end of
one of his despatches, when he said: “In
my opinion earliest possible arrival of
forty-five officers will save both money and
reptitation at this great crisis.”

Gen. Greely's despatches on this subject
are as follows:

Since midnight Whole question has been
moat carefully and exhaustively considered,
and from standpoints ot economy, efficiency
and military precision, In order to reduce
expenses, request that troops sent here be
reduced to one regiment cavalry and one of
infantry, aggregating 1,000 men, Services of
1,500 other troopa can be dispensed with
provided that forty-five selected oMcers and
men of administrative ability, sound judg-
ment and physical energy are sent here as
framework of relief organization They
should consist of five fleld officers and forty
Men without
force, experience or tact would be worse
than useless, Present situation and reasons
for thia modification follow fully in another
telegram

(GPEELY, Major-General Commanding,

A later despatch from Gen. Greely thro wa
more light on the situation:

Previous telegrams from myself and Dr.
Devine, special representative Red Crosa,
indicate clearly necessities for my command
exercising non-military duties connected with
the distribution of relief supplies, whether
purchased by army or presented by the
American people. There exists to-day in
San Francisco no efficient force for such
work other than the regular troops The
National Guard, with its excellent military
organization, good will and unquestioned
energy, containg mawy members harassed
by domestic afflictions, business lossea and
deprivation of means of livelihood and isa
not in sufficient force

The municipal police and flra department
are not only engrossed in their own apecial
duties, largely inereased in amount and re-
aponsibility by existing conditions, butmany
are Without clothing and shelter and neces-
sarily devote part of their energies to caring
for wives and children. ‘The devoted volun-
teara from civil life whose heroic efforts,
business abilities and independeut energy
have, with their organization and labors,
tided the destitute hundreda of thousands
over starvation and disease must henceforth
vive their entire efforts to rebuilding the elty
and reorganizing business and industries

The existing methods, devoid of super-
vision, which has been impossible in the
past, Involve enormous expenses, W hich cause
marked apprehension as to financial phases
on the part of Dr. Devine, Mayor Schmits
and the citizens’ committee, From the
firat my foars have been for the future con-
dition, realizing fully the necessity of re-
strictions, supervision and elimination, The
checking of wasteful methods, of constant
spoliation, of systematic deceptions and ex-
travagant methods can and will be possible
only through military administration strictly
subordinate at all times to civil authority

and the Red Cross representative, upon whom |

demands hae been made by me to assume
charge af the earliest possible moment,
demanda vehich they have promised in writing
to accede to at the earliest possible dat.

which the Red Croas, civil authorities and

crisis CGR ERLY,
Major-General Commanding.

Gen, Greely again to-day explained the
status of the Federal troops which are
being used in San Francisco, This was in
a despatch to Secretary of War Taft, now
at Atlantic City, who forwarded it to Presi-
dent Raosevelf. It was made public at the
War Department as follows:

Your telegram just received. ‘Iwenty-five
hundred troops present are engaged in pro-
tecting Federal buildings and guarding most
important places in burned district. They

GIFT EXPLAINED,

 

Despatoh to Gen. Greely Shows Status of
82,800,000 Appropriation.

Wasninaton, April 30.—The following
despatch has been sent to Gen. Greely
explaining the status of the approprtation
of $2,500,000 made by Congress for ex-
penditure by the War Department.

“With reference to your message of this
date, Congress has appropriated §2,500,000

masters’ and medical supplies, in addition
to such supplies belonging to military
establishment as may be available, and
to issue same to auch destitute persons

circumstances as the result of the earth-
quake and attending conflagration.

“In executing these resolutions Secretary
of War is directed to cooperate with author-
itles of State of California and Mayors of
cities of San Francisco, Berkeley and Oak-
land, Alameda and such ot her cities on
| Pacific Coast as may have sustained dam-
ager, Resolutions authorize Treasury, Navy
and Commerce and Labor departments to
cooperate with Secretary of War in ex-
tending relief and assistanoe,

“Rosolutions further authorize use of
appropriation for purpose of replacing by
purchase of such subsistence, quarter-
masters’ and medical supplies aa may have
| been furnished by Secretary of War from
i‘ wtores on band for use of army in giving
‘such relief, also for purpose of defrayin
all extra cost to War Department incurre:
in mileage, rananortaden of troops and
all other expenditures which would not
have been necessary but for relief measures

“In pursuance of these resolutions eatage
and blanketa have been furnished by the
quartermaster’s department from all over
the country and 900,000 rations have been
purchased in Seattle, Portland and Los

General. Medical supplies have been
shipped from St. Louis,

“All supplies wera sent by express and

No anewer to the telegram of inquiry

sent to Secretary Taft has been received.
Nevertheless, Mr. Phelan in making his |

In

ported a total of $6,152,400 on hand
detailing the accounts he said

_ “Before my last report the funda voted,
in hand or promised, amounted to $6,000,000

Since my last report there haa come into
my hands $39,962. I have promises of con-
tributions amounting to $530,000

“To-day Gen. Funston sent me $25,000,
the remainder of the Guggenheim fund sent
to him. He found himself embarrassed
with the multiplicity of his duties, and with
the consent of the donors he turned the
rest over to me aa chairman of the finance
committee.”

aatet Schmitz called attention to the
fact that the stream of relief supplies seems
to be failin,

at heatn,” he said, “that at present only
a few over a hundred cars containing relief
supplies are on the way. This is a serious
state of affairs. San Francisco can still
use anything in the way of provisions,
clothes and money."

Money should be sent to James D. Phelan,

supplies to Major C. 1, Devol,Q.M., U.S. A.,
Presidio Wharf, San Francisco.

When Chairman Mulally of the Trans-
portation Committee rose to report Mayor
Schmitz Pointed to a leather sack by his
side, announcing that it contained $18,000,
the contribution of the United Railways
Company to the finance committee. It
was the sum of all fares taken in on all
lines running yesterday. The lines along
Eddy und Ellis streeta will be running in
a few days, followed by an extension of the

resent Market street trolley line down
valencia street.

W. H. Metson pointed out that the in-
rush of olrlous people who wanted to see
the ruined city was crowding the care to
the exclusion of people who had business.

Abe Ruef moved that the lines be asked
to collect farea from every one riding.
Heretofore women and children haveffbeen
allowed to ride free. This is one of the;times
when a city has asked a street car line for
higher rates.

hile they were on the street car subject
President Calhoun of the United Railways
Company said that his lines would keep
ace «ch the growth of the city and that
the material he had ordered from the East
wag already on the way.

Upon the motion of Judge Hunt a new
committee was appointed to look after the
needs of the private hoapitala, which are in
sore need of medical aurelies.

There were two amall quakes, lasting a
few seconds, in the early hours of this morn-
ing. They did no damage and are only a
part of the gradually subsiding disturbance
which follows a big earthquake,

The Southern Pacific Railway has ob-
tained ita temporary franchise to run tracks
into the city for the disposal of débris.
Surveyors are already laying out the routes,
and gangs of men will go at the preliminary
work in the morning.

The water supply is still low and there
is mild danger EF another famine, In the
last two or three days the use of water for
all purposes haa been permitted, Now the
authorities think of shutting down on
everything but domestic use, and the city
must go Sirty ugain or bathe and was

The dent in the bay west of Fort Mason

 

has been known from the earliest times
as Washerwomen's Cove. It has come
back now to ita original uses. Yesterday

and beating the dirt out of them on boards
as the Indians used to do,

As fast as the relief trains arrive the
are run out on the Long Wharf at'‘Oakland,
and unloaded into the transport Sherman,
which is a kind of warehouse for provis-
ions. Yaart Saturday twenty cars of flour
were stored in her hold. By the end of the
week her hold will be full. Some trans-

cifle vessela are expected this week
Yockage facilities at| Oakland for deep
draught vessels are limited, but arrange-
ments have been made to get these vessels
into dock long enough to unload and for-
ward cargoes consigned to the East.

The railroads have not counted up the
number of passengers shipped to points
in the East, but the estimate runs from
80,000 to 90,000. The Southern Paoific has
issued $0,000 free passes, and the Santa Fe
10,000. It ia estimated that these repre-
sent an average of $10 each, so that the
railroads have given about $400,000. Free
transportation has stopped now, but de-
serving people recommended by the gen-
eral committee get a one cent rate. In no
case ia this rate given to able bodied men.
San Francisco neede all such.

RED CROSS SENDS $300,000,
Has Over #1 ,000,000 In Ite Treasury Sub-
ect to Call.

Wasainoton, April 30.—The Red Cross
headquarters fto-day made the following |

statement:

“Judge Morrow, president of the Cali-
fornia Red Cross, has telegraphed to the
secretary of the Red Cross, Washington,
that provisions and supplies received and
en route to San Francisco would meet pres-
ent needs, and that Red Cross contributions
should now consist of money. Action upon
this SuggesHion the secretary immediately
telegraphed to the United States Mint, San
Francisco, to the credit of James D. Phelan,
chairman of the Red Cross finance com-
mittee, $300,000.

“The finance committee was also informed
that the Red Cross had in ite treasury over
$1,000,000 subject to the wishes of the com-
mittee. The $300,000 sent to-day makes in all
$400,000 forwarded by the Red Cross for the
relief of the people of San Francisco. It
may be well to state'here that all relief com-
mittees in San Francisco are now operating
under the American National Red Cross,
and the finance committee of which James
D. Phelan is chairman is now the Red Cross
finance committee,”

WALL STREET FIGURES ON LOAN.

Rumors of a Syndicate to Take #200,-
zw 000,000 of San Franelsco Bonds.

There was current in Wall street yester-
day a report that a syndicate of New York
bankers was preparing to underwrite the
$200,000,000 bond issue proposed for San
Francisco, provided the national Govern-
ment guaranteed the interest on such
bonds.

Represent atives of the bankers, it was
said, were in conference with Secretary
Shaw in Washington and lawyers were
discussing whether or not a Government
guarantee of city bonda by act of Congress
would be oonatitutional,

Pel reehae ee of several of the lar
banking houses said that such a plan might
be feasible, but that they doubted if New
York bankers had begun to take it under
serious consideration,

Secretary Shaw could not be found in
Washington last night, but his private seo-
retary said positively that neither New
York bankera nor any one else had talked
with Mr. Shaw about underwriting the San
Francisco loan,
