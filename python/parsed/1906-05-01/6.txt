this experiment from the right een
to understand that we are not in the Philip-
ines for the purpose of making trade,
ut that we are there to discharge the high-
est duty that one nation can toward an- |

other people

“Tt is very probable that the trade be- |
tween the Philippines and the United States |
will increase to such proportions a& to make |
that particular trade useful to both coun- |

tries. But we cannot base our conduct
or action on such a motive. What we |
do in the Philippines must rest on our |

national duty, a duitv which is the greater |
because of our prosperity and ability to
sharge it. |

"This policy has hean sustained in two |
natioral elections and the question then |
arises, What are the duties of the other citi-
zens of the United States who have here-
tofore held aloof from such a policy and
denounced it? Ought they not now to hold
up the hands of the Government and to
assist in every way the experiment which
against their will and their express vote
the Government entered upon? Why should
the anti-imperialists, so called, attempt to
make wha: we do in the Philippines now a
failure? Is it not a small policy and an
unpatriotic one? In the beginning the at-
titude of the anti-imperialisis and their
extreme statements and their apparent re-
joicing at American defeats undoubtedly
continued the war of the insurrection a
nu:aber of months and probably a year
beyond what it would have been had the
insurgents thought there was the whole
Reonle behind the Government. Congress

as been generally wise to put the power
for the government of the Philippines
where it ought to bein Manila.”

Mr. Taft deciared that the present con-
dition of the islands is remarkable, con-
sidering (he many obstructions in building
up the Philippine Government, the dread-
ful agricultural depression there and the
consequent financial depression. He said
that there had not been a period of pros- |

erity since Uncle Sam has been in the |
islands, Then he added |

‘One must feed a son's belly before he
develops his mind or gives him Politica!
npnis The pendulum must swing in favor
of the islands and prosperity must come,
It will be greatly aiaed if free trade he-
tween the United States and the islands
should be established,”

This sentence was wildly applauded, the
only interruption during the address.

Whether this will happen in the present
Congress I do not know. That it will come |
ultimately I am confident. That it ought |

come the people of the islands will realize
how much America has done for them.
Until that time we must expect to be blamed |
for everything in the shane of ill that comes |
the islands and we muet expect to encounter
complaints and criticism from the Filipinos.
But their attitude ought not in the slightest
degree to affect ours or to take from us the
sense of obligation that we should put them
on their feet,”

Mr. Taft held that the educated class in
he Philippines was not now capable of
overning the islands, because there was
uch dissension and there would be war-
pre among the various factions before the
merican soldiers could get away if they
ere ordered withdrawn. The ideas of
tee the educated classes on Governmental

“THE DISTRICT LEADER.”

Scene Painter Makes a Hit With the Lobby
of the “Kauffman House."

Joseph E. Howard's new musical comedy
“The District Leader,” produced last night
at Wallack’s, was a triumph of the scene
painter who depicted a part of the lobby
of a hotel, undisguised under the name of
the Kauffman House, with a faithfulness
that brought forth much applause, espe-
cially from those who had never been there
but wanted to make out they had. A
section of Chinatown, a bit idealized and
decidedly cleaner than the original, and a
part of Union Square, mellow with the
tints of autumn, also were heartily com-
mended. The singing, for the most part,
was, unlike the scenery, colorless, One
melody, “What's the | 'se of Dreaming?”
a dope song, has an element of catchiness
that may make it popular for a time, but
the other numbers are merely suggestive
of muse that has been heard before.

“The District Leader” conflicts with
well regulated musical comedy traditions
by having a plot, which might have been
constructed by the stage carpenter, 80
beautifully and mechanically does every
tenon fit into every mortise. Tim Halloran
(Ha Stone) is the Democratic candi-
date for Senator. His oempet n is man-
Sand by Sam Grady (Mar art), who
sells him to Dan Lowton (Joseph Allen)
the Republican candidate. Tim is engaged
to Lowton's daughter, Grace.

Tom Lowton, son of the Republican can-
didate, turns up in New York after a long
time in the West, and as Tom Cole, gets a
job on the Comet as a reporter. With the
help of the clerk of the Kauffman House
he finds that Grady is playing double with
Halloran. Halloran has atwin brother, Jim,
a dope fiend, who is living with Hop Lee
in Chinatown. Valeska Granger, who mar-
ried Jim two years before, is persusced b
Grady to declare that Tim is her husband.
She believea he is. The scheme of Grady
was to have the papers publish on the
morning of election an account of Tim'a
perfidy, and ruin his chances. While Grady
and the others are visiting Chinatown there
is a raid and the existence of the twin
brother is revealed to Valeaka Granger.
Tom Cole assumes many disguises, inter-
cepts messiges and otherwise helps to
down Grady.

One of the most effective parts of the
piece was the finish of the first act, when a
troop of real scrubwomen came on to clean
up the lobby of the hotel. Mark Sullivan
as The Man Who Wants to Bet, and Ezra
Whittel, editor of the Ladiea' Knitting Needle,
wander through the acts very much as the
Lone Kisherman does in “Evangeline"—for
no reason whatever, except, perhaps, to

et off jesta that have been appearing in
the comic papers for the last ten years.
Mr. Howard, the author of the play, took
a minor part and sang clearly a song called
“The Big Banshee.” The chorus was large
and finely costumed. Harry Stone's asump-
tionof the dua] part of Tim and Jim Halloran
met with enthusiastic approval.

 

 

 

 

W. J. Kelly tn Old Favorites.

The William J. Kelly Stock Company
began an indefinite run last night at the
Harlem Opera House, playing “The Mas-
queraders,” by Henry Arthur Jones. The
Kelly company Pirpoess to give a line of
old favorites and stay as long as they are
popular. There was a big crowd at the
theatre last night, the boxes being filled
with women who carried lavender burgees,
embroidered with “William J. Kelly R. C.”

The initials were explained to mean
the “Romeo Club,” an organization founded |
after seeing Kelly play Romeo. Miss |
Dorothy Donnelly was the leading woman
in the play.

then delayed until the American Connoia-
seur apparently is now a thing for gotten,
one wonders exactiv what has become of it.”

Mr. Konti's certificates are very pretty
pieces of paper. “The American Connoie-
seur Company,” according to them, was
incorporated at Albany in 1902, with a
capital stock of $50,000; shares, $10 each.
Mr. Konti's shares bear June 25, 193, as the
date of issue and the signature of Charles
de Kay as president of the company. S. R.
Bonnell is down as secretary. Mr. Konti
said that Mr. de Kay said last night that he
was not the president of “The American
Connoisseur Company” and never had
been to hie knowledge. Just now V. Lucien
Sawyer of 353 Fifth avenue, a former life
insurance agent, was Piece, general
manager and director of the company, and
Mr. de Kay was treasurer. He had never
had any of the funds in his hands.

“My connection with the American
Connoisseur has been rather vague,” he
said. “In 1902 I made an effort to start
an art magazine which should be to Ameri-
can art what such a magazine as the Studio
isto English art. The need of such a maga-
zine was more apparent than the capital

that since they had interested a good deal

They begged that [ allow the use of my
name as editor in chief and they would
get the funds to start the magazine. I
said, ‘I can't do anything until you furnish
the funds,’ We finally got together on that
proposition. They were to furnish the
capital and [ nerred to turn out a national
art magazine that would pay, the best in
the country. It was to be beautifully

rinted, with colored illustrations and was |

to sell at $15 a year in monthly numbers.

“Now, the people who went out to get
the capital to start the thing may have
used my name as president in the beginning.
f so, it was done without authority, and
this is the first [ know about it. R. W.
Vonnoh was president of the company
at the firat, I think, and put considerable
money into it. This Mr. Sawyer was then
the leading spirit, however, along with a
man named S. R. Bonnell.

“I am sorry to hear that Mr. Konti lost
any money in the prolect: I do not know
how much was collected, perhaps several
thousands. I knew nothing about any col-
lections having been made from artists or
I should have stopped it. That isn’t right.
I myself tried to interest several men of
affairs in the journal, some successfully.
They are the ones whoshould have been
approached, and if any considerable mone
was collected, it came from them. I don't
suppose anything wrong has been done.
I dare say the money has been consumed
in the usual expenses of management.
Mr. William Sartain, the artist, who is now

down as secretary of the company, and
myself have tried to see Mr. Sawyer re-

atedly of late and ask for some informa-
ion on the status of the enterpria®, but we
have never been able to find him. [haven't

heard from him in months, and so far as I
have heard the journal is still going to be
put out if the funds can be raised.”

Myr. Vonnoh declined to say what his
connection with the magazine had been,
For information on the money raised he re-
ferred the SuN eporter to Mr. de Kay.

“I gevered my connection with the man-
agement some time ago,” he said, “The
thing has simply been a fizzle. We just put
in our money and took our chance that the
thing might go. We lost the money, and
there's no use squealing about it. 1 sup-

ose what was raised has been eaten up

y the expense of management.”

V. Lucien Sawyer has an office in the
Billings Court Building at Fifth avenue
and Thirty-fourth street, as the “American
Connoisseur Company.” The Copartner-
ship Directory says of the company: “In-
formation unattainable,” which tallies with
the experience of the treasurer.

trict, atarted to move yesterday. The job
wasn't finished last night, but will be com-
pleted to-day. The club leaves the second
floor on the northeast corner of Twenty-
eighth street and Eighth avenue and goes
across to the northwest corner and over
the Pump saloon, where the club had its

inception.

Big Bill was on hand early yesterday
afternoon and aided in the moving. He
was hailed as he was pure across the
avenue with a chair pressed in his arms:

“Where ye going?” asked the passer by.

“Where'd ye think I was goin'?” said Bill
as he put the chair down in the middle af
the thoroughfare, and began to mop his

continued, “but you're dead wrong.

Just then a southbound trolley car came
along and Mr. Devery two-stepped with his
chair to the sidewalk.

“Yes, sir,” said Bill, putting the chair
down again, “there is one thing I can't
away from and that is my high regard for
women. I tell you if I was bossin’ the job
in Mulberry street these days there would
be somethin’ doin’. But I don't seem to
out much ice these days. When I advocate
anything eversneay gets his coppers out
and plays my tip to lose.”

Devery said that his association for the
improvement of politics in general was far
from being extinct, and that they were sim-
ply taking advantage of the balmy season
to get away from uncongenial surroundings
to quarters that were otherwise.

 

RCRITICS OF THE STREETS.

 

Municipal Art Society Discusses Pavements
and Garbage Cans.

Borough President Ahearn and the De-
partment of Highways came in for criticism
last night at the annual meeting of the
Municipal Art Society, held at the National
Arts Club, in West Thirty-fourth street.
There were twenty-five persons present.
The society's committee on Soot ares
reported through its chairman, William 8.
Crandall, that the borough officials do
not see to it that repairs of asphalt pave-
ments are properly made. The committee
says it has failed to find any reasonable
explanation why the cost for repairs should
be so much greater in New York city than
in Washington, Rochester and other cities,
or why t at officials should aocept
inferior materials, especially for asphalt
repairs. Material which has been rejected
for years by the asphalt experts of Wash-
ington is cheerfully accepted here, the
committee says. -

Dr. J. C. Bayles said that the system of
deodorization and eterilization employed fn
the Street Cleaning Department is the worst
that could be imagined. He urged the
society to lift up ite voice in an effort to
suppress the warpage can as it is at present
—sterilized or not. The Street aning
Department, said Dr. Bayles, maker its
attempts to deodorize only at the dumps
after the garbage has been carted through
the city.

George P. Post was elected to represent
the architects on the board of directors of
the society, William Walton the painters
and H. A. MacNeil the sculptors.
