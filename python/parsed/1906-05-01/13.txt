TO THE INVESTORS OF THE WORLD: ;

THAT PANIC

That panic—You read my ‘panic coming’’ in yesterday’s papers, It
was printed throughout the world, The ‘‘System’’ read it; the steel pool
read it and—they acted.

You rcad in their action, ‘‘at any cost we must turn the market up-
ward. We must make steel preferred advance a dollar or two, at least
long enough to discredit his prediction, for if the world sees that his pre-
diction is verified, it may follow his second one to-morrow, which will
bring a still bigger slump, and his third one day after to-morrow will bring
chaos. At any cost we must turn the market upward.’’

Since December, 1904, and April, 1905, when, because of their newness
my predictions caught the ‘‘System’’ off its guard and shook the financial
world to its foundation, five times I have publicly predicted and the ‘‘System’’
has met each prediction as it did to-day.

Yesterday when my half page advertisement was filed with the Cable
Company for Europe, I put in the hands of two representative bankers my
written prediction that throughout to-day the market would be an advancing one.

I now ask the financial world and the American people if they require
any further demonstration of the abject weakness of that mighty ‘‘System’’
which before it was caught red-handed in its insurance robberies and a score
of other plunderings was all powerful.

I have but to issue a public statement of its deviltries, and at any cost—
at the risk of losing hundreds of millions—it will compel the market to give
my assertions ‘‘the lie.’’

STEEL PREFERRED

Steel preferred---The steel poo! with its hundreds of millions of stock
carried at the people’s savings institutions upon margin and in loans jumped
to its guns yesterday morning and the stock advanced $2 per share.

The blatant swindlers who 'Friday and Saturday were asking each other :
between gasps, ‘‘What are our chances of remaining outside prison walls if this
slump continues ?’’ were again brought shoulder to shoulder and compelled
to trust each other, at least until they can beat an orderly retreat.

But I trust no even-keeled person will mistake to-day’s action of steel
preferred.

Arrangements are about completed to lay before the world the astound-
ing ‘Crime of the Steel Trust,’’ a story to which ‘‘The Crime of Amalga -
mated’’ will be as pocket handkerchief swiping to safe-blowing--a crime
whereby $250,000,000 of real property was turned into a $1,500,000,000
license to rob the American people annually of $140,000,000. '

Simultaneously with its publication, organized effort will be made to

=.

—

open the eyes of the American people to the enormity of a national law }' P
which compels them, each year, to buy an existence necessity from a few -
tricksters at a profit of $140,000,000 upon an original investment of ’
$250,000,000. a
When the eyes of the American people are opened, this law will be J
changed as quickly as were the much better protected life insurance grafting eB.
laws. im
Eye-opening time for the American people will be not later than the coming fall, hs
When it comes, chaos for steel preferred. ri
A short time back it sold below $50 and at its directors’ meeting ‘Standard Oil’’ Rogers, but for an une Pat
expected happening, would have cut its dividend, ‘ a

‘The ordinary investor in steel preferred cannot kaow at this time what the American people will do next

On Friday and Saturday no power in Wall Street could stay the awful fall, bat he eae knew: i

aughter, but yesterday ] had only to publish taFeugHOU the world my warn and then dropped it to under $50 and repurchased it, have it now and, by hook or crook, are going to again un- 4
ing and presto, every man jack, of the ‘‘System’’ pirates was lined up to load it onto the people, and before next fall; that these tricksters’ make-up is such that they will take no ;
chances over the fall elections; | Be

repel boarders. That with every sail full and drawing, with the entire steel trust plant working to its fullest capacity, \ ba

Ti m is making monkeys of the American ] with n0 San Francisco calamity, with no fall election upon them, with a booming market, with the ‘‘ System’’ ‘

" ® ery game, this 8 e y _ ooh peop and shoulder to shoulder and not yet ‘‘ruoning’’ upon each other, the best that the steel pool could do was \ 7

European investors and speculators, but it must go on to a finish, the ‘‘Systems’’ to carry prices to about their present level without inducing the public to take the stock off their hands ; ‘i
finish That under these circumstances any holder who sells at above par cannot lose, and when the crash comes tpt
1SD. will be in position to buy four shares for the same money he now receives for one. te fe

. x & g . e . i k

P. S. Widows, orphans and idiots whose funds are invested in steel preferred should keep this constantly in front of them. Rogers and the Rockefellers have given away dur- :
ing the past three years over ten millions: Carnegie is working overtime inducing beggar American town and city officials to accept gift libraries and Morgan is losing sleep hunting =

Europe for million dollar China dogs and ten million dollar cat’s-teeth collections, and that every dollar each of the three is investing in these noisy pursuits comes from the people who k
buy their steel preferred at over $100 and hand it back on the below $50 shakedowns,
