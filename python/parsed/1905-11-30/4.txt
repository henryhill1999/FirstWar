A Bovival Effected Probably in Honor of
Mr. Caruso—A Large Audience and
an Abundance of Applause for the
Old Melodies—Miss Walker as Leonora,

Donizetti's “La Favorita” was performed
at the Metropolitan Opera House last night.
This {s the record of a more or loss #.g-
nificant fact. This tuneful creation of the
facile tune maker of Italy has not been per-
nictously active in recent years, and there-
fore its revival must be accorded due re-
spect. It was last heard at the Metropolitan
on January 7, 1809, when Mme, Mantelli
was the Leonora, Salignao sang Fernando
and Henri Albers was the King. The con-
duotor was Bevignani, who has since gone
over to the majority.

In the previous year the opera was sung |
at Wallack's Theatre by the Royal Italian
Opera Company, with Adelina Fanton as |
Leonora, Bogue as the King and Agostini
as Fernando. This was a solemn and
affecting occasion, The best performances
of recent years here were those of 1895
and 1806, when the opera was given with |
Mantelli, Cremonini, Ancona and Plangon
in the principal roles, It is worthy of note
that in 1805 “Tristan und Isolde” was sung
for the first time by Nordica and the De
Reszkea on November 27, and on November
20 “La Favorita” was brought forward,

Now that we no longer have an Italian
contralto with all the useful traditions
of her school, there may be some ground
for wonder at the revival of this ancient
morsel; but let us not forget that there
ic a strong tenor réle in the work and that
something must be found from time to
time to cast a glamour of novelty around
the liquid cantilena and pealing high tones
of Enrico Caruso ;

So faras the Italian old guard is concemed
it seams well worth the price of admission
to hear hitn sing only “Spirito gentil,” which
was written for an earlier and unperformed
work called “The Duke of Alba.” Thus
we see that in all ages operatic dukes have

£ 00K unes to sin
Ae ES ranioe “La Euvorita; which was |
written for Paria and produced there in |
1840, is one of the most painstaking scores |
of its composer. True, he was trying only |
to please the taste of the French capital |
and not writing according to hisown fancy,

 

as he did in delicious “Don Pasquale” and

lovely “La Fille du Regiment,” but he was

bent on turning out something of sounder

merit than “Lucia” and that class, Con- |
sequently there are some fairly dramatic |
points in “La Favorita The libretto |
tells a beastly story, and all the sympathy
of one interested in the filthy drama must
go to the tenor. The contralto's role is
not acaptivating one, in spite of her lyric
treasure in the shape of “O mio Fernando,”

There was no room for doubt last night
that the audience, which quite filled the |
house, had assembled for the laudable
purpose of listening to Mr. Caruso. Now,
this is at all times an interesting occupa-
tion, but unless one has made up his mind
in advance that the king can do no wrong |
there are moments when doubt will ob- |
trude itself

It does not make the slightest difference
how many people shout “Bravo!” or how
many bruise the palms of their hands, the
white voice is not a grace of song when it Is
overused, nor is a throaty “quality of tone
at any time desirable. Mr. Caruso is guilty
of much whiteness and occasional throati-
ness. On the other hand, the beauties of
his stvle are so many and the glory of his
voice is so dazzling that his oTences are
condoned by an adoring public, and de-

lored by a few lonely erities, who love

Hi for his virtues and not for his faults

Edyth Walker appeared as Leonora, and
again caused wonder at her extraordinary
notions of costume and decoration. That
wonderful red jewel which flashed in the
middle of her forehead in the firat scene,
like a third eve, was enough to startle every
spectator, but when the prima donna pro-
ceeded to sing many tones sharper than a
rerpent's tooth the auditory nerves joined
those of sight in general vibrato. In spite
of all, however, her performance had much |
to commend it.

Mr Scotti was excellent as the King and
looked like an old print, while in Ba’daasare
Mr. Plarceon found ampis scope for his
pontifical demeanor and his orotund de-
livery, It is hardly needful to add that the
hallet aimlessly capered in remote back-

rounds, while the orchestra tinkled or |

NEW sHow.
ee Again as @ Star in a Musioal Comedy,
“The Press Agent," |

“The Press Agont,” written by Mark
E, Swan and John P, Wilson, and with Peter
F, Dailey in the leading part as Benton
Scoops, @ press agent who afterward be-
comes & war correspondent, was produced
last night at Lew Fields's Theatre. The
show reminded one af Kipling’s “The
Ship that Found Herself,” for the company
was in the same process. The chorus,
while it was not bulky, seemed to find
the stage too tight a fit at tinies, With a
little vigorous sandpapering {t will be an
entertaining comedy,

Silas Fosdick, an American capitalist, is
trying to get possession of some nitrate
beds in Conoarne which belong to Dolores
Yenaga. He has fitted up an expedition
for the purpose under the leadership of
Capt, Gattling, skippsr of La Libertad.
The departure is delayed for the arrival
of Fighting Bill, from Texas.

This gives Scoopa time to discover the
object of the expedition. Joseph Ruther-
ford, Fosdick's business rival, offers Scoopa
a place as war correspondent on the paper
of which he is half owner. Scoops has
difficulty in getting on board the ship,
but finally succeeds as Fighting Bill after
getting the owner of that name drunte,

The second act is in Concarne, Scoops
forms a union among the soldiers, telling
them they must all lay off work at 4 o'clock.
After a few revolutions, aptee hd bloodless,
Gen. Gonsalea finds himself president.
Fosdick secures the grants to the nitrate
beds and Scoops finds himeelf arrested for
treason,

As he is led out to be shot, the soldiers,
all of whom belong to the union, throw
down their guns, for the clock strikes 4.
He starts a counter revolution and restores
the nitrate beds to Dolores. Then eyery-
sag ends happily,

“Moonlight,” sung by Dolores, was about
the best of the songs. “Nightmare Land,”
sung by Bunny Hare and Bouncing Betty,
was cleter and original and Scoops's render-
ing of “The Simple Life” was very taking.

he Pay was filled with hits on every-
body of prominence in the city or country.
Brilliant costumes and unusua stage effects
abounded. Scoopa’s Spanish lesson from
Dolores was laughable. When she men-
tioned siesta he said “I don’t know what
it is, but I'll have one with you. Waiter,
two siestaa!”

Frank Lalor Binyed Bunny Hare, the
amateur hero. Silas Fosdick was by W. F.
Rochester while Gen. Gonzales was Theo-
dore Friebus, Kate Condon had the part
of Dolores and Carrie Graham was Bouncing
Betty, the ship's mascot.

EPILEPSY

 

 

ON FILMS.

 

Doctors See Seizures Realistically Produced
for Purposes of Study.

The first moving pictures of epileptio

seizures ever produced were shutthed off

| before the fifth annual meeting of the Na-

tional Association for the Study of Epilepsy
at the Academy of Medicine in West Forty-~-
third street last night. About 37,000 ac-
curate pictures, showing the development
of numerous seizures at the Craig Colony
for Epileptics at Sonyea, N. Y., were ex-
hibited. They were made under the super- |
intendence of Dr. W. G. Chase of Boston and |
Dr. W. P. Spratling, president of the asso- |
ciation and superintendent of the colony.
Dr. Chase prefaced his comments on the |
pictures by pointing out the value to medical |
science of these new studies, Students
in the clinies, he said, had formerly to wait

| many days to observe even a mild seizure

of the affection.

But now the most aggravated and the
most trivial symptoms could be studied
in detail at will. This, he said, was of
incalculable value not alone to students
but to the advanced specialist in epilepsy
Not alone were the moving pictures pre-
sared, but films covering a complete seizure |
fad been printed in a small book. By
pages they
would fly back, giving the whole seizure.
Thus every doctor could have epileptic
fits in a vest pocket edition or ina large
edition de luxe, as he pleased

The apileptics were shown on a AnaE
rubber blanket before adark screen. The
most delicate tremor of the muscles of
face and body could be distinguished as
the fit progressed. Comments were made
by Drs. Spratling and Chase, pointing out

of the disease. The exhibition closed amid
the applause of the large audience of med-
ical men

COURT YIELDS TO MOB. |

 

Reverses His Decision Promptly When

1,000 Oystermen Threaten.
CRISFIELD, Md., Nov. 20.—A mob of about
1,000 oystermen from the oyster flelds of
Maryland and Virginia came to Crisfield

who had been arrested on the charge of |
illegal dredging on the fields of the Tangier |

They were intensely interested in the
case, as it involved what the oystermen
consider their inalienable right to dredge
wherever they please in the waters of
the Chesapeake, Their fathers and grand-
fathers had this right, and they look upon
all attempts to deprive them of it as down-
right tyranny. / .

fhe mob was so great that Justice Ken-
nerly moved the trial from his office to
Pythian Hall. In the first case called a
verdict of not guilty was rendered and |
there was no trouble. But when the case |
of the Nelson brothers came up, the Justice,
after hearing about 100 witnesses, rendered
a verdict of guilty. Instantly pandemo-
nium broke loose. There were cries of
“Kill him!” “Tar and feather him!” The
Magistrate drew his revolver.

The sheriff's officers drew theirs, and for
the time being the mob was overawed. |
Subsequently the mob decided to force the
Magistrate to reverse his decision. Ac-
cordingly they moved to the hall, where
the Magistrate had locked himself in, and
soon gained an entrance. Justice Ken-
nerly promptly reversed his decision and
the oystermen left in high spirits.

 

DIED IN: CORONERS’ COURT,

 

Mrs. Hayner Had Just Testifed Regarding
the Death of Her Brother.

Mrs. Winfield Hayner of 287 East Ninety- |
eighth street died in the Coroners’ court |
yesterday afternoon just after she had
left the witness stand, Coroner Brown

of James Feeley, Mrs. Hayner's brother, |
who was assaulted in a saloon at Ninety-

tober 16.
It was charged that Thomas Fitzpatrick,

with a beer bottle. Mrs. Hayner, who
was a very stout woman, about 61 years
old, became very much excited as she told
of a statement made to her by her brother
just before he died, and she wept bitterly.
When she left the witness chair she was
assisted to a seat in the rear of the room,
where she swooned.

A telephone message was sent to the
Hudson Street Hbdspital, but before an am-
bulance arrived the woman died. Dr.
Jackson of the Coroners’ office said that
Mrs. Hayner died of heart disease

The inquest was adjourned,

Later, Vernon Murphy, 35 years old,
of 121 Edgecombe avenue, The Bronx, died
in the Tombs just across the Bridge of
Sighs. He was sent to the prison on No-
vember 18 by Magistrate Pool in default
of $1,000 batl on a charge of robbery. Since
he was sentenced he had spent most of his
