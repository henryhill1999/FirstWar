THE COMMISSION'S RATE BILL

AY FORM THE BASIS OF THE
PRESIDENT'S MEASURE,
Gives Power to the Interstate Commerce
Commission Where Rates Are Come
plained of to Determine on Full Heare
ing What Isa Just or Reasonable Rate,

WasHiNGTON, Nov. 20.-Fewer than a
quorum of the Senate Committee on Inter:
gate Commerce listened this afternoon
to the reading of the Interstate Commerce
Commission's bill, whieh, it is understood,
gj] be the basis at least of the bill to be
urged Upon Congress by the President.
genator Cullom is expected to present this
measure ‘The Senators present were Mr,
Hkins (Rep), chairman, and Messers,
Polliver, Kean and Foraker (Republicans,)
and Foster and Newlands (Democrats),
The reading of the bill and the discussion
of its features occupied the time of the
committee from 2 P, M. until nearly 5
plelock ‘To-night the full text of the bill
was made public,

The important feature of the bill is that
in which power is given the — Inter-
state Commerce Commission where rates
and practices of railroads are complained
of by individuals or corporations, including
other carriers trade organizations or
municipal corporations, as unjust or un-
reasonable or discriminating, to determine,
on full hearing, What a just or reasonable
rate or practice is, Which should take the
place of the practice or rate condemned
by the commission, In discharge of this
duty the commission is given authority by
the | i

First—To fix a maximum rate.

Second--To fix a differential rate and to
preseriie both a maxitnumand a minimum,
t the same when that may be
recessary to prevent discrimination for-
hidden by the third section of the bill; not
otherwise

Third To change classifications of any
article

It also gives the commission power, in
case it fixes a joint rate and the carriers
interested are not able to agree on its ap-
portionment, to make a supplemental order
apportioning the rame.

4 similar power is given

GOSSIP OF WALL STREET.

A feature of yesterday's market was the
streneth in the atoc's of the equipment com-
panies, notably Pressed Steel Car and Ameri-
ean Car and Foundry. The appreclation
in price of these stocks was not due to ox.
pectation of early cesumption of dividend
payments, but to the phenomenal demand
for new equipment, which insured the pros-
Derity of the companies for many months
to come, Profitihg by past experience,
companies were expected to pursue a
very conservative course in regard to divi-
dends and this very conservatism wae re-
garded as the condition best calculated to
advance the true interests of the companies
themselves and of their stockholders, On
the preferred shares the influence waa ex-
pected to be most strongly felt, especially
in the case of Vressed Steel Car, where as
the preferred stock dividends are non-
cumnlative the wisdom of accumulating a
larce surplus against the contingency of
temporary trade depression is clearly ap-
parent In this case dividends could not
be paid unleas earned from the year's opera-
tions, but a large accumulated surplus would
justify payments up to the level of the year's
results, whereas these could hardly be made
if there were ‘any question of the adequacy
of the working capital. ‘The companies have
on their books avery large amount of orders
and although a great part of the business
secured early in the year allowed a small
margin of profit, the heavy deliveries of cara
in the past few weeks have opened the way
to work, on which prices are more satisfac-
tory and the result will be shown in rela-
tively larger earnings, Conservative brokers
generally take the ground that the common
stocks of these companies are high by com-
parison with United States Steel, but the
speculative element shows a preference for
them at present on account of the inaction
of the latter.

The weak bull following in Amalgamated
Copper having been shaken out, the stock
resumed a strong upward tendency. The
movement was based entirely upon prosper-
ous trade conditions which it is belleved will
justify an advance in the dividend rate be-
fore long. Not only has the company dis-

 

| posed of its entire stock of mined copper,

through routes and joint rates and to fix |

the terms and conditions under which the
routes shall be operated if the carriers fail
or refuse to agree upon the same,

It also provides that where the owner
of the property transported renders any
service in connection with the transporta-
tion or furnishes any instrumentality used,
the commission may on complaint deter-
mine what is a reasonable charge to be paid
hy the carrier for such service or instru-
mentality. It provides for the colléction in
the courts of overcharges found due by
the commission and the penalties for the
failure of carriers to observe final orders
of the commission, It provides that the
fnal orders of the Commission shall take
efect thirty days from the time they are
served on the carrier, and unless vacated
ty the courts are to remain effective for
one year.

In case the carrier complained of ob-
jects to putting the orders of the com-
mission into effect, the right to have the
same reviewed in the United States Cir-
cuit Court is provided for and an elaborate
form of procedure is provided, differing
in one important Rereculen from the pro-
cedure now established for the courts of
the United States, viz; That the Chancellor
may upon notice to both parties, extend
the time in which such order shall take
effect, not to exceed sixty cays from date
of its service. And that the court may
also, if it plainly appears that the order
is Unlawtit and not otherwise, suspend
the operation within the discretion of the
court

The constitutionality of the above pro-
vision of the bill was discussed seriously
in the committee to-day.

An appeal from the Circuit Court to the
Supreme Court of the United States is
provided without superredeas.

The bill provides that no costs shall be
allowed the petitioner in the Circuit Court.

Inthe cases appealed to the Circuit Court
the United States is the defendant, and if
the proceedings are finally dismissed the
defendant shall have judgment for costs.

The defence in these proceedings is to be
conducted by the Government through

the United States Attorney for the district
where the action is brought by direction
of the Attorney-General and the expenses
are to be paid out of the appropriation for
maintaining the courts. Complaints may
be made by the railroad commission of any
State or Territory and shall be investigated
or the commission may institute an inquiry
on its own motion,

Penalties for a carrier's failure to comply
with a final order of the commission or any
of its officers or agents who knowingly
fail or neglect to obey it are provided.
They shall forfeit to the United States the
flim of $5,000 for each offence. Each viola-
tion shall eonstiture a separate offence and
in case of a continuous offence each day
shal! constitute a separate offeres. These
Penalties shall become applicable unless
within the time limited (thirty days) pro-
ceedings to vacate the order have been
hegun, or unless the commission by sup-
Dlemental proceedings has modified or
Fspended the same.

Another part of the bill defines the word
“transportation” as used in the bill as all
instrumentalities employed by the carrier,
including elevators,
Whether owned by the carrier or other
parties, for refrigerating, ventilation or
other purposes, and require such carriers
to furnish transportation on request of
Flippers, publishing total charges for such
transportation as now required by law.

It makes the through or joint rates where
foode are shipped from one point in the
hited States to another in the United
States through a foreign country subject
to the control of the Interstate Commerce
‘aw and enforces this provision by makin
the merchandise which is thus haul
‘trough a foreign country from a point in
the United States to another point in the
United States subject to customs duties at
the frontier, unless the through rate is filed
with the Interstate Commerce Commission
And published as by law required.

_It authorizes the commission, through
Inspectors appointed by the SOTLInIMRLORT tO
faumine accounts of interstate carriers,

orbids the keaping of any other books of
account save those prescribed by the com-

lon, and requires the carrier tc make

& great variety of reports as to its organi-

‘ation and extensions as at present re-
quired by law.

but it has sold its product ahead to an extent
equal to about its entire output up to March 1.
On account of increased facilities and tm-
proved demand the company expecta to turn
out from 10 percent. to 15 per cent, more
metal this year than in any previous twelve
months in its history, and with the high aver-
age price and the reduced cost of operation
net profitsare expected to exceed all previous
records. Apart altogether from the pros-
perous condition of the copper trade, very
large profits are being made from the sale of
lumber at prevailing high prices, and it {s as-
serted that from this and other outside en-
terprises sufficient net earnings will this year
be realized to show more than 2 per cent. for
the stock in addition to the 10 per cent. or
thereabouts earned in the principal GQepart-
ment of the business. There is reason to
helieve that in the last few weeks there has
been accumulation for the account of peraons
formerly interested in the industry who for
some time had but a small line of Amalga-
mated stock.

One of tne rumors regarding the recent
sensational movement in Tennessee Coal
and Jron attributed the rise to the purchase of
175,000 shares out of the entire 225,588 shares
of common stock by the president of one of
the large local trust companies. Such a
purchase would of course convey absolute
control, exeept that as the board of direc-
tors is classified the new interests might not
be able to elect a majority of the board at
the annual meeting next vear. The rumor
attributed the alleged purchase of a majority
of the stock to a purpose to carry out the
merger of Southern iron companies along the
lines hitherto apoken of, except that Jones
& Laughlin of Pittsburg might, it was said,
be interested either through actual invest-
ment of capital or by a friendly alliance.
In the former plan to bring about consolida-
tion of Tennessee Coal and Iron with other
Southern concerns the scheme was said to
contemplate the placing of the new com-
pany under the auspices of United States
Steel, and the substitution in this instance
of the latter company's Pittsburg competitor
as an ally of the proposed combine was by
some accepted as partial explanation of the
comparative neglect of the stocks of the
big corporation. Like previous stories, how-
ever the rumoi found ne confirmation.

As no definite news transpired to account
for the further advance in National Lead to
anew high figure beyond the indefinite rumors
of progress with a merger scheme, the move-
ment caused increased timidity on the part
of the trading element lest some hitch should
oceur involving possibly a severe break in
this stock and a sympathetic effect on the
general list. Conservative brokers took the
view that is was hardly possible to conceive
of any merger or other development affecting
National Lead which had not been fully dis-
counted by the advance in the stock, and there
was therefore a strong tendency to regard
the continued movement as very largely the
result of bold manipulation and a matter to
be deplored. A speculator who probably
made a large amount of money on the ad-
vance in Tennessee Coal and Iron was said to
have beep interested in the Lead movement,
and to this was attributed mucb of the un-
timely activity ir the latter.

With the unpleasant feeling created hy the
flagrant manipulation of certain apecialties,the
advance to per cent, in the rate for call
money added to the prevailing uncertainty
and induced many traders to assume a
bearish attitude. Not only among the trading
clement, however, was a change in sentiment
noted, but even some of the largest houses
which had been hopefully bullish a week
before were inclined to retire for the time
being from the position which they then
held. Movements in industrial stocks, which
at first seemed to be constructive, had by
manipulation been carried to a point where

| they became destructive, so far as they con-

cerned intelligent sentiments The effect
was to induce the Street to seek out other
factors Which might be expected to depress
prices, and in this mood turned to the pos-
sibilities of rate legislation, the threatening
labor situation and the prospect for a rather
unfavorable bank statement on Saturday
next. What the President might recommend
in regard to rate making was, of course, not
known, but in this respect somé significance
was attached to the comparative heaviness
of some of the railroad stocks. Fears were
expressed that the strike in the building
trades might extend from this city to other
points and ultimately cause & heavy falling
off in the demand for structural material,
besides affecting various otber lines of trade.
Less confidence was placed in reports that
the agreement with the anthracite miners
would be renewed next April, as it was feared
that the unrest of labor now threatening
might incite the miners to present unreason-
able Gemanda. In spite, hoavever, of these
gloomy views the market could not be called

weak.

The publication of Canadian Pacific's figurea
for October showing an increase of $707,000
in net was followed by an advanoe in the
stock resulting from buying of the same
character which had been noted on the
preceding day, Apart from the excellent
earnings, it was argued that the stock was
speculatively more attractive at present
than most other railroad stocks, as it could
not be affected by any remarks about the rate
regulation in the President's message or by
the fears of what Congress might do to meet
the views of the Chief Executive on this ques-

tion,

For some inscrutable reason a gloomy
view was taken of the coal labor outlook,
but the action of Lackawanna directors in
declaring an extra dividend of 10 per cent.
was regarded as an assurance that the man-
agement of that road expected no trouble,

The confirmation of long current reports
regarding St. Paul's intention to build to the
Pacific coast recalled to some minds that
when this story first started it credited the
road with a purpose to build not only to
Puget Sound but Yrom that section south-
ward along the coast to San Francisco,
Whether the latter project has ever been con-
sidered is unknown, but such a road would

Support seemed to be met for Rock Island
under 25, and the statement of earnings of
the system for the month of October showed
that the business was largely ahead of that
of the corresponding period in 1904, although
net returns were amaller as 4 result of the
poliev of changing a considerable amount of
betterment work to operating expenses. A
number of conservative houses took the
ground, after a careful study of the earnings,
that there did not seem to be anything In the

ERIE NOW GIVES UP C.,H. & D,

-

MORGAN PERSONALLY
QUIRES THAT SYSTEM,

 

J. PF, AC-

Leaving Erle Subject to No Obligations
J.P. Morgan & Co, Sold the Road to

Erie, Having Bought It From the
Syndicate Headed by H. B. Hollins & Co.

After a special moeting of the directors
of the Erie Railroad yesterday afternoon
President Underwood announced that the
directora had voted to accept an offer of
J. P. Morgan to assume the purchase of
the Cincinnati, Hamilton and Dayton Rail-
way. The C., H. & D. was sold to the
Erie Railroad about two months ago by
J, P. Morgan & Co,, and it is understood
that Mr. Morgan's offer to repurchase the
property relieves the Erie from all obliga-
tions. The following offical explanation
was given out by Mr. Underwood:

It having appeared to the board of direc-
tors of the Erie Railroad Company that under
evisting conditions the purchase of the come
monstock of the Cincinnati, Hamilton and Day-
ton Railway Company might involve obliga-
tlonsonthe part ofthe Erie company, Interfer-
ing with the future development of its own
railroad, the board of directors to-day voted
unanimously to accept the offer of J. Pp. Mor-
gan, himself to assume and complete that
purchase on his own account, thus relieving
the Erie Railroad from all costs, charges and |
contracts in the matter.

The Erie board voted further to proceed
with the sale of its $12,000,000 convertible
bonds as heretofore authorized, the proceeds
to be used as authorized under the general
mortgage of 1903 in the improvement of and
extensions to its road. Of course, all stock-
holders who have subscribed for these bonds
on the faith of the (., H. & D. stock being
pledged thereunder will be released from
their aubacriptions if they 80 desire.

The $12,000,000 convertible bonds re-
ferred to were issued to purchase the com-
mon stock of the C.,H. & D., but, as ex-
plained, will now be used for other pur-
poses,

President Underwood and several of the
vice-presidents of the Erie made a tour
of the (., H. & D. system a few weeks |
ago and discovered that the condition of |
the property was not as satisfactory as
they and the bankers associated with the
Erie had believed it to be. It was dis-
covered among other things that contracts
and traffit arrangements avored the De-
troit, Toledo and Tronton Railroad, owned
by H. B. Hollins & Co., to sueh an extent
aa to threaten to make the operation of
the C., H. & D. by the Erie an unprofitable

er.
A Morgan & Co. purchased the C., H.
& DP. from a syndicate headed by H. B.
Hollins & Co. Previous to the purchase
it was rumored that this syndicate, together
with Edwin Hawley, Join W. Gates and |
other well known railroad men, was about |
to form a merger of the C., H. & D., Wis- |
consin Central, Detroit, Toledo and Iron- |

|

 

ton and a couple of small railroads con-
trolled by Edwin Hawley. It was thought
at the time that the interests back of the |
large trunk lines would never allow such
a merger to take place.
Hollins & Co. also of
the Detroit, Toledo and Ironton Railroad,
Eugene Zimmer-

had control

|
\
man, formerly president of the C.,H.& D., |
and one of its largest stockholders, sold
his interests at the time that control changed
and later resigned as president. He was
recently elected president of the Detroit,
Toledo and Ironton, Russell Paraings he
vice-president of the C., H. & -D., how-
ever, remained vice-president under the
brief Erie régime and was also made first
vice-president of the Erie. He resigned
both placea about a week ago, shortly |
after returning from the inspection trip
with President Underwood. c |
No information could be obtained last
night regarding the future destiny of the

to Begin With Ready. |

The extension of the Chicago, Milwaukee
and St. Paul Railroad from Evyarts, S. D.,
to the Pacific coast, which was authorized
by the directors at a meeting on Tuesday, |
will cost, it was learned from an official
source yesterday, not less than $60,000,000.
There were many guesses in Wall Street
yesterday as to how the extension would be |
financed, but the directors have reached no
decision as yet. It was said Ry a director,

however, that the company has enough
to begin work. Sepa-

rate companies will be incorporated in each
State to carry on the work.

The U, @, Corporation Taking Them
the Last Half of Next Year,

“The international markets have been
gaining in strength,” says the Jron Age
to-day. “The United States Steel Corpora-
tion, not having any open space for export
orders before August of next year, has just
authorized the booking of orders for the
last half. Since the interest in question
has been holding back for a month, resisting
the demands of buyers, it is likely that a
considerable tonnage will be booked at an
early date.

“An international incident has been the
capture by the Steel Corporation of a round
lot of girder rails fon London tramways.
Yet another English order has been re-
cently awarded to British makera, in spite
of the fact that the American bid was $8
per ton below that of the local mills.”

Of other features of the business the trade
paper saya:

So far as pig iron is concerned the markets
have quieted down, but maintain their full
Strength, There have been few large trans-
actions in foundry grades, but some pretty
good inquiries are atill in the market,

The scarcity of metal for steel making
Purposes continues, Last week the leading
interest purchased 25,000 tons of basic pig
in the Eastern markets for delivery to the
Pencoyd worka. This iron takes the place
of metal which it was the original plan to
ship from the Pittsburg district, but which
has now been diverted to the steel plants
there, where it was sorely needed,

For the first time in many months there
has been a softening in the price of coke,
which is due to the fact that makers have
rushed every available unit of plant into
commission and that there has been a better
supply of cars,

Merchant firms inthe lake ore trade have
been filling up their order books for deliv-
eries of ore during the next season, ‘The
movement Which began some time ago with
the booking by one large firm at an advance
of 2he, per ton over last year has now spread,
and buyers and sellers have met on the basis
ofan advance of 50 cents per ton, which makes
the basis for Bessemer old range $4.25 for the
next season, The ore men have acted with
very much more conservatism than the coke
producers

There has been a little relief in the con-
gestion ofthe plate mills, A good deal of new
work is coming up for the structural mills
in Chicago, Pittsburg and other cities. Thus
far the threatened atrike of the housesmiths
in New York has not affected the rolling mill
programme.

The principal hoop mills have decreed a
further advance of $2 per ton, Which puts
the price up to $1.85 Pittsburg. Bars are siiffer
and higher prices are being asked. ¢

FEDERAL ACTION TO BREAK UP
ALLEGED MONOPOLY,

 

Permanent Injunction Asked Under the
AnthTrust Act--The Bill Alleges ‘Une

lawful Conspiragy" to Destroy Compe+
ttion by Fixing Unreasonable Tolls.

St. Lovis, Noy. 29,-United States Dia-
trict Attorney D, P. Dyer to-day filed a bill
in equity in the Federal Circuit Court to
break the so-called “terminal monopoly” in
St. Louis. The action is directed against
the Terminal Railroad Association of St.
Louis and ita directors, the subordinate
corporations of the Terminal Association
and the fourteen railroads owning terminal
stock,

The Court is asked to dissolve the com-
bination existing between the defendant
concerns, to enjoin them from voting stock
in one another's meetings and to take such
other action as is necessary to the complete
abolition of the “unlawful conspiracy” al-
leged to exist between the railroads and
several terminal companies.

The defendants are required to answer
the petition, but not under oath, on the
first Monday in January, A temporary
restraining order is asked pending the final
decision of the Court on the petition for a
permanent injunction.

The petition covers thirty typewritten
pages and is based on the act of Congress
of July 2, 1890, “to protect trade and
commerce against Unlawful restraint and
monopoly.”

A considerable portion of the first part
of the petition is devoted to a review of
the manner in which the Terminal Asso-
ciation has developed inte a competition
destroying organization,

The fourteen railroads comprising the
Terminal Association, it is alleged, fix
unreasonable tollS both for freight and
passenger service and have so destroyed
competition “that unless the United States
prevents the carrying out of this conspiracy
and combination it will be perpetuated and
the publie will be greatly injured and the
act of Congress of July 2, 1890, to protect
trade and commerce will be circumvented
and set at naught and the public left at
the mercy of the monopoly.”
