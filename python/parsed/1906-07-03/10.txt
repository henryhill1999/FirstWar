6,000 VOICES SING IN CHORUS,

GREAT CONCERT OF THE NORTH-
EASTERN SAENGERFEST.

 

 

An Immense Audience Présemt, Including
Gov, Stokes of New Jersey— me,
Schumann-Heink and M. Campanari
Were the Soloists—Trials for Prize.

Big events marked the progress of the
twenty-first national saengerfest of the
Northeastern Saengerbund at Newark yes-
terday, the most notable being a concert
fn the First Regiment Armory last night,
during which selections were rendered by a
mass chorus of more than 5,000 voices.

‘All the singers taking part in the carnival
were massed upon an improvised stage

at one end of the immense drill shed and
joined in song under the leadership of
Julius Lorenz to the accompaniment of the
Philharmonic Orchestra. Mme. Schur-
mann-Heink and M. Campanari were the
soloiste of the concert. The choruses

,Produced the greatest volume of har-
monious sound ever listened to in Newark,

and an audience of 15,000 persons forgot
the sweltering heat in their enjoyment
of the melody.

The singing for prizes by three classes
‘was conducted at Olympic Park in the after-
noon. The auditorium was far too emall
$0 accommodate the throng that wanted to
listen to the efforts of the societies that
competed, After about 4,000 persons had
orowded and squeezed themselves within
the walls and several men and women
had succumbed to the stifling heat, the doors
were closed and no more were admitted,’

Gov. Exiward C. Stokes of New Jersey
was the guest of honor of the Saengerbund
during the afternoon. The Governor was
brought up from Newark by Major Carl
Lentz, president of the bund, and was
introduced to the various delegations at
their tent headquarters on the grouncls,
The Governor afterward got a reception
at the president’s tent, and later was es-
corted to the auditorium. The Governor
listened with deep interest to the highly
skilled singing of several of the competing
societies, and then left to go to the Essex
Country Club with Major Lentz as the lat-
ter’s guest at dinner. Last night the Gov-
ernor attended the concert at the armory.

It was announced at the park yesterday
afternoon that the asnaeltniod directors
had formally ratified the recommendation
of its committee that Manhattan be selected
eg sa piace for holding the next Saengerfest,
n 1909,

__ The prize contests began about 3.0'clook
in the afternoon and continued until even»
ing. The three classes heard included
the third class societies, limited to organiza-
eu of thirty or legs members, and the

Tat and second classes of United Singers
for the city prizes. The five judgea who
are to decide the merits of the competitors
in all the contests are Dr. Hans Horthan,
Montreal; Louis Ehrgott, Cincinnati; Wolf-

ae Schwarz, Buffalo; Franz Bellinger,
ind lis, and Albert Kunzlen, 8 Use.
The judges were so placed that they and
the singers were not in each other's sight.
The decisions will not be made known
until Wednesday evening at the close of
the formal programme.

The following fifteen societies of the
third class underwent the.ordeal of: render-
ing “Abendrihe,” the piece selected for
the test: Urania Quartet Club, New York;
Schwabischer Saengerbund, Brooklyn;
Germania Quartet Club, Johnstown, Pa.;

and Camden, N. J.

oert last night.

MEN

WANT ICE JAILED.

‘tf the Facts Warrant” Is Added to M. 0.
Alderman's Resolution,

In obedience to the Charter the Aldermen
met yesterday to receive the tax books.
The books will remain open for public in-
spection in the City Hall for fifteen days,
when the Aldermen will hold another special
meeting to authorize the tax levy.

After getting the books the Aldermen
decided to go ahead with their usual weekly
meeting instead of coming together again
to-day.

They spent some time considering whether

or not they§should ask District Attorney
Jerome to prosecute the heace of the Amer-
ican Ice Company for conspiracy to main-
tain an exorbitant price for ice. henry
ey. Peters, the leader of the M. O. forces
in the board, presented the resolution. His
inspiration came from the jailing of some
ice company officials in Toledo, The reso-
lution was a very long one. It insisted
that the heads of the company, which was
described as “the most crue) and _ heart-
less monopoly in America,” had been
Foe. of: extortion and called upon Mr.
erome to prosecute these men for con-
gpiracy Alderman Doull suggested that
it might be wise to insert in this last clause
of the resolution the words “if the facts
warrant.” Mr. Peters agreed to the amend-
ment and the resolution was then allowed
to go through.

e Committee on Privileges and Elections
reported that is had investigated the grounds
of the protests made by Hubert Slatte
ag e seating o! erman ‘a

ainst th t f Ald McCall
and of Joseph Weil against Alderman Har-
nischfeger and that neither protestant had

ie out a case. The thereupon

No Information as to Chicago Tunnel
$50,000,000 Loan.

Carcaao; July 2.—President A.C. Wheeler
of the Illinois Tunnel Company returned
from New York to-day, where he had gone
toconfer with the controlling interest,inthe
Chicago Subway Company concerning
proposed new financing. The only state~
ment'he makes on the special meeting, that
was planned to authorize $50,000,000 new
collateral trust bonds for refunding pur-

ses and to raise needed funds is that it
is found that the company has the right to
negotiate for money without a special meet-
ing that the needs of the tunnel com-
pany have been provided for. .

 

More Guggenheim Stock Voted.

At the meeting of the Guggenheim Ex-
ploration Company at Perth Amboy yester-
day it was voted to increase the capital
stock from $17,000,000 to $22,000,000. Presi-
dent Guggenheim said the company had
acquired or taken options on properties
in Nevada, Utah, Alaska, Yukon Territory
and British Columbia, incurring obligations
of more than $16,000,000, “tbat further
outlay would be required to take over other
valuable options. Every subscriber of
record will be entitked to subscribe to 50 per
cent. of present holdings at $200 a sbare
and all unsubscribed stock may be sold at
the discretion of the’ directors at not less
than $200 a share.

 

Dead Baby Found.

‘The body of a strangled infant was found
yesterday in Colonial Park, near 145th street

cloth satchel. A bit of blue ribbon tied
about the neck caused death in the ovinion
of the Coroner's physician.

IRON AND STEEL,

Firmness Dominates Pig Iron Markets
~Active Conditions in Steel Wares.

From domestic markets for pig iron come
reports of firm prices which dominate all
sorte of fron. The long ruling deadlock be-
tween prodicera and consumers has bren
broken ina latge part of the Eastern and
Western markets, aud good round sales are
being nade by makers of Southern, Eastern
and Western iron, ‘the numerous orders for
«out foundny iron reflect the scarcity of metal
in the hands of consumers, large and small.
In Southern iron several makers who quoted
$13.50 Birmingham last week have advanced
to the basis of $18.75, and are saylug that the
price is likely to be advanced to $14 without
notice to consumers. A northern New Jersey
foundor just back from a tour of Alabama
furnaces says that deliveries of iron bought
thereabouts during the past fortnight will be
vexatiously slow, as the car famine is more
acute than ever. A number of local furnace
agents in summing up their sales for the firat
half of the year find that notwithstanding the
recent lull they have made top notch records
from January to July in recent years. Norvh-
ern and Western irons are unchanged in
price, Steel making irons are strong at $17.50
$17.75 for Bessemer, valley furnace, and
$17.:50817.50 for basic, furnave delivery.
Rar iron is in better demand East and West,
and is going off well on the basin of $1.60
Hittaburg.

Old material is firm and unchanged.
and ateel serap are in good demand.

Coke for furnace requirements {ts active
at. $2.40@82.50 at ovens. Prime 72 hour
foundry coke is in large request and good
supply at $2,75@$3. The Connellaville ovens
are now operating at the weekly output of
580,000 tons.

Steel is in a strong statistieal situation.
The acarcity of billets and bars gives the
key to the position, Foreign and domestic
interests which largely consume these prod-
ucts have been kept short for months. Ever
since a year ago, when the Carnegie Steel
Company contracted to sell the Pittsburg
Steel Company 200,000 tons of Bessemer and
open hearth steel billets a year for five years,
there has been a scarcity of billets. It had
been the intention of the Pittsburg Steel
Company to build blast furnaces and open
hearth plants at Monessan. But this project
was given up when the contract was made
with the Carnegie plant, As to steel making
fron, the larger stee] corporations are hardly
four days ahead of the incoming pig iron.
In finished ateel products plenty of new
business is recorded for domestic account
and the export trade is making high records
for Canada, Mexico, Australia and South
America. Prices are unchanged. If the
United States Steel Corporation went without
booking another order for nine months it
would then be just about worked through
its ordér books. Four other large steel cor-
porations are about in the same condition as
to work on hand,

COPPER, TIN AND LEAD.

Strong Statistical Situation of Copper
—Firm Tene in Most of the Base Metals.

The copper markets the world over ex-
hibit the strong statistical position of the
metal, which T, -V. Anthony, an eminent
British authority, declares is due “to a steady
Progressive and imperative demand. Cone
sumption has actually reached the limits
of production. The present estimated con-
sumption in the United States is 30,000 tons
a month, as against 20,000 tons in 1905. The
Eastern Hemisphere requires about one-
half of the American production, and the
whole of that production is being marketed
as fast as it is available. Of new sources of
supply none are important outside the prop-
erties controlled by American capital.”

In the local market there is little new
business except in a few round sales of elec-
trolytic for Europe. This country is now
making 88 per cent. of the total output of
electrolytic copper. In Europe that form
of industry is going backward, as. refiners
are practically cut off from ores rich in gold
and silver, whiph are controlled by operators
of the vast electrolytic plants of this country,
and which, by resson of the precious metals
in their copper stock, figure low costa of
copper production. Producers’ priqes for
copper are firm and unchanged. Lake,
August and September, 184 ¢.@10c.; electroe
lytic, for August and September, 18%c.@
18%c, Prime casting copper, thirty days,
18%c,@18%jc., London quotes standard cope

Pig tin is in good demand and is firm in
the local market at 39%c.@40c. for spot.
London asks, spot, £178 10s.; three months,
£176 128. 6d. Pig lead is in active request
at 5.80¢.@5.85¢., spot, New York. In nearly
all base metals prices are strong. Most
metal merchants are of the opinion that base
metals are conditioned for a long stay on high
levels.

MISCELLANEOUS MARKETS.

Coffee Dull and Easlier—Provisions Easter.

Coffee declined moderately, owing to liqui-
dation for local and foreign account. Wall
Street sold to some extent. The trading,
however, was quiet and rather featureless,
It is expected that the visible supply will
show a decrease for the week of about 400,000
bags. The receipts at Rio and Santos for
the season just ended were 259,000 bags larger
than for the previous year and 181,000 bags
smaller than the year before that.

Coffee on the spot was steady at 7%c. for
No.7 Rio. Futures declined 1¢ points, Havre
was unchanged. Hamburg was urichan ged

ALABAMA BONDS RENEWED

At 4 Per Cent. Instead of 6 and to Run
for 60 Years.
Gov. William D. Jelkse of Alabama, who
has been in this city for several days, oon-
summated a deal yesterday whereby a $7,-
000,000 issue of Alabama State bonds was
renewed. An old issue of State bonds for
$7,000,000 matured on July 1. These bonds
ran for thirty years, and the renewal issue is
for fifty years.
The old issue was at 6 per cent., while the
new one calls for only 4 per cent. Laden-
burg, Thalman & Co., bankers at 25 Broad
street, hold the bonds with associates. The:
handled the previous issue. On March 15
last the State of Alabama contracted wit
Ladenburg, Thalman & Oo, for the renewal.
The trip of Gov. Jelks to this city at this
time was merely to deliver the old bonds,
receive payment on them and then make

 

the renewal. Gov. Jelks and his party are
stopping at the Waldorf-Astoria.

 

THE COTTON MARKET.

 

Liquidation Causes a Moderate Decline
~—To-day the Government Report Appears.

Liquidation on the eve of the Government
report to be issued to-day at noon caused a
moderate decline in prices. The deoline was
due partly, however, to quite a favorable
crop report issued by the T'imes-Democrat.
It shows that as a rule quite a distinct im-
provement took place during the month of
June. Besides, Liverpool was dull and dis-
appointing, Fall River advices indicate the
possibility of stocks accumulating there from
now on, 48 contracts are beginning to expire;
the weather was generally favorable at the
South, and Wall Street and other operators
sold. There was a good deal of evening up
of transactions pending the announcement
of the bureau report, and if possible the
market was narrowerthanever. The guesses
on the bureau report to be issued to-day
Tun all the way from 82 to 88 and even a little
higher, but as a rule they are about &1 to 83,
as against 84.6 last month, 77 a year ago and
88 in 1904, the high record year. The Houston
estimate was light, spot markets In the main
were firm and even some of the bear houses
begin to take the ground that it may be risky
to follow any decline below 10 cents until a
good crop is assured. . Liverpool and New
Orleans sold moderately, July dropped 10
points in New Orleans, where Frank B. Hayne
is said to be the principal bull, and 18 points
here, but much of the loss here was recovered

later.
pander & Ettelson said: “The weather
recently has been favorable to the crop and

the cotton world has not waited for the Gov-
ernment report to make public this fact.
Due consideration has been given to condi-
tions as they exist. In the speculative market
it is easier perhaps to follow weather and crop
conditions than it is to take a broad view of
che en.ire situation. It must not be forgotten
that while conditions are favorable for a good
crop at this time, we are approaching
the crop scare period. There has been
little favorable to the bull side of the market
recently; at the same time the market has
given way with reluctance. ere has n
no public buying to speak of, and the demand
for cotton come from the consumers.
This is a strong condition and any attempt
to take advantage of any report or any on
incident to force a sudden decline would hardly
offer the possibility of success. The poarkes
was a waiting affair and buying was largely
supplied by conservative operators who have
recently been favorable to the bear side and
must be therefore put down asshort covering.”

Sanger & Ettelson state the condition at
82,1 per cent. against 84.6 last month as stated
by the Government, 77 in 1905, 88 in 1904 and

TN opden th 00, boteht eerily Inthe d

Bache were sellers.

Attwood Violet & Co. said: “July is usually
the first critical month for cotton where f
favorable start has been made and not i
the end of yay: can one foresee prospects 0}
the crop whether they be good, or in-
different. Comparisons with previous reports
for the same per indicate nothing more than
that a small crop may be the outturn of 4
good June conditions, and again a good sized
crop may be raised where June conditions
gave poor promise. Unless there is absolute
assurance of a supply sufficient to leave a
margin in excess of the mills’ requirement
for the season cotton should not be any lower
in the Southern markets, whatever course
they may be forced to take in this market.”

Delaware and Hudson Secures Control of
the Hudson Valiey Road.

Gurens Fauus, N. Y., July 2.—It was
announced here to-day by former State
Treasurer A. V. Colvin that the Hudson
Valley Railroad securities held by the
Colvin-Herbert-Helme syndicate were
bought by J. H. Caldwell of Troy to-da
for the laware and Hudson ilroad.
The price paid for the securities, which

give the Delaware and Hudson company
control of the road, was $1,250,000.

 

Antelope'’s Flash Light.
Erneat Thompaon Seton in Scribner's,

Another remarkable detail of the antelope's
anatomy is the white area on each buttock
Although it seems at firet like the rest of his
spots, a mere patch of white coat, it is found
to be specialized for an important service,

It is composed of hair graded from short
in the centre to long at the frontedges. Under
the skin of the part is a circular muscle, by
means of which the hair can in a moment be
raised and spread radically into two great
blooming twin chrysanthemums, more or
less flattened at the centre. When this is
done in bright sunlight they shine like tin
pans, giving flashes of light that can be seen
further than the animal itself, affording a
conspicuous identification mark that must be
of great service to the specier,

As soon, therefore, aa an antelope sees
eome strange or thrilling object, this muscle
acta, and the rump patch is instantly changed
into a great double disc of white that shines
afar like a patch of snow, and by ite flashing
spreads the alarm. This, it will be seen, is
simply ahcliograph. Man flattershimsclfthat
he was the inventor of flash communication,

PRIVATE SALES, LEASES AND
PUBLIC AUCTIONS,

 

 

House of Boucheron, Leading Jeweiry Firm
of Paris, Leases No. 600 Fifth Avenue
From B. M. Hasn—Few Sales Were
Closed Yesterday at Private Contract,

The volume of real estate dealing repo
by brokers yesterday was considerably
below the normal. In the duction room
two of the four sales scheduled were ad-
journed, and plans for only two new struct-
ures were filed with the Bureau of Buildings.

However, an important Fifth avenue
lease figured in the budget. Douglas
Robinson, Charles 8. Brown & Co. leased
for R. M, Haan, proprietor of the St, Regis
Hotel, the building at No. 590 Fifth avenue
to the house of Boucheron, a leading jewelry
firm of Paris at 26 Place Vendome.
lease is for along term of years. Thestruct-
ure is on a lot 27.6x100, and has been re-
cently practically rebuilt.

Within the last two years—since Colum-
bia College decided to sell its holding—the
westerly side of this part of the avenue
has been steadily changing from a residen-
tial to a business neighborhood. Perry
Belmont’s house is on the Forty-seventh
street corner and Charles T. Cook's on the
Forty-eighth street corner. Many of the

intervening buildi: have been altered
for business, some jewelry firms being al-
ready in possession,

On the east side of the avenue the south
and north corners respectively are occu-
pied by the residences of Helen M. Gould
and Mrs. Ogden Goelet. This side of the
avenue has been only slightly invaded
by business. However, Charles A. Gar-
diner, who is one of the Gould attorneys
and owns two dwellings adjoining Miss
Gould’d, announced recently that his prop-
erty would bo sold or leased for business.
It is likely, therefore, that the Gould house
will before very long be abandoned to
business purposes.

Power Beats Drive Away Sharks.
From Foreat and Stream.

For a great many years sharke were plenti-
ful about the entrance of Pearl Harbor,
situated seven miles down the coast from
the oity of Honolulu. We could be sure
of catching during the night one, at least,
and have caught as high as four man eaters,
big ones, too, measuring ten, eleven, twelve
and thirteen feet from tip of nose to end
of tail. We-usually fished for them at night
with a large hook, well baited and allowed
to rest on the bottom in ten fathoms of water.
Sharks were caught ‘sometimes four miles
up the lochs and were frequently seen about
the entrance.

About three years ago the Pearl Harbor
bar was d from_a depth of nine feet
to thirty-three feet. This contract took a
year and I presume that the noise of the

uge suction dredge, pounding under water,
and of the power boats going to and fro
was very disquieting to the shark family

Bull's Memory of Wrongs.
Vienna correspondence London Standard,

A strange case is reported from an Austrian
village of a bull's vindictiveness.

A peasant named Eger had sold the animal
a few days previously to the parish, and it
was grazing in a field when it suddenly be-
came furious, rushed through the streets and
entered the house of its former owner, Here
it attacked one of the boys, and on the father
coming to his assistance the bull chased him
out into the road, and round and round a
small chapel. Catching him at last it im-
paled him on its horns and dashed him against
the wall, killing him on the spot. Directly
after having done so it trotted back to its
stall and allowed itself to be tethered quite
quietly. ?

It is supposed that the man must have
maltreated the beast formerly, but such an
instance of bovine rancor is unique, reminding
one of the stories of vindictive elephanta.

Horse That Killed Four Men,
From the Greensburg Star.

John Evans of Blair station was kicked
to death by a horse Tuesday morning, and
he is the fourth victim of that animal.

The horse is to be shot now, because the
widow of Evans will not risk selling him to
some other party to increase the list of vic-
tims. Evans bought the horse at a bargain
in Monessen several weeks ago. He was
warned of the animal's bad habit. of kicking
but laughed and said he guessed he could
manage it. He was told it had already killed
three men. Jokingly he said: “I'll make a
good fourth,”

 

 

Swarm of Gnats Mistaken for Smoke.

Bamberg correspondence Columbia State.
_ Yesterday afternoon about 7 o'clock the
fire alarm was sounded and people rushed
from every direction toward the Baptist
church, What appeared to be a slow rising
smoke seemed to be issuing from the very
top of the steeple.

adders were brought and the inside of
the steeple scaled, but no sign of fire could
be discovered. Those on the outside watch
spe top continually. Finally it was decid
