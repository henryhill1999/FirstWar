LUERS LEFT ALL HE HAD TO
FRIEND AND YOUNG WOMAN.

Miss May Gothier Says She Was Only a Dear
Fried of Paralyzed Man Who Last
His” Money in Steck Speculation
—Kilied Himself in Clarendon Hotel.

Henry Luers, formerly ih the tailors’
supply business in this city and the son of
@ sugar refiner well known in Williamsburg
thirty years ago, committed suicide at the
Clarendon Hotel on Sunday night by in-
haling illuminating gas, He had been a
paralytic for nineteen years and used a
tricycle on the street. He walked with
difficulty. He left a note addressed to his
most intimate friend, Charles Wendell,
saying that he had a wife, whose name he
gave as May, and leaving everything to
her and Mr. Wendell. None of his friends
knew that he had been marrfed. He killed
himself from despondency because he had

lost money. :

The woman to whom Luers referred is
Misa May Gothier, about 25 years old, with
whom he had been acquainted about three
years. He gave her address as 39 Weat
Twelfth street. She does not live there but
has two sisters boarding there and intended
to go there in a few days, when one of her
sisters should go home to New Hampshire
for a viait. She denied yesterday that she
had been married to Mr. Luers but she
showed a diamond ring he had given her
as a token of an engagement between them.

“I am shocked over Mr. Luers’s death,”
phe said, “but he had no right to refer to
me as his wife. He probably wanted me
to have some of his things and thought I
would be more sure of getting them if he
called me his wife. I was in the habit of
takihg dinner with him at his hotel once
or twice a week, usually with one of my
sisters. He was unable to go about much
and go we used to go to his hotel. He was
no more to me than a dear friend.”

Mr. Luera was about 65 yeirs old. In
his early life he had been a stock broker.
In 1887 he had a paralytic stroke, which
caused disability that was pronounced in-
curable, A sister had him sent to a home
for incurables, and this caused a breach
between them, In the. settlement of his
father's estate enough money came to him
for his support in comfort and algo to enable
im to speculate in stocks a little. For
many yeara he lived at the’Clarendon Hotel,
under the old management, and in nt
ears he lived at the Metropolitan Hotel,
roadway and Twenty-seventh street. He
remained there until they began to tear
it to pieces and then went out to Flushing,
where for fifteen years he had been spend-
ing his summers with E. V. Brown of 8)
State street.

Eight days ago he came back to town
and again took a room at the Clarendon.
There Is reagon to believe that-he returned
for the ye of suicide. He had lost
nearly all his. money in Sparen ee in the
Street. Three years ago he had on!
left. Recently he had been dabbling in
sugar and steel stocks, and the slump in
steel practically wiped him out,

He asked for a cheaper room at, the
Clarendon, and the manager believes that
this was to facilitate his suicide, In the
first room he had it was not easy to reach
the gas with the tube he had purchased.
Kate Sullivan, a ohambermaid, smelled
the gas coming from his room yesterda
morning, The door was locked and it
was broken open. Luers was found dead
in bed in his night clothing. He had stopped
all the cracks in the room. That he had

lanned suicide is shown by the fact that

had a loaded revolver with him and a
bottle of poison.

This is the letter Luers left: |

Dear Wendell: If anything happens to me,
be sure and carry out my wishes; that is,to take
my body to the undertaker on Fourth avenue,
from where Ed Sorensen was buried, and
have it cremated as soon as you can, and
have my ashes any time. ~

I leave everything I own to you and May,
She is my wife. Anything that she can use
in my trunk give to her. She is keeping
house at No. 39 West Twelfth street. God
bless her’ Don't speak about my private
affairs to anyone. I trust you.

HENRY JLUERS.

My head troubles ne too much. I can’t
stand it. Balance in bank and pocket, I
think, will pay the expenses,

.Mr. Wendell is a bookkeeper for Stephen
K. Telford, a truckmani\at & Avenue D.
Mr. Wendell said yesterday that although
he had known Luers intimatel¥ for fully
twenty years, he knew little of his early
life. He said Luers had a wealthy sister
in Hoboken. He and Luers had been

mbers of Puritan Lodge No, 239 of the
asons for many years and their friend-

Np began in. that way. While he was
telling a Sun reporter about it Miss Gothier
came in, :

__.“Were om married to him, May?” asked
Mr. Wendell.

“Most assuredly I was not,” was the
answer. .

“I saw him yesterday,” said Mr. Wendell,
*and he seemed cheerful. He raid you
were to take dinner with him to-day and
Iagreed to dine with him on Tuesday.”

. Wendell said he could account for
the suicide on no other ground than that
all of Luers’s money was gone, There was

only about $50 in his} effects. Coroner |

Harburger-was called in the case and was
astonished to find that the suicide was
a former friend of his.

“I often called on him in Flushing,” said
the Coroner, “and in common with his other
friends always supposed he was a bachelor.
He was just able to move about, but had
many friends.”

Miss Gothier said yesterday that Luera
had often said to her that he would probably
commit suicide some day. He was des-
pone recently over his losses in stooks,

+ never intimated to her that he had lost
pesctionty all his money. Miss Gothier

a milliner. She used to live near the
old Putnam House, where for a time Luers
took his meals, and she met him there.

DEAD WITH GAS TUBE NEAR.

Eé@ison Co. Employee May Have Been
Killed by Aet of Imbecile Girt.

Daniel McNulty, a water tender employed
by the Edison Electrio Company, at Thirty-
ninth street and Firat avenue, and living
at 825 East Thirty-ninth street, was found
dead in his bed yesterday afternoon from
gas asphyxiation. The gas jets in the
room were turned on and a long rubber
tube connected with thd gas range in the
kitchen was found extended to the side
of the bed.

When McNulty returned from work
terday morning, he went to confession
at St. Gabriel's Church. Returning home,
he ate a meal and then went to bed. His
wife and daughter, Anna, left soon after
to visit a sick relative. :

COULDN'T REFUND SECURITY.
Partners Acoused of Giving Pretended
Empleyment en Fake Collection Lists.

The Metropolitan Identity Company of
80 William street, which consists apparently
of Morria Herman of 886 East Eighteenth
street and Joseph Laskow of 177 East Broad-
way, came to grief yesterday in the Tombe
police court, The two members of the
firm were looked up in default of $1,000
bail fer examination upon charges of swind-
ling. ~ ,

The company, it is alleged, has * been
advertising for somé months im the Yiddish
papers, offering tempting opportunities for
insurance solicitors, with or without ex-
perience. Jacob Rosenberg of 96 Cannon
street and Max Lesher of 162 East Houston
street, two boys of 18 years, applied for
positions. Each was required to furnish
$100 as security. They pawned all they
owned and raised $50 apiece,” which was
accepted. Then they signed a contract.
This agreed to give them 40 per cent. of all
new business written and 20 per cent. of
all collections made. The final clause stated
that the contract could terminate only after

sixty days notice from either party, when
the vacuity would be retusa, y

allege. Many of the names, t

trate Finn, were fictitious,

were names of peon” who never heard of the
Metropolitan Identity Company. Finally
thé boys got a summons.

The defendants went to court smiling.
They relied upon the contracts to clear
them. When trate Finn looked at the

contracts and said it was purely a civil
matter. they smiled more complacently
than ever. But the boys insisted upon
telling their story. When he had heard it

Magistrate Finn said:

“This is clearly a swindle. You got this
money by trick and device.

Then he gave the partners their choice
of refunding the money to the boys or going
to jail. Thedefendante didn't need the
ten minutes time allowance to make up
their minds to refund; but it was harder to
raise the $100. They sent out messengers

| but at the end of an hour had raised nothing.

| The Court became impatient then and com-
mitted the two to the Tombs in default of
$1,000 bail each for a hearing to-day.

CONNECTING R. R. MUST WAIT.

Action on Franchise Put Of Until the
Mayor's Return,

There seems little chance of any action
until the fall on the franchise applied for
by the Connecting Railroad Company.
Three months ago the Mayor refused to
sanction the terms agreed to by the Rapid
Transit Commission for the franchise, and
at his suggestion it was decided that a com-
mittee of the commission and of the Board
of Estimate arrange terms more favorable
to the city. The Board of Estimate end
| of the committee has held several meetings
| but it has never called a conference with
| the representatives of the commission,
Two weeks ago Samuel Rea, president
| of the company, wrote to t he commission

asking that eome definite action be taken,
| President Orr of the commission said at a
' meeting of the board that it was the fault
| of the Board of Estimate’s committee that
| there had been so long a delay, but the
| Mayor declared that the reason was that
| President McGowan of the Board of Alder-
men and chairman of the committee had
been unable to get replies to certain ques-

| tions he had sent to Mr. Rea,
ince then Mr. Orr has written to Mr.

McGowan asking for a conference. They

met yesterday in the offices of the commis-

sion. Mr. Orr urged immediate ‘consider-
ation of the company’s application, but

Mr. McGowan replied that! fe was unable

to take any step in the matter because he |.

was now acting Mayor and that the chair-
man of the committee was Alderman Good-
man, acting President of the Board of
Aldermen. It was admitted by Mr. Orr
and Mr. McGowan that it would require
considerable time for Mr, Goo n to
make himself acquainted with the situation
and the conferenoe ended with the tacit
undersanding thas nothing could be done
until Mayor McClellan returns.

SETTLE WITH PLUMBERS.

Forty Employers Reach an Agreement
—1,2368 of the Men Quit,

The strike of Plumbers’ Union No. 2
for an advance in wages of 50 cents a day
throughout Manhattan and Bronx boroughs
which took effect yesterday was followed
by action by employers who are in a hurry
to get their contracts finished to reach
a speedy settlement with the union, The
men who obeyed the strike order were
directed to register at the headquarters
of the strikers in Maennerchor Hall, Fifty-
sixth street and Third avenue, and up to
late yesterday afternoon 1,365 out of 1,500
had registered. About forty employers
made a settlement early in the day and
their employees, numbering 300, will return

| to work to-day.

It is expected that Local Union 480 of the
National Association of Plumbers and
Gas and Steam Fitters and Helpers, the
new union fotmed under the arbitration
agreement, will try to fill the places of the
strikers. President-Merrick of the national
union arrived in this city yesterday to
look over the ground.

Among the buildings reported by the
strike committee as being affected by the
atrike are Hammeratein's new opera house
Thirty-fourth street, between Eighth and
Ninth avenues; a number of private resi-
dences, a row of model tenements in East
Seventy-sixth street, and many hundreds
of apartment houses and flate.

President Frank Gartland of Plumbers’
Union No. 2 said last Syenne that strikes
of all the trades in the Associated ing
Trades will be ordered in every case where
non-union plumbers or members of the
new union are put to work. These will
include painters, marble workers, steam-
fitters, engineers, stone cutters, plasterers

riggers, electrical workers

We oan pull out 25,000 men in the other
trades in sympathy,” he said, “if necessary.
Our union is not under the arbitration
agreement and we work only for the non-
association employers, who employ more
plumbers at present than the association
employers. The men under the arbitra-
tion agreement oan strike in sympat
with us without violating the agreement,
and a#re ready to do so if necessary, as they
would not be striking against any associa-
tion employer.”

FIREWORKS MAKERS LOOK FOR
FEWER ACCIDENTS, TOO.

New Rules ef the Bureau of Combustibies
One Cause—Mere Spectacular Pieces
Geld This Year—Lees Neise,~ Less
Patridtiem, the View of One BMealer.

The Fourth of July this year will be leas
nolsy than ite immediate 8,
according ta. men in the fireworks trade.
This reduction in noise willbe madeup for,
the same authorities say, by the use of
more spectacular fireworks.

The change in New York is largely the
result of the efforts of the Bureau of Com-
bustibles. The ordinances against the
uge of “dynamite” firecrackers, paper cap
pistols, &o., will, it is hoped, materially
reduce the casualities incident upon the
celebration of the day. /

One of the managers of a large fireworks
company in Park place said yesterday
that the regulations had the hearty approvel
of the trade.

“The majority of injuries are caueed by the
now forbidden goods,” he gaid. “We are
glad to cooperate with the police in sup-
pressing them,since accidenta were always
iaid at our doors, The ordinary Chinese
cracker ia innocent enough and once served
every purpose for a noisy Fourth. But it
is a characteristic of the American people
to go the limit and ‘dynamite’ crackers were
the result.”

The same man spoke of the greatly in-
creased sales in fireworks, especially those
of an aerial nature, His judgment was
echoed by the manager of another big
firm across the street, although the latter
personally has little sympathy with the ad-
vocates of a “quiet Fourth.®

“Why,” he said yesterday, “when I was
a kid I used to save my pennies for six
months sot to make a big noise on the
Fourth o July, Now a lot of people d
the noise. ‘s the only way to t
patriotism to some le, though. Immi-
grants living on t Bast Side celebrate
saints 'days—and there are enough nation-
alities always to have a celebration some-
where—and they use fireworks, too. Let
them celebrate the Fourth as much as they
want to and will. If the adults among
them never learn the significance of the

GOOD DINNER FOR PRISONER.

Cop Gets a $3 Bill in Coroner's Ceurt—No
Ball in Sight Seeing Auto Case.

Willlam MoFadden of 436. West Forty-
eighth street, the driver of the sight seeing
automobile that ran down and killed Frank
Lavecohia 6f 284 Mott street at First street
and the Bowery on Monday night, was ar-

before Coroner Acri' yesterday
and held in $10,000 bail pending an inquest.
The oar driven by McFadden was owned
by the Manhattan Auto Car Company,
Coroner Aoritelli tried hard to learn some-
thing about the concern. All the informe-
tion he could elicit was that it waa inoor-
porated with a capital of $1,000 and that its |
directors were B. W. Wrenn, F. DeC. Sul-
livan and Sidnéy Hartehorne. Just who
they were didn't develop.

When the Coroner found he couldn't
get any more information, he said: / “This
corporation has no business to a nine-
teen-year-old boy to drive such an auto-
mobile. I shall hold this man in heavy bail

was given to me for McFadden and I handed
it over to him at once. As,his employers
couldn't give $10,000 bail they wanted ns
to ha¥e at least a good before being

Coroner Aoritelli was sore about the
whole thing. He said it was Kram’s busi-
ness to take his man direct to the Tombs,
