The $250,000 ocean front hospital for chil-
dren suffering from tuberculosis of the
bones and glands will be built; ‘The Asso-
giation for Improving the Condition of the
poor, which has been superintending the
raising of the fund, reported on Saturday
afternoon that $22,000 was still needed to
complete it. John D. Rockefeller gave
4125,000, and other large sums were pledged.
on condit ion that the whoJe should be raised
by June 1. The time limit expired and was
extended to last Saturday. It was ex-
pected that yesterday morning’s mail
would bring in the balance. The contribu-
tlons fell short of the $250,000 by $19
atter William H. Allen, general agent of he
association, had found that the fund was
going to be shy by so large an amount, a
yoice carne over the télephone. The voice
was that of a man and he wanted to know
whether or not the fund had been raised.
He was told of the shortage and he promptly
pledged himself tomakeitup. He requested
that his name should not be mentioned, and
he was put down as “A Reader of Nows-
paper Appeals.”

jhe association announced yesterday

that there were many details to be arranged
before the hospital could be built and put
in running order, After the selection of a
site architects would be invited to offer plans
and bids for the building. Meanwhile the
association will have to support the tem-
orary heen its at Sea Breeze, Coney Island,

issued by the association says that “New

this, it will plead the child’s right to pro-
tection against consumption and hasten

the end which the association seeks.”

~ GOSSIP OF-WALL STREET.

Some hanking Interests took the ground
' yesterday that while a, few stocks had been
put up to absurdly high prices the present
level for some of ‘them ig very low, They
sald, however, that the causes which pre-e
olpitated the decline were still im operation
and that it might be premature to predict
4 change in the general ‘eral tendenoy of prices,

Fairly illustrative of the present temper of
Wall Street was the following reply: made by
& customer of a prominent banking house
when advised by a member of the firm to
buy about ‘10,000 shares of stock: “I would
rather put the money in a trust company at
3 per cent, interest and buy stocks 10 pointe
higher when J felt greater security as to the
stability of prices.”

"I believe prices are going atill lower ‘asa
result of the liquidation in pregress,” ra}
member of a prominent Steck Exchange h o
“but.I would not sell stboke at this level bey
cause the people who are selling are strong
enough to buy their stocks back’ again an
force a quick rally. As long as the liquida
tion continues prices must continue to -fa!
and neither easy money nor reports of
earnings can prevent it, but as soon as that
ceases then shorta shall have to jump.” {

Although" there was no official announces
ment in the course of the seasion of the Stook
Exchange of any engagements of gold for
import, a prominent house received advices
from London that a consignment of £660,000
from Australia had been purohased for New
York, Yhe greater Part of ‘the £1,000,000

 

received in the British metropolis from South

Africa had been taken by the Bank of Eng-
Jand, the remainder going to France.

« Several brokers expressed the ‘opinion that
importations of gold if made on a large scale
might have the effect of inducing a rally and
forcing the shorts to cover, but many others
took the ground that advantage would pgobe
ably be taken of any such favorable ere
for further liquidation by pools and large
speculators.

A great deal of “Yesterday's selling wag,
doye by brokers “aupposed” to represent this,
that or the other long interest, but some
shrewd traders expressed the opinion ‘that
the supp ‘was wrong, arguing that
the large interests were not likely to press
stocks upon the market after a severe dedline
like that ip the last couple of weeks.

One of the traders and a house which often
executes Stand 4 rd Oil orders were the heaviest
sellers of Pennsylvania. In neither case was
the selling accounted good, for, while there
was talk of the closing out of @ long account,
the impression among close observers of the
trading was that the heavy offering of stock
represented a part of the bear campaign,
the orders being placed ina way designed to
conceal their real source.’ A great deal was
made of the reports of delay In the construce
tion of the East River tunnel, and although
in conservative quarters {t was believed that
ourrent stories greatly exaggerated the de-
fects In the work already done still there was
apprehension that the attitude of the labor
unions.might cause considerable delay. The
kind of argument most commonly heard was
that $100,000,000 had already been tied up In

the New York tunnel enterprise fer five years.

and that five or six years more must elapse
before the company could secure any returns
from this investment. This, of course, was
not true as to ite first part, and as for the
second part all that can be said is that’it is
entirely at variance with the rances
given by the engineers and the officials of
the company, And after all these people
probably know more abdut the length of time
which they will require to do their work than
the average man in | Wall Street.

In. view of the scepticism with which ase
surances given by Pennéylvania officials in
regard to the tunnel and by Steel officials in
regard to tlie trade situation have recently

cates, of the policy of publicity have been
‘conipélled to ask themselves “Does it pay?”

On June 7 Reading ¢ eold at 145%. The
stock sold yesterday. as low as 117, a decline
of 28% points in a little more than three weeks,
A house which is not usually among those
most active in the market sold 40,000 shares,
the selling being attributed to a speculative
interest which was prominent in the advance
that culminated last’ mont. The circum.
stance was regarded in some quarters as
@ little suspicious, to say the least of it. There
was too evident a purpose to rivet attention
on the selling, it was contended, and to create
the impression that either from cholce or
nécessity some large interest bed begun to
throw the stock upon the market. Under
the clroumstances it was argued that the
selling had possibly its origin in the desire
of the shortsto give the stock a weak appear-
ance before proceeding to cover seme part
of their lines, If this was thé {Intention it

certainly succeeded, for the stock not only
looked weak but was weak in the afternoon.
Perhaps some of the people who made big
profits on the advance from 40 in the last
three years have recently beer‘ forced to
sacrifice some of thelr paper gains.

An ill timed effort was made by one of
the traders early in the seasion to advance
Colorado Fuel and Iron,
secured, and if there was a short interest in
the stock it showed no uneasiness. While
the buying continued the price advanced,
but just as soon as the trader ceased bidding
the stock reacted to about its old-tevel.

For the first time since the decline began
Southern ‘Pacific showed pronounced weak-

 

‘ness. As it has become reasonably certain

that no dividend wil] be declared on the com-
mon etock this year and that about the only
basis for the advance in.the price 9 sourie
of weeks ago wag the possibility of rights in
connection with the issue of edditional pre-
ferred stook, there has been a good deal of
selling by traders who bought merely on the
theory that the apparent accumulation by
strong interest® presaged some important
development in the company's affairs. Not
a few brokers have argued that the issue of

additional preferred stock would haye the
effect of diminishing: the prospects for divi-
dends on the common and that the value of
rights gould hardly make up.for the loss in
the indefinite postponement of dividend
action. A great deal was said in speculative
quarters as to the effect of the San Franeisco
disaster on the earnings for the coming yéar,
although the situatfon in this respect mat
have been pretty clear to most people for
several weeks past.

 

Anu mber of traders have been using South-
ern Pacific as @ hedge against short sales of
other stocks on the gr ound that if the general
market advanced that ‘stook would probably
be one of the leaders, yielding a profit to off-
sei the possible loss.on the ventures on the
short side. It was even belfeved that South-
ern Pacific might advance while others de-
clined, so that ‘profits might, be made simul-
taneously on. the two slides of the market.

A bull interest of this kind did not.contribute,

to the strength of the stock, but rather in-
vited attaok and made the decline a matter
The selling which precipitated
the break was sq significant that it attracted
a considerable following at once and a num-
ber of traders sold short, although in some
cases these covered later in the day, oausing
the slight rally before the close. :

While {t was known that the statement of
earnings of the Pennsylvania system for
May was ready for publication, there was little
disposition to speculate on the possible show-
ing, andas the traders were intensely bearish
on the market in generat and this stock in
particular, they did not hesitaté to put out
short lines on the heavy selling, which they
said would mean lowe? prices, whether /t rep-
resented sale of long. stock or a continuance
of clique operations for a decline. The fact
that the bear leaders seemed to have every-
thing their own way was all the average
trader wanted, and, seeing the absence of re-
sistance te pressure, it did not take him long
to make up his mind, The stock continued
to disclose weakness to the end of the seasion,
the price dropping down to the lowest ‘level
touched singe 1904.

New low records for the year were made

by the United Gtates Steel stocks on selling
which the traders regarded as very good. The

 

common, however, railied somewhat just scaled au gvamnte ouch Viuiek of WHOLE $178,087.288

No following was _

,

before the end of the day's session, and some
close observers sald there was the appearance
of a legitimate demand for the stook at about

the low figures. One of the reasons given |

for the selling was the possibility of tariff
agitation, but the point was made that, even
should the duty on imports of iron and steel
be lowered, the relations between the Steel
Corporation and the German steel kartel
would be found to be. close enough to save
the home company from any geggressive
invasion of its territory.

Interborough- Metropolitan’ 6 decline was
Partly the result of a rumor that a prominent
banking house would lend financial ald to
the project for the building of a compeing
subway along Third avenue, but the denial
of this report did not bring a rally, and the
Preferred stock dropped to « new low record

Liguldation by life insurance companies
‘was belleved to be in progress in New York
Central, as in a number of other prominent
stocks, but there was also other liquidation
and selling of an entirely different kind,
with the joint result of gending: the price
down to the lowest point struck in two years.
The volume of transactions in the stock was
not very large, but the decline met with
practically no resistance, the larger interests
in-the property apparently adopting the
policy of allowing the stock to seek a level
where it would attract attention from in-
vestors.

Although Hrooklyn Rapid Transit scored
an advance early, on the ground that the
fiscal year just closed was the best in the
company’s history ard that the beginning
of the new year with a record breaking day

gave good promise for the future, the price

however, the undertone seemed to be a little
better than in most other stocks, and it was

THE SUN,

 

 

THE GRAIN MARKETS.

Waser Deotines After Early Advance—Corn
and Oate Lower.

Wheat advanced early, but reacted later.
Yet there wes more or less talk about the
heavy rains inthe winter wheat belt, the mod-
erate aggregate of the world’s exports, es-
pecially from Russia, andreports from Liver-
pool of a good demand for cargoes off coast.
Liverpool was unchanged to ‘4d. higher.
Parisadvanced (c, Antwerp was firm and un-
changed, while Berlin was o. lower to Kc.
higher.

Yet there was nothing stimulating in the
forelgn markets, and deliveries on July con-
tracts in Chicago amounted to 850,000 bush.
—ae large quantity. At Minneapolis the de-
liveries were 1,000,000 bush. There was no
agaresalve speculation for a rise, though com-
mission houses bought the distant months to
some extent. Some had an idea thet the
‘Western rains may interfere with harvesting.
However this may be, it wes not a serious
factor in the trading.

It {s_contended that no harm can have
come from the Western rains, now over,
further than somewhat to delay the market-
ing of the crop.

Later on prices steadied owing to reports
of further rains, Besides, Broomhall cabled
that the Russian Ministry had requested
£10,000,000 to relieve distress in the famine
districts. Onthe other hand, beneficial rains
ocourred in Argentina.

The news thus cut both ways and the swing
of prices was not very decided one way or
the other.

The visible supply decreased 1,017,000
bush., against 1,265,000 in the previous week
and 1,160,000 last year.

A private Argentine despatch said: “Wheat
shipments will be light owing to rains.
Up country produce is coming forward
slowly. Rainfall general and will do much
good, Every Prospect of rain continuing
for some d

LTS eis 4 telegraphed: “Rather too much
rain for spring wheat and some fear of ru

But there tas little attention paid to talk of
damage to the crop inthe Northwest, [t was
noticed, too, that Pouses with Northwestern
connections were selling. Some of the early
