GOSS OF THE RACBTRACK,

GO BETWEEN I8 OFFICIALLY PRO-
NOUNCED A STALLION.

 

 

 @tewards Rake A, Shields Over the Ceals
and Also Question Others Whe Allowed
the Son ef Meddier to Masquerade as
a Gelding --@candalmongers ero Busy.

(Go etween, the winner of the Suburban
andicap, ts a full fledged stallion, ‘This
act was determined yesterday .by three,
veterinary eurgeons, who made a thorough
examination of the son of Meddler—Indigo,
and so reported to the stewards of the Coney
Island Jockey Club. The ‘veta bore out the
positive statement to this effect made the
other day by John E, Madden, whose partner,
¥. Il. Uitchcock, protested Go Hetween's
victory in consequence, ‘Ihe stewards de-
nied this protest’ because of the fact that
in the oiicial entry blank no desgtiption of

Go fetween's sex had been made, but it

secnis that the stawards did not stop there,

for they are now carrrving on a thorough

Investigation. Aleck Shields, the owner of

Go Ketween, was called before them during

the races yesterday and asked to explain

how it was that although he hud had Gio Ite-
tween in his birnm aince last June he had
either concealedthe fact that the son of \ied-
cler was not a gelding as represented or
had been in total ignorance of the facts,

*If Shields did not know that Go Detween

was a gelding,” said a well known horse-

man,
not a fit man to race horses on the Jockey

Club circult,

ty

gelding, he was guilty of Canadian trickery,
which is not relished sin this part of the
country.”

The stewards also questioned Frank Brown
Charles F. Fox and W, A. MoNulty, all of
whom at differcnt times either owned or

trained Go Between and allowed him to
masquerade as a geldiny. Thejveterinarians

who examined (io Between yesterday said

that there could be no room for doubt about

him, that he was a fully developed stallion
and that he had not even been operated
upon. This state of affairs reflects no credit
upon Shields, Brown and MoeNillty.
was simply the owner of tie horse and prob-

ably did not care what he was so long as he’

won. But the others, it is belioved, were
cornizant of the real facts, yet tried to get
@ shade the best of it with the
allowance, If Shields is gnilty
he has kept his secret well, He has refrained

from running Go Between in selling races

this year, however, probably because he
feared ultimate exposure, To John EK, Mad-
den belonga the credit for making this dis-
covery, while the facts, as now disclosed,
@how that Mr, Hitchcock was justified in
filing 4 protest im the interest of clean sport,
and fair play. Just what action the stewards
of the Coney Island Jockey Club will take
remains to be seen, They may refer the

whole gase to the Jockey Club, and it is just
possible that the entry of Go Between will

be refused at all of the Eastern tracks so
long as he remaina the property of Shields.

The tongues of ithe scandalmongera bir 35

wagging vigorously .all the afternoon,
public form James B. Brady's Maxie wit

looked to have a royal chance to win the

pecond race, But for some unknown reason

Curd, who rode the Farandole colt in a shock.
ing manner, While nobody felt inclined to
believe that thereswas anything criminally
wrong in putting up this incompctent boy,
it was declared that the stewards might do

well to insist that Curd should ride the Brady

colt in all of his future races. The public bet
on Maxie Witt just the same and then put up
@ great how! when they saw what @ poor
fun they got for their money.

The defeat of Fountain Blue in the third

yace caused a lot of ugly talk. This colt
@ son of Oddfeliow—Ferro!, had started but
once before,
him heavily and he beat such two-year-olds
as Bat Masterson, George 8S. Davis, Oraculum
and others. He was quoted ata liberal price
In yesterday's race, "ea |
Fountain Blue was
backed off the boards, closing at 7 to 10,
Bewell, a boy who has been severely SBssiane
here this ‘season, had the leg up and as soon
gs the barrier was raised he pulled the colt
up, for what reason nobody would say. But
there was a rumor in the ring that something
‘was wrong. A well known bookmaker, after
“the races, said that, while there might be
nothing. wrong the turf authorities might
do well to examine the sheets of the six mem-
»Dders of the.Mets who are controlled by the
+ Wellg-Adiler-Tilles syndicate.

George Langdon, who won a bunch on

ran and Magna Stella on Saturday, pure

ased the three-year-old filly, Flip Flap,
who won the Advanoce Stakes from Whimsical,
for $16,000 yesterday. Langdon met Jack
Bennet before the races and eaid he wanted
Flip Flap. In addition to the $16,000, Bennet
“will receive half of the money won by Flip
Flap in her remaining engagements this year.

The Western crowd cleaned. up with’ Charley
Ellison’s Lancastrian in the last race. Miller
rode the Kingston colt perfectly, but Leila,
Our Sister and Samson, a}! well backed, were
handled in slovenly style. Our Sister could
not have lost if Knapp had not ridden her all
overthetrack. Little Hennessy rode Samsen
into the ground while Finn kept Leila in a
pocket the greater part of the way.

Sydney Paget and A. J, Joyner decided yes-
terday to retire the mare Tradition to the stud.
Bhe has not done muoh this year and will be
eent to the Haggin breeding establishment at
Elmendorf.

While the public bet on Jaunty in the fifth
race, there was a tremendous plunge on FE. P.
Bradley's itaringo. From 7 to 2 the Orlando

' filly was backed down to 11 to 5 while the f'eld

‘was on the way to the post. Touls Cella tried
to put Miss Strome over, but Jaunty and Miller
‘were too much for her.

Previous winners of the Ejuality were
Dublin, Highlander, Goldsmith, Dolly Spanker
and Hamburg Pelle, who also won the race
last year. Prince Thuron of Taxis, Hungary,
@ well known breeder and ‘horsenian, in-
epected Hamburg Pelle in the paddock before
yesterday's race and pronounced her oné of,
the greatest mares he had ever seen.

The Jockey Club has evidently frowned
tipon the plan to shut down the Salem Pixies
to-morrow, for it was announced yesterd
that the New England Hreeders’ Club Waule
continue the presont mecting up to July v1,
although the overnight purses would be out
in half. Kid Weller, who retur.cd yesterday
from Salem, where he thougiit. he might pick
up some easy money booking, looked blue.

“Somebody tried to bet him a dollar on a
ito 2 shot,” said a wag, “whilo another guy
touched him for $2. Then she took it on the

run for the big tovn.”

Puddin McDaniel became unruly at the nost
fn one of the races yesterday and Starter
Cassidy set him down for the rest of the meet-

HAMBURG BRLLE WINS BASILY |

ORACK MARE TAKES EQUALITY
STAKES FROM HALIFAX.

 

 

Brepzes Heme a Mile in 1:80 1-8—Oliver
Cromwell Graduates at Last —Far West
and Betanist Scere at Long Odds—Lan-
castrian a Winner on Grass Course.

Sydney Paget's great mare Hamburg Belle
made her first appearance of ‘the season
yesterday in the Equality Stakes, one mile,
which she won in a breezing gallop, hanging
Up 4:391-5. She was a prohibitive favorite
at 2\to7, with Halifax, who conceded nineteen
pounds to her, closing at 16 to & Fancy
Bird, an added starter, was put into the race
to cinch third money, as Kiamesha and Tra-
dition were withdrawn. Halifax, with Shaw
up, set @ fast pace for about three-quarters
of a mile. Hamburg Belle was about a
length behind him up to this point, but when
Miller touched the famous mare with his
whip she bounded to the front so easily that
Halifax wae made to look very cheap. The
Belle won by three lengths, Halifax having
two lengths over Fancy Bird.

More than 12,090 persons made the trip to
Sheepshead Bay, where picking winners was
not easy by any means. The biggest upset
occurred in the third event, for two-year-olds,
five and a half furlongs. when Fountain
Blue, a 7 to 10 favorite, did not get any part
of the money. Sewell took the colt up right
