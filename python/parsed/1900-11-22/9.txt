PIANOLA

and the PIANO.

The PIANOLA will enable every owner of a
plano to play upon his instrument whenever he
desires. Notonly this, but every member of
the family can also play upon It-not one or
two piecrs, but practically every com position
ever written for the piano.

The PIANOLA ts the only thing which war
yants the investment in @ plano by nine tenths
of those who own them. At east it's the only
thing which makes @ plano worth a hundred
cents on a dollar.

Perhaps you or your wife or your daughter
“play a litsdle,”’ but the difference between play-
ing 4 little and playing everything you wish ts
considerable. It ts worth thinking about
The PIANOLA supplies the defielency. It
even makes no difference if you do not know
one note from anotier.

The fingers of the PIANOLA rest upon the
plano keys, and strike the notes for you Just
as they are printed on the music sheet.

You eapertence all the pleasure of hand play-
ing. because you control the expression, W bieh
fs the soul of music.

Belore deciding upon the purchase of A
plano, you should bear the PIANOLA, Itison
exhibition atthe warercoms, You may wish
to buy @ PIANOLA and Investiess money than
you originally Intended in the plano itself,
and getthe full benefit of It; or vou may even
wish to rent a plano temporartiy and purchase
the ability to play upon !t anything you desire
whenever your mood calls for it. it would be
at least fudictous to hear the PIANOLA.

Price $250.
