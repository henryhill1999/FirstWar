two pieces, but practically every com position
ever written for the piano.

The PIANOLA ts the only thing which war-
ranis the invesiment in # plano by nine tenths
of those who own them. At least it!s the only
thing which makes @ plano worth a bundred
cents on a dollar.

Perbaps you or your wife or your daughter
“play a litle,” but the difference between play-

ing a little and playing everything you wish ts
considerable.

It ts worth thinking about
The PIANOLA supplies the deficiency. It
even makes no difference if you do not know
one note from anotier.

The fingers of the PIANOLA reat npon the
plano keys, and strike the notes for you Just
as they are printed on the musie sheet.

You experience all the pleasure of hand-play-
ing. because you control the expression, which
1s the soul of musica

Before deciding upon the purchase of &
Plano, you should hear the PIANOLA, [tts on
exhibition at the warercoms, You may wish
to buy a PIANOLA and Investiess money than
you originally Intended tn the plano Itself,
