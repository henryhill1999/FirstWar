to the walls of Hadrian they set alight

a comparatively modern invention, arrived
at independently by many races of men.
In its simplest form it waa a heavy disk
pivoted on a central point to be set going
by hand as the workinan squatted on the
ground; and it may still be seen to-day in

at Damascus and at Syria at a time when
all over Europe crocks of simple red or
drab clay covered with green and yellow
lead glazes were the sole evidence of the

 

 

south of France and even India.

In the meantime the Chinese, the great-
est race of potters that the world has
ever seen, were quietly gathering strength
until from their glazed hard fired pot-
tery there emergedthe marvellous trans-
lucent white porcelain, one of the wonders
of the mediwval world.

With the dawn of the fifteenth century
in all European countries there was rudely
fashioned decorated ware in which can
be traced the slow development of a
native craft from the superposition of
Roman methods on the primitive work
of the peoples. The vessela manufac-
tured were for use and not for show,
and {f glazed at all only with rough, coarse
leati glaze vo.ured yellow or green, in
no case above the level of the workman-
ehip of the travelling brick or tile maker.
The finest expreasién of this native style
is to be found in the Gothic tile pavements
of I'rance, Germany and England, where
all the colors are due to clays and there
is no approach to painting.

greater part of Spain and Sicily, Kgypt

counts among the treasures of the col-
lector and the antiquarian, The potters of
northwest India use to this day a kiln iden-
tical with that depicted in severest outline
on the rock tombs of Thebes, and the skil-
ful Japanese remain content with a kiln
similar to those used by the ancient
Greeks, With the organization of pottery
asa factory industry improved kilns were
produced. 'Thety pe generally in use now is

actically a reverberatory furnace from

height, capable of firing a quantity in one
day that would have formed the output of
a mediwval potter in a year, Experiments

rotate with his feet, thus leaving the pot-
ter's hands free for the manipulation of
the clay.

No further advance was made inthe
wheel until the middle of the seventeenth
century, when the wheel was spun by
means of a cord worked over a pulley,
and thou a steam driven wheel was
introduced with the advent of power
machinery in the middle of the nine-
teenth century this form of wheel still
remains the beat for the production of fine
pottery. All that the potter does when
the clay is soft is to throw it on the wheel
and set it asideto dry. When it has reached
a certain consistency it is carefully re-
centred on the wheel and turned down
to the exact shape and polished to aneven,
smooth surface. Many of the early Greek
vases on close examination show that they
were “thrown” in separate sections, that
ia, different pleces forming the whole were
firat moulded. ‘The finishing caused the
surface to appear even. The Chinese in
many of their forms of pottery adopted
or were originators of the same idea, and
many of their forms have two or three

vortions. In all ages the work of the
crower or presser has been largely eup-
plemented by the modeller, who alters the
shape and applies to if handles, spouts
or other modelled accessories at will, As

FREAKS OF BUILDING. | |

Some of the most curious among freak | ‘
