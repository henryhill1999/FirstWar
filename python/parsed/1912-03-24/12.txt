4 puree of $15,000 was offered by Presi-
dent Gibson of the Fairmont A. ©. yester-
day tor a tea round bout between Packy
MeFarland and Matt Wells, the English
ughtweight champion, This offer was
prompted by the announcement in yester-

roont'’s proposition and will express a will-
ingness to meet Wells at 135 pounds, ecaling
at 3 o'clock in the afternoon, It is possible
that the Madison A. C. and the Empire
4. €. will do some bidding too. Wells has
boxed at the Madison A. ©. and is friendly
foward the managément.

McFariand and Wells would draw
a $25,000 house even at my club,” said Gib-
son yesterday. “They are the best light-
weight boxers in the world and a bout
to settle the question of supremacy would
warrant a bigh seale of prices. McFarland
was ready to box the Englishman when the
latter was here last fall, but for some reason
Wells backed out. The time is ripe for
a settiement, however, and if Wells and his

manager are really anxious for a battle!

with McFarland they can have a $15,000
purse with any reasonable cutup. MeFar-

land, in my opinion, can outpoint Wells |

at 135 pounds at 8 o’clock, which is the
Vnglish champion’s best fighting weight.
Packy has left this matter to me and I'm
ready to sign articles for him at a moment's
notice

Sir Timothy
believe Soldier Kearns, now under the
management of Gil Boag, is a coming white
hope. In fact Hurst says Kearns will develop
into the best white heavyweight in the
world within the next year,

l've seen all kinds of fighters in my time,”
said Hurst yesterday, “but Kearns is the
hardest hitter of them all, not excepting
our old friend Fitzsimmons. Kearns is a
sreenhorp, however, and needs much
instruction If Tommy Ryan or Frank
Urne could take hold of him he would im-
prove a whole lot. There's no doubt about
his gameness and his willingness to go in
and take a chance. It is true that Jim
stewart and Sailor Burke trimmed him
fix months ago, but that” was because
he knew absolutely nothing about the
rules, had no defence and didn’t have

proper training. The wallop is allimportant | ter, tha

bana puneh that can drop anybody if it
lands. When the Soldier runs up against
Gunboat Smith, the Frisco heavyweight,
next month it will be curtains for Smith,
who is too frail in physique to stand up

before the hammering that Kearna is sure
to hand him.

Carl Morris left here yesterday for his
home in Uklahotna to enjoy a month's rest.
He declared that he would return in May
to resume operations in local clubs. °

Because Tom Jones, Ad Wolgast's man-

ager, refused an offer of a $12,400 guar-

will not be allowed to box at Vernon. until
Jones has severed his relations with the
yehtwelght champion. Rivers will not

but will stand by McCarey to the limit
Jones's exorbitant demands have made
Wolgast extremely unpopular with leading
fight promoters.

says Paris agrees with him and hopes to
regain his lost laurels there.

Mike Gibbons made things lively for a
corps of sparring partners at the New Polo

at yemeragy. He is gradually taking
off weight so that he can easily make 145
pounds at 3 o'clock Tuesday afternoon
or his return match with Jack Denning
that evening. Gibbons is supremely con-
fident of victory, although he is aot bragging.
He thinks he can stop Dennine* before the
end of the tenth round. Denning is work-
ing like a beaver in Hoboken and declares
he is in the pink ofcondition. He is boxing
with Joe Jeannette every day and seems
faster than usual, Denning is a first class
boxer but he is not a hard hitter. e
will be excelled in the latter respect by the
St. Paul wizard.

25 out of a possible 25 targets. No shoot

THE SAFEST CAR
FOR FAST DRIVING

Absolutely positive steering. ‘You go where you steer

Absolute security—the greatest factor of safety in
steering gear

Follows the road better than any other car; because
of its correct weight distribution

The most effective brakes. The foot brakes alone will
slide the wheels :

The Packard “Six” will run longer at high speeds over
roads of any kind without mechanical attention than
any other car

Sixty miles an hour in 30 seconds from a standing start

Power without noise and speed without jolt. The
motor runs smoothly at seventy miles an hour

A brute-proof car that over-rides ruts, bumps, grades,
mud and sand. Its stamina exceéds the endurance of
any driver

The most luxurious carriage at any speed, on any road

A demonstration will make you sure in your own
mind of the dominance of the Packard “Six’
