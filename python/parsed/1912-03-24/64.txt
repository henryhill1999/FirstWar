e should be made but for which the |

Horough President, has no jurisdiction
they recommend certain amendment«

the city Charter which would empower

in such matters. The chief sugges-
ne of the report are that Fifth avenue

« considerably widened and thae such
lagislation be had as will permit the regu-
ation by the Borough President of the
heights of buildings fronting on and near
the avenue.

In submitting its report the committee,
consisting of Arnold W. Brunner, Joseph
Ss, Auerbach, Edward Holbrook, George
}. Kunz, Nelson P. Lewis, George T.
Mortimer and Robert Grier Cooke, says

DIGNIFIED STREET

“At the outset it shouid be said that the
problem presents some difficulties
possible of satisfactory solution, for an
avenue which should have been a noble
approach to our finest park and a real
parkway has been permitted so to de-
wenerate that we must abandon, for the
time belng at least, all thought of making
it the counterpart of any of the splendid
avenues of Paris or other great cities
abroad. Yet while the time has gone by
for such a hope we may neverthcless,
under the authority of legislation now
existing and to be enacted, supplemented
by an awakened public sentiment, still
make of Fifth avenue a dignified street;
aud though largely of a coummercial charac-
er, it need not be without impressive
features as it comes to be adorned from
time to time by worthy municipal or pri-
vate buildings. If, however, our indif-
ference to its appearance continues we
may expect that Fifth avenue will cease
to retain even its
prominence but will bee«
cheaper Broadway.”

The first recommendation of the com-
mittee is that the widening of the roud-
way should be continued from Twenty-
third street to Fourteenth street, where
are now found only a few encroachments
and projections not of an important ne-
ture, and the congested condition of the
vehicular traffic demands that the change
be made.

REPLAN MADISON SQUARE

Madison square should be redesigned,
and the Plaza at Fifth avenue, between
Vifty-eighth and Fifty-ninth streets, re-
ceive appropriate rearrangement. Moddi-
son square suggests an entire restudy
with proper borders, entrances and eur-
roundings suitable for the park and for

ts statues,

At the Plaza the lines of traffic for ve-

hicles are confused, and there is much |

wnate space, while the sidewalks are in-
adequate and their omission in places is
an element of danger. The Plaza can be
redesigned on dignified and orderly lines
and space for a cabstand provided without
infavorably affecting its appearance.

Trees should be planted on both sides |

f the avenue, according to the commit-
ideas, from ‘Thirty-ninth street
to Forty-third atreet, also on the Cathedral
hlock between Fiftieth and Fifty-first
streets, where they will have especial
value and appropriateness.

| Primarily Fifth avenue should be pre-
) vented, the committee believes, by a lim-
| jration of the height of abutting buildings.
| from becoming a kind of cation. To pre-
| vent this the committee recommenda that
ithe height of buildings hereafter erected
there be limited to 125 feet, with the priv-
| jlege of two additional stories in a mansard
this regulation to apply to all buildings |
‘on side streets within such distance east
and west of Fifth avenue as may on fur-|
‘ ther investigation be found to be just and |
adequate
The maximum height of buildings which
ithe committee advise to be authorized
would admit, they believe, of successful
commercia! buildsngs, remunerative to the
owners; and placing the two upper stories |
jin the roof would still secure a dignified
avenue that would receive a reasonable
amount of sunlight. Provisions of the Char-
ter make it now possible, by joint action of
lthe Board of Aldermen with the Board of
! Estimate and Apportionment, to limit the
height of buildings; and by act of Legia-
lature the height of apartment houses is
already limited

VYURTHER

RESTRICTION

This limitation of the height of buildings ,
| might ultimately be followed by some;
requirement of uniformity in the sky line |
and perhaps in facades. ‘The report does
| not. however, now ;co to this extent .

To gain this jurisdiction as regards
Fifth avenue the committee fe opoere an
amendment to the Charter providing that
such streets and avenues as both adjoin
and are parallel with Central Park for
such distance as they adjoin the park, and
Fitth avenue from Central Park South to
Washington Square, shall be in charge
and uncer the control of the Board of Esti-
mate and Apportionment and subject to
such general rules and regulations as shall
from time to time be established by the
board, which shall have power to preserve
the taxable valuea of the land adjacent
to ihe streets and avenues and running
back as far as the board may desigmate
within a prescribed area, and of regulating
or restricting the height of buildings
thereon and the uve of such buildings for
bus.ness or advertising purposes

should such a measure be enacted, the
committee recommends a resolution to
be passed at ounce by the Board of Estimate

   

 

limiting the height of buildings to not

jimore than 125 feev except for steeples,
, domes, towers or cupolas for ornamen-

a prescribed distance from them.

vt is further provided that no signs or
advertisements operated or lighted by
electricity or other illuminating power
shall be installed or operated on or ex-
posed to view from the roof of any building
on these streets and avenues,

These changes are thought to be justified
not asa matter having to do with wsthetic
considerations, but as 2 business measure,
favorably affecting the value of land
abutting on Fifth avenue and adjacent
to it for the ultimate benefit of the private
owners, and favorably affecting aa well
the interests of the city by praserving
and increasing the taxable value of prop-
l erty for the public revenues
| SWEAT SHOP NUISANCE

In existing conditions on lower Fifth
avenue the committee sees several matters
which need immediate attention, Of the
sweatshop Nuisance they eay: “The
gathering of factory operatives at the
;noon hour on Fifth avenue, now seen
| daily in its worst aspect between Twenty-
! third street and Fourteenth street, should
}at once be put to an end, If the assembling
which is to be seen every week day be
| permitted to continue and increase, as

it is increasing, the attractive retail shops
j of Fifth avenue must in self-defence go
elsewhere, clubs and hotels in the end
' will follow and a consequent change for
{the worse in the desirability and value of
the property must necessirily result,
| “Then too so-called light manufacture
carried on in these buildings should take
place in safe buildings,and we have had
\submitted to us abundantly satisfactory
levidence that no building above six or
| seven stories in height can safely house
| the operatives necessuirily employed under
jone roof. The appalling loss of life in
ithe recent Washington place fire is an
alarming illustration of the correctness
of this statement, and there are scores
of buildings on and adjacent to Fifth
avenue where a like catastrophe might
easily be experienced.
“Moreover, the erection of these manu-
facturing buildings is to all intents and
surposes a subterfuge, for though termed
lore buildings it is never intended that
}they shall be used as such, As siated,
the local authorities of the city, under its
present charter and without recourse to
the Legislature are empowered to make this
limitation of height at onee, If this were
done the building of additional factories
| would cease on the expensive land abutting
on and adjacent to Fifth avenue,
| “If, however, the citizens of New York
| are not alive to the seriousness of this
question they can at least insist that a
noonday open air recreation space . be |
| Bocwided for these operatives on the
roofs of the loft buildings, or that some |
| Fe them be required to use at that hour
| the neighboring parks, where they will
not wholly obstruct the passage of
pedestrians. If conditions such as exist |
between Twenty-third and Fourteenth
streets are repeated through the length
lof Fifth avenue, as seers likely, the con- |
sequences will be traceable to indifference
Meanwhile, as is sugges ed, until a perma-
inent reform is brought about, a few!
men like those of the tre®fe squad could!
deal effectively with what is a close ap-
| prosen to # public nuisance,”

FIGHT TO PRESERVE —
“INWOOD HILL PARK

Historical Society Will Protest

Borough President's Office Busy Six
Years Mapping Out Section Where _
Hudson-Fulton Park May Be.

 

The American Scenic and Historical
| Preservation Society is priming for @
‘fight to save Inwood Hill, at the upper
end of the city, for park purposes. For the
last six years the city's engineers have been

surveying the hill preliminary to laying
it out with streets. The survey is now
' finished and on Tuesday next the plan,
which has cost about $30,000 to complete,
| will be laid before the Washington Heights
board of improvement, comprising the
Alderman of that district and Borough
President McAneny. If this board ap-
proves the plan it will be presented to
| the Board of Estimate and Apportion-
| ment.

| Itis here that the Scenic and Historica
| Society will make its fight for what it
considera the only virgin land left on
|Manhattan Island. If the plan meeta
| with success it means that the strenuous
| efforta of the American Scenic and Histor-
ical Preservation Society, and at least a
dozen other societies and civic bodies
which have been trying for years to get
| the city fathers to buy this tract of about
105 acres, have been wasted.

WANT HILL PRESERVED.

So far they have met with little or no .
succes4, and these public spirited citizens
are now bending every effort and bring-

i all the influence they can muster to

 

have the street opening plan, which they
consider sacrilegious, voted down for
good and all. An officer of the American
Scenic and Historical Preservation So-
clety said yesterday that the hill should
be preserved and that the people of New
York would see that it was preserved if
they only knew what they were losing.

Inwood Hill is ideally located for @

| park. It rises from Dyckman street
| toward the Spuyten Duyvil Creek to an
' altitude of 217 feet above the surrounding
| territory. This plateau, or giant rock,
,the last on Manhattan Island, is about
3,600 feet long and 1,250 feet wide. From
the crown of, the hill is afforded a view of
Tthe udson and of the Palisades that can
be had from no other point on Manhattan.
The rock extends out into the river
and from this point a view of the river
can be had almost to the gate of the
Highlands. From the north the rock
looks like Sugar Loaf Mountain near
| West Point. It ia rounded and its sides

| located 895 feet north of Westchester are covered with a heavy growth of trees

it in its plan for a Hudson-Fulton momoria’

time the property could have been bought
