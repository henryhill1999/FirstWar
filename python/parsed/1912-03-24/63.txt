HITALIANS ARE PROSPEROUS

|They Are Rapidly Climbing Up the
| Rungs of the Ladder of Socitl

| and Industrial Suecess.

 

One by one the nationalities of the Old
World come knocking at the door of the
New. They pass in, form for atime a dis-
} trict seetion apart from the common
American life and (hen blend into the com-
posite. Each gives its portion toward
making what sociologists term a distinct
American type. ‘Thus came the Irish aud
the Germans. As a separate part of
this country's life they have passed, and
80 is passing the Italian.

Italians have learned their worth to
the new country, labor employers say.
They aro no longer willing to work at!
anything and at any wage. The more

In other words the Italian is merging |

ship which he once held.

Three million Itallans have come to

and agricultural pursuits. How they
' have succeeded is shown by the pages of
@ special directory which has been pub-
lished in the interests of italian com-
meroe. It carries a# list of 120,000 names
and shows that in New York Italians have
‘jnvested $110,000,000 in . business with
$50,000,000 in State savings banks. The
| benetit they bring to this country, those
acquainted with Itallan affairs state,
is not alone in the work they do but in,
the commerce their being here encourages.
Enormous imports of raw chemicals,
fruits, groceries, olive oil and works of
art are directly traceable to Italian wants.

Their prosperity in the country dis-
|tricts where they have settled has re-

ceived wide publicity. Italians now have
successful market gardens in the suburbs
of all the large cities and they have|
flourishing colonies scattered over the |
jcountry. Taken by States Alabama has
| Daphne, a colony founded in 1890 with an
| Italian population of 250, and Lambert,
| where Tyroleans grow grapes. Arkansas
\is noted among Italians for Tontitown,
| where Italians have increased the pro-
| ductivity of land until it has advanced |
from $15 an acre in 1898 to $125 an acre
‘now. California has no large Italian
jcolonies, but Italians are to be found
there io prosperous groups. They grow
grapes, peaches and vegetables fof all
| sorte: In Colorado Denver has a flourish-
ling Italian colony and Italians have
many successful farms at Pueblo. In,
| Connecticut many of the abandoned
| farms have been taken over by Italians
and an estimate of 600 Italians is given
}for that State. Delaware has many

| Italians in Louisiana have many

where in small groups. One hundred

grow fruit, vegetables and cotton. Inde-
| pendence has its colony of 1,100 Sicillans
‘founded about 1885. Land brought orig-
inally from $2 to $5. Its value is now

from $20 to $100. Strawberries are grown ,

In North Carolina there are several
Italian colonies. Those at St. Helena
and Valdese are very prosperous. In
Ohio one finds many Italians in the wine
growing district by Lake Erie. Pennsyl-
vania, Rhode Island and South Carolina
have many colonies. This ,enumeration
was made by an authority on immigration
and is considered far too conservative |
in its estimates. Many colonies which '
were new were omitted, Italian authori-
' ties say, because the man who compiled
the list did not believe they were sufli-
ciently established.
