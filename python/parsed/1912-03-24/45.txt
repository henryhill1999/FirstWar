of the women who were sisters of the stu-
dents, but had not themselves gone to
college. The American college mother
averages a larger number of children
than either.

In an average population the number
of boys born is slightly in excess of the
number of girls. The children of college
women are just as obedient to this biolog-
ical tendency as though their mothers had
not learned their Greek verbs and conic
rections. Thus in the seminary group
50.4 per cent. of the children were boys
} and 49.6 girls, and the children of mothers

who were graduated from college from
1890 to 1899 were 52.55 per cent. boys and
47.44 per cent. girls.

College education may be said to reauit
in wage earning in the majority of in-
stances, and marriage is usually preceded
by a period of economio independence.
Who will not say that this experience
may help win for her the economio in-
dependence after marriage so important
in the eyes of many for the dignity and
success of motherhood?

Although the college woman may now
be found doing the world’s work in many
vocations, the day ts yet to come when

when women will speak as frankly about
their salaries as men. Great reluctance

occupation. It will not cause surprise
that teaching rbs the largest number
~—75 per cent. of the first and 82 per cent.
of the second decade. Since, however,
occupations other than teaching for the
most part cannot be entered without
preparation, it isto be assumed that the
percentage of those in other ocoupations
in the second decade will increase wheh
tinte enough has elapsed to permit them
jto qualify. The recently established

tions other than teaching.

CONJUGAL CONDITION, OF 1,749 COLLEGE
Many of the teaching salaries range
‘from $600 to $700. Occupations other
than teaching range slightly higher, and
among them were to be found the highest
of all.

“The most impressive fact,” says Prof.
Hewes, “brought out by this tabulation
is the low average earning power of
the college graduate. Whatever indirect
value her services may bring the com-
munity, the economic return which is
hers is frequently insufficiont during her
short occupational life to pay the cost of
her training.

“Questions naturally arise as to whether
the training is itself defective from this
point of view, what effect upon her work-

{ing efficiency the low salary may have,
jand what individual and what social gain

might come from a redirection of her
