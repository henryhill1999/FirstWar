J’ever stop to think how many separate and distinct enterprises there are that contribute
to the efficiency of moden railroading—signal systems, air brakes, rail joints, alloy steels, and
so on?

Yes, the railroad is the focusing point of a thousand ideas conceived to make the pace faster,
to get more tonnage over the line on time and to make travel safer and more comfortable.

Electric Light was recognized as the Logical Light for railway trains with the advent
of the Incandescent Lamp, but how to supply the steady current which the lamp required was a
problem worthy the metal of American enginéers.

An analysis of railroad conditions showed that the only system which could survive for gen-
eral application would have to eliminate the charging of storage batteries at terminal sta-
tions and the making of special connections with specially equipped locomotives.
Phe solution is the U. 8. Axle Lighting Equipment, progressively developed from the be-
| ginning of electric car lighting and which makes each car a self-contained unit power plant with

the power derived solely from the excursions of the car itself. This equipment comprises

lst. The U. S. Bliss System Axle Generator, belt driven from an axle of the
car and operative at all s s above 15 miles an hour to supply current for all lamps and at the
same time to charge the Storage Battery.

2nd. The U. S, National Storage Battery with sufficient
over” the lighting current during all slow speed and stand-still intervals.

8rd. The U. S. Bliss System Regulating Apparatus to take care automati-
cally of all shifts of duty between Generator and Storage Battery, and regardless of speed con-
ditions to deliver a steady current to the lamps.

No innovation is generally adopted by the railroads until it has shown its worth under severe
test. However, every invention that is a real help to better railroading is welcomed. Already
over 4000 U. 8. Azle Equipments have been placed in service.

The manufacture of U, 8. Axle Lighting Equipments is a thoroughly organized and grow-
ing business employing a trained force of workmen in the splendid plant at Niagara Falls.

The U. S. National Storage Battery which is a part of every U. S. Axle Equipment is
also variously modified for every purpose to which a storage battery may be applied, for example,
the lighting of Country Homes, Automobiles and Motor Boats, Power for Eleciric Vehicles, Trucks,
Telephone and Telegraph Service and Stand-by Service in connection with Power Stations.
