O'Neil asserfs that Gibbons was in the
hallway of the apartment house and
helped Jacobs assault him. Acting Cap-
tain McCloskey says Jacobs has madea
clean breast of the whole matter, telling
the police that for weeks he and Gibbons
have been robbing apartment houses
every Saturday afternoon and dividing
the loot. Gibbons denies that he and
Jacohs have been doing any such thing
; , and declares that both Jacobs and O'Neil
are mistaken when they say he was in the
Washington avenue house yesterday.

Because of the frequent robberies
recently in that part of the borough

These rugs have long been a feature of the Vantine store—rugs of standard Persian and
