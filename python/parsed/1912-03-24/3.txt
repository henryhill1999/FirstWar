OPPOSITION TO ROOSEVELT

‘Republican: Leaders Organize to Secure
the Renomination of the
President.

 

San Franxcrsco, March 23.—Backed |
iby the business interests of the State |
President Taft, it is predicted by political
observers! will defeat Col. Roosevelt at |
the coming primary election on May 14
and secure the California delegation to
the Chicago convention. Had the primary ,
been held two weeks ago, Roosevelt might |
‘have carried the State by a large ma-!

jority. |

With the support of Gov. Johnson!

¢and the political organization he led to)

victory in the last State election, the)
Colonel at the opening of the primary
campaign seemed a likely winner. At
first it seemed that the State machine, |
which the Governor has carefully, built |

up, could be used to advantage in the |

present contest. Roosevelt was personally |

‘popular in California, although he had |
alienated many of his admirers by his |
action in the Japanese school question |
‘during his last year in the White House.

_ Not long after the Colonel's announce- |
ment that ‘he would’ accept the namina- !
tion if it were tendered to him and before |
Gov. Johnson opened the “Roosevelt
‘eampaign, a decided change took place.
From aj] parts of the State came an- |
nouncéments hy men who had supported

‘Johnson in his State campaign that they
could not follow him in his advocacy
‘of the nomination of Roosevelt for a
third term The  Lincotn;Roose velt |
League, the title under which Gov. John-
son's supporters were organized, made |
an attempt ta hold,its members, in line
for the primary, lection, but from “all

‘parts of the. State. came resignations

‘of leading members. "

The league was organized for the def-
inite purpose of breaking the power of

_ the so-called Republican machine of the
State which had been controlled by cer-
tain corporate intérésts*and. it aéeéom-
plished its purpose. Buty as soon as its
work was done, the ‘organization fell
apart and the attempt of the Governor
to use it im the interests of Roosevelt
disclosed the fact that there was noth-
ing left of the league but the name.

The Taft leaders then began a system-
atic campaign about the end of February
to place California in the Taft column at |
the Chicago convention? Cof.Charles M-
Hammond, a leader of the up-country |
Republicans, was among the first to de-
clare himself in favor of the renomination
of the President. He declared that a
refusal to nominate Taft would bé suicidal
on the part of the Republicana.

With Hammond as chairman ‘a meeting

, Was held in this city which was attended

t by practically all the Republican veterans

of the northern part of the:State, At

this meeting the Taft Progressive Répub-
lican League was formed. ‘The list of

* memb ers of this league reads like a direc-
tory of Republican leaders. It contains
the names of the editors of three of the
four Kepublican papers of this city and
scores of the men who made possible the
election of Goy. d;Johnson, The general
sentiment Was:

“We will snow the Governor that he
does not carry the progressive vote of
California in his vest pocket.”

The platform alopted by the Taft Re-
publicans declared for the renomination
of the President because he was, elected
a8 @ progressive to carry olit the policies
of Tris predecessor and because he “has

rexercised all the powers of his office to
fulfff the obligations implied by hissne-
cession to Mr. Roosevelt.” It praised
the President's attitude on the tariff

question, and declared that “there is a
strong tendency to civert the Republican
marty from iis fundamental principles,
put we believé that the welfare Of the
United States will be best promoted ty
adherencé 10 thé ‘pélicies of the party
under which the country has always pros-
pered.” It alsovasserted that the prob-
ability of the election of Taft was stronger
than that of any other candidate.

Foll6wing the organization of the Taft
league here, breaches were formed in
Los Angeles, Stoexton, Fresno and scores
ef other cities and towns throughout
the State. [t is planned to extend the
League to every county and township.

It is Kignificant thay although the State
offices are filled to a great extent by men
who were elected on the.ticket with Gov
Johnson they:are not inelined to get into
the fight, for ,Rogsevelt. On the other

‘hand, the. Federal ‘officers throughout
the State, althourh harred from offensive
partisanship, are almost uniformly at
work in behalf of the President r

The Columbus speech of Roosevelt
caused many of the former supporters
of the Colonel to declare their allegiance

President Connolly then outlined the
misfortunes of the suburbanite who has
yielded to the temptation of “having a
home of his own.” After getting this
‘home on a mortgage he said, somebody
comes along with a petition for an im-
provement, which is promptly signed, and
4n a-short time the new- householder has
to pay an improvement tax that forces

‘and in many .cases to lose the property
altogether. |
Queens is in need of another law, Presi-
|dent Connolly added, to compel all im- |
| provements tq be in accordance with the |
| topographical map that is now being pre-
pared, thereby eliminating the dangers of |
a future promiscuous city such as older |
New York below Canal street. The work
| on-this map is gigan tic, he said, and plans |
are being made to map out the entire
county in the same manner. Sixty per
' cent of the borough has already been |
| map out tentative ly and 388 per cent
fina The, entire borgugh will be com. §
