ENGLISH VERSION BY HERMAN BERNSTEIN,

 

1,

Yakov Saranin was a little below the
average in stature; his wife, Aglaya,
ho was of the merchant class, was tall
and stout. Even now, during the first
year of their married life, the twenty-
year-old woman was 80 corpulent that

peside her thin, little husband she looked

vught Yakov.

He thought of this even though he
had married her for love—love for her
and her dowry.

th

lhe difference in size of the couple
often evoked funny remarks among their
‘ acquaintances, These jests poisoned the
peace of Saranin’s mind and amused his
wife Aglaya

One evening after a visit to some of
his colleagues, among whom he was
compelled to listen to numerous caustio

remarks, Saranin returned home upset
and disturbed.

While going to bed he grumbled and
picked a quarrel with his wife. Aglaya
answered lazily and unwillingly in a
gleepy voice.

“What can Ido? It isn't my fault.”

She was of a very peaceful and calm
turn of mind.

Saranin grumbled: “Don't eat eo much
meat. Don't eat so much mealy stuff.
You are chewing candy all day long.”

“I can't get along without food if I
have a good appetite,” said Aglaya.
*Before I was married I had a still better
appetite.”

“I can imagine!
an ox at a time?”

“It is impossible to eat an ox at a time?”
retorted Aglaya calmly.

She soon fell asleep, but Saranin could
not sleep on that autumn night. He
tossed about from side to side for a long
time

When a Russian cannot sleep he thinks.
And Saranin gave himself to this ocou-
pation to which he had so rarely given
He was a functionary,
ao he had little to think about.

"There must be some _ remedies,”
thought Saranin. “Science is daily mak-

street he could sell it stealthily. Perhaps

He who needs such a remedy will not

Having given himself to such thoughts,
faranin dressed very quickly, mutter-
ing under his breath: |

“At 12 o'clock at night——”

He did not wake his wife. He knew

y’ that she slept soundly.

A the soul of an enterprising and free sports- | gay?" he asked irresolutely.

“Like a woman of the merchant class,”
he said aloud. “Like a peasant woman,”
he thought.

Having dressed himeelf he walked out
into the street. He was not at all sleepy.
He was in high spirits and he felt like an
adventurer just before some new and
interesting experience.

The peaceful functionary who had |
passed quietly and colorlessly a third of a
century suddenly felt within himeelf

man in a wild desert, a hero of Cooper or
Marne Reid.

But having walked a little distance in
his usual direction—toward his office—
he paused thoughtfully. Where should
he go, he asked himself. All was quiet,
80 quiet that the street appeared like the
corridor of a huge building, safe, pro-
tected against anything unusual and un-
expected. The janitors were slumber-
ing in front of the gates of the buildings
where they were employed. At-the street
crossing he noticed a policeman. The
lamps were burning. The sidewalks and
the pavements faintly reflected the lights
in the moisture after the rain.

Saranin thought a while, then in silent
perplexity he went straight ahead, then
turned to his right.

II.

At the crossing of two streets he saw a
man walking toward him and his heart
contractedjwith a joyous presentiment.

It was a strange figure. The man wore
a coat of bright colors, with a wide belt.
His cap waa tall, sharp pointed, with

# black designa upon it. His beard, long
and narrow, was saffron colored. His
white teeth were shining. His black eyes
were burning. He wore slippers on his
fart

“An Armenian!® thought Saranin for
Bome reason

The Armenian walked over to him and

“What are you looking fer at night,
my 6ou1? You had better go to sleep, or
4re you Jooking for amusement? If you
wish T will escort you.”

y@ “No,” replied Saranin.

Then he unburdened his grief trust-
ingly to the Armenian.

The Armenian showed his teeth and

“The wife is big and the husband little
—f he wants to kiss her he must get up
ona ladder! Oh, that is no good.”

“Of course it isn't.”

“Follow me, I will help a good man.”

They walked a long time through the

w*yOrridorlike streeta, the Armenian in
front, Saranin behind him.

As they walked from one lamp post to
the other there was a strange trans-
formation in the Armenian. In the dark
he increased in stature and the further
he went away from the lamp the larger
he grew. Sometimes it seemed as though
the point of his cap rose above the roofs
of the houses, to the clouded sky. Then
48 he approached a light he grew ever
smaller; Near the lamp he assumed his
former proportions and looked like

™ an ordinary Armenian merchant. And,

»ftrange to say, Saranin was not surprised
4t this. He was in such a trusting mood
‘hat the most extraordinary wonders

*rperiences of his gray everyday life.

They stopped in front of @ house, an

ber of the house distinctly.
noticed it. It was 41.

They entered the yard. Then they
walked up to the wing of the house in
the rear. It was half dark on the stairway,
but a faint light fell on the door near which
the Armenian stoppedjand Saranin no-
ticed the number—it was 43.

The Armenian put his hand into his
pocket, drew out a little bell and rang it.
The little bell tinkled with a silvery
sound.

The door opened immediately. In the
doorway stood a barefooted boy, hand-
some, swarthy, with very bright lips.
His white teeth were shining because
he was smiling, half joyously, half sneer-
ingly. And it seemed that he must be
smiling all the time. There was a greenish
fire in the boy’s eyes. He was supple,
like a cat, and uncertain, like the phantom
of a quiet nightmare. Dread fell upon
Saranin.

They entered. The boy closed the door
and walked in front of them along the
corridor, carrying a lantern in his hand.
He opened another door and again Saranin
noticed his uncertain movements and his
laugh.

It was a terrible, dark, narrow room,
the walls of which were covered with
Closets; there were all kinds of bottles
upon the shelves. And there was a strange,
irritating and unfamiliar odor.

The Armenian lit a lamp, opened a
closet, looked for something there and
took out a vial containing some greenish
liquid,

“Good drops,” he said; “if you give her
one drop in a glass of water she will fall
asleep quietly and will never wake up.”

“Oh, no; I don’t need that,” said Sar-
anin, vexed. “Is this what I have come
here for?”

“My dear,” sald the Armenian In a
convincing tone of voice, “you will take
another wife according to your height;
it is the simplest matter.”

*I don’t want it!” shouted Saranin.

“Well, don’t shout,” the Armenian
checked him. “Why should you be angry,
my dear? You are only wasting your
health. If you don’t need it you needn't
take it. I will give you other drops. But
these are expensive, very expensive.”

The Armenian sat down on the floor
and took out a square botcle. A trans-
parent liquid was shining in it. The Ar-
menian said softly, with a mysterious air:

“If yon take one drop you lose one
pound. If you drink forty drops you lose
forty pounds of weight. A drop, a pound.
A drop, a ruble. Count the drops and
give me the rubles.”

Saranin brightened up with joy.

“How many do I need®” thought Sar-
anin. “She surely weighs more than two
hundred pounds. If her weight could be
reduced about a hundred and twenty
pounds she would be small. That would
be fine.”

“Let me have 120 drops,” he said.

The Armenian shook his head.

“You want too much, you will regret it.”

Saranin flared up:

“That is my affair.”

The Armenian looked at him search-
ingly.

“Count your money.”

Saranin took out his pocketbook.

“I must add some to the money I have
won to-night,” thought Saranin.

The Armenian took out a bottle and
began to pour the liquid into it drop by
drop.

Saranin was suddenly seized with doubt:
120 rubles is a large sum. What if
the Armenian cheated him?

“Are you sure they work just as you

Saranin

“We sell our goods honestly,” sald the
Armenian. “I will show you the effect
of the stuff at once. Gaspar!” he cried,

The barefooted boy came in. He had
on a red jacket and short blue trousers
His swarthy logs were uncovered up to
the knees. His legs were well shaped,
pretty and they moved quickly and grace-
fully.

The Armenian motioned. Gaspar re-
moved his clothes quickly and walked over
to the table.

The candles cast a dim light upon his
yellow body, which was well formed,
strong and handsome. There was an
obedient, vicious amile on his face. The
light fell on his dark eyes and on the
blue rings around his eyes.

The Armenian said:

“If you take the drops pure, they work
at once. If you put them into wine or
water, they work slowly, 80 you could not
notice at once. If you don't atir them
well, you will reduce your weight in
leaps and bounds, and not very nicely.”

He k a narrow glass, poured some
of the liquid into it and gave it to Gaspar.
Gaspar drank the liquid with the air of a
spoiled child drinking some sweet stuff;
he threw his head back and licked the last
sweet drops with his long sharp pointed
tongue and immediately he began to grow
smaller, before Saranin's very eyes. He
stood straight, looked at Saranin, laughed
and kept undergoing changes like a rubber
doll which shrinks when the air is squeezed
out of it.

The Armenian took him by the elbow
and placed him on the table. The boy
was the size of a candle, He danced and
twitched.

“What will become of him now?* asked
Baranin,

“We'll make him grow again, my dear,”
replied the Armenian.

He opened the closet and took from the
upper shelf a vessel of peculiar shape. It
contained a green liquid. The Armenian
poured out some of it into a little glass
the size of a thimble and handed it to
Gaspar.

Gaspar drank it, just as he drank the
other liquid.

Steadily, just as water fills a bathtub,
the boy kept growing bigger and bigger.
Finally he assumed his former propor-
tions.

The Armenian said:

“Drink it with wine, with water, with
milk, with anything you like, but don’t
drink it with Russian older—you will lose
your color.”

TIL,

Several days elapsed.

Saranin was radiant with joy. He
smiled mysteriously.

He was waiting for an opportunity,
Finally it came,

Agiaya was complaining of a headache.

“I have a remedy,” said Saranin, "It
helps wonderfully.”

“No remedies will help me,” sald Aglaya

“Very well, give It to me.”

He brought the little bottle,

“Nasty stuff?” asked Aglaya.

“It tastes fine, and helps wonderfully.
It works as a mild physic.”

Aglaya made a slight grimace,

“Drink it, drink it.”

“Can I take it with Madeira?

“Certainly.”

“You must also drink some Madeira
with me,” said Aglaya capriciously.

Saranin filled two glasses and poured

the liquid into his wife's glass,

“I feel somewhat chilly,” sald Aglaya
“Could you bring me

Saranin ran for the shawl. When he

came back, the glasses stood as before,

Aglaya sat smiling.

“Take it! Take it!”

“What is it?” asked Saranin.

*I've changed the glasses. You drank
the medicine, not I.”

He shuddered and turned pale.

“What have you done?” he cried
despair.

Aglaya laughed. Her laughter seemed
to Saranin hideous and cruel.

Suddenly he recalled that the Armenian
had a restorer. He ran off to the Arme-

And he began to ory.

The janitor looked at him with oom-
passion. Then he said:

“Don't worry like that, sir. If you
really need that Armenian so badly go
abroad yourself and you will find his
address at the passport office there.”

Saranin did not realize the absurdity
of the janitor’s suggestion. He was
overjoyed.

He ran home at once, rushed up the
stairs like a hurricane and asked his own
janitor to get for him a foreign passport
without delay.

“But where shall I go?” he asked him-
self.

IV.

But misfortune befell Saranin again.

There was a lock on the door where
the Armenian lived. Saranin in despair
clutched at the bell. He was animated by
a wild hope. He rang the bell desper-
ately.

Beyond the door the bell rang loudly,
distinctly and clearly, as bells ring only
in empty housea,

Saranin rushed to the janitor. He
was pale, Little dropa of perspiration
like dewdrops on a cold rock appeared
upon his face, especially on his nose,

He rushed violently into the janitor's
room and cried:

“Where is Khalatyantz?"

The head janitor, an apathetic, black
bearded peasant, was drinking tea out of a
saucer. He looked at Saranin askance,
hen he asked calmly:

“What do you want of him?"

Saranin stared at the janitor stupidly
and did not know what to say.

“If you have any dealings with him,”
said the janitor, looking at Saranin eus-
piciously, “you had better go away. See
that you don't get yourself into trouble, for
he is an Armenian.” 4

“But where is the accursed Armenian?”
cried Saranin in despair. “The Armenian
of No, 43?”

“There is no Armenian here now,” re-
plied the janitor. “There was one, I will
not deny it, but there is no Armenian
here now.”

“But where is he?”

“He has left the country.”

“Where did he go?” cried Saranin,

“Who knows?” replied the janitor
indifferently. “He got his foreign pass-
port and went abroad,”

Saranin turned still paler,

“Understand me,” he said in a trem-

!cealed contempt.

Then she grew angry.

she said. “Have I married such a lili-

It was soon necessary to make new
clothes for Saranin; all his old clothes}
were falling down; his trousers reached
up to his ears and his high hat fell to his
shoulders, |

And he ate ever less and less,

And the servants and the tailors and

dealings began to treat him with ill con-

him the malicious laughter of the door-

Saranin went through many bitter
experiences, He lost his wedding ring.
His wife made a scene for him, She wrote
to her parents in Moscow,

“The accursed Armenian!” thought |
Saranin.

He often recalled that the Armenian,
while counting the drops, had poured in
too many.

“Oh!” Saranin had exclaimed,

“That's nothing, my dear, that was
my fault, and I will not charge you for
these extra drops,” the Armenian had
replied,

still a faint hope that his superior oficer
might offer him some flattering com-
mission because of his special size, that
he might commission him to go to the
world exposition or on some secret mis-
sion. But this hope vanished at the very
first sounds of the sour voice of the di- |
rector of the department. |

“Be seated,” said the director, pointing |
at a chair, |

Saranin somehow managed to sit down |
on the chair. ‘The director looked an-
grily at the functionary's legs, which were |
dangling in the air, Then he asked:

“Mr. Saranin, do you know the regula-
tions concerning the civil service?”

“Yes, exactly ——"

“But this misfortune is not due to any
fault of mine.”

“I cannot judge to what an extent this
strange and improper affair is a mis-
fortune to you, and to what extent you
are to blame for it, but I must tell you
that to me, as the head of this depart-
ment, your remarkable diminution is
becoming positively scandalous, There
are all sorts of rumors spreading about
town, I cannot judge whether they are

justifiable, but I know that these rumors
explain your attitude in connection with
the agitation in favor of Armenian separa-
tism. You will agree with me that the
department cannot be turned into a place
for the development of Armenian intrigues
directed toward diminishing the Russian
Empire. We cannot keep any officials
who behave so strangely.”

Saranin jumped down from his chair,
trembling and screaming: “It ts a freak
of nature, your Honor.”

“It is strange, but the service

And again he asked the same question:

“Why have you done it?”

“Your Honor, I don't know {t myself.
I don't know how it happened.”

“What instincte! Availing yourself of
the smaliness of your size you may hide
yourself behind any petticoat. This can-

not be tolerated.”
“I have never done it,” whined Saranin.

But the director did not listen to him.

He continued:
“I have even been told that you have

done this out of sympathy for the Japa-
nese. But you must know that there isa
limit to everything.”

“What éan I do, your Honor?”

“I don’t know. But I ask you to stop
this. I can retain you in the employ of
the Government, but only in the provinces,
and you must stop this immediately,
you must return to your former propor-
tions. I give you a four months leave

VII.

Soon Aglaya's parents arrived. It
was after dinner, At the dinner table
Aglaya had been making sport of her
husband. Then she went to her room,

He went to his study timidly—the room
was s0 enormous now—he climbed up
on the divan, nestled up in a corner and
began to cry. He was tormented with
painful perplexity.

Why had such a misfortune befallen
him? It was so terrible and so unheard
of! He sobbed and whispered in despair:

“Why, oh, why have I done it?”

Suddenly he heard familiar voices in
the corridor. He trembled with fear.
Ho stealthily walked over to the wash-

| stand on tiptoe to wash his eyes so that

they could not notice his tears. But it
was hard for him to wash his eyes-—-he
had to get up on a chair,

The guests came into the parlor. Sara-
He bowed to them and
squeaked something indistinct. Aglaya's
father looked at him with wide open
eyes in dismay. He was big, stout, with
an oxlike neck and a red face. Aglaya
resembled him,

He stood in front of his son-in-law, his
fect outstretched; he looked around

“As for | cautiously, took Saranin by the hand care-

fully, bent down to him and said, lowering
his voice:

“We have come to see you, son-in-law.”

It was evident that he intended to act
diplomatically. He was sounding the
situation, Aglaya's mother, a thin but
angry woman, appeared from behind her
husband. She screamed in a shrill voice:

“Where is he? Where? Show him to
me, Aglaya; show me the pigmy.”

She looked above Saranin's head, as
though she did not notice him, The
flowers on her hat quivered strangely,

  
   
  
   

  

  

She walked straight in the direction of
Saranin. He screamed and jumped aside,

Aglaya began to cry and said: “Here he
is, mother dear.”

“Here I am, mother dear,” equeaked
Saranin, and made a bow.

“Scoundrel, what have you done to.
yourself? Why have you made yourself
60 small?”

The chambermald laughed.

“You had better stop laughing at your
master,” the mother said.

Aglaya tyuyned red.

“Mother dear, come into the drawing
room.”

“No. You had better tell me, you scoun-
dre], why have you made yourself so
email! ?*

“Well, you had better wait a while,” the
father stopped her.

She then attacked her husband.

“I told you not to give her in marriage
to a beardiess youth. Now it has turned
out as I predicted.”

The father looked at Saranin cautiously
and tried to turn the conversation to
Politics.

“The Japanese,” he sald, “are com-
paratively ema!) sized, but they are evi-
dently an intelligent nation and also a
skilful nation.”

 

VI.

And Saranin became a very tiny man.
Now he oould easily walk under the table.:
And he was growing smaller from day to’
day. He did not avail himself of his
leave of absence. He simply did not go
to his office. They had not yet decided
where to go.

Aglaya now laughed at him, now ariled,
as she said: “Where can I take a man
like that? It's a shame and a disgrace.*

To pase from his study to the dining’
room was now a trip of considerable
length to him. And then the task of
climbing on the chair. 7

But his fatigue pleased him. It {m-’
proved his appetite and with {t came the
hope of growing up again. Saranin ate
ravenously. He devoured much food
in proportion to his miniature measure-
ments. But he did not grow bigger.
On the contrary, he was getting ever
smaller and smaller.

Aglaya thought of passing him off as
a boy and sending him to the gymnasium.
She took him to the nearest achool. But
her conversation with the director of the
schoo] discouraged her. He demanded
documents. Her plan could not be car-
ried out.

The director said to Aglaya with an air
of extreme perplexity:

*We cannot admit a man of the rank of
Aulio Councillor. How are we to treat
him? The teacher may tell him to stand
in the corner, and he may say: ‘I am a
Cavalier of St. Anna.’ That would be very
embarrassing.”

Aglaya tried to persuade him to change
his decision.

“Is there no way of arranging the thing
somehow? He will not dare to be impu-
dent. I will see to that myself.”

The director remained inexorable.

“No,” he said stubbornly. “We cannot
admit any otionartes to the gymna-
sium. There is not a single circular
that permite this. And it is entirely im-
proper to approach the authorities with
such a proposition. How will they look
upon it? There may be many disagree-
able things as a result of this. No, I
cannot do it. Go to the curator of the
school, if you like.”

But Aglaya abandoned the plan; she
did not go to the higher authorities,

 

rm.

One day a young man came up to Arc-
laya. He was very carefully dressed
and his hair was shining. He bowed
very gallantly and introduced himself:

*I am a representative of the firm
of Strigal & Co. It is a first class store
in the oentre of the most aristocratic
neighborhood. We have customers
among the best and highest society.”

Aglaya looked pleasantly at the repree
sentative of the well known firm. With
a languid movement of her stout hand
she pointed at a chair. She sat down
with her back to the light. Then she
bent her head to one side and was ready
to listen.

The young man continued:

“We have learned that your husband
has preferred an original, miniature
stature. That is why this firm, which
is a leader of the latest fashions in clothes
for men and women, has the honor to offer,
madam, to make clothes for your hus-
band as an advertisement, free of charge;
in accordance’ with the latest Parisian
styles.”

“Free of charge?” asked Aglaya lazily.

“Not only free of charge, madam; we
are even ready to pay you, but upon one
small and easy condition.”

In the meantime Saranin, having
heard that they were talking about him,
came into his drawing room. He walked
around near the young man with the
smooth hair. He coughed and stamped
his heels against the floor. He was very
angry because the representative of
the firm of Strigal & Co. did not pay the

Aglaya laughed malignantly.

“Very well. At least I will not have to
look at him all the time.”

in a shrill voice. “I cannot accept this,
I am an Aulic Councillor and a Cavalier.
To sit in the window of a store as an ad-
vertisement—that is too funny.”

“Keep quiet,” shouted Aglaya.
not asking you.”

“What do you mean by not asking me?”
whined Saranin. “How long am I to

dox people and Lutherans from Riga in

“I don't want to aft in the window!”
shouted Saranin.

He stamped his feet. Aglaya seized
