HUSBAND JACKSON ,

Benjamin F. Jackson, the Bronx real ea-
tate doaler who shot and fatally wounded
J. Henry Lavelle, a well to do builder, tn
the vestibule of the Jackson home at 1229
Simpson street Friday night, was ad- |
mitted to bail in the sum of $10,090 yes-
terday hy Coroner Shongut, before whom
he was arraigned on a charge of homicide
Mr. Lavelle died early yesterday morn-
ing in Fordham Hospital and when Jack-
son was brought before Magistrate Cot-
rigan in the Morrisania police court after
having speft the night in the Tremont
avenue police station the Magistrate im-
mediately remanded him for a hearing
before the Coroner.

Testimony of witnesses before the
Coroner and admissions by ‘members of
Lavelle's family led the police to think
that he had been drinking before he went
to Jackson's house. Mra. Mariha La
haney, the sisier of Lavelle whom he went
to seek at (he Jackson home, and Mra.
Minnie Coryell, another sisier, both told
the Coroner they had heard their brother
threaren to kill Jackson. Ocher wit
nesses testified that there was a struggle
between the two men in the yestibul»
and Jackson hiinsell displayed a torn
collar to show where the man he shot
had grabbed him. There were no marks
on his throat or face

Mrs. Lahaney appeared before Coroner
Shongut with Edward Jackson, the eight-
year-old son of the real estate dealer
She said «he stood ac the end of ihe hall
when Jackson went to the door in re-
sponse to Lavelle’sring. She heard Jack-
son ask her brother to go away and heard
her brother reply that he would crush
his skull in before he went. She said
she then saw his right hand reach for Mr.
Jackson and him by the throat.
She saw Jackson whirl back, grab a re-
volver trom a hatrack and then struggle
into the vestibule again with her brother.

Mrs. Minnie Coryell of 1414 Vyse avenue,
ao older sister of Mr. Lavelle and Mrs
Lahaney, said that her brother was at
her home, where their mother lives, in
the afternoon and that he had been drink-
ing

“there has been a diference of opinion
among members of the family,” she said,
“as to Mrs. Lahagey's remaining at the
Jaekson home.” She said her brother
told her he would “kill the dirty Jew”
one of these days. Lavelle left her home,
the said, early in the afternoon. He did
not come home for dinner, and neighbors
of Mr Jackson say they saw him walk-
ing up and down in front of the house
in the late ufternoon

Edward Jackson and Mrs. Kate MeCal-
lum, the latter the janitress at 1229 Simp-
son street, were other witnesses before
the Coroner. ‘The boy said he heard Mr
Lavelle threaten to_take the top of his
father’s head off Mrs. McCallum said
she was passing the house at the time,
heard the altercation and distinctly heard
Lavelle say he would break the other's
skull She got frightened, she said, when
she heard the shots and ran away. A
negro who formerly worked for Lavell
testified he hed heard him make threats
on Jackson's life

Coroner Shongut
an inquest

BselZU

said he would hold
later and that meanwhile he
would fix bail for Jackson at $10,000, The
bond was signed by James W. Rooney
of 1245 Simpson street, who offered a
piece of property in Westchester Square
worth $50,000

Mrs. Lavelle was prostrated at her
home, 916 East 176th street, when she
heard of the death of her hushand

Through a friend she guve out a state-
ment of the causes of the shooting. Since
Mrs. Lahaney and her husband separated
three vears ago, she said, Mr. Lavelle
had been anxious to bring alyout a recon-
iation. In this he was followed by
Lahaney himself, who a year and a half
ogo began to court his wife for the second

 

time They went to the theatre together,
and he wads very attentive. Things ap-
peared to he progressing satisfactorily

when in July of last year Mrs, Lahaney de-
ided to take @ position in the siokent
home She declered she would remain
despite the protests of her husband and
brother

Finally Lahaney brought suit for $50,000
damiges against Jackson for alienating
th® affectidns of his wife) This suit was
to have been tried this week and Mra
Lavelle thinks it caused her husband to
worry a great deal

Jackson had a chance to tell his side!
of the case while getting something to
eat vesterday morning. He said that
Mrs Lahaney had heen governess for his
vounger children In reply to @ question
he ssid thet if was not true that Mrs
Tahaney's son, Thomas had been sent
to a Jewish institution, byt that he is now
na Catholic school

Lavelle came to his home shortly after
9 o'elock Friday night and said he wanted
to talk to his sister Jackson said he told
him to go away, but that Lavelle got his
foot in the door jamb and tried to push
mn He said he held the door as near shut
ae he cauld with his own foot, but that
when Lavelle grabbed him by the throat
1@ was pished into the hall. He said he
seized the revolver from the hatrack
and that he couldn't remember clearly
what happened after that. When he saw
that Lavelle was wounded seriously he
said he called back to Mrs. Lahaney to
get a doctor

A fact on which the police are centring
a good deal of attention is that Dr. Jones
of Fordhom Hospital discovered that
Havelle's right hand. with which he is
said by Jackson and Mrs. Lahaney to
have seized the real estate dealer, was in
hie trousers pocket when he was shot
One bullet went through the pocket and
into the hand, took an upward course
and lodged in the forearm. The bullets
that caused his death entered Lavelle's
forehead

Mr. Lavelle was prosperous as a builder
and probably was worth $500,000. He had
two sons, Finbar, 24 years old, and Tracy,
18 years old, and a daughter, Mildred,
who is 14 vears

WE certainly have a most interesting value-giving story to
tell vou about high class importations at the lowest
prices New York has ever known.

Just imagine yourself in one of the finest specialty shops
in Paris and privileged to select anything you desire at
almost half price and bring it to America without paying any
duty.

That's the story abridged to a concrete fact, because this
occasion gives you this season’s importations at about half’ Paris
prices

Behind all unusual trade transactions that enable a store
to present exclusive new importations at about half price, there

is a valid reason. ‘

POLICE SAID TO HINDER

 

He Will
Now Investigate Killing
Independently.

Assistant District Attorney Sifong

he didn't think of | said yesterday morning at the close of | yrapy:5 Catholic Cathedral in this city |

{the hearing before Coroner Holtzhauser
linto the death of Waverley Carter, a
| negro who was shot in a raid on a saloon

when he reached his home two miles at 2199 Fifth avenue on the night of | formation reaching

!March 14, that he had received no help
‘from the police in his efforts to find out
| who had done the killing and that the
police had in fact been rather a hindrance

}to conduct the investigation without
| asking the police again for assistance,
|and that his work would be entirely in-,
|dependent of them. He added that he
would not confide to them what he suc-
ceeded in finding out without their help.
The police report of Carter's death stated
{that he was shot by an “unknown colored

man.”
Three negroes testified yesterday
against Charles B. Plitt, a stool pigeon
in the employ of the Police Department,
|who was arrested on Friday charged
with the shooting of Carter. One of these
was Harry Kelly, a cook who had charge
of the free lunch counter in the negro
saloon, When the investigation was
taken up by the District Attorney's office
| after the police had failed to act Assistant
' District Attorney Strong was informed
| by the detectives that the man who knew
all about the shooting was Kelly, but that
they couldn't find him. Mr. Strong put
two process servers on the case. These
oung men had little trouble in finding

elly.
| Kelly testified before the Coroner ae
\terday that he was on the ground floor
Lof the saloon. The raiding party and the
| other negroes in the place were then down-
/stairs in the basement, where was a sort
‘of danoe hall. Carter and another negro
lcame in and Carter started downstairs
Some one downstairs shouted up to Kelly
‘to “tell that nigger to come upstairs,”
| apparently with the idea of not confusing
} him with those found in the place. Kelly
‘went to the head of the stairs and called
‘to Carter. The latter turned and started
{to return, As he did so, Kelly says, Plitt
stepped to the foot of the stairs and called
jout “Halt!” Carter stopped and turned
laround, Kelly testified that Plitt then
fired at Carter and Carter staggered
toward Kelly and fell.

Robert M. Moore, attorney for Plitt,
asked Kelly if he had not told the detect-
ives that the man who shot Carter was
of medium height and with very light
hair. Plitt is short and has black hair
and a dark complexion. Kelly denied
made such @ statement.

Fred Lowry, another negro who works
| in the place, said that he was at the bottom
‘of the atairs and heard some one comin

down, One of the raiding party callec
“Halt!” and then, before there was
ime for the man on the stairs to answer,
litt took out a revolver and fired, Lowry
twenty feet from
Carter at the time. Robert Campbell,
a third colored employee of the saloon,
said that after Plitt had fited one of the
detectives said to Ptitt, “You ought not
to have done that; you'll get in a hell
| of a lot of trouble.”

Detectives Thomas A. ‘Thompson and
Charles 8. Ryan, who had charge of the
investigation for the police, said that
! they had seen Kelly and he had described

the man who did the shooting as of medium
build and very light complexion, Ryan
| said wlso that he saw Carter in the hospital

NEW Or. ans, March 23.-—If the Missis-

the levee and settled down in New Orleans
it could not. have made the city much
wetter than it is to-night and seemingly
could not have caused much more general
disturbance.

The trouble Was caused by a rain, one
of the heaviest on record here, which

| still is falling to-night.

Starting at 5 o'clock Friday afternoon,
the storm by 5 o'clock this afternoon bad

poured a trifle over seven inches of water |
upon the town, and there was every indi- |

cation that this figure would be much
higher by morning. From 5 o'clock last

| night to 5 o'clock this morning 4.22 inches
| of rain fell.

pushed the lake water up into the bayous

Several smal!
bridges were swept away and the well
known shell road is dotted with big holes
which will make automobiling for the
next two weeks a hazardous sport.

It was a clammy, sticky rain, the tem-
perature ali,the time being well above 7
degrees. Harbingers of spring in the
shape of s\raw hats and not a few linen
suits went into oblivion or the laundry
and any sort of coat so long as it kept ou
rain was popular.

According to the local weather burea:
if the rain keeps up at its present rate
until 5 o'clock Sunday morning it wil!
set a new record here for thirty-six hours

In the meantime the rains have not
served to allay the fears of plantation
owners above and below the city, who se
the possibility always present of a break
the levees, although the flood stage

cccasion any immediate danger.
