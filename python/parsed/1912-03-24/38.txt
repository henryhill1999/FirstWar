-.No-Rim-Cut ‘Tir
10” Oversize’
At No Extra Price

These patented tires used to cost one-fifth more
than other standard tires.

They were immensely economical then.

But the demand has grown until these tires out-
sell all other tires. Our multiplied output has cut
the cost of production.

Now they cost no more than tires that rim-cut,
tires not oversize.

Save 48 Per Cent

No-Rim-Cut tires has multiplied
six times over.

And these tires outsell any
other tire.

Tires which won so many will
win you also when you try them
out.

We Control Them

With such a demand for tires
that can't rim-cut other makere
must attempt them, too.

But the feature which makes
this type practical is controlled
by the Goodyear patents,

Other devices won't do, for
reasons explained in our Tire
Book.

That is why this demand so
largely. centers on, Goodyear No
Rim-Cut, tires. ‘When you come
to this new type don't get the
wrong tire.

(joopFYEAR

, The result 4s No-Rim-Cut Tires |
With or Without Non-Skid Treads

With old-type tires, statistics
show that 23 per cent of all
ruined tires are rim-cut.

No-Rim-Cut tires save that 23
per cent, plus a large amount of
worry. or these tires never
rim-caut,

These tires are also 10 per
cent over the rated size, That
means 10 per cent more air—10
per cent added carrying capac-
ity. And that, with the aver-
age car, adds 25 per cent to
the tire mileage. :

Thus these two savings, under

average conditions, cut tire bills
tight intwo. Tens of thousands

of users have proved that.

Model 60

The Lowest Priced 35-Horsepower

o-Passenger Touring Car on the Market |

T last we can guarantee immediate
delivery on our Model 60—the $1200
touring car that is the equal of any

$1500 car, of any other make, on the market.

Ever since last July, we have been
working tooth and endeavoring to
supply the heavy demand. It was utterly
impossible to fill the great volume of
“‘rush” orders that kept pouring in, yet
for months we shipped on the average of
one hundred cars a day. The steady in-
flux of orders was perpetual.

The dealers and public alike, from one
end of the country to the other, tried every
conceivable means to force extra orders
through our great Toledo factories. They
burned the telegraph and telephone wires
in a frantic effort to urge and press rush
orders.

Now the situation is changed.

The thousands of our anxious friends
who have had a “60” on order for two
months or more and waited patiently, can
have their car at once,

And this is due to our greatly increased
plants.

We can now turn out 150 cars a day.
In January our mammoth new {factories
were completed and after two solid months
of night and day work we are pleased
and relieved to announce the arrival of a
complete line of “Sixty’s’’ in this city.

And no wonder the public is scram-
‘bling for this car. Nothing in the history
of this business has ever equaled it. Of
all the exceptional Overland values, that
you have been accustomed to, this one has
proven the most conspicuous.

Think of it!

A thirty-five horsepower five-passen-
ger touring car for $1200. This és the lowest
priced thirty-five horsepower touring car in the
world. Part for part—point for point—it is
the equal of any $1500 car made. It has the
power—the speed—the comfort—the ap-
pearance—and the construction. Take the
powerful motor—the strong and rugged
rear system—the Vanadium steel gears—
the fine bearings—the pressed stecl frame
—the drop forged axles—the big tires—the
superb body work—the high grade uphol-
stery; in fact, take every item that goes
into the makeup of this automobile and you
will find the duplicate of this car cannot be
had below the fifteen hundred dollar mark.

Here is a car with a powerful, silent,
smooth-running thirty-five horsepower mo-
tor. Here is a car that seats five large pas-
sengers comfortably, The upholstery is of

ood leather, hand stuffed with fine hair.

he body is finished in our famous dark
Overland blue and the wheels in battleship
gray. The transmission is of the selective

, three speeds and reverse—fitted with

Y

used on the most expensive cars in the
world. The frame is of pressed steel and
has a single drop. The crank and gear
casings are of aluminum. The front axle
is a one piece, drop forged I section fitted
with the famous Timken bearings. The
tires are 34x4—quick detachable. The
handsome massive lamps are finished in
solid black with brilliant heavy brass trim-
mings. Self starter $20 extra.

The Overland center control is the one
proven and practical location for both
operating levers. The method enables
you to operate the levers with the left hand
and gives you free use of your right hand
for driving. It gives you the use of the
right hand fore door, as well as the left hand
fore door, which is impossible if a lever is

laced one side or the other. You can get
in or out on either side. It is easy to han-
die—no stretching out or reaching. Any
one can manipulate the levers without a
particle of effort.

Take the specifications of this $1200 car
—compare them with any $1500 car you
know of and the only difference you will
be able to find is the difference in price,

Why pay an additional $300 for a
purely imaginary value ?

_ Our dealer (name and address below)
will give you a thorough demonstration
