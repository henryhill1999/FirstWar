A Leader That Leads

In everything that helps you get the greatest possible value and enjoyment in
motoring, the Winton Company and the Winton Six lead.

The first company in the world to make Sixes exclusively was the Winton Co.
That was in 1907. Now everybody admits the Six to excel all other types.

The Winton Six has had a self-cranking motor for four years. Most makers
are just beginning to realize that cranking is disagreeable and dangerous.

The Winton Six has always had its gasoline | The Winton Six is the only car in the world
