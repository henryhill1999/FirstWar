M. Paul Poiret’s master mind.

The material is a very dark blue French
serge, trimmed with copper color Faille
Francaise silk, and lined to match. &

The coat is Russian style, double- breatsed
and slightly cutaway. It is bordered all
‘round with a half-inch band of the copper
silk, fastens with a double row of brass ball
buttons, and gathers under a wide, patent
leather belt with brass clasp. *w-»

The skirt hangs straight, from a raised
belt of copper and blue, which loops at the
back to conceal gathers. A wide band of
the copper silk trims hem.

In addition, porch rockers and chairs in all sizes; substantial
wood frames with double cane seat and back.

Some of the new shapes are unique. Almost every other couch, chair or
ane has some quaint point of difference from another either in the shape or
inish,

The variety in our cretonne lined lamps, for instance, is astonishing, as
there are something like 50 or 60 different kinds, many of which are not
yet to be found in any other store. ‘

These lamps come in different heights, suitable for floor or table, and
are either for oil or electric light. The effect of the cretonne over light is
indescribably beautiful.
ab Our willow pedestals for flower pots or urns are also in large varieties.

@ da Any of this furniture will be stained as desired. Can be
WB stained in almost any color and the cost is very slight.

Our suits for young men are actually young men's suits, and not the Ordinary suits for men in
smaller sizes. The patterns are jauntier and the cut a trifle more extreme than the suits for older
men. We show below four of our most popular models. Macy caters especially to the young men.
Our selection in models for the young man is as complete as the average clothing store selection for
any man. Four complete different models to choose from, each with a different lapel shape. Every
man can find lapel shapes that will best frame his face. These four models for youths and men of,

youthful build.
Sizes from 31 to 36 — Prices from $9.75 to $22.50

These two in combination explain the difference between
“¢ Macy’s prices for selected Oriental Rugs and else-
where, often fer vareties which we should feel to reject.
We took from our stock a number of the finest specimens and reduced them to prices which are
less than what one usually has to pay for very inferior grades.
_ The carpets are the best of their kind, being strictly all wool and vegetable dyed, thus insuring
lasting color. These Rugs must not be confused with India Rugs, as those are inferior both in grade
