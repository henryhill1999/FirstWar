Hotel, which occupies the block front

"he express companies which now oc-
mpy the Central's property along the
east side of the avenue from Forty-sixth
to Forty-sighth street will soon move to

*ightly buildings the railroad will erect
tail etructures similar to those already
built on the Lexington avenue side of
the new terminal

i their plans for the Hotel Biltmore
there has been a great demand for prop-
erty adjacent to this site and it is known
‘hat as high as $8,090 a front foot has
been offered and refused for a lot on Mud-

FRONT FOOT VALUES. |
In the neighborhood of Forty-ninth |
street property is held at $5,000 a front
foot, and north of Fiftieth street $4,000
isasked. A slight increase is noticeable |
in the blocks from Fifty-seventh to Six-
tieth etreets, and north of this for a mile |
or more property is held at about $3,000
a front foot. !
The changing of Madison avenue from |

VALUE OF MEADOW LAND.

New Jersey Marshes Appraised in Suit
in Newark Court.

An interesting prophecy as to the
| future development and value of the
| large area of half submerged land con-
stituting the Newark meadows . was
| made by Martin L. Gardner, a civil engi-
|Meer attached to the real estate depart-
;ment of the Pennsylvania Railroad on
‘the witness stand last week. In the
|Easex County Circuit Court in Newark
there is now under way a legal contest
| to determine the present value of a
| portion of this meadow land between
| the city of Newark and former United
States Senator James Smith, Jr.
| Mr. Smith owns about 125 acres of this
, meadow land, his holdings being located
| within what is known as the “ship canal
zone.” This is a stretch of the meadows
4,000 feet in width extending from the
Newark Bay back to the upland.

The Smith acres were appraised by two
real estate men employed by the city
as being worth about $41,000. Mr. Smith
put a tentative value of $100,000 on the
