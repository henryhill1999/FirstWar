pants, March 14.—There are two ways
@o do Paris, the second being to leave

sur wife at home.

nd her two daughters in a nice large
hotel off the Boulevard, one vast third
floor front room with double and single

evening, electric light, elevator and ser-

persons really do prefer the slow passage
in these days of wireless apparatus and
populous sea lanes.

Ouf! I once went second class on an
oopan greyhound, having been persuaded
by some ignoramus that, once at sea,
[ could make excellent arrangements
with the purser to transfer me. Error.
Day after day it was always the same
prioe to change. I stuck it out; but
nothing is more galling than that gate
on the promenade deck which says, “Thus
far shalt thou go and no farther.”

You know about the Peri? The latter
was diaconsolate at the gate. So wae I.
Beyond, superior beings strolled along
an interminable vista of coool and shady
deck. Charming women olled back
in their chairs. On my afde of that gate
there was a emall equare of awning,
then a wide space where the gun beat
down cruelly and the propeller churned
j hite foam.

; At all hours first class passengers came
hurrying through that gateway, glancing
curiously, contemptuously at me, like
ja pariah dog. In the eye of one fair
} girl I thought that I detected noble pity,
|timid, fluttering, hastening, but tender.
'Bless her! In effect, she hurried with
the others in rapturous freedom to my

The Duval restaurants are tourists’
standbys. In the narrow gamut of their

portions are small, and the menu is art-

steak costs 12 cents, and a little dish of
peas coste the same. A ham or tomato

cents; but a bunch of white grapes, in

beat the system, etrange as it seemed
to him.

And when he caught three tens before
the draw on Long Mike's next deal he
made his raise $50 and waited to see if

| To his great satisfaction the pile was
again shoved into the pot before the big
man had troubled to look at his cards,
and he had little hesitanoy in calling for
all he had left, which was nearly but not

“Gimme two,” he sald, and Long Mike
dealt them to him. He looked eagerly
and found a pair of jacks.

But Long Mike was in no hurry. He
looked at his hand for a long time before
deciding. linally he laid kis cards down
face up. There was a pair of kings and
a@ four flush.

“Oi'm thinkin’,” he said, “whether to

One-Eye when it seemed certain that Long

DRESS OF JAPANESE BRIDES.

White Worn for Part of the Ceremony,
but for a Strange Beason.

Brides in Japan follow the same custom
whioh prevails in the Western world, that
of wearing white at the wedding ce
at least during a part of it. But the signifi-
cance attached to the choice of this color
is quite different on the two aides of the
world.
