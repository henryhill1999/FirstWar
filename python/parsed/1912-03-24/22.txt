CROCODILE CATCHING IN BORNEO

Superstitious Natives Kill the Creatures
Only in Spirit of Revenge.
From Chambera's Journal.

It is a common sight in Borneo to see a
large crocodile sunning himself on the
muddy bank of a river. He takes no notice
of the natives even though they pass quite

 

 

at Hurtig & Seamon's Musto Hall this} Dear him. So common indeed is the sight
week. “The Flirting Widow" 1s the title| that the Dyaks themselves pay no heed

Cut Chapel in a Body as a Rebuke to the |

Paculty.

Those who managed to get their degrees |
in the old days will tell you that college
isn't what it used to be, that all the under-
graduates nowadays are well behaved
and never think of doing such things as
hazing, painting statues of philanthro-
pista on the campus and hoisting the
farmers’ cows into the church steeple,

But let these old grads take heart, for |

all spirit has not died within the hearts of
the college boys in spite of the tremen-

dous pressure which is being brought |

to bear upon them, Up in Amherst col-

lege the undergraduates have only this |

month asserted their independence by
pulling off a stunt which might be called
daring even by a strict constructionist.
Their act was performed in a spirit of

revenge against the faculty, who on Janu- |

ery 12 of this year arranged an exhibi-
tion of swimming and diving in Pratt
Natatorium by Rose Pitonof and refused
to admit the students to it.

A few of the students heard what was
going to be doing in the tank with only
the members of the faculty and their
friends to see and they tried to peek in,
but were discovered and hustled off by
attendants who were guarding the gym-
nasium, On the morning after the exhi-
bition the .imherst Student came out
with a picture of the diver in her profes-
sional bathing suit and only then did the
college body realize what it had been
deprived of.

Ever since then, it seems, the fires
of resentment have been smouldering
in the breasts of the Amherst students.
Agitators insinuated themselves among
the student body and on March 8, after
midyear exams had been done away with,
the thing happened.

Amherst is one of the very few colleges
where attendance at morning prayers

North Carolina Rabbit | Catching Scheme.

From the Siler City Grit.

There is always something new under
the sun. The latest scheme or invention
to catch rabbits has just reached us and it
occurred during the last snow near Siler
City. A man of this township went hunting
the day after the snow and coming to a

piece of new ground found literally hundreds
Bf tracks. There were dozens of brush
piles in the field and the tracks, of course,
all led to those piles.

A bright idea was suggested to this hunter
and he at once went home, secured a seining
net and returned to the field ready for
business. The long seine was placed ae
a pile end the rabbits shooed out,

o {Re time he had visited fifteen piles fe had

more rabbits than he could carry and there
had to discontinue his wholesale efforts,
