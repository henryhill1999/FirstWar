ORIGIN OF THE INDUSTRY

English Grocers Began It Years Ago
in Their Efforts to Make
Goods Attractive.

 

clerk or the baker senda his goods to the
purchaser they are wrapped up in a paper
or card box. This card box as soon as the
contents are taken out is in nine casea
out of ten thrown away or consigned
to a shelf for future use. The box or bag
is of no further interest except possibly
to lighta fire. The grocer or the dry goods
store clerk is not much interested in the
box. All that he knows or cares to know
is that the box or bag is more or less
indispensable to his business and that the
firm has a certain price to pay for it.
Yet the history of the paper box or bag
is the history of one of the big industries
of the country. Its mode of manufacture
is interesting. The money spent on patents
and special machinery in one year would
easily run a Presidential campaign.
Years ago the grocers of England used
to wrap goods purchased of them in paper.
One day one of the grocers decided that
the paper was clumsy, although they had
reduced the wrapping of it around a
parcel to a fine art, and sought for means
whereby he could make his package
of tea or sugar attractive to the customer.
He folded the paper in various ways
80 as to form a receptacle for the goods.
First he cut the paper in rectangular
form, overlapping till the ends met and
| pasted together two of them. This bag was
found to be useful for all sinall articles,
but as soon as anything heavy was placed
in it the bag burst. Then the grocer
doubled the bottom of the bag, finding
that most of the weight was there. This,
however, made the bottom too etrong
and the sides too weak. By this time
other grocers and small venders had got
hold of the idea and several brains were
brought into contact with the bag ques-
tion. Various methods of folding paper
| bags came into existence and the enormous

| When the grocer or the dry goods store

demand for them throughout the country
caused the paper mills to look into the
question. The era of paper bag and box
manufacturing then started.

Every mill that handled or manufac-
tured the coarse heavy papers turned
its attention to bag making. Patents
were taken out thick and fast. Mills began
to give up manufacturing paper alone
and took up bag making as their main
product. With the rapid growth of the Uni-
ted States and the native inventive genius
of the people machinery was requisitioned
into the ari of paper bag and box making .

Nowadays there are hundreds of fac-
tories from coast to coast whose sole

product is either paper bags or boxes | cut up into suitable lengths by a big cir- | dential contests which awe

HOW PAPER IS MADE.

 

| Development of the Industry Since Wood

Pulp Was First Used in 1870.

would be hard to imagine a New
York or any other modern community
getting along without paper. The paper
makers say it could not be done, and
when any one starta to count up the
many purposes to which paper is applied |
it seems that the paper men are right. |
We should have a hard time to get along
without the product of the pulp mills.
For one thing, and perhaps the thing
we should miss most, there would be no
printing unless the presses could be
adapted to impressing the type on bolts
of calico. The knowledge of steel and
electricity which is passed on from year
to year would degenerate into gossip.

The real development in the printing
business began when the machine made
paper was brought out. In the early
days, when all paper was made by hand,
five to ten reams a day were considered
a fair showing for one mill. The first
paper mill in the United States turned
but hand made paper, the mill having
been started at Troy in 1704. This mill,
as well as the other pioneer mills, used
rag pulp. Then in 1817 the first steam
pulp mill was established at Pittsburg.
The Fourdrinier brothers had invented
@ paper making machine in 1800, and
within a few years other materials besides
Tage were utilized in making paper.

Pulp made from straw made ite ap-
pearance in 1857, coming from a factory
at Fort Edward, N. Y., and by the time
the oivil war began the newspapers
were using this paper in such quantities
that the price went up from $6 to $20 a
ton. This straw paper was of a poor
quality, brittle and hard on the type.
During the war the demand for news
of the exciting events of the day made
the demand for newspapers heavy, and
as early as 1861 the American paper mills
were turning out more paper than were
those of Great Britain and France.

The first wood pulp paper made its ap-
pearance in 1870. Ite merits were not ap-

eciated at first, but when the makers had
earned to strengthen and improve it in
various ways, the call for wood paper
increaseirapidly. Ninety-nine per cent. of
the paper used to-day is made from wood

ulp and all the grades are represented
om the cheapest up to the finest kinds
of calendered paper for artistic printing.

The wood pulp industry begins in the
wilderness, Btarting with the cutting
down of the tall trees, the paper industry
has some atmosphere of romance. When
the hardy lumberman has brought the
tree down and lopped off its branches,
the boss of the camp exercises his inge-
nuity to get the logs to market. Ad-
vantage is taken of natural cy leading
to the nearby streams, and the logs are
shot down these slopes to the water. If
there are no slopes handy, rude railways
must be devised. Once in the stream,
the “drive” begins. The logs frequently |
form jams in the stream, and then one
of the lumbermen must walk over the
floating trunks, find the one that forms
the key to the jam, and cut it away. When
the jam begins to yield it is time for the
lumberman to make a quick getaway,
for his life hangs in the balance. A mis-
step means a plunge down among the
rushing logs.and in the grinding, crushing
mass the lumberman would never have
a chance of escape.

When a large piece of water is reached
the logs can made up into rafts and
towed to the mill. At the mill they are |

 

cent store editions.

A Few Large Concerns Handle the Year's ~_

Output of Lyries—Most Profit
in Cheap Editions.

The publishing of sheet music, like every
other form of business which relies mostly
upon the theatrical profession for its
existence, is confined mostly to New York
city and its immediate vicinity. A child
of no definite parentage, it haa grown
within a decade to one of the most lucra-
tive branches of the vast enterprise
that cater to the amusement of the
pleasure seeking public. From a few
meagre lofts on Twenty-eighth street,
the former “Melody Lane,” it haa, under
the guidance of business men, become
4 substantial foundation for the building
of beautiful buildings in one of the richest
realty sections of the city.

There are hundreds of publishers in
New York, but the few large or national |
concerns may be counted upon one's
fingers. These few have their main
offices or headquarters close to Broadway
and may all be found within a radius of
several blocks of Forty-second sireet
As in every other business, there are
various branches in the publishing of
sheet music. There are the high class
editions, comprising operatic scores,
symphonies and the works of the masters.
Then the publication of comic opera,
musical comedy and the semi-classical
scores, and finally the million odd copies
annually of the popular or five and ten
This latter, although
the most humble of all, is really the most
pretentious from a profit standpoint
Although sold on a small margin of profit
to permit the retailer to sell it for ten)
centa, the volume of business which erma-
nates from one hit song mounts high into
the thousands of dollars.

There is a certain amount of glamour
or fascination about the composition of
&@ popular melody, the sight of one’s name
on the cover of the music, and more than
all the possible royalties.

“In hardly any other business,” said a
publisher, “are the returns so great for
the minimum amount of energy expended.

WEW YORK CITY,

The paper box factory of John ©
Schmieder, located at No, 892-304 West
Broadway, is one of the oldest Industries
of Its kind doing business tn the City or
New York, having been estabiisned tu
1855 by Martin Frelsem at No, 107 Fulton
Street, between Willlam and Nassau,

The paper box industry was then tn its
infancy and machinery for the manu-
facture of boxes Was unknown, The
Work was all accomplished by band and
the approximate production of this fac-
tory Was originally 200 boxes per day,
During recent yoars the demand for paper
boxes has grown 50 enormously, and i
Schmieder has met with such steadily
Increasing success, Wat he now occuples
the entire of two large structures at the
above address, This factory is thor.
oughly equipped with the most improved,
modern and up-to-date machinery, with

day, einploying ont

ut in squaring machines | mesh to permit the water to drain off

fluence of the “barker” at the same time.
The “barker” is a machine with rotating
blades that gnaws off the bark and makes |
\@ frightful noise over it, too It is said |
by people who have heard this voracious
| machine screaming over its food that it
makes the worst noise that ever assaulted
human ears. The saws are not far behind
in this Wagnerian concatenation,

Except for use in the higher grade of
papers the cut up lo are next ground
up in grinding machines. The best pulp
is produced by a chemical process that
does not break up the fibres as the grind-
ing machines do. Paper machines have

One is the dry end and the
The pulp enters Via the
wet end, where it passes through a screen
and flows along like thin milk. The
standard width of the wet machine is
seventy-two inches. In one form of
machine the puip flows along on an end-

without losing any of the pulp. The
water mark is produced by the wire, and
the arrangement of the wires at what ia
called the dandy roll serves to determine
whether the paper is to be laid or wove.
While the thin stream of pulp is travelling
along on the wire cloth it is mechanically
shaken sideways so that the fibres of the
pulp cross each other at all sorts of angles
to give strength to the paper,

After the pulp has passed through sev-
era] kinds of rolls it passes on to anend-
less wet felt apron and 60 goes along to
the pressure rollers. These rollers press
out nearly all of the water left in the pulp
after straining on the wire cloth, and here
the pulp takes on the character of paper
and is able to continue through all the
other rollers without the blanket sup-
port. It passes between the drying and
calendering rolls, some of which are
heated to remove the last bit of dampness,
As it comes out of the machine in its fin-
ished state the paper is wound up into
enormous rolls, which may contain a mile
or more of paper.

THE QUEST FOR FINE FURS.

Trappers Go to the Remotest Regions to
Supply Demands for Pelts.

The hardiest of all the hardy explorers
who penetrated the forests of North
America in the early days of its settle-
ment were the trappers. To meet the
demand of Europe for furs these pioneers
made their way deep into the unknown
regions of the country, establishing here
and there little trading posta remote
from settlements, and these trading posts
formed the vanguards of civilization,
Albany and St. Louis, among other set-
tlements which were later to become
flourishing modern cities, were developed
from trading poste established for the
benefit of the trappers.

The use of beaver skins in New Amster-
dam in place of gold or silver money was
so prevalent that the beaver skin became
part of the arms of New York, along with
the windmill and the flour barrels. The
French Canadian Voyagers were as daring
in their search for fur skins as the Span-
iards were in their search for gold in
Mexican and South American raids.
The formation of the Hudson‘s Bay Com-
pany in 1670, with the control of all the
country from the bay to the Pacifio and
from the great lakes to the Arctic Ocean,
deprived the Canadian trapper of his
independence as @ fur trader, but the
search went on without interruption
and the skina were sold in London as
fast as they could be collected, and
continues down to the present day.

It would seem that, tabing into con-
sideration the thousands of fur bearing
animals slaughtered avery year to satisfy
the demand of my lady, the supply would
by this time have become slender,
the styles did not change every now and
then it probably would have been, In|
fact some apecies have been very nearly |
exterminated, But when one kind of |
fur goes out of style, the animals wearing '
that Variety have achance to reoruit their |
thinned ranks, so that by the time their |
turn comes round again they have multi- |

»hed and become numerous once more, |
ut in the case of the Alaskan seal the |
animals Were killed off so rapidly that the
extermination of this species is predicted. |
Only bachelor seals are now killed, the

mated ones being protected by law.

tled by every one who could remember |

a tune and which had a life that long out-
lived the President it helped to land in
the White House. This song's career is
interesting, inasmuch as it was written,
composed, printed and shipped from New
York to Washington all in the short space
of twenty-four hours.

“I received the order for the song from
the publicity manager of the political
campaign about ten o'clock in the morn-
ing. ‘We want a rousing campaign song,’
he said over the phone, ‘and we want it
on sale in Washington to-morrow morn-
ing.’ I remonstrated. I informed him
that it was almost an impossiblilty, but
when he assured me of its importance I
gave him my word that the song would be
shipped that night, and it was.

“I called in my best lyric writer. In two
hours the poem was ready for the com-
poser, A half hour later the song was
complete on my desk, and by five o'clock

that evening all the proofs had been |

corrected and the mammoth presses were
grinding out the copies that were to be-
come famous in a fortnight.

“This song alone realized thous ands of
dollars in royalty and earned, during its
lifetime, nearly as much as the annual
salary of the President which it elected,
The latter day songs have, in the short
space of three months, made their com-
posers independently wealthy.

“One song writer, who, several years
ago, was a waiter in a Bowery danoe hall,
now has an income of from $40,000 to
$50,000 a year, realized solely from the
royalties derived from his popular songs.”

Each large publishing house has its
staff of writers and the opportunities for
the layman or amateur to break into this
field are few. The royalties on a popular
composition which sells to the consumer
for 10 cents fluctuate. As a rule, they
hover about the cent mark. That is,
one cent for every copy which is sold,
This, perhaps, seems _ infinitesimal—a
trifle too small to be considered—but
when one stops to consider that a success-
ful song may sell a million copies, or $10,+
000 in royalties, they will readily see that
the half hour or hour devoted to its com-
position was not wasted,

Then there is the interpolation in a big
Broadway musical production, or then
again, the “hit song” in that same per-
formance. For instance, “Every Little
Movement” in “Madame Sherry” is said
to have earned $50,000. “Day Dreams,”
in “The Spring Maid,” as much, if not
more, with none of the expenses which
are entailed in advertising a popular song,
In a musical production there is pract ica ity
no outlay required. The song sells itself
from the advertising it receives by the
Broadway show.

Some Old Vehicles.

There is an interesting collection of
wheeled vehicles in the National Museum
in Washington which was gotten together
for the purpose of showing the develop-
ment of conveyances for men and chattels
from the most primitive times, One of the

exhibits is a fullsized carette, or ox cart

used by the Indians of Arizona and New
Mexico, as well as in some of the remote
parts of Spain, This cart was brought over
by the early Spanish settlers, It has wheels

about three and a half feet in diameter,

made of three pieces of timber fastened
together with dowels of wood, the whee)
being thick at the centre to form the hub.
Another primitive type of wagon
known as the Red River cart and used
by the half-breeds in Canada, has five
foot wheels, the wheels in this case having
spokes, twelve in number, The native

driver of this cart sits in it with his fee,

higher than his hips, the shafts being
higher than the bed of the wagon, There
is also a reproduction of an Kgyptian
chariot in the collection, the wheels of
which have twelve spokes, with nlote|
in them near the hob #0 that a rope can
be run through to hold the spokes firnily |
in place, What is thought to c the oldest |
type of vehicle still in use is the Russian |
bashkir, or child's coach, with whoels
made out of a solid slab of wood, having
noms burned through the centre for the
axle,
