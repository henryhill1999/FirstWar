Baffling Walter Scott

Cryptogram.
A FORCED PLAY AT BRIDGE

 

 

|\Work of a New Problem Composer—
| Magic Star of Prime Numbers

—Puzzie at Algebra.
(Problem No. 1641s one of those interest-
g aituations which can be settled only
ty forcing @ discard and in the creation of
Ernest Bergholt has become famous.
iAt first glance it looks as if all that was
was to separate the trumps
then make the aces and kings in
suite. But this would allow the ad-
ea to separate their trumps also.
‘ere is the distribution:

     
  
   
  

i
iit
i
!
hi

Qlubs are trumps and Z ia in the lead.
Y and Z to take six tricks against any de-
fenoe.

The solution is for Z to lead a heart,
which Y wins with the king, returning
the six of diamonds. Z trumps this
trick and leads the deuce of spades, throw-
ing A into the lead.

A has the choice of two leads, the heart
or the trump. If he leads the trump first
he will have to follow with the heart,
but it will make a slight difference in
Y’s play whiah he does. As his object is
to throw the lead to Y he may as well
lead the heart at onoe.

Y now leads the trump so as to prevent
those in the hands of A and B from making
eeparately, 7% discarding a heart. A is
forced to lead one of his top hearts, which
Y trumps, at the same time compelling B
to solve the problem by his discard. The
good diamond threatens him in Y's hand,
and two spades lie waiting for him in 2's,
¥ being able to lead either suit.

Tf A leada the trumn at trick four, 1n-
stead of the heart, Y will win it and force
the essentia) discard from B by leading
his last trump, on which both Z and A
will play hearts, just as if A had led that
suit.

| There having been some question raised
{as to whether or not Y and Z could not
‘win six tricks with the club opening in
iproblem No. 162, provided they followed
it up properly, all the solutions were sent
to the composer at Prescott, Ariz., for his
reply to the suggested attack. He tele-
gtaphs:

“Sorry about 162, as the club opening
is sound after all. To make the series
correct, substitute jack and ten for king
and queen of spades, and then in 162, inter-
change the jack and ten of spades, as
well as of clubs. Present my apologies
to the bunch.”

The same result is arrived at, of course,
if the king and queen of spades are inter-
changed, without reducing the rank to
jack and ten, which is done only to make
it a jack and ten transposition all through.
It is a pity that such a fine problem had
a double solution, but it is remarkable
that none of the cracks discovered it.
it is unfortunately too late now to revise
the whole list of solvers, so that problem
will have to be called off.

Once more TH SUN takes pleasure in
introducing a new composer, whose name
is already familiar as a solver, but who
starte off with a modest little six carder
which contains a useful lesson in the
management of the trump suit, that being
the most important element in this prob-
lem:

The position shown in Problem No. 164,

on 21, 30 and 31. White men on 11, 17, 19,

THOSE MAGIC STARS.

A correspondent who confesses to hav-
ing had considerable amusement for
himself and his friends out of the problem
of the magic star suggests that it might
be interesting to see how ema]! a number
would be necessary to make a magic etar
if the solver were restricted to the use
of prime numbers.

’ His argument is that there would be
no theory of ratios between increase and
decrease, as in the last puzzle, and that
it is diffcult to imagine how one would
work it out by algebra. He sends the
following as a sample of the best he can
do, but suggests that the cracks who read
Tae Svcwn will be able to improve upon
the arrangement:

This one adds 02 each way and the total
number of pieces used is 280. Now lei
us see who can beat it.

SOMETHING IN ALOFBRA.

So far there are only two attempts at
the problem printed two weeks ago, so
it will be left for another week.

Here is a little problem in probabilities
which may be easier to solve than to ex-
plain to the satisfaction of the interested
parties, as it is not quite as simple as would
appear on the surface.

Three men agreed to throw two dice
to see what each would get, on the under-
sianding tnat an outsider would then
throw until he got two of the numbers
again. Each man put $10 in the pool,
the first man whose number came again
to get $20 of it, the second man to get
back his $10 and the last man to get noth-
ing.

On the throw for position A got 9,
B got 6 and ( got 7.

There are 36 possible throws with two
dice, among which there are 4 ways to |
throw 9, 6 ways to throw 6, and 6 ways

to throw 7. It is therefore admitted that |
C, who wants another 7, has the best
chance, but the outsider who {fs to do the
throwing off, offers to bet against C get-
ting his money back if any one will give
him odds on the proposition.

That is, he bets that both 6 and 9 will be
thrown before 7. A offera to bet him 2
to 1, What are the exact odds against
the double event?

@ reat WALTER SCOTr CRYPTOORAN.

A great many long and learnedly
worded letters have been received by ‘Tur
Sun since last August demonstrating
that the solution to this puzzle was im-
possible to find. The chief argument
was that there were not sufficient repeti-
ive the solver a start, that there
was pothing to catch hold of as a certainty
for even a single Jetter. ‘The secondar
oomplaint was that there were no available
statistics of the frequency of sounds to
form a guide.
Here is the original:

CL_CW EBV QYV ZNX
TSQBH HPK OW DGJ,
ZQGYF CW PI CSF
WANSM R OBFE UL.

These are two lines of ten syllables
each, which have been frequently pub-
lished as anonymous, but Isaac Pitman
says in his earlier works on phonetic
gpelling that they were written by Sir
Walter Scott to show the absurdities of
English orthography.

 

 

tions to

The cryptogram is written in phonetics,
each of the letters in it saadine for a
distinct sound, so that it is never neces.
sary to use the same sign for twoseparate
sounds, The only solution received iy

trom Steven T, Byington of Ballard vale,
Mass., who gives the following account
of how he arrived at it:

“Cryptogram solving has to work with
certainties where it can and to try prob-

able guesses when the certainties give
‘yout. ‘The first certainty in this case is
that every syllable, within the limits of
ordinary English, must contain one vowel,

and (since we are told that diphthongs
are to count as single Vowels) only one,

“The second certainty, given to us
in the directions for the eryptogram, is
that the halves of the sentence are equal
in number of syllables. This condition
is fulfilled if we assume that the words
of five sounds are dissyllables and the
words of less than five sounds mono-
syllables; this is then the likeliest guess
to start with.

“Of two sounds in one word one must
be vowel and the other consonant, except
in the highly improbable case of a dis-
syleple without any consonant, Hence,
if C is @ Vowel L and are consonanta,
and then O and U are vowels. But it is
also a bable guess that in the four-
sounded monosyliable the vowel is more

aining tricks. |i

kely in the middle than at either end.
Chis onumnpticn gives us ©, O, U, con-
sonants; L, W, R, vowels.

“And if © is a consonant 8 and F must
be one of them a vowel .and the other
ry a consonant; from this a
further series of inferences can be drawn
as to what will follow if S is a vowel or
if it is a consonant, Alfnost necessar
A must be a consonant if W is a vowel,

“I now made the false assumption that
the author of the cryptogram had inten-
tionally planned to make A, E, I, 0, U
all consonants, and thia decided whether
to count S_as vowel or as consonant.
Luckily the false assumption happened to

 

lead to the correct conclusion; but I might) NEW

better have drawn the same _ inference

TASKS FOR PLAYERS

“I now had the characters nearly all| Valuc of Hands Changed and a Different

classified into vowels and consonants.
The next step obviously was to read
‘CL CW,’ C being consonant. I took the
lists of consonants and vowel sounds
printed below the cryptogram, assuming
that for the present purpose these were
authoritative, and began saying pa, pe,
pi, &c., to find two words beginning with
the game consonant that could begin my
couplet. .
“When I came to ‘the’ and ‘tho’ I decided
that these were good enough to try my
first experiment with; there was no prob-
ability that going further would give me
anything more plausible. (It is to be noted
that CW comes twice in the short piece
for which ‘the’ is a likely word.) So
put down every C, L and W inthe piece.

Method of Bidding Made
Necessary.

Whist was a good game until they in-
vented bridge, and bridge was a good
game until they started to play acution.
Auction was the best game of all until
they suggested royals. This new game,
having met and overcome every defect
in the old, is regarded as the best card
game for four players in the world to-day
and will probably hold for the next ten
years tho places held, each for a decade,
by whist and then by bridge.

Whist had the defect that the trump
was determined by pure chance and

looked plausible enough to try. But ‘R'| that many of the strongest hands were

part of ita context. A, which wasmy first}them. Bridge remedied that defect by

guess for R, did not seein likely to come so
near before a word ending with o at the
end of a sentence. I decided that the
likeliest guess for ‘R OBFE UL’ was ‘T)
must go,’ which gave the excellent word
‘me’ for ‘OW.’ Then ‘CSF’ must be ‘this’
(can't be ‘thus,’ since short u is B), and!
had at the same time the firet two sounds
of ‘EBV.’ I had also the location of nearl
alfthe vowels in the piece, and, since it
was poetry, the probable accentuation;
‘wae beginning to get the general sound
of it.

“By putting down the alphabet in order
I saw that the author of the ptogram
had simply taken the alphabet backward
as far as his phonetic scheme permitted.
I believe I noticed this before I felt quite
sure of the words in general. This enabled
me to declare with confidence what sound
jhe must have ascribed to I, and hence
what his pronunciation of ‘lough’ waa."

With regard to the sign u for the
sound of “ough” in “lough,” this is the
only guttural in English, and as no other
vowel ever goes wit) it, it is commonly
written in shorthand with a single sign.
The complete lines are:

Though the tough cough and hiccough
plough methrough,
Across the lough this evening I must go.

As will be seen, there are no less than
seven distinct sounds for the four letters
“ough,’ and only two sounds are repeated
four times, these being the heavy sound
of “th” in thought and the long sound of
e. There are four sounds that are repeated
three times; ten are repeated twice, and
the ten others occur but once.

It will be interesting to see what the
English do with this, as Bergholt repub-
lished it in the Queen on March 2, but at
las t reporta had no solutions.

 

allowing the dealer to select the trump
and permitting his adversaries to double
its value if they thought the selection
@ bad one for him.

But bridge had the defect that the
dealer and his partner had a monopoly

doubtedly an improvement on whist
it did not go far enough, because no mat-
ter how good the hands held by the non-
dealers they had nothing to say about
selecting the trump that would best fit
their hands. Auction remedied this by
allowing each player at the table a chance
to pick out the suit and letting the man
with the best cards play them for their
full value.

But auction in its turn had the defect
that the values of the suits were not
equitably adjusted, the advantage still
being largely with the color of the cards
dealt. With two of the four suits in the
pack one might easily go game on the
deal. With the other two suits this was
impossible if either of them was the
trump

This forced the partners who held the

black suits to take long chances in order
to get something out of their cards and
prompted the player who held the red}

suits either to outbid them or to ait still
and slaughter their no-trumpers.

longer any weak suits as distinguished] _

from etrong suits, so called, because all
the suite are winning suite now. .

In auction when a player bid two in
hearts he practically told his partner to
let him alone, even if he had three sure
tricks in clubs and seven in spades, and
the partner sat there and said nothing,
although he might not have a heart in
his hand. It was only when he had the
other red suit, which was also a winning
suit, that he dared to interfere with the
original declaration. Now he can show
his strength, no matter where it is, as six
cards in a black suit are just as good as
six cards in a red one.

In auction, with the penalty on ohe
spade limited to 100 points, that sult was
reserved for safety bids and nothing
else. Statistica published in Tak Sun on
January 7, 1912, went to show that in auo-
tion 40 per cent. of the dealer's deciara-
tions were eafety spades. Two-spade
bids, to encourage the partner to go no
trumps, did not come up more than three
times in 100 deals, and were not responded
to more than once in three times.

The club suit, in auction, was kept for
supporting and suggesting possible no-
trumpers, not being declared more than
five times in 100 deals, and it did not ma-
terialize into a no-trumper more than once
in four times when it was declared. All
the player had left to fight with was the
hearts and the diamonds, so that the game
was practically divided into four elemente
--two fighting units, one lame duck, and
one dead suit.

In royals this is all changed. The
safety bid is still there, as it thould be,
like the white chip at poker; but this epade
suit is still a good fighting suit if it has
any stren it, and takes its place
along with the three others, so that the
layer has all four arms of the service,
oree, foot, artillery and engineers, at his
dis lin royals, while in auction he had
nothing but the cavalry and artillery, the
engineers being left in the ditch at the
start and the infantry being too slow to
get anywhere near the ting line.

The main reliance of the old game was
on the hospital service, which kept one
side from losing more than 100 men at a
time. The other part of it was a seriea of
desperate no trumpers, which reminded

one of the charge of the Light Brigade at
are in conception and re-
sults.

This being so, it must be evident that
all the old text-books on auction bridge
will be useless for the new game ao far as
the system of communication between
partners is concerned, and that the player
who wishes to keep up with the times and
get the most out of his cards must study
— that will better fit the new condi-
tions.

: The game is true to-day of royals. The ress inens

methods by which partners came to an
understanding of the possibilities of their
cumbined hands in auction will be found
not only useless but misleading in play-
ing royals, because the chief object of
partnership is no longer to arrive at a
no trumper, but to avoid penalties. With
wider experience this will undoubtedly
'be found to be the keynote of the new
game.
