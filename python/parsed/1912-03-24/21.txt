Mme. Simone haa finished her stay
in this more or less inhospitable city
with a reviyal of Meilhdo and Halévy's
play of social life in the last days of the
Second Empire, and in “Frou-Frou” some
of the most engaging phases of her art
were shown. It cannot be denied that
with all her energy Mine. Simone has
not succeeded in touching deeply the
hearts of the New York public. Her
acting has frequently been praised and
generally admired by those who saw
the varied exhibition of her talents which
she offered to New Yorkers. During
the decade over which her theatrical
career extends the French actress has
been seen in Paris in nine réles. During
one season she has acted five for the
benefit of New York. Two of these were
quite new to her répertoire. So of her
desire to please there can be no question.

It was during her last week at the
Hudson Theatre, which ended on Satur-
day, that she showed qualities
would probably have endeared her to
the American public to a greater degree
than any previous exhibition of her
talents. She was altogether charming
as Gilberte de Sartoris. There was more
than one reason for predicting that
this historic character was one to which
she was by temperament but little suited
It was easy to say that Mme. Simone is
as an actress essentialiy cerebral, while
the irresponsible butterfly of French
society was altogether a creature of her
passing emotion. It took
sapience to predict that she might infuse
her attack on the preponderating Louise

A PLAY OF NOVEL FORM.

Each Act Shows a New Generation of |

Characters.

Klaw & Erlanger have shown courage
in selecting for this country the new
play called “Milestones” by Arnold Ben-
nett and Edward Knoblauch. It was to
be expected that any work from these
two popular writers would attract atten-
tion but the novelty of their play makes
it somewhat diMicult for the hidebound
theatrical manager to understand. It
has an entirely new set of characters in
each of ite three acts although these
people are of course related to one another
by some ties. Nevertheless, anything so
unoonventional required a degree of
courage on the part of the managers
who will offer it to this public. It was
acted with what is said to have been
genuine success at the Royalty Theatre
in London.

The first act passes in 1960; the second
in 1885 and the last at the present time,
As the descendanta of the characters

do not seem to differ very much in essential
matters from their ancestors.
