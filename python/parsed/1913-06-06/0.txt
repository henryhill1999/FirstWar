New Vork Company Will Annoance

The stockholders of the Standard Oil |
Company of New York yesterday voted

to increase the capitalization of the
company from $15,000,000 to $75,000,-
000, There were no votes against the
increase, 121,589 shares out of 150,000
outstanding being voted,

The diréctors of the company will
announce the distribution of the new
stock us a 400 per cent. stock dividend
to-day, and it is expected that it will
be distributed to stock of record of
June 13,

This action just now when financial
conditions are so unsettled is consid-
ered somewhat remarkable, although it
was discounted some time ago,

There have been seven large stock
distributions among the ‘companies
which once made up the Standard Oj!
Company. The Standard Oil Company
of Indiana declared one of 2,900 per
cent, the Standard Oil Company of
Nebraska one of 58 i-3 per cent., the
Standard Oil Company of Kansas one
of 100 per cent., the South Penn Oil

The strike committee received to-day |
from Miss Helen Keller, the blind girl,
a check for $48.98 to help “in their brave |

A committee of fifteen of the central
strike committee was appointed to-day
to confer with the mill owners and ask
for a hearing on a proposal to return
to work, but 2,000 strikers at a meet-
ing decided to stand firm There was
a hint of threatened sabotage in a
resolution passed by the central eom-

resolutions say. “They would bave

| frankly he based his opposition on the

fact that ratification of the treaty would
obligate theUnited States to arbitrate the
Panama (Mal tolls controversy with
Great Britain.

The British arbitration treaty expired
by limitation yesterday, The two Gov-
ernments agreed last to re-
| newal for another period of five years
and to-day the Senate Committee on

Foreign Relations brought in a report

recommending the ratification of the
| treaty as well as of identical treaties
; with Italy and Spain. The Senate in
executive session agreed to the ratifica-

tion of the treaties with Spain and Italy,
| but when « vote on the British treaty
was proposed Senator Ghamberlain ob-
| seated, The Senate, desiring to avoid
the appearance of affronti Great

Briain, thereupon withdrew the ratifi-
cations of the Spanish and Italian trea-
ties. The British treaty will lie over
until it is ascertained that the neces-
sary two-thirds vote can be obtained
for its ratification.

If President Wilson proposes to con-
cede the justness of the British conten-
tion in the Panama Canal tolls con-
| troversy or if he proposes to submit the
| dispute to arbitration he will be in dan-
| ger of having his proposals repudiated
lin the Senate.

time a popular impression that the ex-

no country in which American abscon-
