THE GRAIN MARKETS.
Wheat Lower Arsen

 

—- Argentine News Good
ables Heavy—Corn and Oats Firmer.

Wheat gave way. Good weather in Argen-
tina and lower European markets caused
the decline. December at Chicago has of
late been 7%c. under May. Export trade is
small. Patten interests are standing on their
holdings, said to be as bullish as ever, but not
adding to their Line, They think Europe
must sooner or later buy freely in this coun-
try.

A momentary rally occurred at one time
owing to East Indian advices to the effect
that the acreage had been reduced 8,000,000
acres out of a total of about 29,000,000 last
year. Much colder weather at the Northwest
also had some effect. It has been so mild
of late in the winter wheat belt that a coid
wave could do a good deal of harm. ‘

But with the foreign markets weak. the
Argentine newa favorable and the export
trade at a standstill there was little disposi-
tion to buy except to cover shorts, And that
was anything but urgent. The outside =
kets were weak and the Northwest sent sell-
ing orders. The course of the market in the
immediate future will depend largely, a the
opinion of many, on the foreign news and the
size of the export business. .

Argentina wes said % ht ofinn lege
uantities to Europe. Liverpool -
chan to ed. Tower. Berlin. declined
% mk. and Paris equal to %c. Broomhall
cabled that the indications were for favor-
able weather in Argentina for harvesting.
Famine conditions were reported in Turkey.
The Modern Miller says that moisture hae
been plentiful over the Ami — winte
wheat belt, but the open winter is regard
as conducive to unseasonable growth and in-
sect life. At present, however, there are few
traces of insect damage.

THE CORN SITUATION.
Prices were firmer. The weather ac the
West is too warm. It is not good for the
grading. Besides, the country offerings are
very small. Western rec 8 are moderate.
Shorts covered and there was more or leas new
buying. December showed the most strength
Ch cago reported a mood shipping demand
with the supply inadequate. The receipts
there were 422 cars with 187 expected to-day.

THE OATS FEATURKA.
In sympathy with corn oats were firmer,
especially as. the offerings were moderate
and commission houses showed some dis-
position to buy. Larger country accept-
ances were reported, but there was a better
cash demand at Chicago and the sample
market there was ‘, to ‘4c. higher. Chicago
received 367 cars and expects 171 to-day.

THE COTTON MARKET.

| A Sudden Jump When Wall Street Pulled
the String--1t Was a Big Buyer in a
| Narrow Market.

Wall Street, uptown and other prominent
buying suddenly pitckforked prices to a higher
level. The toss from the morning's decline
was pretty high. Again, it other words,
prices were forced down and again they

! struck back. This has been the experience
for weeks past. Yet at one time things did
not look very favorable for a bull, Cutting
down production 25 per cent, during the first
two months of the year by 75 per cent. of the
New England mills, as now seems to be the
programme, reveals a striking change for the
worse in New England’s trade as compared
with that of a twelvemonth ago. Receipts

E larger, too. Those estimates for this

morning at the Southwest seemed to make
rather pleasant reading for a bear, But
suppose they merely reflect recent big export
purchases? That is easily within the range
of possibilities. It has occurred before now
that big receipts merely stood for big Euro-
pean purchases. Exports at times during
the past week have certainly been large.
The South sold yesterday, however, and so
did many of the camp followers of the bulla
who ran the December deal and sold January
it appears, against it, yet who were expected
at the same time to carry the deal into Janu-

ary.
home who are understood to have sold
January against December holdings bought
January and March and put out the hedge
in May. There was also some generel com-
misgion house buying for people who believe
that, cotton is good property at current prices.
In any case an early decline of a dozen points
was recovered in short,sharp order. it was
due to a rise in stocks, somewhat greater ease
tin the money market, the ooomingiy iNogical
discount on January here with the contract
»80 greatly improved and an idea that it will
be dangerous fishing to throw out any big
line of January notices on Monday with the
possibility of their bein spap up b
some of the leviathans of the business. Wal-
