THE BUSINESS OUTLOOK.

Reports by “Dun’s” and Bradstreet’s " on
the State of Trade. ,

Dun’s review says that there are more
unemployed wage earners now than at
any time this year, but says that in spite
of this and of the unprecedented emigras

tion lately the amount of immigranta for
ae exceeded that of last year ty

Bradetreet’s says:

Trade as a whole has been quiet and in-
dustry has slackened perceptibly, but the
Anancial situation has eased, except where,
as in the case of New York, large end of the
year disbursements have to be provided for.
Previous anticipations as to the volume of
holiday trade find confirmation in the reports
that the distribution, while fair, was not
equal to that of 1006 or of some earlier years.
Mild weather is still complained of as affect~-
ing retail trade in seasonable goods, such as
clothing, shoes, rubber footwear and kindred
lines, At some cities the usual January
reduction sales were held in December, in
many instances occurring before Christmas.
Jobbing trade was quiet till after the latter
date, when the usual clearance sales of wash
and other dress fabrics were made, arousing
a fair amount of interest. Wholesale business
has been quiet, and both this line and the
jobbing trade note the receipt of many re-
quests to delay shipment of goods.

Industrial ‘ines are quieter, a very general
shutting down for the holidays being noted,
and the textile trades especially have shown
a tendency to further curtail. One item in
this line has been the reported agreement of
nearly 80 per cent. of the New England cotton
apindies to reduce or curtail pro duction in the
next sixty or ninety days.

Dun's says:

Holiday trade was very heavy during the

mast few days, before Christinas, raising the
total for the season above expectations, al-
though comparions with last vear's figures
are unfavorable at most pointa. A few in-
terior cities report better results than in
1906, but these are exceptional cases. General
business has been quiet, as is customary at
this time, and manufacturing plants have
increased the percentage of idle machinery.
Dry goods jobbers atimulated trade by spe-
cial clearance sales, retail buyers attending
in large numbers because of light stocks
on hand.
The banka furnished currency more readiily
for payrolls, but little improvement is recorded
in mercantile collections, More wage earners
are unemployed than at any previous time
this year, yet many factories and mills an-
noynce resumption early in 100% and con-
sumption of staple commodities ia not
perceptibly diminished, because of the savings
of the preceding extended period of full occu-
pation. It is i: teresting to note in compari-
son, with recent statements of unprecedented
emigration that imMigration for November
also established a record, 117,476 aliens arriv-
ing in this country, or 22,855 more than in the
same month last year.

OUR FOREIGN TRADE.

For Eleven Months of 1007 it Reached a
Total of $3,047 332 807.

WasHINCcTON, Dec. 27.—The foreign com-
merce of the United States for the eleven
months of the present year was valued at
over three billions of dollars and exceeded
that of the corresponding period of 1906 by
$253,357,538, of which $144.882,027 repre-
sented the increase in imporis and §$108,-

of the four great classes into which the
articles are divided by the Bureau of Statis-
tics the greatest increase was in the value
of raw materials sent abroad, which rose
from $443,721,168 in the eleven months of
1906 to $490,156,713 in the like period just
ended. ‘The next increase was in the im-
portation of finisiel manufacture! arti-

cles, which gained $46,536,841 and reached a
total of $249,714,106. The a nalies’ increase

Two Manufacturing Concerns With 82, 300,-
000 Caplial Go Into Bankruptcy.

BuFFALO, Dec. 27.--The largest petition
in bankruptcy ever filed in the United States
District Court here was placed on recor
this morning. It is against the Lisk Manu-
facturing Company, Limited, of Canan-
daigua, the capital stock of which is $2,000,-
000, all paid in. At the same time a peti-
tion was filed against the Reed Manufac-
turing Company of Newark, Wayne county,
the capital stock of which is $500,000, owned
by the Lisk company. The total indebted-
ness of both concerns is upward of $1,500,-
000, Both companies have about a million
dollars of manufactured goods and stock
on hand.

Intmediately following the filing of the
two petitions application was made to Judge
Hazel, in chambers, for the appointment of
receivers, in order to preventa sacrifice
of the business and property. After listen-
‘ing to the facts in the case the Judge ap-
pointed as receivers Frank H. Hamlin of
Canandaigua, Frank Garlock of Newark
and Henry E. Boller of this city. The re-
ceivers a required to file a bond of $100,000
upon each Emap _and are authorized
and direct to continue the iness.
Under this management it is believed the
indebtedness will be fully paid and the
fr operty saved to the stockholders, T

jak company manufactured househo
and cooking utensila, The present condi-
tion of the money market is given asa the
cause of the failures.

WILL SHUT DOWN SILVER MINES.

a

Producers Find Work Unprofitable at
Present Prices,

Sait Lakg, Utah, Dec. 27.--The directors
of the Silver King Coalition, Daly West
and Daly Judge, the three big silver mines
of Park City, to-day agreed to shut down
their mines as far as possible on New Year's
Day. About 1,000 men will be thrown out

of employment.

Mine managers say it is profitless to
mine and ship ores at present prices, and
they believe that mine owners, by ceasing

production, can help the market back, to
a level that wil make mining pay again.
