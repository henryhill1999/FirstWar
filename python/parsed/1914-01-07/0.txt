that he was Birl I. Roland of Syracuse

On New Year's eve, the nan went on,
he was seized by three strangers as he
was leaving his place of business and
hustled {nto an automobile. Then he was
blindfolded and hurried up several pairs
of stairs to a room, where they robbed
him of $161 and a gold watch and forced
him to sign an order for $500.

Then he was dragged back to .the au-
tomobile and driven about until last
night, when, he says, his captors whisked
the bandage off his eyes, set him down
at Fifty-first street and Fifth avenue
