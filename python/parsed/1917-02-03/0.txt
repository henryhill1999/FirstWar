After hours of tense expectation the
officials of the American Line were cha-
grined, as well as disappointed, In not
hearing last night from the United |
States Government that thelr liner st. |
Louis, flying the American flag, carry: |
ing American mail, was at liberty to”
take the ‘sea at her accustomed hour |
and upon her accustomed business.

Knowing that the President was dis-
cussing with the Cabinet yesterday |
afternoon the course of policy to be |
taken with Germany, President P. A. 3.
Franklin of the International Mercan-
tile Marine, of which the American Line
ie a constituent, remained in his office |
at 9 Broadway until 7 o'clock last |
night, anticipating a telegram from the;
Secretary of State assuring him that
American merchant ships still enjoyed ;
the freedom of the seas, But at 7 P. |

M, no direct word had come from Wash- |
ington, and all that Mr. Franklin had |
to make his dinner cheerful was the
hint. conveyed in news despatches that
Secretary Lansing had intimated vaguely |
that the St. Louis had better not leave

to-day or until the U-boat issue was
decided,
Although an Associated Press des-

patch quoted Secretary Lansing as say-
ing the American Line had been given
the suggestion—not an order——that it
would be well to postpone sailings pend-,
ing a decision, officials of the line last ,
night asserted no such message had |
been delivered here.

Steamship Officials Shocked.

American Line officials were literally |
shocked at the failure of the Govern- |
ment to define quickly their natural |
procedure. President Franklin hopes |
that when he gets down to his office |
this morning a message from Secretary {
Lansing instructing him to send the St.!
Louis with her 300 passengers on her
way at noon, sailing time, will be on
his desk; otherwise he will scarcely -
know what to do. It is taken for |
granted, however, that the liner will re
main tied up at her dock until the
United States Government formulates a

licy.

ee tee Lansing has stated that the;
St. Louis be held it is likely that we will
be advised to-morrow morning,” said Mr. |
Franklin last night. “Naturally, we shall |
act in conformity with that recommenda-
tion. It is well to note that the Amert-|
can Line is a national institution, hav-
ing a contract with the United States |
Government for carrying the mails to
Europe on regular dates.

“The line was organized under the
mail act of 1891 and {s maintained un-
der the provisions of that act. In this
crisis we feel that we must be advised
officially what to do. We have asked the
State Department and the Post Office be-
partment for instructions. We must}
iknow where we stand, j

“Are we at Iiberty to travel the seas)
or may we travel only according to the
orders and conditions laid down by an-
other country? That is the whole ques-
uon,.”

 

American Line Ruling Vital.

Every steamship line and agency in
New York—in the United States, for |
that matter—is awaiting with intense in-!
ierest the United States Government's |
instructions to the American Line rela-!
tive to the movement of the liner St. |
Lauls.

It is anticipated that those ins‘ruc-
tions will reveal the decision of the ao
