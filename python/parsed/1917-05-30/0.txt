As barley is one of the principal in-

prohibition of its tre would bring the
‘brewing industry, which represents a}

dollars, to a complete halt duripg the}
period of the war, and undoubtedly would
wreck a considerable part of the indus-

bushels of barley were used in brewing
and 4,073,262 bushels in the manufacture
of distilled spirits, a total of 66,513,236
bushels. This is a considergble portion
of the barley crop, being slightly more

evident that the protest had been writ-
ten by an individual, but nevertheless
more than thirty of the Jackies and ma-
rines had signed the protest, each giv-
ing the name of his ship.

Following the introuuction of the’ pro-
test Senator Swanson, acting chairman
of the Committee on Naval Affairs, said
he was acquainted with certain facts re-
garding the establishment of a base hos-
pital near the anchorage of the Atlantic
fleet and knew there had been delays
incident to the acquisition of ground for
the buildings. Tits might in @ measure
account for some of the discomforts, he
said, but it failed to explain why the
sufferers aboard the Solace had been on
short rations of water or ice or why sic
men had been compelled to carry their
own baggage while suffering from fuvers
or why apparently serious unsanitary
conditions had been permitted to exist
in lavatories and culinary departments
of a hospital ship which was supposed
to be something of a model in the navy.

No action was taken by the Senate
over the (wider commun s=.tion.

Across the page in big, black type wae
this question:

“Why is America now at war?"

The entire front page of the periodical
was devoted to “Some political obser-
vations ou the present situation,” as
part of the headlines phrased it. One of
the subjects was whether or not the
Democratic attitude was dictated by
patriotism or partisanship.

“Mr. Wilson was reelected President
and the Democratic party is now in
power,” read a sentence in the body of
the article, “largely because of the
campaign appeal to stand by the Pres-
ident, who was said to have ‘with
honor’ Kept us out of war." Further
town in the artic'e the Republican de-
clared it was loyal to the American
flag and added that it was “not yet
satisfied that Congress and the Presi-
dent have, in this matter, represented
“ best interests of the American peo-
ple”

Criticism was directed in the article
against the sending of American
troops because “England is- reported
to have refused to send any more of
her troops to France, although France
is her ally by solemn treaty engage-
ment, on the alleged ground that Eng-
land feore a German invasion of Great
Britain.”

Offence to French Mission.

Probably the most obnoxious of Mayor
Thompson's acts wae his attitude with
regard to the visit of the French War
Commission. Chicage was clamoring
for the honor of paying homage to the
