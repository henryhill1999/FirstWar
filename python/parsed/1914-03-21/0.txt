Wasnincton, March 20.—After a day
of conferences between Attorney-General
McReynolds representatives of the
New Haven ratlroad all doubt had disap-
peared that a satisfactory agreement in
regard to the dissolution of the big rail-
road system will be reached. The clearing
away of all clouds was indicated by this

that all details will be satisfactorily ar-
ranged at an early date, A further state-

points in controversy have been settled |
and that an agreement is assured.

The fact that the negotiatio:s had

ROUTED BY 9 A. M. FIRE.

Cornelius Byrne's Family All Get
Oat in Safety.

Arthur Byrne, the of Cornelius E.
Byrne of 302 West End avenue, was awak-
ened at 2 o'clock this morning by smoke
and the noise of crackling flames in the
roof over his head. He stumbled through
thick atmosphere to the window and
shouted for help. In making his way
down he routed out of bed his brother and
sister, Cornelius, aged 9, and Marzaret,
aged 11, and also hie mother and father,
who were on the second floor.

They all got out safely, but two malds
who were on the top floor had not been
warned. Firemen found thom nearly
overcome by smoke and carried them out

Mrs. Byrne became hysterical as she

them. She was found almost unconscious

BRYAN LLAMA TO ENGLAND.

At Least It Will Start There With
the Verdi, bat—.

The Nama which arrived last Sunday
by the Lamport & Holt liner Verdi from
Buenos Ayres, consigned to William J.
Bryan, “Minister of the Interior,” will go
away again next Tuesday on the Verdi,
not back to its native South America, but
to England. At least it will start in’ that
direction, but before now, according to
seafaring men, dead llamas have been
found floating in from the three mile limit
after they had been rejected by the live
stock quarantine inspectors.

The llama, one of several which ar-
rived by the Verdi, in the usual course of
things would go back with the Verdi to
Buenos Ayres on her next trip. As it

wife.

The deceased Mrs. Faversham's execu-
tor claimed that nearly $2,000 was due
at her death. The actor contended that
he had made the payments of $3,200 a
year regularly from the time the divorce
was granted in 1902 and that all he owed
was about $350, which had been mailed
by him to his former wife before he knew
she was dead and was returned on ac-
count of her death.

Justice Scott, who wrote the opinion
in the case, said:

“It is not strictly a debt due to his
wife, but rather a general duty of sup-
port, made specific and measured by the
court and the allowance becomes a debt
only in the sense that the general duty
over which the husband previously has
discretionary control has been changed
into a specific duty. In Its very nature
therefore upon the death of the wife,
when the obligation of support and main-
tenance ceases, the obligation of payment
likewise ceases.” =

BRRRR! SPRING IS HERE.

fo Says the Almanac, bat the Ther-
mometer Drops to 15,

Spring begins officially at 6:03 o'clock
this morning. This information was ob-
tained from a trusted almanac, and not
from the Government thermometer on the
top of the Whitehall Building, which at
10 o'clock last night stood at 16 de-
grees above sero. The weather man,
who had watched it gambolling down
from 36 degrees at 3 o'clock Thuraday
afternoon, said hopefully that he didn't
think it would have the nerve to
go any lower, although the high westerly
winds might make it appear so,

Not even Winsted, Conn. had the
hardihood to report a robin yesterday, and
peach trees in New Jersey are not in
bloom.

For spring’s opening to-day the forecast
calle for increased cloudiness, with
moderate variable winds, probably bring-

 

 

rebels, tearing up the railroads and burn-
ing the bridges. This made it necessary
for Villa to despatch his men on foot and
on horseback and made the progress for |
100 miles very slow, as the country is
desert and without water.

The destruction of the railroad puts
Villa in a bad way for supplying his |
army, but he declared to-day to corre- |
spondents that he had no fear from this
score, as his men would soon be able to
subsist “off Torreon.” He cannot much
longer delay the attack, as he must either
tabe the town or retreat, according to the
best information obtainable here,

It would not be surprising if the rebel
guns opened the battle at daylight to-
morrow.

Miguel! E. Diebold, Huerta's Consul here,
said to-night he had no Information from
Torreon except that the Federals were |
fortified and ready to resist. He received
a telegram to-night from Gen, Maass that
a force of Federals had repulsed a force |
of rebels at Monclova, east of Torreon,
after Killing 400 rebels.

Gen. Manuel Chao, Gen, Luls Herrera
and Aureliano Gonzales, Civil Governor
of Chihuahua, reached Juarez to-night at |
11 o'clock on a special train, accompanied
by 400 rebcl troops.

They say they are only on an Iinspec-
tion trip, but the coming of troops adda |
a significance to the visit, since this brings
the Juarez garrison up to about 1,400
men. Carranza is expected on Sunday |
with about 1,000 men, The reenforcement |
of the garrison makes the Villa forces |
greater than that which Carranza is
bringing.

WasHinocton, March 20.—The suffra-

As a result the
equal suffrage in a differ nt form, how-
ever, will probably be before the Senate
again next week and there will be a re-
newal of the struggle. The lobbyists for

suffrage were very much elated over their:

victory.

Senator Shafroth of Colorado offered an
amendment to the Constitution providing
that whenever § per cent. of the voters of

voting on the question of equal suffrage

‘the authorities of that State must submit

the question to a vote,

As the resolution was proposed yester-
day afternoon in the Senate by Mr. Shaf-
roth it provided that only 5 per cent.
might petition and get such recognition
from the States, Senator Shafroth wa:
prevented yesterday from introducing his
resolution by a motion to go into executive

mittee was voted down 37 to 25

It was well known that if the
had been referred to the Judiciary Com-
mittee it would not be repdrted back to
the Senate this session, The issue was a

struggle between the Judiciary Committee | O'Gorman

and the Woman Suffrage Committee for,
control of the resolution. The Woman
Suffrage Committee was made up of Sena-

tors the majority of whom are favorable women,

Immediately following
which the Judiciary Committee was de-
nied jurisdiction over the resolution a
motion was carried without a division to
refer it to the Committee on Woman Suf-
frage. It will be reported back next week

The purpose of the suffragists in chang-
Ing the form of the amendment was to
overcome the objection raised by Senator

ernment should not impose woman suf-
frage on the States of the Union without
their consent.
