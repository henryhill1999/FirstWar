IN BALKANS-GARYIN|

President's Action in Mexico Called Insult to Church—|} Latin American Republics No-; London Editor Says if England!
Organ of Southern Clergy Sees Challenge |
to the Faithful.

NEW ORLEANS, Oct, 16..—The Morning

Star, regarded as the mouthpiece of the

‘ |
Catholie clergy of the South, published |

to-day the following editorial:
“Venustiang Carranza, the bandit, the
cutthroat, the outlaws the avowed per-
secutor of the Catholic Church, the rob-
ber and despoiler of her sanctuaries,

| schools, convents and lfospitals, the mur-
iderer of priests, the
' hordes,

leader
whose nameless
indignities to pure, consecrated nuns
and defenceless women and children show
the vicious darkness of his soul; Venus-

of vandal

tiano Carranga, whose name must ever
; stand for all that is blackest and vilest
and must degrading in the pages of
Mexican history, has been recognized
by the President of the United States
as ruler of the distracted Mexican re-
public.

“We say the President of the United |

States, because this recognition of Car-
ranza is Mr, Wilson's direct work, From
the moment of his assumption of the
reins of the Government of this country
it became plainly evident to every close
observer of the trend of events that
Carranza was Mr. Wilson's choice among
the rebel hordes,

“Mr. Wilson's recognition of Carranza,
the avowed enemy of the Catholic

church, is an insult to the Catholics of |

this country, It is a direct challenge
togghem, and we hope that not only
Ca lics but every true lover of re-

ligious freedom, for which the glorious

flag of our country stands, will give him!
| such an open answer at the polls as will

that no President of the
can so flagrantly ignore
the lawful and respectful request of
16,000,000 fellow citizens without pay-
ing the, penalty.

“This is the only way open to Cath-
olics in which they can take up the

prove to him
United States

gauntlet thrown down by the President |
It ia the only way |

of the United States.
in which all true lovers of religious
freedom, irrespective of creed, can show
to the Administration at Washington
how they revere and are determined to

‘uphold this fundamental principle of the

American Constitution.

“Meantime, we do not hesitate to
predict that long before that day comes
the utter weakness of Mr. Wilson's Ad-
ministration, especially as regards hie
Mexican policy—which has culminated,
as every one could see it would, in the
recognition of Carranza-—-will, through
that very account, be exposed to the
world for the utter fallacy that it is;
for the veriest infant in statecraft
should have intelligence enough to see
that such a man as Carranza can never
restore peace and order and stability of
government in Mexico.

“The question was put squarely before
Mr. Wilson; there was no dodging it.
and he has given his <.nswer, which is a
direct insult to every American Catho-
Ne. He has openty, in deflance of every
principle of right and justice, ignored
the wishes of 16,000,000 Catholic fellow
citizens and given the protection of our
flag and the moral support of our Con-
stitution to a party that has no respect
for God or man, law or order and whose
expressed determination to

Chureh, |

A measure of the disfavor with which |

clergy of the Catholic Church
this country has received the announce-
ment that President Wilson is about to
recognize Gen. Carranza

is supplied by !

editorial and news articles in the Tablet, |

which is the official organ of the Roman
Catholic Church of the diocese of Brook-
lyn.

In its issue of yesterday the Tablet
declared that the recognition of
ranza will be an open insult to 16,000,-
the United States, be-
cause Carranza and his mintons nave
been guilty for several years of pillage
and murder, of unwarranted, sacrilegious
attacks against priests and nuns and of
consistent efforts to blot out
Catholic Church in Mexico by the most
revolting means.

“Letters and telegrams of protest from
thousands of American citizens, Catholic
and non-Catholic, un@ng that such a
travesty be avoided, have been of no
avail,” says the Tablet. “Telegrams
organizations representing
sands of American citizens were {gnored,

WASHINGTON, Oct, 16.—Recognition of

'
the Carranza Government by the United

States and by the Latin-American coun-
tries which participated in the recent
conferences will be extended within a

few days. All of the Latin-American |
Governments which joined with the
United States in considering the Mexi-

can problem have notified the State De-
partment of their acceptance of Whe rec-
ommendations of the conference

Secretary of State Lansing has called
a Ineeting on the conference on Monday,
and at that time the final steps will be
taken looking toward a recognition of
Carranza as the head of the
Government,

The instructions received vy the diplo-
matic representatives of Brazil, Argen-
tina, Chile, Bolivia, Uruguay and Guate-

mala were in the nature of a ratitica-
tion of the action taken by thein in com
junction with Secretary Lansing. The

| Latin American dipiomats are instructed

thou- |

by their Governments to make arrange-
ments for the actual extension of recog-
nition,

This will be a simple matter for those
countries which still have diplomatic rep-
resentatives in Mexico. In the case of
the United States, however, the recog-
nition will have to take a different form,

| as this Government has not had an Am-

ing of their beliefs, providing they have |
not participated and will not participate |

in the politics of Mexico.’

“Moreover, the guarantees do not ex-
tend to ‘religious persons’—that is, to
priests and nuns——who may be accused
in the future of participating in Mexican
politics, and the decision as to what
constitutes participation rests with the
Carranzista politicians The political
‘amnesty’ granted by Carranga is of the
same nature; pardon for those whom he
decides to spare,
those whom he fears or upon whom he

 

would be revenged,

“The latest Mexican adventure of
President Wilson might be cited as a
contradiction of much that has hereto-
fore received his approval. It is. But in
the inconsistencies and mutually de-
structive elements that compose the

President's Méxican ‘policy,’ why singte
out one for special honor’ The bargain

‘of Saturday was struck to meet the ex-

tremities of domestic politics, to facili-
tate escape from an embarrassing in-
quisition, and {ff it reduces Congress to
siler
