The Rehabilitation of the Dance

When the waning popularity of the
waltz and two step and the craving
for novelty tn ballroom dances afforded
the opportunity for innovations three
years ago there was a grave danger
that the transition from old to new
might lead to tolerance of steps and
figures of, to put it mildly, an immodest
origin and tendency, Against this pos-
sibility it became the duty of ladies and
gentlemen to oppose their influence,
und the recent history of the ballroom
records how immediately effective lietr
prompt disapproval was,

The new dances came, and conquered,
but in them ts discernible nothing of

resources it must be with the admission
that none of the regiments is as well
trained as organizations of the regular
army and that most of the militia is
conspicuously Inferior.

When the ery of war used to be
ratsed periodically in Europe from the
Russo-Turkish campaign of 1877 down
to the recent Balkan convulsion, and
war of any magnitude never followed
the alarm, our pactficists argued that
it was fllogical to suppose that the
United States would ever have to be
prepared for a capital war. But con-
tinental Europe is now a cockpit, and
Japan, our rival in the Pacific that
humillated Russian in 1905, 19 at war
too. The place of the pacifictsts {s at
the rear now. Preparedness for war ts
thrust upon us. General WorTHersroon
recommends that the regular army be
increased to 205,000 and that a first line
reserve of 203,500 men and a second line
of 200,000 be provided for. Whether
Congress can be prevailed on to heed
the warning and take the counsel sert-
ously may be doubted, we fear, but that
the United States would have sore need
of such resources fn fully and partiaily
trained men in the event of war with a
first class Power, whieh must no longer
be decried, is manifest. The next time
we have to fight we shall not be able
to muddle through.

 

 

And Now Sanitary Bread,

Who would suspect the neat loaves
of bread furnished by our bakers of
harboring bacteria, those insidious be-
cause unseen enemies of man?

In connection with our recent warn-
ing against domestics, espectally cooks,
as disease carriers, the investigatious
of the Department of Health of this,
city published jn a late bulletin and |
confirming previous similar findings by |
the United States Agricultural Depart-
ment become Interesting and Instruc- |
tive. It appears that loaves purchased
in various stores were brought to the
laboratory, the crust scraped upon ster+
ile paper and the parings placed in
test tubes with what the scfentists call
a culture medium, that fs, a meat broth
that offers good soil for the growth of
any bacteria that may be present tn
the article subjected to examination.
The result was that this bread showed
contamination with colon bacilli. the
most suspicious of all, In two-thirds of
the samples.

On the other hand, only 7 per cent.
of samples of bread that had been
wrapped in paper containers within
three hours after baking showed colon
bacilli, proving that handling the bread
exposes it to contamination by infected |
fingers and dust. The crust is abso |

lutely sterile as 1t comes from the oven
and should not be handled except with
recenUy washed and scrubbed hands
during Its transmission to the paper
wrapper. It was also demonstrated
that the bread did not become stale so
soon when wrapped, and that it did rept |
lose its ivor so soon, in fact, the latter |
ouly occurred after the lapse of two |
days, the longest period betng 114 hours.
The additional cost of wrapping is com- |
pensated for amply, although tt amounts |
to 5 per cent. of the total cost, by this
improvement in the keeping quality.
and still more by prevention of 10 per
Pk in weight of wrapped bread

THE WAR TAX ON PREMIUMS.

A Protest Against Their Collection by
the Insurance Companies,

To run Epitorn or Tue SuN—Sir: It
has come to our notice that the war rev-
enue tax of 1914 applying to Insurance
premiums ts to be collected from the In-
suring public by the Insurance
through the medium of adding tho tax
to regular premiums charged.

It seems to us that in doing this the
insurance companies are shitting their
burden to the business men, who are al-
ready very much overtaxed, The argu-
ment may be used that these taxes must
eventually be pald by the public, but It
is our opinion that they should not be col-
lected in the manner intended by the In-
surance companies. Insurance policies are
very frequently subject to cancellation or
reductions in amounts and in rates, which
involves return premiums, pald to the in-
suring public by the companies,

The law requires the insurance com-
panies to pay one-half of 1 per cent. on
thelr premiums. It has been held by some
that the law does not require stamps to
be attached to insurance policies, and that
the companies might be allowed to pay
the tax direct to the Government on their
net premiums. The insurance companies,
however, are endeavoring to shift the re-
sponsibility by attaching stamps, and if
perchance they issue to us policies the
premiums on which are $1,000 they will
attach stamps to the amount of $5. If
subsequently the rates of our Insurance
should be reduced, which In eur case we
iuve reason to belleve they will be, and
our premiums are reduced to $500,
can secure no rebate on these stamps if
attached (© the policies. If the insurance
companies were permitted to pay a tax
