TESTIFIES MRS. LYLE

|

That's Why She Put Those Ten- |

afly Bells Near Happy Land,
Husband's Other Hobby,

 

SURE FODKS LIKED

 

Mire. Julia Gertrude Lyle, who in-
herited millions from her husband, John
S. Lyle, thrice her age, was a witness in
her own behalf before Vice-Chancellor
Lewls in the Chancery Chambers, Jersey
City, yesterday afternoon in the injune-
ton suit brought by a number of neigh-
bors in an effort to hush the chimes
erected in a tower on her Tenafly estate

as a memorial to her husband.

Jler presence attracted a throng to the
Shyancery Chambers and when court re-
convened at 10 o'clock the court room
filled with Tenafly neighbors and
seekers Mrs. Lyle, dressed in

ack and purple he has Not yet come
out of mourning—was seated beside
counsel, Chauncey Parker, except when on

was
Wiasity

ie Witness stand,

Nine bells, the largest weighing a ton
and the smallest 400 pounds, are hung in
the top of a tower fifty feet high Tt is

located at the entrance to the estate and
150 feet of Happy Land, the home
to which fifty girls of the New York slums
ave been taken every two weeks from
June to September for the past twenty-
t

withir

ree sumiers.

“Happy Land was Mr, Lyle’s hobby,”
eaid Mrs. Lyle between tears. “For
nineteen years he conducted it as a vaca-

fon home for the children of the slums
Since he took sick, four years ago, T have
ept it up. Mr. Lyle also loved chimes.

So 1 put the two things that my husband
loved inost together.”

Asked by her counsel if she
people enjoyed the bells, M Lyle said:

“It geamed so to me. On Sunday after-
noons when hymns are played at sun-
down it attracts automobile parties all the
way from New York. I have seen as
many as a dozen near the chimes tower
at one time. In fact there are so many
that it is often embarrassing.”

Mrs. Lyle said that she gave the con-
tract for the memorial in February, 1913,
and that the work commenced on March 1
following. The tower was finished and the
chimes installed some time in
that vear. But nobody, excepting Henry
J. Brenton, one of the complainants tn the
injunction suit, complained about the bells
She said she told Mr. Brenton she would
do all she could to hush the bells but that
ehe could not be expected to stop them
ringing altogether.

Joseph G. P. Kennedy, the chime ringer,
told of his experiences with the neighbors.
He «said that when Mr. Brenton com-
plained to him the latter said:

“You know, Kennedy, I came to Tenafly
to have quietness. I am so nervous that
even the rattle of a teaspoon makes me
Jump.”

Kennedy told of meeting John Brew-
ster, one of the complatnants, and aak-
tng him why he had signed against the
bells. Ho said he told Brewster he was
‘worse than an old woman.” Kennedy
seid that Brewster replied:

“Well, Kennedy, the bells don’t disturb
me, but it does seem to me to be a non-
eensical bit of — fogtishness.”

Kennedy said that he plays “Abide
With Me” every night and that on Sun-
Cays at sunset he plays “Lead, Kindly
leht’ and “How Firm a Foundation.”
lie testified that automobile parties

stored out to hear the chimes. As a
porting shot to Mrs. Alice May Batley and
er father, Charles P. Buckley, the prin-
cioal complainants, Kennedy said that
‘hey live right on the corner of two well
e d roads and that automobiles are
} ed to toot their horns when ap-
} ng the crossing

favant Among these were J. Weller
Noves, president of the Tenafly National
Bunk; FE, Stanton Clark, a retired mer-
iant Hving near by, and Miss Lucy F.
