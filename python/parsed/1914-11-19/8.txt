Second Night of Season Brings
Good Performance of Ger-
man Opera.

GENERALLY

CAST STRONG

 

 

  

\ cner's “Lohengrin” was sung at the
M in Opera House last evening,
the second of the season. An audience
of good 3 assembled and there was

i nl applause. The performance was
igh merit, though there were the
jpeveable uneven places in the delivery
of some of the music. Undoubtedly these
were so sii@ht as to cause no diminution
of t enjoyment of the audience The
general spirit of the representation was
«) faithful to the Intent of the great mas-
te ind the devotion of each individual

artist was so fervent that only uplifting
esults could be observed.
The excellence of this performance was

 

rot due wholly to the principals, The |
da of star caste and ragged back-
g nds are long past, and no small part
of (he interest of last night's repetition
was due to the minute care bestowed upon
etuls. The movement of the chorus both
in groups and among individuals was well
planned and executed, Indeed in the
singing of the chorus, as well as its ac-
tlo ind in the playing of the orchestra
there Were many evidences of rehearsal.

The cast was composed of old ac-
qua inces. except in one instance.
Arthur Middleton, an American singer,
made his first operatic appearance here
as tie Herald, He has been heard in ora-
torio His voice ts well suited to the
oper stage and his vocal style and
diction both proved to be praiseworthy.
Vir. Middleton probably fell into an error

 

common among singers new to the Metro-
politan stage. He seemed to think It
necessary to give out continually the

power of his voice. He will doubt-
1 to husband his resources.

A good example was set for him by
Carl Braun, the basso, who sang the
music of the Aing with much excellent
Judgement, employing a moderate and even

whole

small degree of force most of the time,
and thus adding to the dignity of his
style Mme Gadski as Elsa and Mme.

tiber as Ortrud supplied the feminine ele-
ments in the performance. The former
s always a painstaking artist, but last

evening her vocal apparatus was not In
{te best condition and her singing was
somewhat labored

Mime. Ober's Ortrud was up to its usual
level and the Lohengrin of Mr. Urles
lacked none of its wonted quality Mr.
Weil repeated his stalwart and sonorous
Teiramund. The orchestra of the Metro-
politan Opera House has often been
praised for its excellence, and it is a

pleasure to record that it is as good as

ever.

Lager.” |

The piece Is the first of Schillen's Wall-
enstein triolog, or rather the introduction
to the Piccolomini and Death of Wallen- |
stein, which are to come later in the sea-
son. It was well and appropriately cos- |
tumed and presented, as it was intended
to do, a vivid picture of Wallenstein's |
army, with its blind belief in the success |
of his arma, their unrestrained Indulgence |
and disregard of every law save that of |
camp, }

Ernst Holznagle appearing as the Wacht- |
meister, Rudi Rahe as the Trompeter, |
Richard Fetst and Henry Falk as the two

comedy, “Ein Blauer Teufel,” with {ts
scene laid In a French village tn the war
of 1870, Christian Ruh as the Bavarian |
soldier and Aranka Eben as the French
farm girl were pleasing In the two char-
acters and delighted the audience with
their singing and Gancing.

The contemplated season will be in
French and Italian, and its organizer will
be no less @ person than the well known
Cleofonte Campanini, who made the repu
tation of the earlier seasons at the Man-
hattan Opera House Ile is now in Chi-
cago. In spite of the differences between
Signor Campanini and Oscar HWammer-
stein, the season which ts at present con-
templated by the Itallan conductor v
probably be given in Mr, Hammerstein's
new Lexington Avenue Opera House
Until last week this was used for the
exhibition of moving pictures

Signor Cainpanini is now in Chicago

 

endeavoring t» collect what he considers
should be paid to him as his salary for
the present seuson. Since the Metropuli-
tan Opera House hag been able to give
its season, he believes that the Chicago
company could have carried out its plans
had there been any real desire to do so,
It has been said that all the French
artista, Including Charies Dalmores, Ar- |
mand Crabbe, Hector Dufranne and the
rest of the company could have een
assembled had the Chicago directors so
desired, Already Edyth Watk Marte
Koutzleneff and Marie Barrientos have,
with other singers, declared thelr inten- |
tion of bringing sult against the com-
; pany on the same ground that Signor
Campanini is urging his claims to pay-
ment,

It {is thought that he will get his
salary, which is said to amount to about
$40,000, without difficulty. There are now
a number of operatic artists in this

country, sufficient in the oy on of Signor
