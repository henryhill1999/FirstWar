Withdrawal in Relgiam,

WORGOR, Nov, 19,--The Times aorre-
Spondent in West Flanders telegraphs his
impressions after seeing officers and men
who had occupied the trenches further
south.

“The fury of the German attack,” he
says, “is spent, and preparations on an ex-
tensive scale are béing made by the enemy
for the inevitable withdrawal from the line
he holds at present. Transports have
been moved back several miies at vartous
points. It is Known that the mining of
the roads has been carricd on fairly ex-
teusively In the past few days.

“One important point must not be over-
looked when the position in the north is
considered When the enemy made his
Supreme effort three weeks ago the Brit-
ish artillery equipment was not nearly so
600d as at this moment. Our heavy guns
are now doing great execution, The ex-
céllence of the French artillery is well
known, The German guns, on the other
hand, are considerably worse for wear.
They were used with recklessness in the
opening months of the war, a fact whieh
naturally has had its effect on the guns
themseives and on the quality of the am-
munition which is being feverishly and
badly manufactured by the Germans

“When Furnes was bombarded
other day only three out of twenty-five
shelia exploded. Three German shells on
