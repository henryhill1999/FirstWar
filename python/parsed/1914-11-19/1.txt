Fortress Was No Longer Defen-
sible When the Kaiser's
Troops Capitulated. ,

 

PRKIN, Nov, 18.—A newspaper corre-
spondent who arrived here from Tsing-
tao to-night says that the fortress was no
longer defensible when the Germans capit-
ulated, The Japanese artillery, he saya,
had shelled the German trenches until,
when the bombardment stopped, the bay-
onets and machine guns of the Japanese
infantry were close upon the trenches.

The Japanese then broke through the
line, crossing over the German dead and

wounded. At that time only Fort Bis-
marck,- of the three big forts, was still
able to reply to the bombardment. The

termans dynamited the guns of this fort
as the Japanese scaled the fortifications

Hetore capitulating, the Germans de-
stroyed all thelr vessels, including three
merchant ships in dry dock, and all their
artillery and military stores,

Experience has proved
over and over again that
when times are hard it is
the advertised brands of
goods which hold up best
on the sales chart.

The reason is obvious. The
first law of economy is to
buy only those things in
which you have the greatest
confidence.

Good advertising builds
confidence.
