finally got down to work to-day in
drawing the actual formula for a
Jeague of nations, to be presented as
the American plan to the

President will ask that the problem

of the league be taken up after the’

question of representation has been
settled as the basis for the whole
proceeding.

This may bring out the first differ-

tions noted recently in the French
viewpoint render the success of the
Wilson plan more probable. The va-
rious suggestions of formulas for a
Jeagne are belng combined now Into
one plan under the supervision of
James B. Synott and may be pub-

conference,

WH Be a Compromise.

The plan will be a compromise be-
tween the extremists of the Taft
echool and the more moderate ideas,
It will not call for a World United
States with a president or head of
any kind, but will provide for an as-
sociation of nations, without surren-
dering their sovereign rights, to ren-

der judgment in any dispute that may |

arise and then require a walt of a
year before beginning hostilities.

If the parties to the dispute are re- ,

ealeitrant then each nation in the
eague pledges itself to decide forth-
with whether fn its sovereign capacity
it will join the others in coercive mill-
tary measures,

Avold Constitutional Amendment.

This plan removes the objections
so! against the supernatienal proj-
which would require the relin-
quishment of sovereignty and in the
of the United States would de-
mand a constitutional amendment
aking unnecessury the consent of
Congress for the employment of the
armed forces of the country. It

wonld be impossible to obtain, and

Ry the Associated Press,
Paris, Jan. 10.—-President Wilson, it
is said, virtually has made up his mind
‘how far he will support Italy’s de
mands at the peace table and informed
Premier Orlando of his decision, but
it is probable that his ideas will not be
made known publicly unul the peace
delegates have been advised of them.
It is asserted by persons close to the
President that he favors only partial
indorsement of Italy's ambitions. The
expectation has been expressed that
President Wilson is agreeable to meet-
ing the principal features of Italy's
claim to territory undeniably Italian
and essential to safeguard her sover-
eignty and at the same time to recog-
nize the territorial aspirations of the
Jugo-Siavs. It is anticipated that the
President's leanings in favor of Italy
do not go as far as to warrant the aug-
gestion that he is in favor of giving
Italy control of the Adriatic, but
that by a project of internationaliza-
tion he is willing to satisfy the Italians
that there will be no military threat to
the east of them, according to persons
supposed to be well informed

Cannot Support in Fall,
The President ts said to realize that
the Italians are depending almost solels

on the United States for support, but
that he has felt from the first
could not indorse thetfr
though he 1s said to entertain the warm-
est sympathy for Italy.

David Lloyd George, the British Pre-
mier, will reach parts Saturday night
and Arthur J. Balfour, the Foreign Sec-
retary, will arrive Sunday morning.

General conferences among the allied
Statesmen assembled here will be held
auritng next week, and there may pos-
sibly be a meeting of the peace con-
itself before the weels's end.
