Save Russia, Says

Soldiers’ Council
PETROGRAD, via London, May

\ertan Council of Soldiers’
and Workmen's Deputies has is-
sued an appeal to the army in
which it declares that German
imperialism is seeking to destroy
revolutionary Russia and enslave
the Russian people. It appeals
to the soldiers to defend Russia
with all their nower and declares
that a separate peace is impos-
sible. °

ithe appeal says that the only
solution of the war must be a
general peace among ail nations
by common agreement. It asserts
that the Council is aiming at
peace br calling for a revolution
among the workmen and peasants
of Germany and Austria-Hun-
gary, but that neace cannot be
rchieve: unless the enemy at the
front is checked. The manifesto
cencludes with begging the sol-
Vers not to renounce their offen-
‘ive and warns against fraterniz-
ing with the enemy, which, it
Says, cannot end the war.

“We have been amazed.” he said, ‘at
the wonderful spirit shown by the

“Tt must be borne in mind that the
