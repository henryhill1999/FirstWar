LAST OF CATHERINE MARKET.

The work of tearing down the last of |

the two buildings constituting Catherine
Market, which had encumbered the foot |
of Catherine street for more than a cen-
turyy, was completed on Saturday. The
builds duyrs are the #est.to be removed from
the site to be oceifpied by a park if the
Board of Aldermen ‘accepts that project.
The market consisted of two low build-
ings extending from Cherry to South street.
It was established in 1788 by Capt. Har-
Inat) ed after his wife

years it w for its fish for which

MUSIC OF ONE SUNDAY.
Mr. Damrosch and Brabrs at a Matinee
and Mr. Mottl and Beethoven, Later,

The New York Symphony Orchestra,
over which Walter Damrosch presides,

 

| gave its second matinée at Carnegie Hall

yesterday afternoon before a very large
audience. The programme consisted of
Brahins's third symphony, the Grieg piano

‘ concerto, short ‘cello pieces by Molique
‘and Dvorak and “Variations and Fugue

on a Merry Theme” by George Schumann.
Mrs. Fannie, Bloomfield-Zelsler was the
pianist and Leo Schulz the ‘cellist.

Mrs. Zeisler played the Crieg music with
all the energy at her command and it seemed
at times as if she were straining every
The audience was
spectacle and
applauded what may fitly be described as
her efforts with generous indulgence.

Mr. Damrosch conducted the Brahms
symphony with judgment’ He prefaced it
with some explanatory remarks, aided by
illustrations played on the piano. His
talk was to the point and well suited to the
needs of a general audience.

At the Metropolitan Opera House in the
evening the first of the winter series of
Sunday night concerts took place. Mr,
Mottl conducted and there was made mani-
fest a desire on the part of the conductor
and Mr, Conried to change the time-honored
character of these entertainments,

With this desire it was evident that Mr.
Plancon, who reappeared after an absence
of two years, had no abiding 8 mpathy.
Ho sang the good old air from “Der Frei-
| schuetz,” and in response to applause added
to the list the perennial “Les Rameaux,”
and the sempiternal “Two Grenadiers.”
He was in fine voice and sang the Weber
air magnificently.

Olive fremstad sang an air from Mozart's
“Clemenza di Tito” yery well, though her
style has not quite all the smoothness and
repose necessary for music of the classic
type. She had to repeat part of the air.
Mr. Mott! made the orchestra the feature
of the evening, and the seccnd part of
his programme consisted of Beethoven's
“Eroica” symphony, which he read with
eloquent accentuation and much warmth
and which the orchestra played like the
solid old New York routiniers that they
are. It wasa very interesting performance
and showed that Mr. Mott! had_ imbibed
fully the Wagnerian ideas as to the proper
method of performing the work.

The archestra played also the yors iel
to “Die Meistersinger” and Berlioz's “Car-
nival Romain” overture. Both of these
went well, though the Wagner number was
given in an astonishingly square-cut style,
Of course the Mastersingers were a rigid
and pedantic lot, but a good deal of the pfe-
lude is devoted to the exposition of the
romantic feeling embodied in young Walter,
and this readily lends itself toa more elastic
treatment than Mr. Mottl accorded to it.

WILD GEESE STOP “IN PARK.

Their Cousins Calied, and Some Paid Visit
in Spite of the Gander.
; A flock of about 200 wild geese visited
| Central Park yesterday and caused a com-
| motion among the swans, geese and ducks
in the winter quarters near the Ramble.
It was shortly after daylight when Keeper
| Conway of the sheepfold heard a “honk,
honk, honk!” coming from overhead, and
looking up saw the flock of wild fowl flying
low in the form of the letter V. They had
come from the direction of Jersey and were

| headed toward Long Island Sound. ‘Their
| flight took them over the winter quarters
of the water fowl and, as they were passing,

 

 

'
|
| the Park geese caught their cries and sent
| back an answering “honk, honk!

The salutation from the land caused
| confusion among the flock in the air and
| the wedge shaped formation broke up.
| Some of the flock seemed anxious to go
| down to investigate the cries from their
| kindred. The old gander that had led the
| flight wavered in his course and then headed
for the reservoir, which is a short distance
from the winter enclosure of the Park fowl.
The rest of the flock followed him, and all
of them dropped down into the open reser-
voir near the centre.
| They paddled about fora wh le. ISDE TERYY

looking for the geese that had cailed tothem,
| but finally took fright at a man walking
around the reservoir, and rose from the
| water. As they did so the Park geese again
| called to them, The old gander paid no
| further heed to the cries, but started off
| toward the Sound, followed by most of
| the flock.

Some of the geese, however, circled about,
and when they had located the source
| of the calls from the land they flew down
| to the winter quarters and joined their
| cousins. There was a bobbing up and
down of heads and a clatter in geese lan-
| guage while the strangers were welcomed
| by their cousins, and in a short time they
went floating about in search of food.
| Some of them became frightened later

in the day ana flew away. Only three of
them remained there last night.

VETO TIME LIMIT TEST.

Important Constitutional Question Up in
the Connecticut Courts,

STAMFORD, Conn., Noy. 29.—On the calen-
dar in the Superior Court for to-morrow
is a petition for an injunction to restrain
the officials of the “pretended town of South
Norwalk,” as the petition calls it, from

| carrying on the functions of their offices.
The hearing will be held before Judge
Thayer

Back of the suit there is an important
constitutional question. After one of the
most strenuous controversies in this State
a bill was passed by the last Legislature

| dividing the township of Norwalk and in-
corporating the part comprising the city
|

 

of South Norwalk as @ separate township.
The agitation for the bill caused a sharp face
tional fight in the Republican party. With
anew township there would be extra Asseme
blymen, which would be of importance in
the event of an election for a United States
Senator,

The Governor vetoed the bill, and it was
not passed over the veto, but the veto was
not filed until after three calendar days
had elapsed after the passage of the bil. |
There is a precedent in this State for con-
sidering three ijegislative days and not
calendar days in filing vetoes, and accord-
ing to this construction the veto of the
bill would be valid.

The Constitution merely fixes three days
as the limit for vetoes without any specilic
reference as to what kind of days, For
that reason the assertion is made by the
advocates of the new town that the veto
was not valid. An election for town officers
was held in the new township last October
and a full set of officials was chosen, They
have been ready for business ever since.

SALESMAN STOLE JEWELRY.
A. Fried Confesses He Was Short and

Vielded to Temptation,

Aerrold Fried of 638 East Fifth street, a
jewelry salesman formerly in the employ
of Resh & Rothberg, at $11 East Houston
street, was arrested on Saturday night
charged with stealing $1,200 worth of his
employers’ property.

Central Office Detectives Cronin and
Hennessey, who made the arrest, told Magis-
trate Ommen in the West Side police court
yesterday that Fried had 5 eone out to look
up customers on Oct, 5, t with him a
sample case of watches and diamonds.
That was the last his employers saw of him.

Fried admitted his guilt in court. He
said he was working on a small salary,
was short of money and yielded to tempta-
tion, He begged the Magistrate to give
him another chance, but Magistrate Ommen
said he had no choice but to hold him in
$2,000 bail for trial,

yesterday that an oil painting valued at |

from the rear room of the Hon. Tom Foley 's

It was enclosed in a gold frame 4 by 3 feet

DOCTOR'S FACE SCRATCHED. -

Dr. William Armstrong, who lives on the

police court on the complaint of Mary
Doyle, who lives on the top floor of the

“He circulated stories about me,” said
Mary Doyie, “and I went to his apartment
last night with my sister. When we got
inside to speak to him he assaulted us and
hit me with a bottle.”

“She and her sister used the bottle,”
said the doctor. “They came to my apart-

SKATING IN BAYONNE,

GOOD

The Ponds Are All Right, but Small Roys
Broke Through Ice tn Canal.

Lovers of skating can find good sport in
Bayonne, The many ponds are covered
with ice two inches thick and as smooth as
giass. Yesterday a couple of thousand
people enjoyed the sport. On the pond
adjoining the clubhouse of the Bayonne
Rowing Association, foot of East Thirty-
third street, which is the biggest in the
hundreds
of men, women and children skated all
day. ‘The sport was enlivened during the
afternoon by a flurry of snow.

The Morris canal is frozen, but the ice
is thin. Some big boys prevailed upon
William Wilson and George Donaldson,
small boys, to go on the ice to test it. They
fell through and went up to their necks in
icy water. The big boys pulled the little
boys out and sent them home, crying and
shivering.
