Boat and the Plainfield to Be Sold.

Eurzanetn, N. J., Nov. 20.—When United
tates Marshal Alcott of Trenton served
a writ of replevin on Sheriff Coriell of Union
county, on Oct. 20 last, for possession of
the cruiser Chattanooga, which was at the
Crescent Shipyards, the Sheriff was sum-
moned to appear before the Circuit Court
of the United States to answer in the sum
of $50,000 for “unlawfully detaining the
vessel against the pledges and security
of the national Government.”

Declaration in this suit has just been
made by United States District Attorney
John B. Vreeland to Circuit Court Clerk
Oliphant in Trenton. The declaration re-
cites the facts of the seizure of the vessel
and her detention, The Government re-
plevined the vessel by force to prevent
the Sheriff from eelling her at aucrion under
a writ of attachment. No bond was given
by the Government, which will contend
at the trial that the Chattanooga was not
the property of the United States Ship-
building Company, but that the latter was
the Government's agent commissioned to
construct the vessel,

Sheriff Coriell said to-night; .

“I was simply acting as a ministerial
officer carrying out the orders of higher
officials. On June 18 last [ served a writ
of seizure issued by Suprema Court Com-
missioner Jobn A. Miller upon the applica-
tion of A. Q. Keasby, the New Jersey counsel
for the Babcock & Wilcox Company, of
New York, and according to law advertised
the same for three months. At the expira-
tion of that time I expected to sell the
Chattanooga and the torpedo boats Nichol-
gon and Obrien. I held tho boats until
they were replevined by the Government
and seized by United States Marshal Alcott
and removed to the Brooklyn Navy Yard.

“So far as the suits were concerned, I
{informed Mr. Keasby that it was his place
to see that I was saved harmless in the
matter and without any expense to me.
On Sept. 30 I received orders from Com-
missicner Miller to sell the vessels, but
before the time for the sale arrived they

wwere seized forcibly and taken away.
inade the usual protest.

*It seems to me that if the United States
Shipbuilding Company was only acting as
an agent for the Government in building
the vessels, the Government is liable.”

The original complainants were Bab-
cock & Wilcox, the claim being a balance
due on $19,000 for boilers furnished for the
vessels. A number of other suits were
brought by other firms holding claims
against the United States Shipbuilding
Coppany,

Next Thursday is the time set for the
sale of Charles M. Schwab's pleasure boat
Happy Day, the Czarina, another pleasure
boat and the ferryboat Plainfield, owned
by the New Jersey Central. Warrants of
seizure and order of sale were issued upon
the Bees of an Elizabeth firm which
furnished the lumber for these boats. It
fs quite likely, however, that the owners
will arrange to prevent a sale.

HORSEMAN SNOW ARRESTED,

Attempt to Extradite Him to Kansas for
Alleged Debt for Shetland Ponies.
Joseph J. Snow of 781 Lexington avenue,
was arrested yesterday morning by Detec-
tive Sergeant Galvin on a charge of larceny.
He is accused of having bought two car-
loads of Shetland ponies valued at $3,100
in the vicinity of Abilene, Kan., last fall
and of having forgotten to pay for them.
Snow is a well known breeder of Shet-
land ponies and has a large farm at Loon
Lake in Warren county. John E. Eustis,
Park Commissioner of The Bronx, appeared
in his behalf in the Tombs police court and

prisoner to police headquarters until to-day,
when 1t is expected that requisition papers
will arrive from Albany.

Farmers near Abilene, Kan., allege that |

Bnow bought ponies from them last sum-

mer on the promise that he would pay for ; is sure.”
them as soon as the animals were shipped |

to New York, and say that he neglected to
make good his promises.

Capt. Langan of the Detective Bureau
eaid yesterday that the police first began
a search for Snow on July 29 last. At that
time Gov. Odell was requested to grant
extradition papers so that Snow might be
taken back to Kansas.

The police, he said, were unable to find
fSinow at that time and the papers were re-
turned to Albany on Sept. 10, as the thirty
day limit had expired.

Notification of Snow's arrest was sent to
Albany on Saturday night. Capt. Langan
said that he was not aware of the details
concerning Snow's alleged offence, but said
that his arrest had been ordered on the

round that he had obtained money under

alse pretences. The complainant in the
Origine! papers was J. W. Baker, Sheriff
at Abilene.

Snow was at one time an influential Tam-
many pclitician.

JERNEGAN'S GOLD CRAZE.

Galt Water Swindler, Teacher in the Philip-
pines, Still Hunting for the Metal.

ROCKLAND, Me., !Nov. 20.—Dr. Ernest
M. Wheeler, who served two years in Luzon
as an army surgeon, confirms the report
that the Rev. Prescott I’. Jernegan, the
"gold from salt water” swindler, is teach-
{ng school in the Philippines. He was aware
of Jernegan's identity, and this knowledge
came in time to the school authorities,
but Jernegan pleaded so earnestly that
he was only trying to earn an honest liv-
ing that he was permitted to retain his
place.

When Dr. Wheeler left the Philippines
in January, 1903, Jernegan was still teach-
ing in Bigan, about 300 miles from Manila.
Dr. Wheeler says that in 1901, when stationed

t Banta Cruz, province of Ilocos, he was

troduced to Jernegan, who was one of
he teachers at Bigan and head of the
district. Purine the vacation Jernegan
and some of the other teachers went to
northern Luzon, where Dr. Wheeler had

one with soldiers who were guarding
the mines.

Jernegan seemed to be endowed with
the gold fever and was constantly urging
the other teachers to push further north,
where the richest mines were reputed to

. His companions were cautious, and
finally Jernegan left alone, taking a Filipino
blanket. His mania for gold was the sub-
ject of much comment upon the part of all
who came in contact with him. His visit
to the mines was unproductive, so far as
any one could see, although he staked out
weveral claims.

LLOYD KILLED IN A FIGHT?

FALL INTO ELEVATOR WELL DID
NOT CAUSE DEATH.

He Was a Stableman and Did Not Run Cabs
During Strike, but It Is Belleved That
the Real Circumstances Leading to
His Death Are Being Concealed.

Capt. Tighe and two of his plainclothes
men of the East Fifty-first street station
spent most of yesterday investigating
the death of Joseph Lloyd, the stableman
who was found with his head crushed in
at the bottom of an elevator shaft in the
Manhattan Transit Company's building,
237 East Forty-seventh street, on Saturday
afternoon.

The police satisfied themselves tnat Lloyd
did not get his injuries from a mere fall
into the well, as some of his fellow work-
men alleged, but Capt. Tighe wae positive
there was nothing in the story that Lloyd
came to his death because he took out
automobile cabs during the cabbies’ strike

As a matter of fact, the captain said,
Lloya was merely a stable hand and had
taken out no cabs at all.

Both Coroner Scholer and the_ police
believe that the real circumstances leading
up to the stableman's death are bein
concealed. Peter Dwyer of 503 East 135t
street and James McDowell of 211 East
Fifty-third street, employees in the stable,
told the police yesterday that Lloyd, in
trying to get into the elevator as it was
leaving the first floor, caught hold of the
bottom of it as it was rising rapidly and
was flung to the bottom of the shaft.

Coroner Scholer made a careful exami-
nation of Lloyd's body at the Morgue yes-
terday. He found the skull fractured in
many places, the right eye and most of the
right side of the face gone, and the nose
Broke in several places. He said after-
ward:

“No such injuries as this man received
could have resulted from a mere fall of
one story to the bottom of a shaft partly
covered with earth and thick dust. Lloyd’s
elevator.

head was caught between the car and the
side of the well I cannot say. But the
injuries were caused by the elevator, that

Patrick Lynch, the elevator man, who
was arrested Saturday in connection with
Lloyd's death, was held without bail by
Magistrate Pool in the Yorkville court yes-
terday for examination to-day.

LAW ON CREDIT.

Collateral Put Up With Rosey Unmarket: |
able When the Case Was Won. |

Rosey, the lawyer, president of the Essex |
Market Bar Association, was in front of the
court yesterday with a group of other
barristers when a tall young man passed.
“There he is! There he is!” shouted Rosey.
The young man ran and Rosey ran. The
young man's hat blew off and Rosey got it.

The man got away.

“All I get for my easy $40,” said Rosey
sadly, as he came back with a second-hand
hat.

It appears that the fugitive was partner
on a chicken butchering business under
an agreement to divide equally the profits.
The business was wound up and the pro-
ceeds of the poultry on hand were equally
divided, but the other partner had Rosey's
client arrested for selling the accumulated
chicken feathers and keeping all the pro-
ceeds.

Rosey agreed to get the man free for
$40 and took as fee a check not to be pre-
sented until earned.

On Saturday Earning Rosey saw easy
money because no complainant was present
in Essex Market, and Magistrate Mayo
dismissed the complaint at once. The
client was jubilant and he and his relatives
and friends gathered around Rosey to thank
him. “You are such a fine lawyer,” said
the client, “You safed me undt I vill nod
forged you.”

“Tf I do say it, there are only a few of
us left in Essex street who could have
pulled you through,” said Rosey.

Rosey ran across the street to his office
and sent his office boy to the bank, which is
not far from Canal street, to cash the chech.
The client had been quicker, however.
He telephoned the bank to stop payment
Then he went and drew out his account,
10 minutes before Rosey, whose office boy
had come back with no cash, could get to
the bank.

“The overcoat I was Faunne on for this
winter is gone now,” said Rosey.

ROY OF 7 NOT ACCUSED.
But His Sister, Aged 13, and His Mother
Are Charged With Shoplifting.

Josie Martelli of 41 Oliver strest, her
thirteen-year-old daughter Mamie and her
son Lowi,a bright little chap of seven, were
arraigned in the Jefferson Market court
yesterday on the complaint of private de-
tectives employed by a Broadway depart-
ment house. The woman and her children

were arrested late Saturday afternoon, after

they had been seen, as alleged, to take sev-
eral articles from one of the counters. In
their pockets, when searched, handkerchiefs,
hosiery and cheap jewelry, valued in all at
$12.95, were found.

Mrs. Martelli was held in $300 for ex-
amination to-day and her daughter was
paroled in order that she might take care
of Lowi and two younger children. No
complaint was taken against the little boy.

WAGONLOAD OF POLICE CON-
VERGE ON WAKEFIELD.

Two or Three Nimble Souls Got Away
by Dropping From the Roof of Lerch’s
Hotel When the Rest Were Corralied
—It Was an Athietle Club Matinee.

Capt. Foody of the Wakefield station and
a squad of forty policemen from the sur-
rounding precincts raided a_ prizefight
early yesterday morning in a hotel on the
outskirts of Wakefield near the Mount
Vernon line, Forty-seven prisoners, in-
culding the two fighters, were captured.
Two or three men escaped.

Capt. Foody heard late on Saturday
night that there would be a fight inthe hotel,
which is at White Plains road and Merriam
avenue. The hotel is run by August Lerch,
and on the ground floor is a large room
used for a dining room.

Capt. Foody has only about fifteen men
in his precinct, and he heard that about
one hundred men were to attend the fight.
So he telephoned to the neighboring pre-
cinets for help. The Morrisania, Tremont,
Westchester and Bronx Park stations each —
sent some men in a patrol wagon. Then |
there were the captain himself and a few |
of the sleuths of Inspector Titus’s staff. |

When the cops got to the hotel they found |
the place dark. From the back, however, |
there came shouts of “Eat him up!” “Soak
him” and “Put him out.” ‘The captain and a
couple of the heavy cops put their shoulders
to a door and broke it in.

They found themselves in the room where
the fight wes going on. Two young men,
stripped to the waist and in fighting trunks,
were Puramelling each other. he ring
had not been ro off, bul aspace had been
chalked off on the floor for them to fight in,

The ‘crowd made a dash for the windows
and ran into the policemen who had been
stationed outside. Some got to the roof
and a few dropped thence to the groun
and got away.

The fighters were Tony Dodd, whois called
the “Mount Vernon Nonpareil,” and George
Williams, known in Wakefield as * Frenchy.”
They and Lerch and Edward Crimes, who
said he was the secretary of the Wakefield
Athletic Club, were arrested. Moet. of the
forty-three spectators were bailed

easily accounted for. All the
blankets are especially woven
for us, in quality and design
exactly as we want them.
Then the Robes are made up
in our own factory, over pat-
terns that have been cut
with fullest experience as to

what is comfortable for al

man to wear.
They look well—
They fit comfortably—
They are nicely finished.

And, by having the whole)
matter of their production

in our own hands, the prices
are at least twenty-five per
cent. lower than
equal quality of blankets,
made inthe old, clumsy way,
cost elsewhere.

When you are buying a
gift for a man, it is well to
have such assurance that the

garment iy made exactly as,

men want it.

Prices, $3.75, $5,36, $6.50,

$7.50, 38 and $10.
