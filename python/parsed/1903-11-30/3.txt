PENNSYLVANIA BANDIT GANG,

BEARCA FOR THE HOLD-UP MEN
IN SEVEN MOUNTAINS.

Wen Hold-Ups in Quick Succession Since
the Marder of Telegraph Operator
Clendennen—All of ‘Them Within
Striking Distance of Seven Mountains,

Winiramsport, Pa., Nov. 29.—Central
Pennsylvania is in a state of terror as the
result of the series of robberies, hold-ups
and other orimes which have been perpe-
trated during the last ten days. Men who
ure compelled to be out at night go armed,
and more firearms have been purchased
than for many months. An army of de-
tectives, after searching for ten days
throughout this part of the State, have
failed to catch a single guilty man.

The belief has become quite general among
the detectives who are engaged on the cases
that the numerous crimes are the work of
an organized band of outlaws, whose re-
treat is insome mountain place, where they
can find safety after a dash into the thickly
settled parts of the country. This belief
has resulted in the sending of a posse of
officers into Seven Mountains, a noted
criminal resort in Center county, in the
hope of finding the headquarters of the
desperadoes.

Since the murder of Willlam Clendennen
in the lonely tower near here ten days ago,
there have been ten other hold-ups and
robberies, so similar in their character as
to compe! the belief that they are directed
byone head. Herejsa list of the crimes:

Thursday, Nov. 18.—Night Operator Wil-
liain Clendennen murdered in Brown's tower,
on the New York Central,

Yriday, Nov. 20.—Merrell Hafer, night
operator at the Reading station at Allen wood,
held up, robbed and chloroformed,

Friday, Nov. 20.—Thomas Dalton, plgnte
operator at the Reading station at Girardville,
held up and the station robbed,

Saturday, Nov, 21.—-W. B. Fletoher, night
operator at the (learfleld station at the
Pennsylvania Raiiroad, held up and the sufe
dynamited. 7

Saturday, Novy. 21.—Wires cut on both
sides of the Uuffalo, Rochester and Pitts-
burg tower at Clearteld and the tower at-
tacked.

Saturday, Nov. 2!1.—Three men driven away
from the Montgornery station of the Reading
railroad by_the-arrival of Agent Motter,

Monday, Nov. 23,.—Hector Hughes, a Penn-
sylvania Railroad engineer, held up near

enovo and robbed

Tuesday, Noy. 24

Thursday, Nov. 16 —Brakeman tH. 1. Han-
ner of Renovo held tip end robbed on top of

a box car while his traia was running forty
miles an how!

Friday, Nov. 27-—-Delawore, Lackawanna
and Western -iation at Berwick broken inte
and robbed.

The territory e:braced by the robberies
includes a bel! thirty miles wide, and _ex-

tending 100 miles east and west from Will-
port. Every place at which one of
these crimes hase been cornmitted is readily
accessible from a well known resort of
oriminals, Seven Mountains, Center county.
The place gets its nume trom seven pea ks,
the mountains being the most rugged in
the State. In places they are almost im-
metrable, and in years past they have
n known to shelter outlaws. Several
months ago a batile occurred there Le’ ween
@ posse headed by the Sheriff of Center
county and four pes office robbers, The
latter had entrenched themselves in an old
low house, but they were captured finally,
er one of them had been wounded mor-
tally. It is the firin belief of many detec-
tives that this place is the headquarters of
the present gang of deaperadoes. The
belleve that from this secure spot the
leader has been directing their movements.
It is to ascertain the truth or falsity of this
theory that a posse has been sent into
Seven Mountains. ;
Tn addition to the officials in each of the
ties and counties in which hold-ups have
occurred, a large number of railroad detec-
tives are at work on the case. Five rail-
road companies have put their best officers
in the field with instructions to spare no

and Pittsburg, and the Delaware, Lacka-
wa and Western.
lor more than a week every train has been
searched for fugitives, and every suspicious
character is searched and compelled to
prove his whereabouts during the robberies.
An army of telegraph operators, anxious
to assist in the capture of the slayer of
Clendennen, are onthe lookout and armed
bands of citizens have joined the detec-
tives and searched the mountains for the
fugitives. In ope of this strong force not
a ty man been caught thus far.
Such a state of affairs indicates that the
uilty men are not only very adept at get-
ng away, but that they have a resort at
some place, not far away, where they have
been kept in secrecy and safet y
The long continued series of crimes has
terrorized the rural communities. No one
can tell when or where the next hold-up
will occur, and men feel that their families

result of the incursion into Seven Moun-
tains is awaited anxiously, for the belief

in the oentral part of the State. Seven
Mountains is in almost the centre of the
robberies and hold-ups mentioned.

 

NEGLECTED BY CHICAGO POLICE,

Well Known Man, Assaulted and Robbed,
Locked Up for Intoxication.

Cxuicaao, Nov. 29.—Suffering from con-
cussion of the brain Edwin D. Bangs, chief
city operator for the Western Union Tele-
graph Company, lay unconscious in the
basement of the Harrison street police sta-
tion yesterday. The police insisted that he
was intoxicated. To-night it was said by
the attending physician the Samaritan
Hospital that Mr. Bangs was doing well
and had a fair chance to recover.

It was not until two physicians brought
by Mrs. Bangs had examined the suffering
man that the police reluctantly permitted
him to be removed to a hospital. Bangs
was assaulted at Van Buren and La Salle
streets, within a block of the police station,
at 60’clock in the morning. An hour latera
policeman strolled around to look at the
unconscious man, after being notified by a
stranger that he was lying on the sidewalk,
The patrol wagon was called and Policemen
Doyle, Blackburn and Otto lifted the un-
conscious man into the wagon. In spite of
the fact that his face was covered with
blood, from the blows of the robbers, and
there was no odor of liquor in his breath,
the police decided that he was intoxicated,
and he was thrown into a cell.

When Bangs was found his watch chain
dangled from his vest pocket, but the watch
was gone. Detectives assigned to investi-
gate the assault found no clues

LIVE TOPICS ABOUT TOWN.

The largest fire engine in the city came
thundering down Broadway in response
to an alarm at Fifteenth street, dodging
in and out among the cars and going at
a mile a minute clip.

“Well, by gum!” a whiskered person who
had been gazing at the Flatiron Building
remarked to a stranger. “Those fellows
have our department skinned all hollow.
Be they going their fastest?”

“Fastest!” said the stranger, “why, they
haven’t started to go yet.”

“You don’t say!” ‘responded the man
with the whiskers, “Well, how dp they
look when they are started?”

“Oh, you can’t see them at all, then; you
can just hear the whistle and feel the wind
and then you know that they've passed.”

“Well,” remarked the farmer, with a
satisfied look on his face, “no use in talking,
You can’t beat the city to see sights in.’

And he kept on up Broadway.

 

A well dressed man under 380 carne out
of the Thirty-third street, entrance of the
Waldorf-Astoria yesterday afternoon, told
the man in livery at the door to call a
hansom and drove away in it.

“Like all the members of the first fari-
lies,” called out the cabby driving him
to his colleagues about the door. “He's
easy to satisfy and makes no kicks.”

This was a joke, for the waiting cabbies
all renicrieetea that it is little ore fee
a year since the passenger was one of their
competitors, driving a hansom and look-
ing for fares as eagerly as they do them-
selves ona rainy aby:

All that is changed, He was, for a while,
a private coachman, but later gave that
up. Now he dines in the hotel he was leav-
ing yesterday, and always drives in a han-
som he picks up there. He never recog-
nizes any of the men who used to know him,
but he is polite and liberal in the matter of
tips. They are as much in the dark as the
rest of the world aa to his recent change in
fortunes

The servant question has been compli-
cated this year by an additional trouble.
The wages of all servants have been ad-

vanced this winter by $3 or $5 @ month, |

The maid who was formerly contented
with $20 must now have $24, and similar
advances prevail in every branch of do-
mestic service. The increases are in the
main the work of the men and women who
keep the employment agencies. Their
percentage is based on the salary the ser-
vant receives and they benefit by every
advance. The demand for capable ser-
vants is so great that they have felt able
this year to advise all those who came to
them for employment to put up prices for
their mutual benefit. ‘The most discourag-
ing fact about it to the housekeepers is that
the prices, advanced as they are, seem to
be paid without a protest,

 

One of the curious features of Adelina
Patti's remarkable contract is the privilege
of her manager to call off any of her con-
certs when at a specified time before the
date the advance sale does not amount to
enough to indicate receipts that will reach
$5,000. That is the minimum sum which
the diva is to receive for every concert,
and the manager is thus secured from loss
when it is plain that the receipts will not
pay expenses, The prima donna in such
cases receives nothing and the concert is
merely deducted from the number guar-
anteedto her. The receipts of her last New
York concert went just euough above $5,000
to make it necessary to pay. all the other
expenses, There was little more than
enough profit for her, The indications are,
however, that in the large cities she will
have very large receipts.

A new species of cheap millinery has re-
cently invaded Fifth avenue, and it must
be successful, Judging from the rapid in-
crease in the number of the establish-
ments. The method of doing business
in these places is to refit an empty store
which was formerly occupied by a mil-
liner. The shop is taken at a reduced
rent and the tenant isto leave when a permas
nent lessee appears. The windows are
then filled with hats that sell for $5 or some
surprisingly small sum for Fifth avenue.
Where the hats are made or whence they
come are questions that have never been
answered. Evidently the purchasers do
not worry over those matters, since four
of these shops have been opened in Fifth
avenue between Twenty-third and Fifty-
ninth streets since the early fall, Fifth
avenue evidently enjoys the opportunity
of getting a bargain as much as do the
other parts of the town

A frequent sight in the neighborhood
of Union Square is a poorly dressed man
wearing glasses, unshaven and suggesting
in his appearance the depths of poverty.
He has changed little in appearance during
the last few years, but not many persons
would recognize in him a vaudeville per.
former who not a great while ago could count
on $900 or more every weekthat he wanted
to act. Only six years back he was at the
height of his popularity as a song com-
poser and performer and his wife was one
of the highest priced performers in her
well paid and not especially artistic line.
Now he is grateful for the slightest financial
aid that any of his old friends may extend
to him. He might have been to-day as
prosperous as ever had it not been for his
uncontrollable taste for liquor, which de-
feated all attempts at eradication.

An odd incident of the fire on Park row
when the wagon load of corks caught fire
in front of City Hall Park, was the appear-
ance of the water tower on the scene when
a few pails of water could have put out the
fire. Folks who saw the water tower
turned their gaze skyward, fully expectin
to see a blaze in one of the big office build-
ings, and their disappointment was keen
when they found that the fuss was all oven
a small fire in a wagon,

 

A women’s department has recently been
added in several downtown haberdasheries,
whose stock heretofore has consisted ex-
clusively of men’s furnishings. ‘These
stores, since this innovation, have contained
almost as Many Women custoniers as men,
and apparently have profited by the ex-

periment.

The absence of women's stores in the
business district has long been commented
upon, In streets such as Nassau street,
which have @ constantly growing numper
of stores where men’s things are sold, not
a store can be found where feminine wear
can be purchased, notwithstanding the fact
that thousands of women are employed in
the office buildings nearby and have as
little time for shopping uptown in depart -
ment stores as the average business man.
Now that some stores have decided that a
woman's department is a good thing, it is
not at all unlikely that before long Nassau
street or some other downtown street may
have a woman's depart ment store on asinail
scale wherein the modern biginess woman
can shop.

 

“It is to laugh.” That's the loug suit
of a man who haunts a saloon in Ninth
avenue. Even his name is a joke. He is
called “Troy,” as he hails from that city,
but his real name is Laundry. However,
he in no way suggests the combination of
stiffness and starch that his name might
imply. In fact, he urbends easily, and his
chuckle, rising to a most hearty laugh, is
so infectious that all the world laughs
with him, and beer flows freely.

But there are sorrows of mirth, strange
as il may seem, and this man of laughter
finds his in that he is barred from his favori'e
theatres. He once haunted the , play-
houses of Eighth avenue and found added
oy in the jesters of the stage. But, alas!

e laughed, and soon the audience was
holding its sides; the actors heard him,
and they, too, forgot all else, while a gale of
merriment swept house and stage,

This was all very well till the managers
decided that there was too much outside
talent being “featured.” Perhaps they
feared that Mr. Laundry would demand a
salary. At any rate, the doors are now
closed to him as a disturber of the \
But, true to himself, he laughs at Fate
and holds his sides in remembrance of. the
Joys of yesterday.

DOORS, PORTIERES, SPOTTS,

 

COMBINATION MEANS DISPOSSESS
TO PRINCETON TENANTS.

Landlord Is an Affable Man, but He Will
Have His Own Way—Won’t Discuss
the Difficulty, but the Tenants Do,

The tenants in the Princeton apartment
house, at 257 Efghth street, Jersey City,
put in a busy Sunday yesterday trying to
find out what ails Spotts. In twos, squads
and companies they communed with one
another for most of the day, but at sunset
they didn’t know any more absut what's
troubling Spotts than they did at dawn.

Spotts is Andrew Spotts, owner of the

Princeton apartments and vice-president of

the Lincoln Trust Company of Jersey City.

Up to the middle of last week nobody ever

suggested that there was anything the

matter with him, In faot, if anybody had
asked the question, he would have been
told very promptly that Spotts was all
right. But at that time Spotts hadn't told
his tenants that they'd have to take down
all thelportiéres that were hanging in their
apartments and hang in their stead the
doors that had been made and provided
therefor, and which the tenants had rele-
gated to the cellar.
The tenants: thought at first that the
| order was a joke, but they soon found that

Spotte is no joker when it comes to por-

tiéres and doors, Soon after the verbal

order was issued each of the offending

tenants received a very legal looking docu-
| ment, which proved to be a formal notice
| to get out of the house on or before Jan, 1.
| Then they concluded that something surely

was the matter with Spotts. Many of the

tenants stayed home from church all day

yesterday to see if they could figure out
| what had hit the landlord on the bias, Early
last evening one of the tenants made the
| following statement to a reporter of THE
SUN:

“We can’t, for the lives of us, tell what's
got into Spotts. All the doors in the apart-
ments in this house are swinging doors,
instead of the sliding kind. The apart-
ments are not over large and the swinging
doors were always in the way. Moat of the
tenants therefore coucluded to take down
the doors aud hang portiéres in their places.
The doors were wrapped in poner so that
they wouldn't get marred and put down in

 

the cellar.”

“Yes,” said the tenant's sweet faced wife,
“and some of the tenants have never had the
doors. ‘There are the Quinns, for instance,
who live on the second floor. They have
lived in the house for thirteen years and
they have had portiéres all that time, Then
the Smiths and the Gumaers, who have
lived here a long time, have always had
portiéres. ‘They're 80 much sttier than
doors and go muoh more graceful. They're
not in the way, like those horrid swing-
ing things.”

“Ever have any
before?” asked the reporter.

“Never a word about anything,” said the
husband.

“And he has always kept such a nice
house,” chimed in the young wife. “He has
always been so particular about his tenants.
It isn't everybody, you know, can get in

that. That is why we like it s0 much. And
I tell you, Mr. Spotts is awfully particular

Spotts

about the references. Untilthis thing came
up I thought Mr. Spotts was one of the
nicest men I had ever inet. But they say
he's been 80 different since they elected
him vice-president of the Lincoln Trust
Company.” ;

“What are you all going to do about the
notice to get out?” asked THE SUN man.
“Going to fight it?”

“No,” replied the husband, “I guess
we'll all get. What's the use of fighting?
That takes money and I, for one, haven't
any money to throw away on lawsuits.
Rather have my fun out of court than in.
Besides, none of us ha@ leases for longer
than a month. Locks to me aa if Spotts
had us cinched. But we're not worrying.
He don’t own all the flats in vereey, City,
and I guess we can find another by the
ist of January. Then ho can hang his
doors and hang himself, for all I curs.”

Some information was sought frora the
Quinns about their thirteen years’ experi-
ence with portidres and Snotts.
who is Commissioner of Finance for Jersey
City, was not at hore. In his absence
Mrs. Quinn refused to commit herself on
either doors, portiéres or Spotts. If Mr.
Quinn were at home he would undoubtedly
have something to say, she said, but in his

word; not even a syllable.

Finally, an expression of opinion on the
rolative value of doors and portiéres in
apartinent houses was sought from Mr.
Spotts. He lives around the corner, in
Seventh street, almost in the rear of the
Princeton. 10 look at Spotts no one would
ever suppose that he'd give a hang whether
his tenants Bung portiéres or doors in their
flats. And the first impression is strength-
ened by talking with him. He is a little
man, not more than forty years old, with
keen, dark eyes, prematurely gray hair,
a pleasing voice and a most engaging man-
ner. Indeed, he is rather magnetic.

When ‘lak Sun man told lira what was
wanted, Mr. Spotts said:

“I'm awfully sorry, but I can't say a word
about that matter. I had nothing to do
with any publication of the alleged facts,
and I haven't a word to say. It’s too bad
you came all the way over here for nothing,
and I'm sorry, but still I have nothing to
say.”

It is more than likely that the world will

with

never know what wus the matter

Spotts.

men protested, but this did no good and the
Obsireperous ones took complete posses-

At Prince street the conductor called a

locked up at the Mulberry street station.

Among the passengers who remained on

Aged Farmer Found Dead at His Home
Near Florida, N. ¥.

MIDDLETOWN, N. Y., Nov. 29.—John Coe,
a wealthy retired nonagenarian farmer,
was killed by a buck sheep at his home,
near Florida, on Friday. When his body
was found it was supposed that he
had fallen from a granary stoop, but a
fractured skull and Jeg, with many cuts
and bruises on the head and face, caused
a suspicion that he had been foully dealt
with. Investigation developed evidence
of a struggle and blood marks about the
ground adjacent to where the body was

ound.

The mystery was not solved until
to-day, when members of the family
discovered the head of the buck sheep,

covered with the aged man’s blood. Four

CRUSH JAPAN WITH ONE BLOW

STATEMENT CREDITED TO RUS-
SIAN GENERAL AT TIENTSIN,

 

 

Tells Viceroy Yuan Shi Kal That Bussia
Has Spent Too Much in Manchuria to
Evacuate Now—Growing Irritation in
Japan Over Delay in the Negotiations,

Special Cable Despatch to Tie ScN.

LONDON, Nov. 29.—Despatches from the
Far East indicate growing irritation in
Japan, owing to Russia's delay in concluding
the negotiations regarding Manchuria. Vis-
count Hayashi, the Japanese Minister to
Great Britain, points out the desirability of
Russia’s reply to the Japanese proposals
being received before the meeting of the
Japanese Diet on Dec. 5,

A despatch from Tokio says that M.
Oishi, ex-Minister of Commerce and Agri-
culture, who lately visited Manchuria, has
made a public speech in which he strongly
protested against the continual increase
of the Russian forces in Manchuria, He
declared that Japan must suspend negoti-
ations and demand the instant stoppage
of the sending of Russian reenforcements,
If the demand were not accededto, Japan
should appeal to arms.

The Amiju, a newspaper published in
Tokio, prints a despatch from Tientsin
reporting a conversation between Gen,
Wogack, the Russian commander, and
Yuan Shih Kai, Viceroy of Chili. The
former said that the demand for the evacua-
tion of Manchuria, where Russia had ex-
pended enormous sums of money, was
unreasonable and impossible to fulfil.

Yuan Shih Kai replied that a third Power
would not accept that view. Gen. Wogack
rejoined that the third Power meant Japan,
and Russia could easily crush so small and
poor an opponent with one blow. China,
he added,*had merely to accede to Russia's
wishes.

Admiral Alexieff, Russian Viceroy of the
Far East, has sent the battleship Poltava
and three torpedo boat destroyers to Che-
mulpo, Corea, to back up Russia's demand
for redress in connection with the recent
affray between Russian and Japanese
sailors at that port.

PERIN, Nov. 29.—By the successful in-

of Russian influence to all principal points
in Manchuria, Russia is now supplying
this country with butter, kerosene, flour,

handling lines of goods identical with those
coming from the United States. It is the
intention of the Russians to make a whole-

of Russian Poland is bordering on revolt.
All olasses at Bialystok are in a state of

The Government apprehends a violent

WILL REOPEN DREYFUS CASE.

PREMIER COMBES SENDS ALL
DOCUMENTS TO M. DURAND.

 

 

Dreyfus Overjoyed at the Prospect of
Proying His Innocence—Eyvidence Not
Pat Before His Military Judges
—Forged Documents Were Presented.

Spectal Cable Despatch to THB SUN.

Paris, Nov. 29.—-Official notice has been
given of the intended reopening of the
Dreyfus case. Prime Minister Combes
announces that after an examination of
the dossier communicated to him by Gen.
André, Minister of War, and also the appli-
cation from Dreyfus for a revision of the
Judgment, he bas transmitted all the docu-
ments to M. Durand, counsellor of the
Court of Cassation.

M. Durand, who is a Catholic, will be
assisted by two other counsellors, M. Mari-
gnan, a Protestant, and M, Alphandory, a
Jew. It is expected that a decision will
be reached in a week.

In consequence of the announcement
attempts were made to see ex-Capt. Drey-
fus. He was averse to making any state-
ment except to say that he was overjoyed
at the success of his application. He was
determined to say nothing except to the
members of the commission. .

It is understood that the documents
tending to prove his innocence of the charge
of treason made against him include several
that were not placed before his military
judges, It is‘also said that Gen. André
discovered that two documents which
were submitted to the court martial at
Rennes were forgeries, and he believes that
they must have contributed in a large
measure to the verdict rendered by the
court martial.

ACCUSES A POLICEMAN.

Kemp Says Cop Struck Him and Allowed
Men Who Hobbed Him to Go.

Joseph Kemp of 492 Ninth avenue was
arraigned in the West Side police court
yesterday charged with intoxication, dis-
orderly conduct and causing a crowd to
collect at Forty-second street and Eighth
avenue. Policeman Maloney of the West
Thirty-seventh street station, who arraigned
Kemp, said that he made the arrest at 8
o'clock yesterday morning.

“The prisoner doesn't seem to be intoxi-
cated now,” remarked Magistrate Ommen,
“What have you to say for yourself, young
man?”

“That I am not intoxicated and should not
be here a prisoner,” answered Kemp. “It
was this way. Early this morning I got
in with a couple of other young men and
the bartender in the American Theatre
café. One of the men robbed me of my
scarfpin and even took $3 from my pocket,
See, my pocketistorn. I wenttothe corner
of Forty-second street and told an officer
that I had been robbed and that I wanted
an arrest made. He said that it was not
his post, and then I got this officer. He
knew the bartender. When we got to the
three men the bartender said something to
the policeman and he saicl to one of the
men, ‘Soak him a good one,’ One of the men
hit me in the mouth, and when ] demanded
of the officer that an arrest be made he
struck me and arrested me,”

Kemp stuck to his story, notwithstanding
a long cross examination by the Magistrate.

“There is something very odd about this
case,” announced Magistrate Ommen. “I
think that it will bear an investigation. I
will put the disposition of the case over
until to-morrow,

Kemp was paroled, He got a summons
for the bartender who, he said, was known
as “Gus.” Policeman Maloney said that
all the prisoner’s statements were untrue,
FRYE AND GEN. WOOD.
Former Superintendent of Cuban Schools

May Not Testify for Several Weeks.

Boston, Nov. 28.—Alexis E. Frye of
Cambridge, formerly Superintendent of |
Schools in Ouba under the American régime, |
left. Cambridge on Friday for Havana |
to visit his wife's father, who is seriously |
ill. It is understood that Mr. Frye will |
not visit Wushington at present to give

A, EF.

is now dealing with the nomination of Gen.
Leonard Wood as Major-General.

Gen. Wood was instrumental in having
Mr. Frye leave his place as superintendent
of the Cuban sane and it is asserted by
his friends that Mr. Frye possesses docu- |
mentary evidence against Woodand know!- |
edge bearing on the case which ‘ould |
be of much interest to the public. This,
it is said, will be given at the proper
time,

Mr. Frye is not expected to return to
Boston before a month at least. He will
visit his home in California before coming
back, and it is just possible two or three
months may be consumed in the trip.

THE

M. Bunau-Varilla Gets Evidence of Amer-
fean Business Alertness.

A number of newspaper men who had
sent their cards to M. Bunau-Varilla, the
Minister of the new Isthmian Republic,
at the Waldorf-Astoria, a few days ago,
became conscious of the fact that their
little group was the centre about which a
certain tall, mysterious looking person
was slowly revolving in a halting, uncertain
sort of Orbit. He was a well clad, rather
distinguished looking person, and under
close inspection developed something
furtive in his movements calculated to
stir a mild curiosity in those who watched
him.

When at last M. Bunau-Varilla’s invi-
tation to come up to his room reached
the newspaper men and they moved in a
body toward the elevator the orbit of the
mysterious stranger quickly narrowed
about them, and as the last of the reporters
stepped into the elevator the conspirator,
as the reporters had already begun to call
him, after a moment's hesitation followed
them into the car.

“| beg your pardon,” he asked of one
of the newspaper men, with a Chester-
fieldian bow and much suavity of intona-
tion, “but are you going to see M. Bunau-
Varilla?”

“Tl am,” was the answer.

“Thank you; thank you, sir,” said the
stranger courteously, and with that he
turned his eyes in the direction of the ceil-
ing of the car and seemed lost in medita-
tion. aT

When M. Bunau-Varilla’s floor was
reached and the newspaper men stepped |
out of the elevator the conspirator stepped
out after them. A servant was waiting
to show the visitors to the diplomat's room,
and the conspirator affably made himself
one of the party; but after a few steps he
began to lag behind,and when M. Bunau-

the rear and had resumed apparently the }
sume standing-off-aud-on tactics which |
had first attracted attention to him down!
on the office floor. |

M. Bunav-Vanrila had been talking to his
visitors maybe five minutes when there
came a discreet knock at the door. The
servant was there.

“This gentleman,” ho said, indicating the
conspirator, “says he has a word to suy to
yuu in confidence and wants to know it
you will be kind enough to step out into
the ball for a moment.”

The polite Frenchman instantly com- |
plied with the request and after a moinent !
came back laughing. |

Former Army Officer With Iiis Mother in
Chicago—Declares That He Has No
Resentment Against the Honest Men
Who Voted to Convict Him—Hls Suits.

Cuicaao, Noy. 29.—“Happiness is within
my grasp again after four years of purga-
tory. Iama free man. My debt is paid;
I bear no malice, The past is buried, and
the future looms up brightly before me.”

With his mother’s arm thrown over his

shoulder, Oberlin M. Carter, former Captain .
of Engineers in the United States Army, |
released on Saturdey morning from Fort |

Leavenworth prison, stood in the parlor
of his mother’s home to-night and received
the congratulations of a few intimate friends
invited to the family reunion,

“I do not care to say anything that will
reflect the least upon the men who tried
me,” he said. “They acted probably in the
only way they knew how. The honest men

among them will be more punished by the |
remorse they will feel, if 1 am exonerated

in my coming trial, as I fully expect to be.
As to the others, if a man is intentionally
unfair, there is no good in criticising him.

“With the new evidence which has veen
collected since the court-martial I propose
to make a fight for vindication, At the
time of the court-martial it was said that
if it could be proved that I received $400,000
in railroad bonds and sums of money from
inv fasier-in-law, Mr. Westcott, and that
I had no reason to believe that the money
had been received from Gaynor and Greene,
the contractors, as commraission on Govern-
ment contracts, I would have escaped
imprisonment,

“T did not have the power at that time to
compel my father in-law to testify in my
behalf and, although there was no evidence
to show that I was guilty, [ was condemned
op a suspicion. The Government has
brought suit in several cities to recover the
money and securities I received from m
father-in-law, and which, it is
eame frou: Gaynor and Greene.

these suits is brought before the Federal ;

Court in Chicago, and, by an agreement

between myself and the Government, the |

outcome of the Chicago suit is to settle all
of the others. { have no other plans for
the future.”

MAN IN CARBONIFEROUS AGE?

Speculation Aroused by Discovery of
Vossilized Box Below Coal Veins.

PrrrspurG, Kan., Nov. 29.~—An interest-
ing find, which will attract much attention
from students of archeology, has been
made by miners in a new shaft sunk by the
Weir Junction Coal Company on the Ker
farm, south of Cherokee.

Imbedded in the fire clay below the
second vein of coal, at a depth of fifty feet,
was a box made of bark, which contained
three arrowheads crudely made of flint.
The box was fossilized. The compara-
tively close proximity to the surface
might lead to the belief that an ancient
well or shaft might have been sunk
in the prairie years ago and the bor
with ils arrowheads might have been
dropped down the well by the savage pos-
sessor, but the miners say the ooal veins
had not been disturbed and such a well
could not have been sunk and filled up
without being shown in the two coal veins
which were above the fire clay.

On this theory the finding of the box
indicates that there was human life ante-
dating the carboniferous era, when the coal
was formed

STEAMSHIP HELD TWO HOURS.

Quarantine Physician Was at Church anc

PHILADELPHIA, Nov. 29.—Because Dr.
Wicks, the surgeon in charge of the quaran-
tine station at Reedy Island, attended
church to-day the steamship Noordland,
. With fifty cabin passengers and 361 steer-

age passengers, was held up for two hours
| at the quarantine station, This afternoon
‘when the steamship approached Reedy
Island there was a brisk hunt for the doc-
‘tor. He was nowhere to be found. The
passengers fretted and a report that dis-
ease, discovered on board, had caused thi+
hold up and threatened an indefinite delay,
' increased the confusion.
| After two hours bad elapsed an exolteri
| attaché saw Dr. Wicks quietly walking ou!
of the church. No one had thought of
looking there.

“That was certainly a fine sermon,” said
the physician.

The situation was explained to him anii
he rushed to the vessel. The examinatio:
was put through in quick time and the
Noordland steamed on. It was explained
later that the failure of the operator at the
