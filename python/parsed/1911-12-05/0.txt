| WAR RISK INQUIRIES,

Disquiet Caused in England by German
Firms Who Fear a Clash,
Special Cable Despatch to THR SuN

LONDON, Dec, 4. A feeling of disquiet
has been caused here by the fact that a
number of inquirles were made here to-
day concerning the rates on war risks in
the event of a clash between Ger nany

It is reported that 7 per cent. was
quoted for six months and 10 per cent.
|for a year. The inquiries came from
some important business firms in Ger-
many, who fear that the political situa-
tion has not improved since the state-
ment made by Sir Edward Grey in the

Phe Government names John H, Patter
sou, the owner of the majority stock of
the company and its president, and

twenty-seven other officers, directors and
agents, most of ym live in Dayton
Ohio, as defenda in the suit The
company's plant ia in Dayton, occupying
140 acres of ground, with nine factory
structures and having branch factories
at Berlin, Germany, and Toronto, Canada

The Government charges that the
company has undersold competitors at
unprofitable prices, drawn exclusive con-
| tracts and brought expensive lawsuits.

The Government's complaint contains
other allegations, however, that are more
startling. It is alleged for instance that
the company maintained a room in the
factory at Dayton in which it exhibited
the “scalps” of competitors whieh it
had forced out of business. This room
was known as the “graveyard” and the
Government charges that prospective
manufacturers of cash registers were
intimidated by sight of this exhibit of
concerns that had fallen in the struggle
against the National.

“In this room,” says complaint,
“were shown competing
companies which had been forced out of
business by the methods above set out
Prominent display cards reporting the
names of these companies, the dates when
they went out of business and the amount

of money lost by them appeared in

this display and it was pointed out to
them by the said officers and their agents

“This process of

known asthe ‘glooming room.’ Thousands
of merchants and other visitors to the
factory were shown this exhibit and told
that it wonld be useless to buy other cash
registers becatise competing concerns
would soon go out of business and fail to
maintain the guarantees given with their
registers.”
Phe petition charges that the corpora
tion maintained a department for the pur
pose of stifling and suppressing competi-
tion This department was called the “ways
/and means department " The Govern-
| ment alleges that a force of special men
was maintained to suppress and destroy
the busineas of competitors These
special Inen were known as “knockout”
men and were employed, so the petition
charges, for the special purpose of inter-
fering with sales by competitors This
department, the Government avers, also
employed secret agents to spy upon the
business of the National's competitors
and fraudulently obtain information in
regard to sales and shipments. Other
secret spies, it says, were employed to
| report the names of customers who pat-
| ronized competitors of the National
|The petition charges further that the
National bought the employees of its
competitors and obtained confidential
information. The competition depart-
| ment, the Government alleges, instructed
| agents how to manipulate competing cash
registers so as to show defects.

The National, so the complaint charges,

‘instructed ita agents to pursue a war of
extermination of competitors

| The Government contends that this
conspiracy has been going on since 1890 |
and that the National has succeeded in
destroying more than 150 cash register
| companies and as a result controla to-day |
more than 95 per cent. of the trade. The
Government asks that the defendants be
perpetually restrained from doing the|
things complained of.

Rates was destroyed. The loss is estimated
at about $75,000. It is believedthat the

rhese men are to be arrested, it is said
to-night, without delay

Ortie MeManigal to-night told THE Suw
correspondent that Job Harriman, S»-
cialist candidate for Mayor of Los An-
geles, knew months ago, as did Clarence
Darrow, that the McNamaras were guilty
and admitted much to him

Another disclosure to-night was the
lfact that for the last three or four weeks
J. J. McNamara had been subjected to the
lthird degree, Each day some witness
| brought here by the State who knew him
| well took a position in the court room
where McNamara could not help but see
‘him, One day a girl who had been his
sweetheart sat in and when she
caught his eye she pointed to a sealakin
coat he had given her. Another time it
was a man who had been McNamara’s
confidant,

court

Each day McNamara brought to

realize more and more that the chain of

was

evidence had been welded, for each day
he saw some new witness who he realized
could give damaging testimony facing
him

This afternoon the Federal Court Grand
held a after

hastily called together to start an investi-

Jury short session being
gation of the dynamiting crimes of the

MeNamaras and their associates. It
will meet again Thursday

| attachment against Darrow,

Lecompte Davis, Joseph Seott, C. F

MeNutt and J. Bo Harriman, attorneys
for the McNamaras, for $5,750. Bullard
| is the assignee of I. H. Lovering, a civil
engineer, who alleges that dhe furnished
maps, drawings and surveys of the Times

building, at First street and Broadway,
and whose bill, it is alleged in the com-

plaint, has been repudiated. No return
has been made on the attachment, but
it is understood that it will issue against
| the $10,000 bail money furnished by Davis
for Bert Franklin

In addition to the Federal investigation
that is being made in Indianapolis the
Federaf Grand Jury here will begin an
investigation into the dynamiting con-
spiracy which is believed to have been
nation wide in its extent.

This investigation will begin with the
return of United States District Attorney
A. 1. McCornffick from Washington, where
he has been conferring with the United
States Attorney-General in regard to the
{McNamara cases. It is probable that an
Assistant United States Attorney will
arrive here with him, or perhaps within
| the next few days, to assist in presenting
| the evidence to the Federal Grand Jury.
| Detective McLaren of the Burns agency
| said that he expected the Federal inves-
| tigation to open here within the next
fifteen days and that the Federal Grand
Jury will investigate the transfer of dyna-
mite in violation of the interstate come
merce law and along other lines
“The plea of guilty on the part of the
MecNamaras only starts the investigation
here,” said Detective McLaren this after-
noon. “Before this is through many of the
men higher up in the gigantic conspiracy
will be caught. Many of the States have
good cases and the national Government
has a splendid case. I look for an in-
vestigation on the part of the Federal
Grand Jury to open here within the next
two weeks, that is, with the return of
United States Attorney MeCormick.”

Asked if the McNamara brothers would
be held here to testify before the Federal
Grand Jury Detective McLaren said that
he would reserve his answer for enother
