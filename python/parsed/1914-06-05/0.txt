bles taken consisted of watches, rings,
stickpins and brooches, :

Edward 8, Clinch, @ former Justice of
the Supreme Court, who lives at 133 West

WASHINGTON, June 4.—The Mexican
situation is in a worse muddle to-night
than at any other time since the media-
upon thelr conferences at
Niagara Falls, Not only does Carranza
remain an unknown factor in the prob-
lem, but new developments fraught with
grave possibilities have arisen in connec-
tion with the sailing of the Ward liner
Antilla for Tampico with a cargo of arms
for the Constitutionalists,

As a result of the clearing of the An-
tilla the United States is confronted on
the one hand with the danger of sus-
picion by the mediators that this Gov-
ernment has not acted in good faith in
support of an understanding that there
would be no shipments of arms from this
country to Mexico pending the Niagara
Falls conferences, On the other hand if
the United States attempts to interfere
as now seems likely, with a blockade of
Tampico to be instituted by Huerta, tt
will lay itself open to @ charge of vio-

divorce from her husband, Dr. John Dun-
can Emmet of 95 Madison avenue, and

Pope Pius, leaving her free to remarry if

| Connecticut, by Judge Tuttle on May 14,

The petition was filed by Mrs. Emmet on
1913. She alleged that her
husband deserted her on August 1, 1908.
While the allegation of desertion was op-
posed on behalf of Dr, Emmet, the jude-
ment rendered was that he “did wilfully
desert the plaintiff on August 1, 1908, and
continued said desertion with total neglect
of all of the duties of marriage for more
than three years and until date of judg-
ment.”

That a divorce had been granted did
become known until it was learned
that Mrs. Emmet had sailed on the Ham-

CONTRADICTS BIG POINTS
IN MELLEN’S TESTIMONY
Gives New Versions of Billard,
B. & M. and Westches-
ter Transactions.

 

 

Wasninoton, June 4.-—-Charles 3. Mele
len's account of his martyrdom in New
Haven railroad affairs was flatly contra-
dicted to-day by Lewis Cass Ledyard, whe
appeared in the witness chair before the
Interstate Commerce Commission.

Mr. Ledyard gave a detailed account
from his standpoint of incidents leading
up to Mr. Mellen’s indictment in the so-
called Grand Trunk case.
not only contradicted Mr,

His testimony
Mellen's state

ments on the stand, but was designed
to show that Mr. Mellen and not the late
J. P. Morgan was responsible for the

traffic arrangement with the Grand Trunk

which resulted in criminal prosecution
under the Sherman law against Mp.
Melien. Referring to the Grand Trunk

case Mr. Ledyard said:

“I want to say in the most emphatic
terms that Mr. Mellen did not go forward
and offer himself as a vicarious sacrifice
and take on himself the full responsi-

bility in order to shield Mr. Morgan. There
was nothing like that.

Mellen Wrote Letter,

“Mr. Mellen wrote hfs letters assuming
responsibMity at his own suggestion. He
asked me !f I thought it not a wise thing
to do and I told him I thought it was
The only things done that mude any one
subject to indictinent, if they did, were

(done by Mr. Mellen, and on his own show-

ing Mr. Morgan had done nothing.”

Mr. Ledyard’s statement in regard to
the Grand Trunk case came at the ena
of an interesting recital of his expert-
ences as a director of the New Haven
road. In the course of his testimony
there were many other statements directly
contradicting those made by moeiueu.

Mr. Ledyard expressed the opinion that
Mellen dominated the New Haven board
4s much as any one and he characterized
as false statements made by Mr. Mellen
in connection with the extension by the
Boston and Maine Railroad of a contract
{t had with the American Express Com-
pany.

Mr. Ledyard in appearing before the
commission offered to be sworn and waive
immunity. The commission had cancelled
Mr. Ledyard'’s subpwna, apparently in
deference to representations made by the
Department of Justice, but had informed
him that he could appear and make a
voluntary statement. He was not sworn
as a witness.

Willing to Take Oath.

Mr. Ledyard discussed the affairs of
the New Haven with the utmost frank-
ness and said he was willing to make all
his statements under oath.

In connection with the Grand Trunk
matter Mr. Ledyard said he went to Bu-
rope some time after the Titanic disaster
in May, 1912, and came back for a short
business trip in September, 1913.

“In the few days that I was in New
York,” said Mr. Ledyard, “I saw Mr
Morgan. I very rarely had a talk about
New Haven matters with Mr. Morgan out-
eide of the board. He did not seem te
take much interest in talking about them
outside of the board, but tfis time he
bekged me to stay over for the next New
Haven meeting.

“He said: ‘Mr. Mellen has got some
thing that he Is going to lay before the

board about the Grand Trunk.’ J asked
him what and he replied: ‘I do not
know.’ ;

“What is the nature of Kis proposi-

tion?” I asked. Mr. Morgan replied: ‘f
do not know what it is. He has been
having some negotiations with the Grand
Trunk people.’ I said to him: ‘I don't
think, commodore, that I can wait. Now
let me urge upon you If that thing comes
before the New Haven board that you tn
sist on getting the independent advice of
outside counsel who knows that sftuation
and whose advice will carry welght.’

Suga@ests Olney for Counsel.

“Who would you suggest” Mr. More
man asked. I sald ‘Richard Olney. He
knows all these subjects, Let me beg of
you that before the New Haven has com-
mitted {itself or anything is done, get
Mr. Olney's advice in the matter.’ My {tm-
pression is that one of his partners, Mr,
Davison, was present at the time,

“T went back to Europe," continued Mr.
Ledyard, “and I returned from there In
December to find conflagiation all around
the New Haven road, Mr. Mellen In proc-
ess of being Indicted by the Grand Jury,
the Rhode Island papers creating @ great
agitation in respect to the suspension of
the Grand Trunk extension into New
England and general agitation throughout
New England,

“I saw Mr. Mellen and I asked him
what had been going on. He told me hie
story. I am bound to say that he told {t
pretty much as he told /t here, He said
that after the death of President Hays
of the Grand Trunk he hed taken the
