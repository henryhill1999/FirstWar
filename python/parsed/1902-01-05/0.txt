prinenry EPISODE DROPPED
—~GOLDWATER TOLD QF IT.

 

Alderman Mathews Angry With the Mayor
Says Detectives Have Been Watch-
ing Tim —Cauers Rewards Gold-
water—Leaves Committees to Fornes,

After the caurets of the fusion Aldermen
wcesterdey afternoon, President Fornes
anrour wd that the report of an attempt
by Tammany to bribe one of the members
of the board made to Mayor Low was re-
garced as a closed incident. “Mr. Fornes
said also thet the fusionists would posi-
tively contro! the organization of the board
and that the fear of Tammany control
wos past

The man who reported that an effort

d been made to induce him to leave
tye fusion ranks was Alderman Goldwater

«tf the Thirty-eighth district, a new mem-

ber of the Board, and the matter was pre-

sented ‘o President Fornes, President

Cantor and Mayor Low by Alderman Dow-

Ninth. The caucus has put

r '
g of the
yoldwater on the slate for a membership

the Committee of Rules, and some of the |

Aidermen said that had they thought of
it they would have been approached by
Tammany, and have got good committee
places themselves. Goldwater is a new man
in the board and the place that he will
have would usually be given to some mem-
Ler of experience

Alderman Dowling’s story is that Gold-

iter came to him and said

 

members of the Tammany minority

1o jein them, and that they had offered
im committee places and everything else

‘hat he could ask for. Mr. Dowling, who
sa Sheehan man and regards a Tammany
‘nan as a bad citizen anyway, told Mr
Goldwater that he ought to tell Mr. Fornes.
Apparently Goldwater did not do this,
‘or Dowling himself went to Fornes and
the two went to Mayor Low. In the mean-
time the facta had been laid before Presi-
dent Cantor, and he said that he thought
steps ought to be taken to frustrate any
other attempt to bribe a fusionist
it was decided that the Mayor should issue

the statement that he had ready on Friday |

evening, which, it was believed, would
prevent any Aldermen from betraying
their constituents. The matter rested
at this point until the meeting of the cau-

us yesterday.

When the caucus met, Alderman Gold-
water said that he did not know that he
was the man who was referred to in Mayor
Low's statement and who was talked about
by Mr. Fornes and Mr. Dowling.

“J did not tell Mr. Dowling that I had

received an offer of money,” said Gold-
water. “All that I said was that there had
been very general talk among the Tam-
many men that they would do well by any
rean who voted with them in the organiza-
tion of the board, and | said that they had
said that they would give that man good
committee places, and al! sorte of things
like that. I did not have any idea of saying
that they had offered money to me and
did not say 60. Where this renors of $5,000
having been offered to any came
from f do not know. All that I told Dow-
ling was that they bad said that they would
be glad to do well by any man who was
willing to vote with them and give them
the control of the board, and I have not
had any idea of taking up with their offer,
That is all that there is to the matter and
the whole thing is over so far as I am con-
cerned.”

President Fornes was asked if there was
ny intention of taking the matter to the
Crrand Jury. He ead that there was not
md that there never had heen

“As far as I am concerned,” eaid Mr
Fornes, “the incident is closed, and there
wil) be nothing further dune about it. It is
all over. We will surely control the board
at its organization Fvervy man who was
elected to it on the fusion ticket will be in
hia seat, if it is and all of them
who are in their seats will vote with the
fusion forces There will be enough of
them to control and organize the board.”

The caucus decided that the organiza-
tion of the committees should be left to
he attended to after the board was orga’ -

ized. Wt is expected that the beard will
leave to the President the naming of the
mmoroittees, the *) he will be guided by
the leaders of majority. Thus, the
members of the cancus said last evening

inducements had been held out to him |

Then |

'

| any man who was absent without a sufficient
| excuse would lay himself open to the charge
of bribe taking. A sick man ought not to
be subjected to such a charge. I knew

 

 

 

nothing about t matter until 1 beard
rom pers last night of the charge
that tho yor had made. It explained

a great deal to me. During my conval-
escencs I have been eitting at my window
a great deal and I observed that there were
two men opposite the house all the time,
| apparently watching something. They
| were relieved at intervals and one of thera
was on duty all the time. It is quite ap-
ent now that they were werenng my
ouse, in the belief that they might learn
something about me. They are welcome
to watch all that they please, though it
| does not please me to think that I may
have been under suspicion,”

FIRE AT MRS. SIMEON DRAPER'S,

The Aged Head of the House Carried to
the Street by a Fireman.

A fire which was discovered shortly after
noon yesterday in the residence of Mra.
Simeon Draper, 320 Lexington avenue, did
considerable damage to the house and
furnishings. The fire ‘started in the rear
on the third floor and was not discovered

| until it had spread to the front of the house
| and burst out the front windows. Then a
| passerby noticed the flames and turned in
an alarm after he had notified the family.

Mre. Draper occupied the house with her
two daughters, Miss Mary H. Draper and
Miss Fanny Draper. When the fire was
discovered Mrs. Draper, who is 91 years
old, was on the second floor. She was
carried to the first floor by a servant, and
later a fireman carried her to the house of
a friend across the street.

Mre. Draper is the widow of Simeon
Draper who was an active personal and
political friend of William H. Seward, but
soon after (he formation of the Republican
varty he opposed Gov. Seward's policy.
| He was provost marshal for New York
| city in 1862 and later was appoinied Col-
| lector of the Port of New York by Presi-
dent Lincoln

The third floor of the house was gutted
| by the flames and much of the furniture and
furnishings were badly damaged by water.
| The fire is supposed to have been caused
| by a defective flue. The damage is esti-
| mated at $2,000.
| While the fire was in progress the police
; found a man suffering from a broken ankie
| in the back yard of a house next door to
‘the burning building. He admitted that
he had tried to climb from the Drapers’
yard and had fallen, but he would not

 

 

 

 

 

he was James Bentham and that he lived
at Guttenburg, N. J. He was arrested
| and sent to the Bellevue prison ward

 

 

| PLANS FOR SPEYER BUILDING.

| They Show Some Radical Changes From the
Usual Banking House.

Plans for the Speyer Building which is to

 

| Department yesterday. The structure is
interesting owing to the fact that it is a
departure from the present tendency toward
| skyscrapers, The building will be a three
story structure which will be occupied
entirely by Speyer & Co.
It will he erected within a short distance
| of the tallest buildings in town, while on an
adjoining plot a realty company plans to put
| up a twelve-story office build ng. The plot
' on which the latter will be erected is identical
jin sive to that of the proposed Speyer
Building, but will cost $75,000 more than
} it. the diference representing the value
added to the plot by the fact that a plentiful
eupply of light and air for an indefinite
period will be assured to the office building.
There is little in the appearance of the
Speyer Building sugzestive of a banking
house. The chief point aimed at in the
construction of banking buildings vears ago
was protection. The whole appearance
| of thisfmodern building will be more in the
| nature of a private house than abank. | ndue
presonsee from thieves is not required
| hecause there will be little that thieves could
steal, as the staple of a modern bank in
not cash but credit, In the cellar there will
be a vault for the safe deposit of securitios
and valuable papers. The structure will
cost $200,000

THE CARNEGIE INSTITUTION.

A BRODY INCORPORATED TO HAN-
DLE THE 810,000,000 GIFT.
Formally Organized at
the State Department, With John
Hay as One of the Incerporators
~ Objects of the Institution Set Forth,

The Institation

WasnINGTon, Jan. 4.—Andrew Carnegie’s
$10,000,000 gift to the United States Goy-
ernment for educational purposes will be
handled by a corporation known as the
“Carnegie Institution,” which was organ-
ized at the State Department to-day. The
fund will be under the direct charge of a
board of trustees, some of the members of
which constitute the incorporators. These
men, six in number, were present at the
organization meeting and signed the ar-
ticles of incorporation, which were after-
ward filed in the office of the Recorder of
Deeds. The incorporators are John Hay,
Secretary of State; Edwin D. White, As-
sociate Justice of the Supreme Court of
the United States; Charles D. Walcott,
Superintendent of the United States Geolog-
ical Survey; John S. Billings, formerly
Surgeon-General of the United States Army
and Daniel C. Gilman, until recently
President of Johns Hopkins University of
Baltimore, who is regarded as Mr. Carne-
gie’s personal representative, and Carroll
D. Wright, United States Commissioner of
Labor.

When the incorporators assembled in
in Secretary Hay’'s office the articles of
incorporation, which had been prepared in
advance, were read and there was some
discussion of the scope of Mr. Carnegie's
scheme of higher education in conjunction
with the scientific, literary and art branches
of the United States Government. William
MeNeir, a notary public of the State De-
partment, was called in and attested the
signatures of the incorporators and affixed
the necessary seals. Marcus
the Geological Survey, took the articles of
incorporation to the office of the Recorder
of Deeds, where they were made a matter
of record. It is the intention to have the
institution incorporated also by act of
Congress. The suggestion that an incorpo-

rated body be furmed somewhat similar |

to the Smithsonian Institution, to properly
care for the great fund which Mr. Carnegie

has established, is raid to have resulted
from the objection to having the Govern-
ment made the custodian of the $10,000,000
bonds of the United States Steel Corpora-
tion. The suggestion is understood to
have originated with Mr. Carnegie

The articles of incorporation set forth
that the inco rators desire to establish
and maintain in the city of Washington,
“in the spirit of Washington,” (an evident
reference to the first President's desire
to establish a national university) ‘‘an in-
stitution for promoting original research
in science, literature and art.” The term
for which the institution is organized is
stated to be “perpetual.” The particular
objects and business of the institution, in
addition to the promotion of study and re-
search, are set forth as follows:

“To acquire, hold and convey real estate
and other property necessary or the purpose
of the institution and to establish general
and specific funds.

“To conduct, endow and assist investi-

tion in any department of scientific

terature or art, and to this end to co-
operate with Governments, universities
colleges, technical schools, learned societies
and individuals.

“To appoint committees of experts to
direct special !ines of research

“To publish aad distribute documents,

| to conduct lectures aud to hold meetings

*To acquire and maintain a library and,

| in general, to do and perform all things

necessary to promote the objects of the
institution.”

There are to be thirty-seven trustees
for the first year, and after that not more
than thirty, unless tie board, by a three-
fourths vote, shall decide otherw.se

DRAWN BATTLE IN OFT0.

Foraker Wins tn the Senate and Hanna tn
the House.

Co.umsBus, Ohio, Jan. 4.—The factional
fight for control of the Legislature between
Senators Foraker and Hanna resulted
in a division of the honors in the cau«
cuses which were held to-day, The Foraker
people secured the victory in the Senate
by a decisive majority and the Hanna
people dominated in the House, Senator
Foraker’s triumph in the Senate was the
more pronounced, his candidates winning
by a vote of 14to7. The result in the House
was 38 to 80 in favor of Hanna. The latter,
as will be seen, by adding the vote of the
respective leaders in the two branches,
however, had a bare majority of one vote
in the entire Legislature among the Republi-
cans,

The Foraker people had the votes pledged
until yesterday. There were desertions
during the day which reduced their strength
to two short of a caucus majority. Last
night the contest was settled in favor of the
Hanna slate by eeveral doubtful members
declaring in favor of W. S. McKinnon of
Ashtabula county, the Hanna candidate
for the House Speakership.

Cincinnati, Jan, 4.--Senator Foraker,
when asked for a statement on the Ohio
Legislature fight to-night, said:

“I did all I could to support Mr. Price,
but without an unkind word or thought of
In fact, the only regret i
had in connection with the matter was
that the situation compelled me to oppose
so gooda man. The excitement over the
contest in the House has overshadowed
what was done In the Senate.

“The whole trouble commenced there,
end in the Senate was fought out a far
more decisive contest than was had in the
House. Taken al! in all, there is no cause
for anybody except the immediate par-
ticipants to be disappointed.

“The Republican party in the Legiela-
ture will now present a solid front, aid go
forward without further friction to the
faithful and successful discharge of its
duties of legislation.”

PEAPACK DISCOVERS CAVES,
Glistening Stalactites in Chambers Under
the Heart of the Town.

SoMFRVILLE, N. J, Jan. 4—There was
excitement in Peapack to-day over the
discovery of a cave and a number of sub-
terranean passages in the heart of the
town, None of inhabitants

the oldest

had any knowledge of the existence of the |

cave. Lime rock has been taken from
the great hill on the west side of the main
street of the town for many years. It
was in blasting the lime rock in the quarry
of Philip Todd yesterday that the mouth
of the cave was found. On entering the
cave with their lamps the workmen were
dazzled by clusters of stalactites, The
cave was large enough to hold a hundred
people, A large opening was discovered
near the top, A ladder was procured
and the men passed through the opening
to a second charnber somewhat smaller
than the first, which also was hung with
stalactites,

There was another passage leading to a
third chamber smaller than the first two,

| and leading from this was a subterranean

passage about three feet wide. A mimber
of young men of the village worked their

way through this passage for several
hundred feet. They then lost courage
and backed out. Further explorations

will be continued on Monday under the
direction of the Rev. William Johnson,
pastor of the Peapack Reformed Church,
who has taken a great interest in the mat-
ter. The discovery was made in the big
hill on the summit of which L. C. Blair,
grandeon of the late John 1. Blair, is putting

| up a costly dwelling

RECEIVER FOR CRUDE RUBBER '2"%0% #-2x0w semrs asuone

 

FLINT
LADD,

& CO. HAVE WILLIAM W.
JR, APPOINTED.

LAabfilities, Direct and Indirect, Are $5,000,-
000, Assets 83,000,000, Capital
$1,000,000 —On Watkinson Paper for
8800,000—Siatement by Cromwell.

The Crude Rubber Company with which
Charles R. Flint has been connected went
into the hands of a receiver yesterday. The
company is a Virginia corporation with a
capital of $1,000,000. Mr. Flint was a direct-
or of the com pany but he resigned that office
some time ago. The difficulties of the
com pany first came to public attention a
week ago yesterday, when the Hempstead
Bank of Hempstead, L, I., secured an at-
tachment against the company and against
George Watkinson & Co, of Philadelphia
at the same time for $5,009 because of a
protested note of tlie Watkinson concern
which the Rubber company had indorsed
It was said then that in all likelihood the
condition of the Cride Rubber Company
would be found to depend upon the situa-
tion of the Watkinson company’s affairs
That company had failed, and the heavy
liability of the Crude Rubber Company
on Watkinson paper which it had indorsed
caused Mr. Flint's firm of Flint & Co, to
apply for a receivership of the Rubber
company's affairs yesterday to forestall
any preferences among creditors. The
receivership was epplied for and secured
first in Virginia and afterward in the United
States Circuit Court in this city.

William Nelson Cromwe!] of Sullivan
& Cromwell, counsel for the receiver of
the Crude Rubber Company and for Flint
& Co., with Mr. Hill of Mr, Cromwell's
firm, and William F. Goldbeck as attorney
for the rubber company, called upon Judge
E. Henry Lacombe of the Federal court
at the Judge’s home in the Clinton, in West
Forty-second street, early last. evening,
and after a hearing before the Judge Mr.
Cromwell made this statement:

“On the application of Flint & Co
Robert R. Prentis of the Circuit Court of
the city of Norfolk to-day appointed William
W. Ladd, Jr., receiver of the Crude Rubber
Company in that juriedienan Thereupon,
Mr. Cromwell and Mr. Hill of Sullivan &

| Cromwell, attorneys for Flint & Co., with

attorney for the

William F. Goldheck,
filed

Crude Rubber Company

| proceedings before Judge FE. Henry La-

; fin the

combe of the United States Circuit Court
for this district, and Judge Lacombe con-
firmed the appointment of Mr. Ladd as
receiver here aleo. The bond of the re-
cniver is for $50,000 in each jurisdiction.
“The action was taken in the interest of
the creditors and stockholders of the Crude
Rubber Company, and to prevent prefer-
ences by attachment and dismemberment
of the property and assets of the company
The bill of complaint sets forth that the
Crude Rubber Company was organized
under the laws of Virginia in April,
1887, and that the officers are Henry Farle,

. Judge |

ancillary |

Vice-President,and P. De Lacy Liebermann, |

Treasurer and Secretary, with offices at
25 Broad street, this city.

*The company has conducted a large
business in South America and tn this
country. The present stock and mer-
chandise consist of rubber and bills re-
ceivable to the amount of over $5,000,000,

mostly under pledge to bankers. The direct |

liabilities are stated at about $3,000,000,
and quarantees and indorsements at about
$2,000,000, of which about $800,900 Is in re-

spect of r of George Watkinson &
Co. of Philadelphia who failed a few days
ago for severa! millions

“It is not believed that the failure of the
Crude Rubber Company will disturb the
rubber market, as the stock of rubber is
held largely by bankers who are well se-
cured and are wnder no necessity to sell

“Mr. Ladd will be recognize! as a gentle-
man especially equipped for the discharge
of the important duties of hia position
He was for many years Deputy City Cham-
berlain of New York city, and was until a
few days ago an Assistant ( orporation
Counsel and the persona! ac vieer of Mayor
Van Wyck, and was a candicate for Comp-
troller at the late clection.”

Umbria Of With Him—Lost Ris Cane
Hart Jumped for Ferryboat—Dead.

Vernon H. Brown, agent of the Cunard
Line at this port, was so wrapped up in
business aboard the steamship Umbria,
which sailed at noon yesterday for Queens-
town and Liverpool, that he wasn't aware
that the ship was moving out. The gang-
plank had been partly lowered and the
liner had backed twenty-five feet when Mr.
Brown appeared at the gangway. He
made a gallant jump for the plank, bumping
his hat and losing his cane overboard, but
he gotashore. Longshoremen vainly fished
for the cane in the drifting stuff alongside
the pier.

As the ferryboat South Brooklyn was
about to leave her slip at Pier 2, Eact River,

yesterday, Hugh Hart ran through the
ferryhouse and out to the bridge. The
boat was ten feet from her slip. Hart

made a flying leap. He came down on his
stomach on the sharp edge of the deck
and fell into the water. Policemen Man-

RICH MEN MUST SHOULDERGUNS.

 

To Be No Royal Road to Promotion tn
the Twelfth Hereafter.

In the future no one, not even those
possessing millions, can obtain a com-
mission in the Twelfth Rugiment of this
city without enlisting first as a private,
and shouldering a rifle, like any other ordi-
nary enlisted man. Col. Dyer, who com-
mands the regiment, determined upon
this course yesterday, and the rule will
be followed strictly in all applications
for cormmissions from civil life

The Colonel has not decided upon this
programme because ho is dissatisfied with
any of his officers, but as a safeguard to
the regiment in the future. So many
applications fron men of high social
standing who have had no military experi-
are being received that, to avoid
the possibility of some incompetent slip-
ping through, it has been deemed wise
that all such applicants for commissions
shall join the recruit class and learn thor-
oughly as a private the AB Cs of soldiering.

PATROLMEN MUSTN'T LOUNGE.

Military Bearing and Vigilant Patrolling
Fxacted of them.

In the police stations on the lower East
Side last night an order was read from
the Inspector directing the patrolmen to
be more vigilant in patrolling their posta.
The men were instructed that they must
be very careful in trying doors and also
at the same time maintain a military bear-
ing and look “snappy.”

The order did not mention that Col.
Partridge asked for this, but seemed to
come directly from the Inspector

The patrolmen were also notified that
all children under 16 years old found on
the streets should be sent to the Gerry
society's rooms.

There was a fine judicial muddle in Brook-
lyn yesterday, over the refusa! of ex-Magis-
trates Dooley, Naumer, Furlong, Higgin-
botham and O'Reilly to recognize their
successors, who were elected in Novamber,
and their determination to prevent the
latter from taking their seats in their re-

uncompromising attitude on
the strength of the opinion of Supreme
Court Justice Marean, which held that

There
were some exciting ®cenes in the court
and Corporation Counsel
Rives, Pclice Cormunissioner Partridge and
Sheriff Guden quickly became involved
in the controversy. Col. Partridge, who
had been notified of the situation Tate on
Friday night, sent a communication yester-
day morning to Carporation Counsel Rivea,
asking for his advice. Shortly before
noon Col. Partridge received this response
from Mr. Rives:

The Hon. John Partridge. Commiasioner ef
alice of Citu of New Yor

Sin--I have received your communication
of Jan. 4, 1902, in which you inform me that
the injunction heretofore issued against
you by Mr. Justice Marean in Kings country,
restraining you from recoenizing as legally
clected officess the persons elected to tha
oMioe of City Magistrates in the borough of
Brooklyn at the last election, has been vVa-
ented and set aside, and in which you ask me
to advise you ns to your duty in the premises

In reply 1 beg to state that T believe it
to be your duty as an administrative oMcer
to give full faith and credit to the act of the
Tegisiature providing for the election of City
Magistrates in the borough of Brooklyn at
the annual election of 1091, and to recognize
the persons so elected as the lawful ineum-
bents of the office of City Magistrates in ths
borough of Frookiyn

Some questions may arise in view of the
fact that in the opinion of Mr Justice Marean.
vacating the injunction heretofore granted,
a doubt is expressed as to the validity of th
act of the Legislature authorizing the eat
election According to the strict and ore
dinary rules of leeal interpretation whatever
opinion was expressed by the learned Court
on this point is purely obiter dictus, as i
the words of the Court the action in whi h
the injunction was granted was improperly
brought and there was no strict necessiy
for any decision or opinion as to the validity
of the enactment

If there be any desire on the nart of thé
proper authorities to test the validity of this
evactinent ft can be done in sppropria™
proceedings in the manner provided by law

Mr. Rives also sent this communication
to Inspector Alfred E. Steers, President of
the Board of City Magistrates in Brooklyn
who is not affected by the litigation:

Hon. Aifred BE. Steers, President Board of
City Maaistrotea, Brooklun, N

fin: Tam in receipt of your letter of thie
date, in which you request me to inform you
who are the City Magistrates in the borough
of Brooklyn

A controversy has been pending for some
dave before the courts as between the yee
sons elected to be City Magistrates at the lars
election, and those who have heretofore held
of oe under appointment The question oF
the dnty of the -dministrative departme t®
of the city government in respect to this
matter has been alrendy considered hy me
at the request of the Police Commissioner

I inelose herewith a copy of my reply to
him, which, | think, sufficiently answers your
inquiry

Magistrate Steers said

I do not know what the outeome will be
