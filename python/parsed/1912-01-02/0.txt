Jan do Chinese imperial
ist soldiers at Hankow have been ordered
not to fireupon revolutionary forces unless
attacked, according to advices: received
at the State Department to-day. There
was considerable desultory firing in the
sieinity of Hankow on Saturday, which,
Imperialiste alleged begun by
the revolutionists

Offic ials At the Department are
awaiting with considerable interest the
result f a conference to be held at the
Bmperor’s palace in Pekin ‘This con
ference, it has been reported, will decide
whether the Manchu princes and the
Emperor are to give Yuan Shih Kai money
with which to continue the Government
or whether the imperialist Cause shall be
abandoned and the throne abdicated ‘The
Department is informed that Dr. Sun Yat
Sen is proceeding with the organization
of a republican government and intends
to have himself #gaugurated as President
at Nanm,-regar s of the plans for a
national cenvent# i which shall decide
the question of the future form of the
Chinese government

The desperate and unavailing efforts
of Yuan Shih Kai, Premier of China, to

imperial Government at Pekin have

GEN. COXEY AT THE WALDORF

A Large Diamond on His Right Hand
and a Gas Turbine Next His Heart.

All of the nap is worn off the left coat
sleeve of the raiment which clothes the
figure of Gen. Jacob Sechler Coxey, one
time supreme commander of an army of
tramps but at present with us tempo-
This slight defect in Gen. Coxey's
coat sleeve is caused by the fact that the

sleeve is used to polish the diamond
which the General wears on his right
hand. When he talks about the possi-
bilites of the gas turbine which he is

how promoting he absent mindedly passes
that coat sleeve back and forth over the
large piece of carbon crystal

Gen Coxey had luncheon at the Wal-
dorf yesterday Between the steak and
the ice he read to a companion extracts
from a blue backed folio. Later it was
possible to determine that this folio was
entitled “Description and Possibilities of
A. Haines
and Its Use as a Prime Mover for Motive
Power" There is no use denying the fact
that all of Coxey's heart is in the Haines
thermodynamic motor It used to be
Coxey silica sand and it used to be oil
Promotion is life for the former leader
of the tramp army

It may be said that the General is still
a Socialist, for he doesn't quite see what
other party he could join and be con-
sistent with history. And he still believes

that Col Roosevelt, both while he was
President and as contributing editor,
stole and now steals Coxey's policies

without giving credit,
