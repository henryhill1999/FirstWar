Madison avenue, from Fiftv-fourth street
to Fifty-ninth, was a river from a foot to
three feet deep, according to locality,
9:30 o'clock and midnight, last
A flood, pouring from a_ burat
water main at the Fifty-fifth street corner,
ran up and down the avenue, brimming
over the sidewalks, filling the areaways
end basements of dozens of houses, pouring
down the side streets to the east, and by
datrect canal through Fifty-fourth street
mishing down to Park avenue and turning
a torrent into the New York Central's

in and out of the houses folks
led by soap box stepping stools and
ly got very wet in transit. The cars
stalled in the water, at the first rush

f the flood and no other vehicles braved
the torrent, so the district was practically
isolated. A fire alarin was rung, but the
firemen naturally were not equipped for
figiiting water, and there was every prospect
for & tine that the tenants might have to
tale to the roofs,

The break in the main occurred at the
northeast corner of Fifty-fifth etreet and
Madison avenue at 0:35 o'clock. With a
ush the water lifted up the pavement and
started a geyser. Dr. Samuel H. Tucker of

‘rave
usu

fl Fast Fifty-fifth street was passing.
Net knowing what elswe to do, he ran to
the nearest fire-alarm box and sent in an

alarm. ‘Two minutes later Engine 8, from
Fast Fifty-first etreet, in charge of Capt.
Freet, dashed up the avenue.
Freel at once assumed command of af-
fairs. He sent his men in every direction
open up the sewer manholes. By this
time the water had opened up a big hole
in the street and the water was rushing
out in torrents. Jt ran east through Fifty
fifth street toward Park avenue in a flood
fully three feet high and spread up Madison
avenue in a lower, but steady stream. It
flowed through the side streets above,
toward the east, but didn’t cover the side-
walks there. In Fifty-fifth street there
Was a roaring torrent
The flood didn't by any means subside
when the manholea were opened, so Cant
Frell telephoned to the Water Depart-
ment to send men to shut off the water
That war before 10 o'clock. At midnight
the water had not heen shut off and the
flood was as high as ever Madison ave-

of the fire supply in the district fed by the
48-inch main

A repair gang got to work as soon aa the
water was turned off, and though it may
be some time before the broken piv’, or
pipes, can be replaced, it is probable that
some termmporary connection can be ar-
ranged at once at the point of the break.

When the flood was at its height the
water in the side streets reached some
distance toward the west from Madison
avenue, nearly reaching Alfred Gwynne
Vanderbilt's house at Fifty-sixih street
and Fifth avenue and E. Fi. Harriman’s
residence at 1 East Fifty-fifth street

The houses whose basements suffered
the most were those on Madison avenue
between Fifty-fifth and Fifty-sixth streets.
Thege houses and their occupants were

In East Fifty-sixth street No, 79, occupied
by Dr. and Mrs. Alexis M
tenanted hy Mr. and Mrs. F. M. Wyler;
No. 85, which is the Loreley apartment
house, and several others were flooded to
the basement ceilings. In all these houses
and those in Madison avenue and in East
Fifty-fifth street all the furnace fires were
put out,

On East Fifty-fifth street the houses
flooded and their occupants were: 54, Mr.

Capt. Freel ordered the fire engine ten-
ders into rescue service. The tenders were
backed up to the cars and people were
earried in them to dry places, which al-
ready were at some disiance then. The
street railroad people sent an automobile

to help out in the work of emptying the |

ears, but still the vehicles mustered were
too few to muit some of the women. ‘Then

street their beds were floating around.

The lower part of the First Reformed
Episcopal Church, at the corner of Fifty-
fil street, was filled from floor to ceiling
and there were some who doubted last
night as to whether the building would
not require pinning up before it could be
used again for service

Into the Grand Central's tunnel] the water
poured in a torrent. Geor, Schumann,
the station master at the Central,
when he heard what had occu , at once
gathered a force of workmen and went
to investigate the porsibility of danger
to the tunnel. But although the water
was flowing into the three divisions of
the tunnel from the different openings
between Fifty-fifth and Fiftv-ninth streets,
the drainage waa so ample that it was
carried away almost as quickly as it flowed
in

The main tunnel and the one to the east
hold only a few inches of water, not enough
to cover the tracks entirely. In the western
tunnel the water did hide the tracks from

view, but as this track is not being used

SUBMARINE BOAT SWAMPED,
FULTON DIVED OF HER OWN AC.
COND WHEN WATER CAME IN.
Forward Hatten len epen While She Was

Undergoing RNepairs—At the Bottom

of Peconic Bay in 12 Feet of Water
~ Divers at Work — Machinery Uninjared

 

The submarine boat Fulton, which was
successfully sent through water, over
water and under water at her trials re-
cently, showed on Monday afternoon
that she could do a diving trick on her own
hook under proper conditions. Some one
left the forward hatch open while she was
undergoing repairs alongside the Holland
Torpedo Boat Company's pier at New Suf-
folk, L. I., and she promptly filled and
stayed “subbed” until last night

Capt. Frank T. Cable of the Fulton was
visiting his wife, who is very ill in this city,
when the accident happened. Men from
the company's shops were about to make
some slight repairs to the exhaust valve,
which is aft and well below. In order to
bring the stern out of water the crew, for-
getting that the forward hatch was still
open, eubmerged the bow. The water
rushed in instantly, bringing the Fulton
so that she stood almost perpendicular,
nose down. Some one then suggested that
if her stern were also sent under she would

probably come tothe surface before she ,

filled enough to go to the bottom. They
tried that. The water gurgled through

| from stem to etern, and she dropped to the
| bottom, the water being twelve feet deep.

There was no one aboard at the time
The crew couldn't realize just what
had happened. They had seen the Ful-
ton go down 80 many times only to bob
up serenely again that

again. But the Fulton remained “sub”
at the bottom of the Peconic Bay

mediately telegraphed to New London,
Conn., for divers, and in the
two pumps were set in operation on the
Fulton Phe divers guaranteed to have
her pumped out, sealed and on the sur-
face before the day was over.

Capt. Cable was almost broken hearted
when he heard of the accident and hur-
ried down to New Suffolk. He expected
to start the Fulton on a 455-mile trip to
Washington on Friday under her own
steam. He proposed to run her on the

REGS OF J. TV. MORGAN'S GUEST.
Madison Avenue Mendicant Arrested
Carey Willi Prosecute Her.
Miss Mary DePeyster Carey, daughter
of the late Samuel T. Carey, was a guest
at a luncheon given yesterday afternoon
at the home of J. Pierpont Morgan, at
Thirty-sixth street and Madison avenue
As Mise Carey was leaving the house
at 3 o'clock ahe was accosted by a well-
dressed Jewish woman, who had made
her way inside of the high iron railing and
who asked for some money and said that
she was starving.
Miss Carey told her that she ought to

be ashamed to accost people on the street |

with such a tale, clothed as she was, and
the woman began a tirade of abuse, which
attracted the atténtion of ao many people
on the atreet that Miss Carey walked up
Madison avenue, hoping to be rid of her
annover

But the woman followed and at the cor-
ner of Thirty-eighth street spoke to Mise

Carey again. She was no longer defiant,
but told aatory of trouble and starvation
which Miss Carey was obligal to
listen to because she could not
walk fast enough to get away from
the woman She finally met Officer
O'Sullivan of the West Thirtieth street

station and asked him to arrest the woman.

She volunteered to go to the station house |

and make a complaint and did so despite
the entreaties of the woman for mercy
The prisoner said at the station house

that she was Annie Kramer and that she |

lived at 194 Orchard street. She begged
Miss Carey on her knees not to press the

charge against her, but Mise Carey was
obdurate. She said
“The beggars on Madison avenue are

such a nuisance that some have got to be
made examples of. I will take the tnitia-

 

| tive no matter how unpleasant it is, I
will appear against this woman.”

him had cut him off from the fire escape
ladder. He clambered down by the illumi-
nated sign. When he got to the second
floor the firemen broug)t him down on
one of their ladders

The flames ate their way up through the
front of the building to the roof, skirting
an air shaft which separated a part of the
office end of the building from galleries
of the theatre in the rear. The firemen
took their pipes into the theatre and worked
from the gallery to wet down the thick
back wall of the theatre. They also worked
from the roof of the theatre and managed
to confine the flames to the offices in front

faster and caught him at Seventh avenue,
where they clutched him by the throat,
knocked him down and sat on him. Police-
