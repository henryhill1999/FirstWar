for the Colonel.

He came around voluntarily. Farly |
this morning, while some of the jurors|
were still and others were get-

and stubborn — silence. Ife suddenly
wheeled around when he was scrubbing
his face and spoke to the foreman of
the jury, Warren W. Somers

“Somers,’ he said, “I guess I've been

The vote was taken at 6:50 A, M.
and every slip of paper bore three
words, “For the defendant.” Led by
Foreman Somers, the jurors shook
hands with Burns and the twelve went
to breakfast good friends and in thor-
ough accord

A few hours later, when the jury ap-
peared in court and answered Clerk
Clurke’s call of their names, Burns's
Voice rang out as emphatically as that

of any other juror in recording his vote
for Col. Roosevelt. }
The one great factor which deter- |
Mined the vote was the question of
Vaucity between Roosevelt and Barnes. °
Everything else was subordinated. From

“It is only right that we should tell

ROSTAND GIBES BERNSTORFF.

Poet Contrasts Viatt of Condolence |

With Lusitania Dead at Sen.
Special Cable Despatch to Tur Sex
Paris, May 22.—Edmond Rostand

' publishes a ninety-two line poem in the

Figaro describing Ambassador von Bern-

| storff's calling at the State Department
to present the Katser’s condolence for’

the American losses in the Lusitania.
The poem gives two lines to Bern-
storff and his hypocritical grief, then

| two lines to the scene on the Irish coast
| when the Lusitania went

down, Thus
after Bernstorff is described as dressed
in deep mourning entering the White
House, there is a parenthetical clause
reading:

“Women's bruised
against the cliffs.”

In the next two lines the Ambassador
described his mission, which is one of
sympathy and condolence, and then oc-
curs another parenthetical clause read-
ing:

“Children twine silently round a reef.”

One verse about President Wilson
Says that behind him stand Lincoln,
Virtue, Washington and Glory, but they
are invisible to Bernstorff. The German
Ambassador is described as saying that
those who sailed despite the German
warning were aggressors, and then an-
other parenthetical clause follows:

“Over there a 61 nd maiden is washed
upon the shore with her three sisters.”

The poem contains a line about Alfred
Gwynne Vanderbilt and his heroism in
giving up his life belt to a woman.

Revenues Fall Off.

Some months ago when the state of

the Treasury began to attract attention
Secretary McAdoo announced that a
yield of approximately $100,000,000 from
the corporation ard income taxes would
save the situation at the end of the year,
He explained that the revenues had been
hard hit beeause of the war, but ex-
pressed confidence that the returns from
the income and corporation taxes would
restore the Treasury to normal con-
ditions

In the meantime customs receipts have

been dropping and there is only a come
paratively small increase on account of
internal revenue despite the emergency

Was privately estimated that the income
and corporation taxes would yield $80,

of $100,000,000 tixed by Secretary Me-
Adoo, Now Treasury officials say
the Government will be lucky if it gets
$70,000,000 from this source, and there
are other officials who fear the yleld will

Hints at Dictatorship.

"We must stamp on this thing even

The article then attributes to the
Government weakness in handling the
drink mundle as the second cause of the
downfall of the Cabinet. Despite Lloyd
George's demand for large measures
and the King’s and Kitchener's action, 9
wonderful opportunity was wastea and
a purely party Cabinet had shown it
self incapable of dealing with the ques-
tion of drink and munitions

In regard to munitions the article
argues that it was impossible for Lord
Kitchener to stop the War Office ma-
chine in order that it might be entirely
rebuilt “It must be regarded as out of
the question that Lord Kitchener, unless
he goes to the front, can relinquish the
of completing AS a historic
achievement the developing of the fuil
military power of the nation”

The article regrets that difficulties
have arisen in making Lileyd George
Minister of Munitions or War Supplies
The attacks upon Lord Kitchener have
made it essential that the new Cabinet
emphasize the vote of confidence in lord
Kitchener which the whole country spon-
taneous!) passed while the city strongly
expressed a desire that Lloyd George re-
main as Chancellor of the Exchequer;
therefore, “the Observer hopes that A,
