and then consented to a transcript.” said
Baldwin. “When their representative
was in court tho information I wanted to
get was excluded upon objection.”

the letter simply showed how fallacious
the statement was.

Bushe said that the statement was the
result of a good deal of labor, but in the
end Justice Putnam simply accepted the
statement as an adrnission.

Brokaw in order to prove the stato-
ment went on the stand. He said that
he had examined the statement and that
it Was correct.

“Lid you contribute anything toward
the work of making it?” Brokaw was
asked.

“I set the valuations on the realty,”
eaid Brokaw.

“Is all of your income set down?"

"It is.”

On the crose-examination Baldwin
asked thé witness how many transactions
he bad during the year with J. 8. Bache &
Co. Brokaw said that he could not recall.

@. You simply furnish the money and
take thé result? A. Yes

Q. Then you know nothing of the state of
your affairs? A. Only from Mr. Bache

Q. Does he render you a monthly state-
ment? A. No.

Q. Does he render you the usual stock

Q. Do you instruct him what stocks to

@. Did you ever ingtruct Bache 4 Co.

ment of his deposita.
Q. The other day you said that you did

Q. Then, Mr. Brokaw, you are not a very
poor mah, are you? A. I think that I ant.

without your knowledge?”
Baldwin.
Bushe jumped to his feet in an Instant,
but was calmed when aagsured that there
was no reflection cast upon him.
Baidwin then moved to strike out the
statement as purely hearsay. Bushe
said that the statement was the best
evidence obtainable, and Baldwin re-
marked that the cross-examination had
brought out the fact that the witness
knew nothing of the statement what-
ever beyond what Bushe had told him.
Justice Putwam then accepted the
statement as an admission of property,
on both sides said that

Licatenant—Man Whe Said He Was
Ivaffy’s Father Went to Ask About Him

A woman in evening attire, who came
out of Silsbee’s restaurant in Fulton
street near Flatbush avenue, Brooklyn,
at half past 12 o'clock om Saturday morn-
ing, turned back as she was entering
a cab and appealed to Policeman James
O'Connor of the Adams street station
to protect hen from a young man. O’Con-
nor says the young man slapped the
‘woman on her bare shoulder. He ordered
the fellow to move cn and received, he
says, an insolent reply.

*Go on, how,” O'Connor says he told

the young man, “or I'll have to arrest
you.”
“I won't go on and you don't dare ar-
rest me,” O'Connor says the youth re-
torted, whereupon O’Connor grabbed
him and marched him off to the Adams
street station.

Lieut. Skidmore was at the desk. In-
specter Holahan was also in the station.
The woman who complained of the
prisoner had not gone to the station, and
the policeman did not have her name,

“Well,” said the lieutenant,

READY TO PAY KIDNAPPERS,

Louisville Girt’s Uncle Visite Chicago
After Taking 85,000 From Bank.
Curcaco, Jan. 1.—Despite the repeated

of the police and Frank Fehr of

ville, developments to-night went to

that Fehr's visit to Chicago was for

the purpose of meeting and making

terms with the kidnappers holding his
niece, Alma Kellner. ‘

Fehr refused to talk of the kidnapping,

but it is known that before leaving Louis-

ville he drew $5,000 from a bank, the last

amount demanded by the abductors of

his niece.
This demand came in a telegram, fol-

 

   
  
  
   
  

*Have you got my boy here?”

“Who is your boy’” asked the lieu-
tenant.

“George Duffy.” said the man. ‘I'm
his father. I heard that he wasarrested.”

“He was,” answered the lieutenant,
“but he has gone home now.”

The father turned and walked out of
the station house.

“He came in here so soon after the
arrest,” said the lieutenant last night,
“that I suppose some one must have run
to his house the minute the young man
was arrested and have told him.”

Policeman O'Connor, who arrested
Duffy, has been on the force 14 years and
has an excellent record. For some years
he wasin the newf{Tenderloin in Manhattan.

TO REMAKETHE NEW THEATRE,

Cetitiug to Be Lowered Twenty Feet te
Improve the Acoustics.

What amounts to a complete recon-
struction of the interior of the New
Theatre is to be undertaken in order to
correct the faulty acoustics of the present
building. Detailed plans have not yet
been drawn, but the general programme
bas been almost completed. Carrere &
Hastings, the original architects of the
building, will have charge of the work
of reconstruction. It is thought that
work will be begun in the coming summer.

The most important of the structural
changes provides for the lowering of the
ceiling about twenty feet It is hoped
that this alteration will improve the
acoustics. At present !the voices of the
actors seem to lose themselves in the
great height’ of the auditorium. The
fact that opera will not be given in the
New Theatre after the present season
makes it particularly desirable, it is said,
to provide foracoustics of the best order.

For the same reason those who have the
alterations in charge have seen fit to
recommend the lowering of the balcony
in an effort to bring the audience closer
to the stage. The founders’ bores, which
at present are in the rear of the audi-
torium and are raised only two or three
feet above the level of the floor, will dis-
place the foyer stalls, which according
to the present arrangement are in the
first balcony. The passage behind the
founders’ boxes and the space occupied
by the boxes themselves will be con-
verted into seating room, as in other
theatres in New York. The arrangement
of boxes and floor seats will be similar
to that in the Metropolitan Opera House.

Carrére & Hastings in their original
plans followed a scheme outlined by
Heinrich Conried. Mr. Conried laid down
the original measurements and the archi-
tects followed them in the main carefujly.
Mr, Conried’s plan, however, called for a
second balcony above the present baleony,
and the height of the auditorium was made
to correspond with measurements allow-
ing for its construction. When it was
decided to have no second balcony the
height was left unchanged, leaving a large
unoccupied area at the top of the theatre.

MRS. ELLIS MAY DIE.

Weman Burned at Martin's on New
Year's Kve in a Grave Condition,

Mre. Charlies E. Ellis, who was burned
severely just before midnight on Friday
night in Martin's, Twenty-sixth street,
Broadway and Fifth avenue, may die of
her injuries, it was said last night at the
New York Hospital. She received burns
on the chest, arms and about the mouth
and her condition war grave. Her hwe-
band, father and sist-r spent much,of the
day at the hospital.

Mrs. Ellis was Miss Florence Taylor
of Montclair. Her husband has been presi-
dent of the Kornit company, which is
now involved in bankruptcy proceedings.
The Ellis home in Montclair is on South
Mountain avenue. It has been closed
for the winter season.

Mrs. Fillis went through a long exami-

‘nation in the Supreme Court recently
because of her claim that she was the
proprietor of the Hotel Frederick at 210
West Fifty-sixth street and owner of its
contents. That is where she and her hus-
band have been living recently. The
hotel was seized by the Sheriff on Novem-
ber 12 last under an order of attachment
for $196,800 obtained against Ellis by
Nathan Bilder,’ trustee in bankruptey
of the Kornit Manufacturing Company
of New Jersey.

The attachment was issued in a suit
in which the trustee in bankruptcy
charged that Ellis sold stock in the com-
pany for that amount and failed to turn
the money in to the company.

Mrs. Ellis said that she and not her hus-
band owned the hotel Wusiness, in spite of
the fact that the stationery and adver-
tisementa of the hotel bore Ellis’s name as
proprietor, and the hotel bank account
was in his name. An order for her exami-
nation was then obtained and she de-
clared that she really was the proprietor,
although she permitted her husband to
attend to all the finances. She said she
didn't want her name used because she
had friends in society from whom she

without announcing a singleappointment,
although it did come out later that he had

asked Herman Ridder to accept offices as —
Park Commissioner for Manhattan and |

Richmond in place of Henry Smith.

The determination of the Mayor to keep
his slate covered up was a great disap-
pointment to scores of men who have
applied for offices and who have been led
by their backers to believe that they

would certainly land some job. They.

hung around the door leading to the
Mayor's office until the time camé for the
closing of the City Hall and many of

they hadi been assured that Mayor Gaynor” _

had gone home and would not be back at
the City Hall until Monday. Many of them
had letters of introduction to Mayor
Gaynor, but these were useless to get them
past the policemen who guarded the doors
to the Mayor’s inner office. Mayor Gaynor
ehook hands with about 1,200 persons who
filed before him for an hour, and after that
he went to his private room and saw only
