BROOKLYN, 8; NEW YORK, 6.

For a time it looked as though the Brook-
lyns would be defeated on the Polo Grounds
yesterday afternoon, but in the seventh the
Champions got their bats going and the dia-
mond soon assumed the aspect of a Coney
jsiand merry-go-round, ‘They pounded in
four runs, which gave them the lead, and al-
though the New Yorks came back with a tally
which tied the score, it was their dying @asp,
as Hanion’s men hustled soine more runs across
the plate a8 8000 as they gota chance and wou
out With something to spare. ‘The Brookly ns
gave a very yellow exhibition in the [irst stages
of the game, a fumble by Capt, Kelley, who
played iirst base, and two misplays by Daly,
turown in with @ couple of singles and a two-
bagwer by Hickman in the second, giving the
New Yorks three runs, MeGinnity was being
lut pretty freely, and this tact, coujded with
the poor felding of the Champions, } resaged a
victory for the locals, but the “Iron Man
settled dowd soon after and finally the Brook-
lyns began Lo solve the Inysteries of Mercer's
curves, When this combibation was effected
it Was all over with the New Yorks, Ewing's
men promptly went up in the air. Error 1ol-
lowed error and hit followed hit, and at last
the lowly tail-enders slunk to their clubhouse,
brooding over their seve nth consecutive de-
feat, Ine game might have been enjoyable
had pot the players of both teams marred the
easure ol the spectators by a lot of useless
sickling, The rowdyism began in the very
lirst inning, In executing a double play the
umpire called the runner, Delbach, out, In-
stantly that player, together with Smith, Van
Haltren and Bowerman made a rush at the
umpire aud for afew minutes the air was heavy
with their talk, Such incidents as Warner
throwing his bat Violently On the ground when
Latham called a strike on him in the second
inning served to disgust the spectators still
more, but the climax was reached in the fifth,
when for more that five minutes the players of
the Brooklyn team acted like a ‘Texas lyneh-
ing party. Gleason was declared sale at first
base on a close decision, and the ruling was
the signal for every mian of the visiting lean
except Sheckard in left fleld to Converge on the
umpire and expostulate wildly and loudly.
Capt. Kelley's voice could be heard above all
the rest yelling at the official:

“Go home! Get out of here! You are dis-
gusting!” Latham took it ull meekly, und not
until the Brooklyns were tired of talking did
they resume their positions and continue the

ame, Intheseventhinning Daly of the Brook-

“ns went so far as to grab the umpire around

e neck when that official made a decision
gainst him. The New Yorks made an absurd

ick, which lasted some minutes, in the eighth
when Hickman knocked a three-bagger nearly
to the centre-field ropes. They asserted that
the ball went beyond the ropes and the bats-
man was, therefore, entitled to a home run,
but as a matter of fact the ball did not roll to
within fifteen feet of the ropes. The hit was a
very long one and was the batting feature of
the game. There was a slicht fire in the lower
grandstand, caused by a lighted cigar, but it
was quickly extinguished with no damage,

HARVARD SURPRISES YALE.

 

Wins the Ball Game at New Haven te the
Chagrin of the Alumni,

NEW HAVEN, June 26.—Before a crowd of
9,000 persons Harvard totally surprised Yale
and spoiled commencement week here to-day
by winning the annual class day baseball con-
test by a score of 3 to 0, in one of the closest
and best-pluyed games ever seen on Yale field.
It was a veritable survival of the fittest in a
pitchers’ battle between Robertson, Yale's
star twirler, and Stillman, who, after being
knoeked out of the box at Cambridge last week,
shut Yale out and only allowed five hita to-
day. Both colleges put their best collection
of players in the fleld and for six innings it
was an almost perfect exhibition of baseball,
neither side getting beyond second base.

The crowd, which in view of Yale's easy
victory on Harvard's own diamond last Thurs-
day had expected a one-sided contest to-day,
were too astonished to cheer after the first
few innings. At the start both teams went out
in one, two, three order. This was the case
up to Yale's half of the seventh, when Sullivan
led off with a long hit to deep left fleld and he
was clear around to third before the ball came
back to the diamond. Five thousand alumni
of Yale and their friends who saw victory com-
ing their way at this stage rose and te din was
deafening for a few seconds. Guernsey shat-
tered the hopes of the locals a second later
by fanning out.

Hirsch, who followed, came up to bunt and
then happened the play which many believe
cost Yale the game. With but one out, Sulli-
van made a wild attempt to steal home while
Stillman was pitching the bali to the plate.
Hirsch struck af, but missed the leather,and Capt,
Bill Reid nailed Yale's closest effort to seore
with ease when Sullivan alid for home,

In the eighth Harvard went after the game
with a vengeance, After George died, Robert-
eon to first base, Clark and Stillman lit on Yale's
twirler for singles and got around to second
and third on a passed ball by Hirsch. When
Kendall struck out a mighty shout went up
from the stands, but a moment later Coolidge
by a lon two-bagger to centre, sent in Clark
and Stillman for the first tallles of the game.
Reid fouled out to Hirsch, closing the inning

In the last inning Loughlin was hit, but was
out on @ flelder’s choice off Fincke. who himecif
got to second and scored on Clark's single
Yale fought until the last gun anda filled the
bases, Stiliman then settled down and the
game Was over on three easy puteouts, In the
seventh Devons, while at the bat. was hit in the
nose and badly cut by @ pitched ball, He re-
tired and Loughlin replaced him, The result
of the game came as a thunderbolt to the Yale
men and they are deeply chagrined to-night,
Fine weather made the contest a typical col-
lewiate one, the large throng present being
amused by the antics of the returning classes
and their brass bands. Yale ard Harvard
have now each won a wame and will settle the
tie in New York Saturday. The score:

YALB | HARVARD.

M’MEEKIN WINS TIDAL.

FORTUNE BESTOWS ANOTHER SMILE
ON WILLIAM H. BARRICK.

 

 

Easy Wefeat of Handwork in the Spring
Stakes by The Parader—Backers of Voter
Receive a Big Scare and Very Little Monev
~Old Dolando Comes Ont Again as a Winner,

The special features yesterday at the Sheepa-
head Bay track were the Tidal, with $1,600
added, for three-year-olds at one mile, and the
Spring, with $1,000 added, for two-year-olds
over the Futurity course. These rounded
out an attractive card and the attendance
reached a satisfactory total. Facilities for
transit to the scene showed marked improve-
ment in the important matter of promptitude,
especially over the Whitehall street route
affected by business men from the Wall Street
section.

For the Tidal the seven three-year-olds
named as starters overnight accepted. H.
Eugene Leigh was doubly represented by Ll-
drim and Vulcain, who were coupled in the bet-
ting at 11 to 2, McMeekin closed a strong fa-
vorite, while Mesmerist and David Garrick also
had a following, Mesmerist with O'Connor
up, showed speed for a quarter and after be-
ing headed for a moment by MceMeekin, again
took up the pacemaking. The Featherstone
candidate held a slight advantage until a fur-
long from home, but curled up in the drive
and MeMeekin won out by a neck from David
Garrick, who also caught Mesmerist and beat
him a length, It was the fastest race ever run
for the stake since it was established twenty
years ago, with the notable exception of Dob-

bins’s performance in 1*94, when Richard Cro-
ker's favorite colt carried 122 pounds to the
front ini40. W.H. Barrick returned espectall
from Chicago for this race with Jockey Mitchell.
The latter rode MeMeekin, while Barrick spent
a busy hour getting even with a few of the prom-
inent layers

Only four youngsters turned out for the
Spring Stakes, and of these Handwork was
made an overwhelming choice, The only other
seriously backed was The Parader, and the
latter won easily by a length after allowing
the Hanover colt to make the running,

The presence of Voter in the
decimated the fleld and paralyzed the betting
His odds were prohibitive and disappointed
bettors finally took chances on Gold Or to beat
him. The Golden Garter colt stirred up a fever
of enthusiasm among his followers by making
the running to the last jump, where Voter got
up and snatched the verdict by a short head.

The ridiculous price of 8 to > was freely ace
cepted by followers of W. C. Whitney's maiden
two-vear-old colt The Rhymer, although he
had nineteen opponents in the Line-up. The
race Was down ie last tive and a half furlongs
«f the new course, and the 8 to I shot, Telamon,
‘oo. the honors in a drive. but two lengths
trom Militant, while Trigger outetaved tha
favorite and finished third. The time wiped
out the new course record of 1:984-5, made by
Moor with seven pounds less in the saddle,
on June 22. Mike Clancy ‘Saw another bars
wain and bid the winner from his entered
price of $800 up to @1,500, Then Sam Hildreth
chimed in and secured the promising Hanover
colt for $2,000

A handicap for three-year-olds and upward
at one mile ond three furlongs preceded the
stakes, With Col Roosevelt and Prince of
Melbourne withdrawn the contest was regarded
as a duel between the Kentuckian and Knight
of the Garter The latter carried most tuoney
at the end and rewarded his backers while the
Kentuekian had to be content with the short
end of the purse, Maid of Harlem splitting the
pair. The Kentnekian hit himselt badly and
pulled up lame

King Barleycorn was almost unanimously
selected as the pea in the last event of the day,
atone mileand as xteenth on turf rhe twelve
starters ran well bunched until within hall of
the judges, where Dolundo drew out and won
by alength and a hall. Sam Hildreth thought
the Fleischmann candidate too cheap at $500
and he raised him to $1,500, at which price the
owner's representative quit. Summary’

Turf Notes,

For her first trip as a four-year-old Matd of Harlem
showed surprisingly good form yesterday in a fast
run race.

Handwork will have to run much better than he did
yest rday to win back the big price paid for him by

ogers & Rose last spring.

The Kentuctian’s breakdown Is a serious blow to
his «porting owner, EF. Simma, but as the hore's
lameness was an incident of the race and not const.
tutional, the handsome son of Pirate of Penzance may
come round in time to Mill his many engagements.

Owner J White, after running last inthe maiden
tvo-year-old race won by Telamon, loat faith in his
filly Toboka and started on a still bunt for a better
youngster. He finally selected The saver d took
him away from W. C. Whitney underthe rules, at a
cost of $1,690,

Ada Deatries gtew so skittish on her way tothe t
for the second race at Sheepshead that she shied loto
the fence ogoomne the betting ring and useated
Hiechards ookmakers said she resented the odds
ef ao to l marred up against her. Richards re
mounted and brought her home eighteenth.

Iidrim's Belmont laurels are beginning to reat
heavy Upon him, His peaalty and the concessions al
lowed to rivals that were Dot So fortunate In the early

rt of the sra-oa, place him ata great disadvantage

n condition stakes sueh as the Tidal yesterday,
when he gallanfly carried 130 pounds into fourth
posttion

Little MeCue carried off the riding honors at Sheeps-
head Hay yesterday by bringing home both Knight
ofthe Garter and The Parader, Winning brackets
were also earned by Snencer, Rutter, Mitehell and
O'Connor, while thy Jockeys who contrivad to finish
aomewhere in the money were Fred Tara. Clawson,
M. Daly, Dangman, Maher, Turner and Shaw,

Consistent followers of favorites almost loat their
breath when they glanced at the prices chsiked up
for the first race at the Coney Island tract yooter-
day. it wasa hard proposition to begin by bettin
from 10 to 18 to 1 that Voter wreuld win, a

CREWS ON THE

 

Tho Sarvard and Yale Oarsmen Indulge in
Moderate Practice.

Gaga Ferry, June 26.—Ccol weather favored
the Yale and Harvurd oarsmen this morning
when they started in on their reguiar practice,
and the chang» In the temperature was thor-
oughly appreciated by the crews afier their
exporience in the awelter‘ng sun yesterday.

No long distances were rowe !, ali the coaches
keeping men nour their respective quarters
Yale's oarsmen were out scarcely an
hour, rowing in the vicinity of Hor-
ton'’s Cove Bridge, Coaches Gallaudet
and Brown gave their men several
triala in starts. The oarsmen were cautioned
on their indidval fau!ts and imrressed with the
great danger that hung over a crew that did
not pay attention to the stroke and failed to
pull together. Yale's four-oared crew had un-
dergone a change, Hugh Auchincloss going out
of the boat on account of iUness. Cross has
been put on and the positions occupied by the
men as they now row are: Lincoln, bow; Mitch
ell, 2; Croas, 3; Hooker, stroke; Armstrong,
coxswain.

Harvard's 'Var-ity eight is pluckily training
and bids fair to give the Eli crew a fast race on
Thursday. Coach Storrow stands in the bow of
the launch with th» big megaphone in hand and
closely follows every movement made by the
crew. He is very quick to detect a fault and
loses no time in telling the oarsmen just where
they are slow or fast as the occasion may be

“The ‘Varsity crew is doing as well cs I
expected it would under the circum-
etanoces,"’ sald Coach Storrow to-night, “but

three days is too short a time to pre-
pare oarsmen for a long-distance race.
The loss of Higginson was a severe

blow and the effect is quite noticeable. Hard-
ing is pulling a strong oar and Builard ts gradu-
ally falling Into line, butit ts a question what
the men will do when they meei the Yale crew in
a four-mi'e contest.”

Dr. Gallaudet, in conversation with a corre-
spondent of THE SUN to-night, said:

“The Yalecrew is not up to the pitch we
would like to see it.” He was neked just where
the trouble was.

“There is no one faultin particular. Itis the
rowing in genera!—the individual faults, too
many to enumerate,--that makes the crew's
work unsatisfactory When the oarsmen
do not work together and in unison the
shell is not steady and asa result the speed is
impaired."’

The coach, in speaking of the accident to
Harvard's stroke, Higginson, reterred to it in
@ touching way, and said that Yale felt the loss
from the Crimson shell just as keenly as Har-
vard did.

“It places the Yale crew in a very peculiar
position,”’ added Dr. Gallaudet. “‘It we win we
will not receive any credit, though the present
Harvard eight may be just as good as the one
stroked by Capt, Higginson, If we lose the de-
feat will be worse on account of the sort time
the present Cri:mson eiglit has had to practice.
The inishap to Capt. Higginson waa indeed a
very unfortunate affair.’

Harvard's ‘Varsity and freshman crews hada
ecrap for half a mile at 6 o'clock this evening
the start being made at the on*-mils stake and
the shells were pointed uvstream. The fresh-
ner,as usual, hitup a $4 stroke atthe stat
and threatened to leave the Deg eigit tar
in the rear, but the steady Su-st oke
of the. ‘Varity oarsmen soon had a
telling effect, When the half mile had been
rowed, th: Freshmen were overa length hehind
The latter were inclined to be rattled v hen the
other boat crawled away from them, and did
corsiderable splashing The ore crew
pulled a clenn stroke, Har‘ing and Bullar!
rowing like old timers and giving a good
ethibtiion of blade work. Coach St: rrow gave
consifvrable attention to Harding, trying to
breik nim of hi: habit of taking too shorta
stroke. Harding is conceded to be one of the
strongest men in «he shell and no fear is en-
tertala:d that he willnot be in good condition
at the flnish line in the our-mfe race

Workmen were envnged to-day repairing the
flontat Red Top which wos wrecked by the
waves of the passing seam yachts on Monday
evening. Th side of the float where the oars-
men enter theirshel's is subm reed and all the
onrainen had to wade through the water when
they went out and returned from practice,
Several of the men comp ainedof thelr feet
being chafed to-night and the trouble fs as-
signed to their rowing while their shoes and
stockings were soaking wet

The result of the baveball game at New Haven
thia afternoon was received by wire at both

Yale's and Harvard's quarters and there
was sorrow at the former pnd hi-
larity at the latter place when the
game was won by the Cambridge nine.

‘the whistle of the launch John Harvard was
kept tooting for five minutes, andaeveral of the
employees about the boithouse were sent cut
ekirmishing for barre!s and boxes to pile up for
a bonfire to-nicht. Fireworks were ordered
from New London, and there was a grand pyro-
technical display this evening.

Capt. Higginson cept in the large tent near
the training qvarters last night, but the weather
{fs so cool to-nieht he will probably choose his
room, which will b>» more comfortable, thougn
not ao enay of access as the tent on account of
hia crippledcondi'ton, He spends the day on the
porch fronting the river vith his injured ankle
on a rest, and takes great interest watching
through a glass the mancuvres of the crews on
the water. He suffers scarcely any pain ard
says he will remain at Red Top until the races
are rowed

he had to favor his game leg a little, and he
allowed Stehle to take his place. Stehle had
his ankle swathed in bandages and this morn-
ing it felt quite stiff, but this afternoon he was
able to take his share of a four-mile pull and
do his work well. Two doctors are attend-
ing him, and there is no sore ankle nearer than
