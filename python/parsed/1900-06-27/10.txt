to bad crop reports from the Northwest, some new

despatch from a prominent miller in Minnesota to a
friend here. stating that Senator Washburn, who has
deen travelling in the Northwest, says he doesn’t be-

Owners of the City of A sta and the Chi-
cago Equally Liable for Damages,

After the steamship City of Augusta sank the
Pennsylvania Railroad ferryboat Obicago on
the morning of Oct. 81 last cross-libels for
darmages were filed by the owners of each ves-
gel, $100,000 being dermanded for the loss of tho
Chicago and $10,455.42 for damages to the City

of Augusta, Libels were also filed against the
latter vessel for loss of life and property to the
amount Of $167,868.27. The owners of both ves
sels filed petitions for limitations of their
liability, each, however, denying fault on its
own part, The cases were tried together. Ina
decision handed down yesterday in the United
States District Court Judge Addison Brown
holds that it is impossible to acquit either vessel
of fault. The opinion concludes:

Both vessels muat therefore be held to blame,
and the owners equally liable to answer for the
loas and damage caused by the collision, subject
to the limitation of their ljability to the value of
the vease's.”’ \

Judge Brown allowed the following claims for
dainages for loss of lifein the collision: John
Bryson, $6,000; Charles E. Macready, $7,500;
Alexander Weir, $7,500.
