)001's stocks in store and afloat are over 800,000

ales less than @ year ago

Wes ana Wall Street, while local room traders
were also buying on a liberal scale and Europe
purchased, Europe is not in full_ sympathy
with the rise, however. June and July closed

October at 8.50c, and January at 8. 38¢

Turspay, June

The stock market developed pronounced
Most of the buying was for

strength to-day,
the long account, There was some covering
of shorts, but it was in a few stocks, The
short interest remains very large and may be

effectively utilized in promoting a further rise

in prices. The demand for stocks was mainly
from quarters in which the belief prevails
that the situation is far more favorable than
has been pictured by bear operators in Wall
Street, and that it warrants a considerable
Appreciation in values. This is the season,

anyway, when an upward movement in stocks

usually starts, and it seldom reaches its con-
clusion before Beptember, There is no good

reason why the experience in former years
should not be repeated this year, and the indi-

cations are that it will be.
The apprehension of undue lightness in money
is disappearing. The disclosure that the sup-

ply of foreign exchange in this market is larger

than was supposed will prove an important aid
in keeping money comparatively easy.
chiefly time exchange which is now maturing,
and It will serve to restrict, if not entirely stop,

the outgo of gold. This exchange becomes
available in the period that will elapse until
grain and cotton bills come on the market in

amount sufficient to meet all requirements.

Undoubtedly, much money will later be sent to
the West and South to move the crops, but this

should cause no embarrassment at this centre.
The resources of the banks are large and the
July interest and other disbursements will be the
heaviest ever known. Besides, should the oc-
casion arise, the Secretary of the Treasury will
promptly come to the relief of the money market.
The outiook for money, in brief, may be said to
have ceased to be troublesome. The call upon
the banks for $5,000,000 of Government deposita
was viewed with equanimity.

it has become apparent that the reports of
damage to spring wheat have been greatly
exaggerated, The spring wheat crop will be
smaller then last year, but there ts a bumper
crop of winter wheat, and there will, accord-
ingly, be no real shortage in wheat. There is
#0 much old corn in the country that a reduced
corn crop could result in no injury. It is too
early as yet to determine the size of the corn
crop, but with ordinary meteorological con-
ditions the crop will be large. The scare in
cotton is not well founded. It plainly was
promoted for speculative purposes, the same
As the scare which was worked up in spring
wheat. It finally is apparent that the rail-
roads will have their customary tonnage from
the crops and the proceeds 0° the crops.

The exhibits of earnings vy the railroads con-
tinue surprisingly good, Not only do the re-
turns show that the business of the roads is
not falling off, but that it actually is increas-
ing as compared with the heavy traffic at the
corresponding time last year. The showing
of the New York Central and Hudson River
Railroad for the quarter ending June 30 and
for the fiscal year ending on the same dato,
partly estimated, is truly remarkable. After
including $2,000,000 expended in extraordi-
nary items and charged to operation the net
earnings from operation in the year are more
than $3,000,000 greater than in the preceding
year, while the gross earnings are more than
$6,000,000 greater. While in the year 4.75 per
cent, in dividends have been declared, or \ per
cent. more than in the preceding year, the bal-
ance available for dividends is equal to 8.02
per cant. on the stock aa issued. The capital
stock now is $115,000,000. In the year ending
June 30, 1899, when the capital stock was $100,-
000,000, the balance available for dividends
was 6.71 per cent, Large increases in gross
earnings are reported by the St. Paul, Atehi-
son, Missourf Pacific, Southern Pacifie and
other leading lines. The disturbances tn
rates have subsided and the prospect is for a
continuance of the great prosperity of the rail-
roads,

A deoline in money rates at Berlin, coupled
with more favorable news from China, created
a better feeling abroad and was reflected in
higher prices for American stocks in London
and in the reoeipt of foreign ordera for the
purchase of some 25,000 shares of various
stocks {n this market. The largest dealings
on the Stock Exchange were in Brooklyn Rapid
‘lranait. In this stock there was at one spell
something of a acramble by the shorts to close
their contracts. The result was a rally of
nearly 6 points in the price, although part of
the gain was subsequently lost. The fluctu-
ations in Sugar Keflning ware wide, but not-
withstanding an advanoe of 10 cents a hundred
pounds in refined sugar, the stock closed lower
than yesterday. The steel stocks were not
particularly active, but they were strong.
People's Gas was in request and picked up in
price, There was a further decline in Balti-
more and Ohio common which was due to sel]-
ing of long holdings in consequence of the
delay in the deolaration of a dividend on the
stock. There was exeellent buying of the
Atchison issues, St. Paul, Burlington and
Quincy, Northern Pacific, Union Pacifie and
Loulsville and Nashville. While the closing
was not at the best prices of the day, {t was
firm,
