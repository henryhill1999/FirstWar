POGH’S PLAN 10 CUT |
OFF ENTIRE SALIENT

‘Had Gathered Forces for This
Opportunity, Says U. S.
War Department.

‘HIS Famers anes EXACT

Supreme Commnntes Looked
for Encircling Move-
ment at Rheims.

Special Despatch to Tue Sex.
WasHinoton, July 19.—The counter
Offensive launched against the Germans
by Foch is developing into an encircling
movement which has for its object the
cutting off of the entire salient made by
’ the Germans in their Atsne drive in
May and reaching down to the Marne.
To accomplish this all of the altied
reserves Foch has been holding and
steadily increasing . for just such a
counter stroke are being brought into
action on the sides of this salient.

Eight divisions of Americans, num-
bering 208,000 men, are already en-
@aged in this tremendous battle, with
more American divisions in the eserves

being brought up. This does not in-
clude American divisions on other
sectors not Involved in the present

offersive, twelve American divisions in
all being on the battle line.

‘* “Plans for an overwhelming stroke
against the Germans for the regaining
of captured Belgium and French ter-
ritory, by hurling an ‘overwhelming
man-power force against the enemy,
will not be changed by the present

. fighting. The attack ‘of the Franco-
- Americans this week
simply a forerunner of the crushing
blow the Allies are planning, and when
it has been consummated the present
operation will appear a minor one in
comparison with it.

Washington Is Elated.

With American troops engaged to this
extent, official Washington held its
breath to-day, while the great battle
went on and reports continued to come
in showing the offensive of the Allies
still making gains.

Elation over the fact that the Allies
shad wrested the initiative from the Ger-
mans by the aid of the American forces
poured into France in the last few
months was still the dominant topic here.

The fall of Soissons is believed to be
imminent. The development of the al-
lied offensive into an encircling move-
ment was indicated to members of the
House Military Committee in a confer-
ence at the War Department, which
served to increase the interest with
which the battle is being followed.

It was disclosed to-day In allied dip-
lomatic circles that the Foch counter-
stroke had not been suddenly determined
upon, but had been quietly in prepara-
tion for a week or more. Foch is cred-
ited, in well informed quarters here, with
having, by remarkab’é prevision, deter-
mined that the next drive of the Ger-
mans would be directed toward the en-
circlement of Rheims, and planned his
counter stroke accordingly.

As seen here the drive of the French
and Italians west of Rheims to-day and
the recapture of towns between Rheims
and the Marne are part of the same
movement, aimed at cutting off the Ger-
mans to the south.

Not only have German communica-
tiom lines running from’ Soissons to the

oc Mame been brought under fire, and some
eae@f the lines actually cut, but the neck

--of the salient has already been nar-
rowed.

Grave Peril for Germans.

Further progress by the Allies on
either side will involve huge German
forces in the gravest peril. With their
communication lines severed, their re-
tirement would be a matter of great
difficulty.

Military experts here regard the com-
bat now going on as the greatest battle
of mancuvres since the Marne, with
the advantage now plainly on the side
of the Allies. An offensive by the Brit-
ish is expected by many, though natur-
ally the plans of the supreme allied
command with regard to other parts of
the fron’ are being kept a deep secret.

That the Germans, seeing their peril,
will bring up all possible reserves, is
fegarded as a certainty by the experts
here, and the expectation of the British
offensive is based largely on keeping
‘@lese reserves down to their minimum.
¢

‘Pershing Commands in: Person.

Gen. Pershing is con@ucting opera-
tlens of the Americans in person, ac-
jeording to reports here. This explains
‘the fact that only a few messages have
‘dome from him since the battle started,
‘it is thoroughly realized by the Preai-
dent and Secretary Baker that the
American commander is too busily en-
faged to furnish them with anything
“bit the most meagre reports.

As stated in Tue Sew. this morning
‘the troops now engaged include the
‘Rainbow Division, which means that
New York troops of the old Sixty-ninth
ate taking part im the counter offensive.

Draw on Second Corps,

~Not only are all of the six divisions
-of the new First Army Corps, under
Major-Gen. Hunier Liggett, now en-
gaged, but some of the divisions of the
‘Recond Army Corps have been brought
into the fight.

» The divisions known to be engaged
here are the First and Second Divisions
of Regulars and Marines, the Twenty-
‘Fixth New England National Guard di-
_vision under Gen. Clarence R. Edwards,
“the Rainbow Division under Major-Gen,
(Charles Manoher, the Forty-first, made

That the drive will continue unless the
Germans can bring up more reserves

| F ORCE PRIEST TO RING

BELL AND KISS FLAG

 

“Frankfurter Zeit Zeitung” Calls| Mt. Vernonites Compel Him

for Internal Reform.

AMSTERDAM, July 19.—The

severest criticism in yesterday's iesue of
the Frankfurter Zeitung.

“When foreign countries see several |
persons with great influence upon the

State pursuing in this country policies
quite at variance; when they see that
the intention of one side is openly op-
posed by another; when every declara-
tion of those governing ie immediately

half recalled by a subsequent statement
and a jangling dispute rages in the
newspapers regarding the Interpretations
of it, then the world must assuredly
come to the conclusion thit the German
political system is false," saya the news-
paper in concluding its article. ‘That,
we believe, is the main reason why we
do not attain peace. Our declarations
are given no credit. There is only one
means of reforming our foreign policy.
It consists in reforming our internal
policy.”

The Frankfort paper opened its arti-

Five thousand citizens assisted in a
Ed-
pastor of the Ro-
Church of Our Lady of
Victory in Mount Vernon, for his
failure to ring the church bell in ac-
cordance with. a proclamation issued
yesterday afternoon by Mayor Brush
in honor of the Franco-American drive
The priest was haled from the church
and an explanatién demanded. When
he replied that he had no one to ring
the bell he was hauled inside and the
rope put in his hands. The bell was
rung.

The crowd outside the edifice became
more excited, and when Father Heinlein
appeared again he was caught and
forced to kiss an American flag nailed
to the church door. Father Heinlein
did not acquiesce at once and was pulled
and hauled around the vestry until he
consented. The hooting of the crowd |

policy pursued by Germany was carried
out “in a noisy squabble, with opponents

“We have by no means pursued a

policies, right and wrong, mixed," the
newspaper added.

Referring to Chancellor von Hertling's

business of the Foreign Minister was
merely to carry out the policy of the

Lonpon, July 19.—Lord Robert Cecil,
who has just let the post of Minister
of Blockade to become Assistant Sec-
retary of State for Foreign Affairs, in
an interview with the Associated Press
to-night urged the necessity of the En-
tente Allies sending immediate help to
the Czecho-Slovak forces along the

Trans-Siberian Railroad.

“The presence of a Csecho-Slovak
army in Russia at this time ts, I be-
lieve, one of the miracles of history,”
Lord Robert said. “We have beheld
one of the greatest empires of the
world plunged into such an appalling
state of disorganization that nothing
like it is known in modern history—a
situation so unprecedented that the
world seemed merely to stand aghast,
hopeless. :

“Then suddenly we find this Czecho-
Slovak army, well. drilled, carefully or-
ganized and ably led; we suddenly find
this army stretched across the back-

“If the Allies allow ft to be. wiped out
for want of ammunition, food or moral
support, there is absolutely no leaven
left to leaven the lump, and smal]! hope
remains of preventing the Russian peo-
ple from being overwhelmed by a terri-
ble series of economic disasters during
the coming winter.

“T recently have heard men who know
Russia well speak of what ts likely to
happen there during the coming winter
under the present clraotic conditions.
One authority estimated that 20,000,000
persons would perish as a result of dis-
ease and economic disasters which are
inevitable unless some unforeseen alle-
viatton comes and comes soon if we
can tide the Russian people over this
difficult, winter I believe they will begin
to met their feet again.

“One of the tragedies of the Russian
revolution has been that it resulted in
dispersion and disunion, rather than in
any united effort toward a united de-
mocracy. Wherever you get two Rus-
sisns tggether to-day you find two po-
litical parties--there are almost ae many
political parties as there are Russians.

“There are many uniting forces In

WASHINGTON, July 19.—Austria now
knows tat a million Americans are in
France and is beginning to realize what
American intervention In the war means.
A despatch received from Berne to-day
quotes the Vienna Arbeiter Zeitung as
saying the question now is whether the
German army can force a decision this
year before tle United States is able to
throw the whole weight of its force into
the balance.

“The Americans,” says the newsparer.
“are transforming the eituation against
whict the Entente found itself in a per-
ceptible manner every day, not only from
a political but also from a military point
of view. All the latest reports are in
agreement that there In no longer doubt
about the fact that a million Americans
are to-day in France. Their genius for
organization has obtaimed an amazing
result wich recalls the creation of ee
British army.

“All the forces that are arriving in
France to-day have been raised, trained
and equipped in a year and a half. Tho
participation of the Americans in the

}struggle increases to a gigantic extent

the intensity of the efforts which Ger-
many must make. It is a fact without
for Germany is

three States whose population is three
times superior to hers and whose talents
for organization and economic force are

equal to the organfzation an! economic

power of Germany.

“The Germans are maintaining their
positions, but there is a Ifmit to every-
thing and it can be understood that tre
supreme command of the German army

are striving to obtain a final decision

this yeaw. It is now a question of doing
this before the United States is abie to
throw the whole weigit of her force into
the balance, for the American transports
into France are increasing month by
month.”

GERMANS WOULD EMIGRATE.

Tax Ridden Popalation Wants to
Go to Ukraine, but Is Warned.

AMSTERDAM, July 19.—Reports reach-
ing .Berlin from various parts of the
fatherland. according to telegrams re-
ceived here, say the tax ridden popula-
tion is demrous of emigrating amd set-
tling In the Ukeaine, where it ta believed
farming conditions are easier and taxa-
tion will be Hmghter.

A warning has been issued against
this proposed emigration. It is pointed
out that no permission will be given
by the Government authorities for a
long time to persons who wieh to emi-
gzmte. Moreover, it is added, the Ukraine
still is unsafe, and the popular feeling
there so anti-German that the Germans
are anxious to get back home.

The cry comes from Danzig,

 

on the

Baltic Sea, that this district {s in im-
minént danger of being controlled by

the Poles The greatest war profiteers
there, it seems, are Poles. They are
buying up all the real estate in the
city and vicinity. The Polish Bank h
acquired a large edifice in Danzig and
the suburbs are full of Polish business-
men. It is sal? tltat among the politi-
cal schemes in the background is az
attempt to ‘secure an outlet for Poland
in the Baltic.

Wasninoton, July 19-—Negotiations
among the United States, Great Britain,
France and Japan as to the character
of military aid for Russia are continu-

agreement has been reached. It was
further stated that no American forces

have been landed in Russia except the
few marines at Vladivostok and on the
Murman coast.

Press despatches from Toktfo saying
the Japanese Government had accepted
a proposal of the United States for joint
milftary action in Stberia continued to
be the subject of guarded discussion in
official and diplomatic circles to-day,
with officials at the State Department
declaring emphatically that any an-
nouncement fn regard to the situation
would be premature.
