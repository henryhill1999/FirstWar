BOOSTS FAR EAST TRADE,.

Bureau of Commerce Organizes
Division for This Purpose.

Warunoton, July 19.—Creation of a
tar Eastern division with C. M. Bishop
of New York as chief was announced
to-day by the Bureau of Foreign ai
Domestic Commerce.

The new division is official recognition
of the closer relations between America
and the nationa of the Orient, espe-
Clally those bordering on the Pacific, as
@ result of the war, and is the first
step of the Government toward devel-
oping commercial] intercourse with them
on a large acale,

It will be the effort of the far East-
ern division to stimulate and facilitate
trade with the Orient and to make com-
merce with Asia as familiar and general
as trade has become with Latin Amer-
loa under the guidance of the bureau's
Latin American division. Information re-
garding the needs of the far Bastern
stations, their syetems of credit and what
they can send this country in return
for American goods will be gathered
for the benefit of manufacturers and
exporters.

Mr. Bishop formerly was head of the
far Eastern work of the American In-
ternational Corporation,

REACTION IN OATS TOO

 

General Increase Over Last
Year in Movement of All
Grain to Markets.

 

A report that owing to the heavy
Movement of wheat St. Louis elevators
had been ordered cleared of coarse grain
resulted in a sharp break In both corn
and oats, particularly corn, which at
one time yesterday was down nearly
14 cents a bushel from the high level
made only a few days ago. The move-
ment of corn is also very heavy. 80
far this week receipts have increased

1,800,000 Dushels over last year, oats
receipts have increased 1,800,000 bushels,
while wheat receipts have increased
6,500,000 bushels.

The freedom with which wheat is being
moved from the count?ry is surprising

CERTIFICATE ISSUE REDUCED.

Treasury Makes Third Biweekly
Offering §500,000,000.

Wasutnoton, July 19.—Oversubscrip-
tion of the first two blocks of Treasury
certificates issued in anticipation of the
fourth Liberty Loan and increased re-
turns from War Savings certificates and
from income and excess profita taxes
have made it possible to reduce the third
biweekly offering of Treasury certifi-
cates to $500,000,000, Secretary McAdoo
to-night announced. Institutions which
have made arrangements for subscrip-
tions on the basis of the usual offering
of $750,000,000 may carry out their
plans, it was said.

The third block of certificates will be
dated July 23, and will be payable No-
vember 21, 1918, with interest at 4%
per’ cent. Subscription books will be
closed July 30.

The offering of the issue for which
subscriptions closed July 16 was over-
sub bed by $9,438,000, the Treasury
announced to-day. New York, Phila-
delphia, St. Louls and Kansas City Fed-
eral Reserve districte exceeded their
quotas.

BARLY CURB GAINS
LOST IN REACTION

Stock Transactions Done on
Small Scale and Losses
Were Not Large.

 

 

Favorable war reports influenced
trading in the opening of the market
for outside securities yesterday, but it
was not before long that a reaction set
in and all of the earlier improvements
were lost. After the first few min-
utes of trading a bear drive on the
higher priced stocks sent prices down-
ward somewhat, but losses were not
large and business was on a small scale.
The lower priced oil ‘and industrial
stocks held the early gains in some cases
advancing above the morning prices.

The Andependent oll shares started off
well, but reacted subsequently with
fractional losses being made. Houston
Oll sold a point or so lower after gain-
ing at the opening. Merritt Oil strength-
ened toward the. close, advancing a
small fraction. The Standard Ol! shares
were firm, with Pterce Oi! showing
strength in the morning trading.

The motors were under pressure and
slightly lower. The speciasties were
quite active but without much change.
War stocks were particularly weak.

Mining stocks were strong. Big Ledge
Copper was in good demand.

Bonds were unusually active and gen-
erally higher. The feature was the
