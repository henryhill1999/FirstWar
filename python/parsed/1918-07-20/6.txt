ROGER A PRYOR, HALE
AT 90, CELEBRATES

Ex-Justice Was Penniless
Brigadier After War.

 

 

Roger A. Pryor, a penniless Briga-
dier-General of the Confederate Army,

! came to New York city fifty-three years

ago to make his way in a new and
strange land. He made his way suc-
cessfully, at last reaching the Supreme

Court,

Yesterday he celebrated his ninetieth
birthday at his home at Setauket, L.
1., surrounded by his family and rela-
tives, and received many telegrams of
congratulation from men who had
fought with him and against him in
the civil war, as well as from the sons
of men who belonged on both sides.

Early in the morning the aged jurist
arose and went for a three mile walk.
Then he came home to open his tele-
grams and to make preparations for
the reception of the relatives who were
to pass the day with him. Hearty and
strong, he went through with his cere-
monial day, and at the end said that
he was feeling ‘‘fine.”

Mrs. Sarah A. Pryor, who married
the former Justice of the Supreme Court
when he was 20 and she 18, had been
his constant helpmeet and companion
during his long and interesting career.

He left the command of a brigade in
Gen. Robert E. Lee's army with noth-
ing but a sword and a ragged uniform.
He had been a foreign minister and a
member of the National Congress be-
and when it closed he
came to New York to become by turns
a journalist, a lawyer and a member of
the Supreme bench.

“When the civil war ended,” he once
said to a friend, “Mrs, Pryor had to
pawn her watch and a ring for $300,
so that I might have civilian clothing
to wear North. There was no chance to

imake a lving for my family in Vir-

nia. I was told that New York was
free city, and that there was a wel-
come here for everybody. I found it so.”
He often said that to the association
had had with the late Gen. Daniel

May Result in Wider
Use of Pork.

 

Lonpvon, July 19.—Herbert C. Hoover,
Ameriean Food Controller, arrived in
London to-day. He was met by Waldorf
Astor, M. P., representing Premier Lioyd
George; John Robert Clynes, British
Food Controller, and representatives of
the American Embassy.

Food Administrator Hoover left Wash-
ington July 8 to make a survey of the
food situation in ,Europe. He was ac-
companted by Joseph P. Cotton, chief of
the meat division; James W. Bell of the
milling division, George 8. Jackson, vice-
president grain corporation of the Food
Administration, and Lewis Strauss, his
secretary.

Mr. Hoover will confer with the food
ministries of the Allies and endeavor to
determine their requirements and to
take measures to unify distribution. The
entire problem of pooling of food sup-
plies will ocupy a large part of his time
while in Europe.

 

Special Despatch to Tan Sox.

WASHINGTON, July 19.—Unified dis-
tribution of foods during the coming
winter among nations arrayed against
Germany on a basis which will main-
tain the efficiency of the fighting units
and the civil population at the highest
possible pitch will be the principal out-
come of the conferences between Food
Administrator Hoover and the food ad-
ministrators of allied nations. Prelimi-
nary negotiations having as their object
the pooling of the food supplies and re-
sources of the allied nations were
started with his arrival in England.

The food problems of the Allies will
be discussed from all viewpoints, and
after determining the available supply
of food an equitable arrangement of dis-
tribution will be devised. Particularly
is this true in connection with the prime
food commodities of a high nutritive
value and accudpying a relatively small
cargo space in oceangoing ships.

Needed Data Compiled.

Mr. Hoover left here on July 8 and
sailed a few days later. Before his de-
parture experts from his office here had
gone to London and Paris to compile
statistics and data relating to food sup-
plies and food requirements of all of the
allied Powers for the next twelve
months. That information will be placed
at Mr. Hoover's disposal and will be the
basis on which negotiations with other
nations will be conducted. Mr. Hoover
will remain abroad several weeks.

Accompanying Mr. Hoover is John P.
Cotton, chief of, the meat division of
the Food Administration; James W.
Bell, chief of the milling and flour di-
vision ; George S. Jackson, vice-president
of the United States Grain Corporation,
and Lewis Strauss, Mr. Hoover's secre-
tary.

Beef Supply Considered.

Dr. Alonzo Taylor, chief dietician of
the Food Administration, fs at the head
of the staff of experts who have been
abroad for tome time. Before the war
Dr. Taylor made an extensive study of
the food situation tn Germany and
Austria and is familiar with the re-
sources of those countries

The beef supply in the United States
will have special attention in the con-
ferences to be held by Mr. Hoover. The
shortage of beef in this country, to-
gether with the large needs of the allied
armies for this article of food, may
make it necessary for the civilian popu-
lations to substitute pork extensively for
beef.

A surplus of pork exists here, and the
Food Administration is in a position to
export sufficient quantities to meet the
needs of the civic populations of the
warring nations.

BEANS PLENTIFUL THIS YEAR.

Sugar Beet and Peanut Crops Also
Will Be Abundant.

WASHINGTON, July 19—The largest
crops of beans, sugar beets and peanuts
ever grown in the United States are in|}
prospect for this year's harvest. De-j
partment of Agriculture production fore-

000 bushels: an increase of almost [,000,-
000 bushels in the bean crop, with a
total of 19,791,000 bushels, and an in-
crease of 267,000 tons in sugar beet
crops with a total of 6,247,000 tons.

The hop crop. promises 32,494,000
pounds, an increase of almost 5,000,000
pounds over last year; broom corn, 70,-

kafirsd &c., 110,005,000 bushels, an in-

FOILED HUERTA WAR
PLOT, SAYS MEANS

Caused Arrest of Mexican Ex-
Chief While Here on Ger-
man Mission.

 

Cuicaao, July 19.—The assertion that
the late Victoriano Huerta, President of
Mexico, came to the United States after
he was ousted from the Presidency in
the interests of the German Government
and with the intent to cause war be-
tween Mexico and this country was
made on the witness stand to-day by
Gaston B. Means during his testimony
regarding an alleged second will pre-
pared by the late James ©. King. Means
was a witness at a hearing being held
as a result of an attempt of certain

heirs to have the will admitted to
probate.

During his testimony Means also
brought in the names of Count von
Bernstorff, J. Pierpont Morgan, Capt.
Boy-Ed and Secretary Daniels.

Means asserted that in 191p he was

told by a German official that Huerta
would come to the United States in the
interests of the German Government,
and that later he would return to Mexico
and attempt to embroll the southern re-
publics and the United States. The wit-
ness said he communicated this infor-
mation to a detective agency, which
brought about the arrest of Huerta. He
added that his action caused him to be
dismissed by Capt. Boy-Ed from the em-
ploy of the German Embassy.

Later, the witness said, he held con-
ferences with Joseph P. Tumulty, secre-
tary to the President; Secretary Daniels,
J. Plerpont Morgan and John R.
Rathom, editor of the Providence (R.
I.) Journal, at which he gave these men
information which resulted in the arrest
of Werner Horn while en route to blow
up a Canadian bridge over which Cana-
dian troops were being transported. He
also testified he had warned Government
officials of the destruction of the Parlia-
ment buildings at Ottawa

“Some German agents knew IT was on
familiar terms with Capt. Boy-Ed,'" the
witness testified, ‘and assumed anything
they said to me would go no further, I
listened to all they had to say and re-
ported it.”

Means sald that Mrs. Maude C. King
of whose murder he recently was ac-
quitted, was interested with him finan-
elally in supplying the German Govern-

ment with rubber, in violation of the
Anglo-American trade agreement. He
said Germany still) owed Mrs. King's

$167,000 as a re-
sult of these transactions,

The witness announced that he had
been ordered by the Department of Jus-
jtiee to report to the local bureau to as-
sist the authorities in unearthing Ger-
man plots in the United States.
