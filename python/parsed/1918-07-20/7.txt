BATTLE NEWS HELPS
SWELL SMOKE FUND

Donors Determined America’s
Fighters Shall Not Want
for Tobacco.

 

 

MANY BENEFIT AFFAIRS

Soldier Tells How “Makin’s”
Taste After Having a
French Cigarette.

 

"The first thing I tried to do after
lanling in France was to smoke a
French cigarette, and I failed!” That
fe the way the first letter from “the
front” to his people home by Sergeant
Jack Johnstone begins. Johnstone lived
at 101 West Seventy-third street ahd
received training at Plattsburg, saw ser-
vice on the Mexican border and had in-
tensive camp training at Spartanburg.
8o he hae had a taste of many varieties
of tobacco both here and abroad. But
he is faithful to the “good old American
tobacco,” for in continaaston fe writes:

“After wo had moved «up to the ‘real
thing’ for a night or two we were per-
fectiy comfortable in our ‘pup’ tents,
while the officera who were waiting for
theirs, which had got stalled somewhere,
had to sta:td up most of the night and
let their teeth chatter. I was made
happy, for along came a fellow who had
some American cigarettes and he was a
good fellow and shared with us in the
‘pup.’ Later, after we were billeted on
a kind old French woman, who knows
how to cook omelette to the ‘queen's
taate,’ and were assigned four perfectly
good barns for ourselves we met other
Americana with the ‘makin's’ and were
all right, with economy. We recent
arrivals, however, are waiting to get in
at a Sun distribution, of which we have
heard so much.”

As it appears on the transports and on
French soil, while it !s still a wonder
and a novelty, the American soldiers are
all tuned up for the gifte which are to
como to them through THe Sun Ta-
bacco Fund. Sergeant Johnstone's home
letter has doubtless been many times
@uplicated in substance, and especially
mith reference to tho tobaco episodes,
by soldiers writing not to the fund ora
@onor but to father and mother.

Isn't {t fine? The American soldier
looks forward with confidence to the time
when he will personally share in the
g00d brought over to Europe by Tue
Sun. They expect !t as confidently as
they expect thelr rations. And it ig the
unclouded intention of THe SuN Tobacco
Fun that so long as it can preach and
persuade people to “dig down” and find
the money which shall buy the smokes
and get them acrosg to the soldiers the
men shall never be disappointed.

Children Arranging Fete.

The thirty children who have organ-
ized to give a fete on the grounds of
Paul N. Hayes in Scarborough-on-Hud-
gon on the afternoon cf July 27 have

lecided finally on what is to be “requisi-
jioned" from the parents of each. The
children of Mr, and Mrs. Hayes are to
furnish five gallons of ice cream, others
will bring cake to.go with it; still others
lemon juice, &c. Big signs have been
tacked to the magnificent trees which
shade this historical part of Westchester
county by the children themselves, and
they expect a big turnout of guests
(paying guests) to their tobneco fete.

Miss Louise June Finch led her bevy
of pretty young women into Rector’s
Thursday night to sell scats for the
new play, “Mother's Liberty Bond,”
which is being rehearsed now for a pro-
duction at the Park Theatre. These
young salesiadies are volunteering their
valuable time and persuasive powers in
the interest of THe SUN Tobacco Fund,
which has accepted the offer of Bingham
and Doty, managers of the play, of a

enerous slice of its gross weekly re-
eipts in the New York run. The pur-
pose of their call at Rector's was to sell
tickets for a performance of the play at
$1.50 each. The tickets may be re-
deemed for any performance by present-
ing them at the box office of the Park
Theatre. The total sales of tickets on
Thursday night were $131.

Last night this party of young women
under the same chaperonage visited
Reisenweber's. They were accompanied
by Mrs. Florence Roesch and her daugh-
ter, Kathleen, who had volunteered their
aid on account of a lively interest in the
smoke fund for soldiers abroad. Mrs.
Roesch, an English woman is the wife
of Eugene J. Roesch, an American, an
assistant educational director of the
West Side Y. M. C. A. She is a public
lecturer and war speaker for the general
comfort of the soldiers at the front. She
knows by experience and acquaintance
with soldiers the vital necessity of to-
bacco and in her short speeches to the
guests of Rector's and Reisenweber's
ehe eloquentty and effectively portrayed
this need.

Chance to Buy Collles,

Manager Shult of Reisenweber's has
offered the freedom of the famous resort
to the beautiful Scotch collie and her
family which are to be sold at THe SuN
fund party to be held on the Paradise
Roof on the night of July 30. Accord-
ingly the donor of this interesting family
will ship them from Kyserike, Ulster
county, New York, in time for them to
be on view the day before the party.
This donor is Irving P. Favor of Cricket
Hill Farms.

These collies are of pedigreed stock.
The pups were sired by Montville
Clinker, A. K. C. 8. B. No. 235206. He
was a grandson of the famous champion
Wishaw Clinker, A. K. C. S. B. No.
78835, the fine animal owned and loved
by the late J. P. Morgan.

Almost to @ man and woman the stars
who will be playing in the city at the
time of this Paradise Roof party have
@nnounced their intention to be present
as guests. <A notion has already been
given of the splendid talent which will
gather there to entertain the guests. In
the list of those who will go to be en-
tertained and to show their devotion to
the smoke fund cause will be Blanche
Bates, Blanche Ring (the latter may be
induced to sing one song for the sol-
diers), Grant Mitchel and Holbrook
Blinn. The 400 Club ts also to be opened
for the smoke fund event.

Already we are in receipt of the pro-
gramme for Tue SUN Tobacco Fund Day
at the Samoret, Rockland, Me. It was
announced two days ago, but the man-
ager of the hotel and the committee in
charge evidently do not propose to let
the grass grow under their ¢eet. In
the afternoon thero will be a garden
fete and a putting eontest with an en-
trance fee for the Sagter of $1.25 and
in the evening a cav@ warty, for which
the tickets are being sold at $1.25 each,
The committee in charge, which an-
nounces that it will be very glad to re-
celve any financial contribution and any-
thing suitable for sale at the booths,
consists of Mrs. Justice Riddell, Miss
Amy Taylor, Mrs. Davidson Kennedy,
Miss F. 1. Dorset, Mra, L. H. Schultz,
Mra. J. C. Cook, Mivs. A L. Baggott, Mrs.
Willard Saulsbury, treasurer, © C. Ham-
mann and Walter Jarvis. The affair will
be on the afternoon and evening of
July 26.

Somerville Concert Wednesday.

Prospe of the success of the grand
concert offered to the fund at Somer-

I carr

ville, N. J., next Wednesday night are
extremely bright. It will be in the ar-
mory, which has a large seating capac-
ity, and the neighboring towns are tak-
ing as much interest in it as Somerville
itself. Mrs. Florence Turner Maley,
who will sing a group of juvenile songs,
is well known in the vicinity as an ar-
tist, having appeared there on various
occasions and her name is, on that ac-
count, particularily attractive. John
Paimer, the reader, and Ida Sterner,
coloratura soprano, have appeared in
Somerville before, and have a large
number of admirers. The other excel-
ent artists on the bill are Ruth Hutchin-
son, planist; William Scarpioff, tenor,
and Earl Tuckerman, basso, W. W.
Major of Somerville and the National
Park Bank, thia city, and Mrs, James A.
Lynch of Ardemar Farm, Somerville, N.
J., may be applied to by those wishing to
reserve seats,

The news from abroad, the magnifi-
cent but expected news from abroad, is
having its natural effect in spurring men
to renewed interest in Tur SUN Tobacco
Fund. A letter with a check for $50
enclosed expresses the profound feeling
of elation that accompanies victory:
"Elated by the success of our boys in
their drive through the Hun lines to-
day, we are pleased to express our ex-
citement by the enclosed donation of $50
for more smokes for the boys. Faster
legs to the boys when they chase the
Huns!” It is signed World Chemical
and Metal Company of New York, by R,
Hershcopf, treasurer.

think you are doing splendid work and
trust you will keep it up, ae it is a great
comfort to those “over there’ who re-

To-day it is impossible for any one to
go into a Schulte or United cigar store
and make a tobacco purchase without
depositing the coupons or certificates in

{s too full of the glorious news from the
battle front to permit anybody to even

SHOE WORKERS GET
INCREASE IN WAGES

Brockton Manufacturers Grant
20 Per Cent. Raise—Police
Act in Bristol.

 

 

Brockton, Mags., July 19.—The Brock-
ton Manufacturers Association to-day
granted a 20 per cent. wage increase to
ehoe workers, other than cutters, to be
paid as a war bonus. The advance af-
fects nearly 20,000 operatives. The cut-
ters’ continued absence forced 2,000 more
operatives out of work, making nearly
7,000 idle. a

 

Bristo.t, R. I., July 19.—Police re-
serves were called out here to-day to
disperse strike sympathizers who threat-
ened to rush the plant of the National
India Rubber Company in the attempt
to force 1,500 workers to leave the fac-
tory. Two strikers were arrested.

The strike began Tuesday, the disaf-
fected employees demanding a 25 per
cent. wage increase. More than 1,360
are on strike and 2,000 others have been
forced out of work.

 

HAVERHILL, Mass., July 19.—Several
thousand members of the Allied Shoe
Workers Union to-day joined a general
strike of shoe workers which has been in
progress here for more than a week.
Union leaders estimated 3,000 operatives
quit to-day and that their idleness would
result in over 8,000 of the 15,000 shoe
workers in the city belng thrown out of
employment. Manufacturers placed the
number of new strikers at not over 2,000.

The shoe workers scek a 20 per cent.
wage increase.

 

Ho.Lrokk, Mase#., July 19.—Employees
of the Holyoke Glazed Paper and Card
Company, numbering 150, struck to-day
for an increase of 25 per cent. in wages
and a reduction from 52 to 50 working
hours a week. The strikers are not
organized.

 

Warren, R. I, July 19.—Loom fixers
and weavers at the Warren Manufac-
turing company and the Parker mills,
who have been on strike for three weeks
for a 15 per cent wage increase, de-
cided at a mass meeting to-day to con-
tinue the strike until their demands were
granted. Of the 2,500 employees 750 are
involved in the strike, forcing a reduc-
tion in output of more than 80 per cent.,,
according to estimates of company of-
ficials.

 

LYNN, Mass., July 19.—Walter C. Fish,
general manager of the Lynn plants of
the General Electric Company, where
10,000 employees are on strike, gave out
to-day the text of a message sent to
President Wilson last night, in which
he declared the action of the men fn
walking out without giving the com-
pany any reason was contrary to the
war policy of the Government.

The men hag telegraphed the Presi-
dent expressi®v thelr willingness to sub-
mit wage and other differences to the
War Labor Board for adjustment.

NITRATE PLANT DESTROYED.

Marquetre, Mich, July 19.— Three
men were killed and damage estimated
Qt several hundred thousand dollars was
done by an explosion to-day at the
nitrate plant of the Actna Explosives
Company, near Ishpeming.

The plant, which was engaged on
Government orders, was destroyed. The

INCREASES OF PAY
WON BY POLICEMEN

least $1,500, combined with the pension
inducement.

The patrolmen and firemen rejoice
over the capture of part of the dbjec-
tives of their long and trying “drive.”
They are giad that the comrade with
the meanest pay has received recogni-
tion. They will not be satisfied, how-
ever, until the $1,500 men, the men with
families and settled responsibilities, also
receive their increases. They probably
will ask the Board of Estimate to ad-
vance the $1,600 grade to $1,800 on
January 1 if it cannot do so earlier.
The patrolmen’s increases voted yes-
terday are as follows:

Second grade, from $1,400 to $1,500 a
year.

Third grade, from $1,300 to $1,450.
Fourth grade, from $1,200 to $1,850.
Fifth, sixth and seventh grades, from
$1,060 to $1,200.

Police matrons go from $1,200 to $1,-
3650.

The firemen's increases are:

Second grade, from $1,250 to $1,400.
Third and fourth grades, from $1,050
to $1,200.

One-fifth of Forces Benefit,

The men who benefit are only one-
fifth of the 13,049 patrolmen and fire-
men now on the payroll. The other
four-fifths are in the $1,500 grade. The
increases voted will cost the city only
$380,090 a year, or $150,875 for the five
months until the beginning of the new
year.

To give all the 13,049 mon the 10 per
cent raise which they requested would
cost about $1,800,000 a year. The Board
of Estimate argued that this was too
great a burden to assume in the middle
of the year, when the money would have
to be found in ways not contemplated
by last year’s budget makers, but that it
might be assumed in the budget for next
year if departmental economies could be
effected,

The -finance committee, of which
Comptroller Craig is chairman, decided
on the increases in a rather feverist
meeting on Thursday afternoon. Yes-
terday morning the temperature of the
board members was not at all lowered
by the news in Tue Sun that a group of
prosperous New Yorkers beaded by Eli
Joseph, epecial Deputy Fire Commie-
sioner, preposed to raise a fund and give
tre firemem@ 10 per cent. bonuses if the
city administration felt that the city was
too poor to pay a wage that would keep
firemen from resigning and attract new
men. When the Board of Estimate,
which has the same personnel as tre
finance committee, met in its regular
Friday open meeting there was nothing
about fire or police salaries on the
printed calendar. The clerk, however,
soon began reading a communication
from tre finance committee, with resolu-
tions which had been drafted such a
short time before that they were not
typewritten.

Finance Committec Reports.

The faithful committee of bluecoats
and bluestirts which had worked for
seven harassing weeks in ite effort to
convince the Hylan administration that
emergency conditions demanded emer-
gency treatment was on hand. The
gatrolmen and firemen knew that the
board would not meet again until Sep-
tember and that for them it was “now
or never.” Trey perked up when the
clerk introduced their favorite topic. He
read:
“To the Board of Estimate and Appor-
tionment.
“GENTLEMEN: On July 12, 1918, your
board referred to its committee on
finance and budget a communication
dated July 9, 1918, from the Police Com-
miasioner requesting that the salaries
of the uniformed force of the various
ranks and grades of the Police Depart-
ment be increased (approximately 10
per cent.) as follows:
(Mr. Enright had recommended in-
creases for every man from chief in-
spector down, including $150 for each
patrolman and matron.)
“Your committee upon consideration of
the urgency of this matter has deter-
mined to recommend the adoption of
the annexed resolution, which affects the
matrons and all of the patrolmen up to
the first grate. The other matters re-
ferred to tn the communication of the
Police Commiasioner (meaning his
reoommendation regarding all uniformed
men above second grade patrolmen) are
held under consideration by your com-
mittee in connection with the 1919
budget, and for recommendation at an
earlier period if it is found feasible to
take such action. The adoption of the
annexed resolution will give effect to
such recommendation. Respectfully sub-
mitted, CHARLES L, CRAIG,
“Chairman of the committee on finance
and budget.”

ST

Aldermanic Action Urged.

The resolution recommended to the
Board of Aldermen the establishment of
grades in the Police Department with
the new salaries as given above. The!
letter and resolution from the finance
committee regarding Fire Commissioner
Drennan's r@juest for a 10 per cent.
advance for the firemen and the recom-
mended increases were along the same
line, except, apparently by an oversight,
nothing wae said about raising the $1,500
firemen before next year if it proved
feasible.
When the clerk called the roll on the
resolutions no member of the board said
anything, which meant that everybody
voted “aye.” So in a jiffy the Board of
Eatimate had voted the tncreases which
hung fire so long, but to the distress of
the $1,500 men had

the present.

In the corridor members of the two
blue armies had an !tmpromptu consul-
tation. They were happy over the relfef
given the lower grade men, and gave un-
measured praise to THE SUN for its as-
sistance in the fight, and to Joseph J.
O'Reilly, their spokesman in personal
appeals to the Board of Estimate. But
it was obvious that the postponement of
more pay for the great majority of men,
who are in the $1,600 class, did not
please them. They talked of going after
a $300 raise for January 1, instead of
the 10 per cent.. or $150, which they
had requested beginning July 1

left them out for

 

 

 

 

Citizens May Raise Fand

It was suggested to Albert E. Guinness,
president of the Uniformed Firemen's
Association, that Commissioner Joseph
and his friends might raise their fund
and give a bonus to the $1,500 men, aa
Mr, Joseph had thought of doling for all
the firemen who stuck to tte dejart-
ment, if the city did not act.

“No,” sald Guinness. “Commissioner
Joseph is a prince, and we certainly ap-
preciate his generosity, public spirit and
desire to help the Fire Department. But
bonuses from private sources would be
charity, and no fireman would accept
charity, All the f'reman wants is a
fair day's pay from the city of New

York for a fair day's work for the
city.”
Mr. Joseph and officials of the Fire

Department heard yesterday from sev-
eral very well known New York men
who wanted to cotitribute to the bonus
fund. It {8 possible that if the money
can be awarded in some way so it may
be paid officially by the department
rather than through private sources the
project wil! not be dropped.

Fire Commissioner Drennan and Chief
Kenlon had nothing to say about the
action of the Board of Estimate. Police
Commissioner Enright was out of town.

 

EUROPE IS WATCHING
SHIPBUILDING IN U. 5.

Entente Welcomes New Ton-
nage, but Foresees It as a
Factor When Peace Comes.

 

GERMANS ARE ALARMED

Activity Urged in Kaiser's
Yards, Many New Vessels
Being Under Way.

 

Progress in shipbuilding in the United
States, an incident of which was the
ninety-five launchings on July 4, has
attracted much attention all over Eu-
rope, as shown by the latest newspapers
from the other side. English, French and
other allied writers look with undis-
Guised satisfaction on the additions to
the American mercantile marine, know-
ing that without our new ehips the Pn-
tente cause would be seriously handi-
capped.

In Germany a note of alarm sounds
in the writings of the Junker, and the
shipbullders are being appealed to to
meet the “Yankee menace” after the
war. At the same time the Germans do
not appear to be perturbed over the
movement in Entente countries, espe-
cially in England, to boycott German
ships and German goods when peace
comea, They take the view that if
such a plan is carried out the United
States will not join In ft, in which case,
they believe, all such efforts by others
will be nullified.

Germans are being fed also with dire
predictions attributed to members of
the Industrial Workers of the World in
this country, the general trend of the
sop being that history has shown that
whenever a nation approached England
In @ea power the latter worked in-
sidiously to form a pretext for starting
a war with the object of humbling her
rival. To bolster their contention the
Boches point to the cases of Holland,
Spain, France and finally Germany.

In neutral countries surveys of the
situation are being printed assiduously,
the losses from submarines and the post
bellum need of bottoms being argued
from every standpoint. Lack of raw ma-
terial, however, is a serious handicap to
the neutrals, as almost invariably some
necessities are controlled by belliger-
ents and their shipment is almost a
hopeless task.

Praise for American Labor.

Speaking of the position and pros-
pects of United States shipping and ship-
building, Enginecring, printe@ in Lon-
don, says:

“In view of her resources up to a
few months ogo and her available vol-
ume of skilled labor America is now
doing wonderfully well. Thus she is
Playing and will play a highly welcome
part in helping to solve the shipping
Problem, and it is not unlikely that
after the war that country will be our
chief rival in the ocean carrying trade,
as she was in the first half of the nine-
teenth century.

“In the middle of the last century the
Americans came near to beating us in
ocean shipping, and history may pos-
sibly repeat itself. Ambitious plans are
being made for a permanent revival of
the United States merchant marine.

“But we may rest assured that we
shail not experience from America that
kind of State subsidized and bounty fed
undercutting of freights and passenger

rates that characterized the German
competition beforo the war and will
govern itself again if we take no

measures to check it.
tition will be fair and aboveboard.

“Tf, as is probable, American ship-
ping is subsidized It will be only to an
extent sufficient to balance the difference
between costs at home and abroad, In
strict accordgnce with the protective
principle of the United States law, It
will not be done, as in the case of Ger-
man subsidization, with the set inten-
tion of destroying our position as a
shipping power.

“When war broke out the tonnage of
United States shipping engaged in for-
eign trade was only, in round figures,
1,000,000 tons, though the country pos-
sessed about six times that tonnage
employed in the lake, river and coastal
shipping. Britain had 18,000,000 tona of
ocean shipping and Germany 5,500,000
tons. Only about 8 per cent. of Amer-
ca’'s oversea commerce was carried in
American vessels,

American compe-

Inaugarated Before the War. |

“The great boom In American ship-
building and its twin trade shipping is
not, however, a creation of the war,
though it has been accelerated by the
war. It is part of a national movement
for more ehips inaugurated before and
apart from the war. More than twenty
years ago a merchant marine league
was formed in the United Stutes to ad-
vocate the restoration of shipping.

“When it was found that the Panama
Canal was at last likely to be opened |
to traffic the ‘more ships’ question be-
came one of practical politics,

“If our workmen and their unions are
unreasonable, {f our engineers will not
adopt standardization and other eco-
nomical methods, if our builders will not
cooperate and combine and if our
atatesmen will not recognize the rights
of enterprise and stop unfair foreign
competition, then nothing can prevent
such a growth of American and German
shipping and such decline of our own
€@s will spell the downfall of the British
Empire.

“The central and supreme fact is that
we possess such great natural and eco-
nomic advantages in shipping and ship-
building that we easily ought to main- |
tain a very long lead In these lines, With
our coal and iron suppliea, our ateel
worka and building yards and harbors
all practically side by side, with our
unique geographical eituation, with our
Great bullding oapacity and inherent
skill in this trade we hold a combination
of special favors, These advantages en-
abled us before the war to bulld and sail
ships more economically than any other
nation,

“But what of the future?

 

Some au-
thorities consider that one result of the
war will be the removal of the great
difference between British and American
costs Which has hitherto existed.”

Urges Germany to Activity.

Germania, the Berlin organ of ast
Centre party, is the most persistent of
the German newspapers that are urging
feverishly the bullding of new ships to
fiy the Kaiser's flag. Predicated on the
hope that Germany will regain all of its
lost colonies Germania harps upon the
connection between ‘colonial policy”
and “sea power policy.”

“German Central Africa’ is now a
dominating idea among the junkerdom.
In arguing that point Germania, which
has accesr to official views, says:

“The more hopes are based upon an

Central Africa the
more clearly will it be seen that such
expectations are not realizable if Ger.
man sea power is restricted to the At-
lantic Ocean, German sea power must
embrace the Indian Ocean.”

The Pacific also comes in for much at-
tention, Stress is laid on the fact that
Mexico will be exploited commercially
from both

extensive German

the Atlantic and Pacific

sides. The Panama and Suez canals are
looked upon as aids to the “German

 

belt that will extend around the world.”

German statistics show that on Janu-
ary 1, 1914, the German merchant
marine counted 5,469,296 tons. Through
the war about 50 per cent. of this has
been lost. Counting German vessels
lying idle in neutral ports the losses
have been about two-thirds of the total.
However, ehipping yards in Germany
have been busy as possible during the
war. New tonnage under construction,
according to authentic German statistica,
totals about $50,000 tons,

New Ships for Germany.

Some of the new boats being built and
the yards or the companies making them
