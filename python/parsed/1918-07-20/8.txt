REALTY MARKET
NEWS AND COMMENT

Trading Affected Apartments,
Business Buildings and
Dwellings.

 

 

RESALES ARE A FEATURE

 

Operators and Others Are Paid
Higher Prices—Many Build-
ings Are Leased.

 

Selling in the real estate market yes-
terday affected many kinds of realty
and reached into a number of sections.
Apartments, a business building and

several tenements and dwellings were
sold, and a number of buildings were
taken on long leases for new uses.
Several of the transactions announced
were resales at advances above pre-
vious selling prices. The mortgagor of
the Arlington Court apartment on Wash-
ington Heights who several months ago
was forced to protect his interest in the
auction market by taking over the prop

ty has resold it to a realty company.
A corner on Morningside avenue has
been resold by operators after an own-
ership of several weeks. A bullding in
the chemical district was purchased by
speculators who are understood to have
practically resold it, presumably at a
figure above the price which they paid.
It had been long held by the owners,
Leasing was notable by the number of
buildings which were taken for long
terms and for warehouse purposes.

HEARING ON I. R. T. NOTE ISSUE

Speyer and Schiff Regard Terms
Favorable to Company.

the application

before the Public Service

of the

Interborough Rapid Transit Company
to issue $39,476,000 of three year 7 per
cent. notes was concluded yesterday fol-
lowing testimony by James Speyer and
Jacob H. Schiff to the effect that they
regarded the proposed terms of the issue

as favorable

for the company.

Mr. Speyer said he considered the sale
of the notes at 95% to the bankers and
to the public at 98% of 98% asa favor-
able proposition, considering the present
state of the money market and the con-
dition of public utility corporations gen-
erally. \When asked ff he regarded the
provision) for having the notes converti-
ble into the company’s first mortgage
bonds at 87% as being a wood feature
of the offering Mr. Speyer replied that
one could only speculate as to that be-
cause it all depended upon the condition
of the bond market three years from

now.

“I don’t think any human being can
tell what the conditions will be then,”
said Mr. Speyer.

Mr. Schiff declared that he doubted if
any banker not already interested and
more or less responsible for Interbor-
ough financing would make as good an

offer.

He sald he considered the propo-

sition a@ outlined quite favorable to the

company.
