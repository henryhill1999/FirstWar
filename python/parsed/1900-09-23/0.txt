NEW YORK,

TWO TRAIN ROBBERIES.

 

The Burlington Portland Fiyer Held Up in
Nebraska.

Lincoun, Neb., Sept. 22.—The Burlington's
Portland flyer was held up and robbed nine
miles west of here at 1 o'clock this morning
Two of the robbers concealed themselves ou the

ores# car plitform until the suburbs ware
‘eached. Then they crawled over te tender
and compelled the engineer to run four miles

>a point where two other menibers of the gang
were In waiting, reénforcing the command with
several thumpé of thelr sorelens on the en-
gineer’s head. The fireman was induced to
work harder by the same method.

The waiting members of the gang s!gnalied
their whereabouts with a bonfire built between
the rails, A fusilade of shots directed against
the express car door impelled the messen er
to open it. The through safe contained be-
tween $5,000 and $6,000, but the measenger did
not have the combination and the robbers dfa
not have any dynamite. They were forced
to be content with the contents of the local
eafe, about $200

lhe other members of the train crew and
the passengers were kept within the cars by
a detail of two robbers, who gave occastonal
reminders of their presence by a shot or two
iu their direction. No attempt was made to
molest the passengers. When their work

was finished the fellows signalled the engineer {

') go ahead. The robbery was reported soon
afterward, and posses have been scouring
he country, but no clue has been secured,
Bloodhotuas were put on the trail, but they
soon lust the scent. A two-horse team was
stolen off the etreets laat night, and it ts be-
jieved that this was utilized In conveying the
robbers to the acene and back again, It haying

been possible for them to have left the city |

on some early morning train. Two of ‘the
men were masked and two he'd thelr faces
painted. Three suspects are under arrest,
one of them a tramp who attempted to get
off the train when the robbers released ft. Re-
wards aggregating $2,000 have been offered
for their capture.

Srowane, Waeh., Sept, 22.—Single handed
a masked robber held up the west bound pas-
gouge train on the Northern Pacific at 1 o'clock
last night and sucoseded in getting away with
about $500 in cash, several watches and a quan-
tity of jewelry. The robbery was committed
after the train left Athol, 1daho, and the robber
Jeft the tratn at Rathdrum. The hold-up evi-

dently was carefully planued, and was outed
sith a ool deliberation, which #howed that
the robber thoroughly understood his busi-

ness. Until he had left the train few of the
passengers realized that only one maa Was fu
the plot.

Couduector Dunuing was the ouly person on
the vain who offered se: ious resia'anoe, a fey

The record-holder Deutsdiland of the Ham-

down to-day, but the operators say they will

have a laree force of men. The strikers, on
the other hand, say there will not bea corporals
gaurd to go to work. They base their state-
ment on two meetings that were held in Robin-
son's Hall to-day, one in the forenoon and one

made up of Lithuanians, the half-savage, leno-
rant men who solely were engaged in the riot-

entirely unsatisfactory vote it was declared the
