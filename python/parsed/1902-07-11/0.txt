about 100 were in the place where it did | ance could

were not more than 100 caught in the fall,

and that they will be reecued @* soon &s

“We have large forces of men at work

President Powell Stackhouse and General
Manager Price left for the Mill Creek open-
ng of the mine at 630 to take personal
charge of the rescue work They said
before leaving that they did not expect
to obtain any definite knowledge of the
situation In the mine for several hours,

but both of them expressed the hope that

inen. They declared their belief that
the men who were not Billed at first were
«till alive, but thie te discredited by per-
sons who were underground when the
explosion took place

At 11 o'clock to-night the searching
party hunting for the bodies of the dead
had not reached the place where the ex-
ploaion occurred, and were not certain of

Two foreignere who had escaped the

FDWARD L. BONNER KILLED.

Permeriy Montana Member of Republican

Heavena, Mon, July 10 Pdward L. Bonner, |
a millionaire Jumberman, merchant and
banker, fell from an automobile at Mis-
soula, to-day, dying instantly. He was |
stricken with heart failure He was a

pioneer of Montana and formerly Mon-
tana rember of the Republican National
Committee

Mr

Bonner was 65 veare old. He was a
Maseachusetta boy He came to New

York city as a lad. and was an errand bey |
for the old house of HB. Claflin & Co
He was a typical New York bey of those
days in 1866 he went to Missoula and
opened a general store One of his rivals
at the time was Senator Willlam A. Clark

 

All the goods sold by Mr Ronner were |
carted by ox teams for hundreds of miles,
and most the great money was made |
at times in “cornering” candies, whieh
were used in the mines |
Then there was a great deal of money
made in assaying gold and silver ores |
Mr Bonner became a millionaire early
in the @, and almost every winter he

would come to New York city and live |

at the Fifth Avenue Hotel. On one of
these trips le took a course in minerlogy,
thinking to get ahead of Senator Clark,
but it turned out that Senator Clark on one
of his trips to New York city had taken
a similar course at Columbia College, and |
Mr Bonner ues! to tell how he and Senator
Clark with their professional know ledge
could make a great deal more mor in
assaying the gold and silver ores than
their rivals

Mr. Bonner sold anything from a shoe-
string to an ox team, He then became
interested in the copper mines of Montana |
and was one of the pioneers in getting
out the copper ores in the territory around
Butte, which is known as “the mountain of
copper.”

Wr Ronner of late wears has lived at the
Waldorf-Astoria with his wife and daughter. |

and early in March he bost his only son,
