CHINESE COMING FOR FUNDS.

PlaneSaideto He to Sell Rank and Titles
to Chinamen Here.
Speriah (udle Despatch to THE SUNG

Pears. Oct. 12. Mr. Conger, the Areri-
can Minister, yesterday view! the pase-
porta of the Chinese Commissioners and
their attendant, who will go to New York,
San Franciao and the Philippine Islands
to solicit funds. This plan of the Chinese,
which embraces the Chinese colonies
throughout the yworld, is condemned by
the British and) Dutch Ministers as im-
moral

In reply to inquiries for information on
the subject IA Hung: Chang said that it
was the purpose of the Commisstonen to
sell rank: and titles to obtain money for the
relief of the famine sufferers in Shensal
Tt was originally announoed that the ob-
ject was to obtain money to
help pay the indemnity Li Hung
Chang denied having any  detatled
knowledge on the subject Be belitthed
the enterpriae, and said/tnat since the plan
was launched an edict forbidding traffick-
ing in rank had been tasned The orginal
recuea@t thas wae made of the Ministers to

feeue pasaports fo the Commissioners,

whieh they are not empowered to do, is
noderatood'to have been a deviee on the
part of the Chinese to sound the foreign
represer.tatives a4 to their attitude towarda
the plan

The French and Japanese Mihuisters will
pr hhablw vie® the passports of the Com-
missioners going to Cochin China and other
French possessions and Japan, Dut the
Chinese representatives will be kept under
cloee eurveillance in those places. It ia
understood that the Duteh and Britieh
Ministers will not give their vieé to the
pMansports of the Commis*toners going to

“An opportunity will also be afforded
of weeding out those who are unsatisfactory,
thus avoiding much expense and wasted
instruction. Any system looking to the
development of our navy should void
the error of not having the personnel keep
pace with the materia If we are adding
to the navy each year new ships and new
guns, all of the most modern type, we should
certainly not fail to provide also the trained
officers and men with which they must be
manned. The fact should not be lost sight
of that it requires a much longer time = to
produce a naval! officer than it does to pro-
duce a battleship

“It is recommended that legislation be
enacted providing that the quota of en-
listed men and apprentices shall be as

2,500 apprentices under training at the
training stations and on board training
ships. This is an inerease of 3,000 men
