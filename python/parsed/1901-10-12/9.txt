NORTHERN PACIFIC PLANS.

AN AUTHORITY SAYS THEY ARE
STILL INDEFINITE.

of That Company and
of the Great Northern Are Consider-
ing the Slivation--St. Paul Steck «
Strong Leader in the Market Yesterday.

The sensational advance tn thé price of
Chicago, Milwaukee and St. Paul stock

 

yesterday from 150% to 167, closing at 166, i

gave rise to rumors connecting St. Paul
with the alleged plan to consolidate the
control of the stocks of the Great Northern
and the Northern Pacific Railroad, The
denial by President James J. Hill of the
Great Northern that arrangements were
under way to place the majority stock
holdings of that company and the Northern
Pacific in the custody of a new proprietary
corporation caused a cesmition of buying
of Great Northern shares, which developed
extraordinary strength on Thursday. It
was suggested by well-informed Wall
Street men, however, that President Hill's
denial was technical rather than absolute
Financiers clorely identified with the
Harriman syndicate intimated that while a
proposition to form «4 proprietary cotm-
pany to take over the Great Northern
and Northern Pacific stocks is under eon-
aideration, the idea is not sufficiently de-
veloped to warrant a public discussion of
details. The present controtling interest
in the Northern Pacific, | was asseried
hed not assented to the scheme. One
important member of the Harriman eyndi-

cate said

*The plans that have heen reported to
have heen made concerning the Northern
Pacifie and the Great N rtherty railroada
are entirely in the future, and nothing
definite has been determined, The repr:
sentatives of each interest have been work-
ing in certain direetions and are still con-

sidering the situatio:
Late in the afternoon rumors were cir

culated on the floor of the Stock Exchange

that the Morgan-Tfill interests hed ot

tained undisputed contre! of the Northern
Pacific Railroad through the exchange « t
Mr. Morgan's minority holding» of St. Paul
stock for the Northern Pacific preferred
ehares held by the Standard Oil interests
Persons prominently identified with the
interests concerned said that they knew

nothing of any <uch transactior

A rumor which was received with much
credence in the closing minutes of the Stock
Pxchange was that valuable stock rights
are soon to be iasued hy the Great North-
ern management in connection with lines
constructed in the State of Washington
These rights, it Was asserted, were expected
to be worth from 10 to 3) per cent. Some
brokers said that bids of 15 per cent. had
niready been made on the Street for these
proepective rights

 

COLLATERAL

Internal Revenoe § Department
Ruling Concerning It.

Collector of Internal Revenue Treat re-
ceived yesterday the ruling of the Internal
Revenue Department at Washington re-
garding the taxation of collateral stock
The Collector rules that pledged or collateral
ecourity for the future payment of money
is taxable at two cents on $100 whenev er
it is accompanied by an evidence or memo-
randum of transfer. This tax cannot, of

course, apply to cases where loans are ac-
complished with hypot heeated stock and
no certificate of transfor entered

The ruling is based upon a decision al-
ready rendered by the Attorney-General
Tt is understood that the New York Clearing
House will carry an appeal on this decision

Parpar, Oct. 11.

The stock market made
play of strength to-day and there was «
material increase in the volume of busi-
nees, the trananctions falling only « little
below 1,000,000 shares. The dealings in
railway bonds, while not up to yesterday's
record, were considerably larger than in
many weeks past, and in this department
aleo strength and well-distributed interest
was displayed. London contributed tow-
ard improvernent in this market by @
higher range in American railway shares
at that centre, and arbitrage dealers fo!-
lowed this up by purchases in this market
on balance of upward of 90,000 shares

This buying was partly for account of |

the Continent, which was reported to show
a disposition to take hold of the Pactfic
railway tasues. Doubtless the purchases
referred to, as well as the strength of the
local stock market, was to an extent at-
tributed to the further covering of short
contracts. At the same time investment
purchaess are reported

The stimulating infuences in the local
market appeared to be an impression that
the principal security owning interests
in the Western and Northwestern railway
systems have resumed the elaboration
of comprehensive plana for a still closer
and harmonious working out of the prob-
lems presented in transportation economics,
including the betterment of properties
and improvement of the rate situation
In the event of a reduced volume of gen-
eral business, a steady maintenance of
rates resulting from a community of tn-
teresta in the great Northwest, together
with a reduced operating cost, would go
& great way toward preventing a reduc
tion of net profita to the railroads

The change in the temper of the Street
resulting from the rally in security prices
yesterday and to-day was to a consider-
able extent attributed to a change of posi-
tion by some of the more prominent pro-
fessional operators, induced by the more
favorable immediate monetary conditions
following the release into the regular
financial channels of many millions of
dollars that had been invested by the banks,
trust companies, savings banks and other
corporations, in the revenue warrants
fasued by the municipality of the Greater
New York last spring and subsequently
The amount of the New York city loans
paid off this week out of the proceeds of
the collections for taxes is estimated at
fully $16,000,000 Doubtless, a fairiy con-
siderable portion of this money was loaned
out again in the last half of the week, but
several of the larger banks are known
to have decreased their loans, one insti-
tution reducing that item nearly $4,000,000

In the two weeks previous the sharp
Nquidation in the securities markets failed
of reflection in the statements of averages,
for the reason mentioned by Tar Sus,
that the money was in urgent request for
the payment of maturing loans upon sterling
exchange, made some time ago. It ts
asserted in exchange circles that the bor-
rowings on this account in the current
week have been considerably smaller,
and tt is also suggested that the local banks
may have gained cash this week from
nearby sources not covered in the pre-
liminary compilations of the known move-
ments of money. The feature of the mone
tary situation, other than the develop
ments noted above, is the fact that this
week, instead of a loss by direct express
shipments of approximately $4,000,000 sus-
tained last week, the banks received fully
as much as they forwarded, leaving a net
gain from Sub-Treasury operations of
$1,807,000 to their credit

This material falling off in the outgo of
currency to the intenor may not be regarded
as justifying an extravagant speculative
movement on the Stock Exchange, as the
South is expected later to require consider-
able sums, incidental to the belated move-
ment of the cotton crop. A slightly easier
tendency in the sterling exchange market
at the close was attributed to the foreign
buying of our securities to-day, as the
offerings of bills against cotton and other
commodities for export are still light. The
further weakness in sterling in Paris indi-
cates the continued withdrawal! of balances
from London,

With comparatively few exoeptions ac-
tivity in to-day'’s market was confined
to the railway list and in this department
the speculation was dominated by move-
mente in St Paul common and Union Pacific
common. The siocks mentioned, singu- |
lariv, recorded almost an exactly similar |
volume of dealings, in each case over 120,000
shares, but St. Paul displaved considerably
more strength and, at a recession of nearly |

 

a point from the highest figure, closed 7,
per cent. higher than yesterday Union

Pacific, at the best figure of the day, left off
2°. per cent. above Thursday's fina! sale
Nothing developed in the way of confirma-
tion of a variety of rumors that were made
to do service in attempted explanation |
of the movements noted, but they «timu-
lated improvement throughout the
Southern Pacifle came next in point of
activity, though at a measurable distance,
and closed nearly 2 points higher Other
stocks in which the dealings attained note-

lint

worthy proportions were Erie common,
Atchison commen and = preferred, Mis
souri Pacific, Brookivn Rapid Transit
Pennayivania and Southern Railway) The
stocks mentioned in most cases showed
net gains, extending in Atchison common

to 1% per cent On lighter trading im-
provements ranging "Wy fo & Pp unt were
made in Louisville and Nashville, Man
hattan Railway, Mexican National, New
York Central, Reading issues, Missouri,
Kansas and Texas common, Minneapolis
and St) Louis, Baltimore and Ohio and
Canada Southern Rock Island retained
about half of an extreme rise of 4 points
In the usually less active shares, Denver
and Rio Grande common rose 1%, Evans-

ville and Terre Haute 3, and Colorado and
Southern firsts and second preferred 14
and 1% per cent respectively
In the industrial list leadership in volume
of business was enjoved by Amalgamated
Copper, and the stock, after considerable
irregularity within a moderate range, left
off nearly a point abowe yesterday's final
price, not withstar ling a drive made upon
it in the afternoon, presumably for effect
upon the general list Sugar Refining, on
| comparatively light trading, rose
