designated by the Navy Department as
No. 7, but better known as the * Dear Schley”
letter, had bean sent by Admiral Sampson
to Commodore Schley by the torpedo boat
Dupont on May 20, 1898, was produced
at the Schley Court of Inquiry to-day
It has already been proved that all the
despatches carried by the Dupont on that
trip were delivered to Commodore Schley
at Genfuegos on the morning of May 22
This documentary proof that the * Dear
fiohley” letter went by the Dupont is one
of the most important points made by
Judge Advocate Lemly in his conduct
of the inquiry. Just how vital it is to the
officer under investigation has been ex-
plained several times in these despatches,
but @ repetition in the present instance
wil) serve to give a clearer understanding
of the marked bearing it has in the case

Admiral Schiey's reputation for veracity
and the validity of his reasons for not
promptly obeying orders to proceed from
Cienfuegos to Santiago and there blockade
the Spanish fleet are involved in the question
of the time the “Near Schley” letter was
received by him This communication
was written by Admiral Sampson at Key
Weat on May 20, 1898, and sent to Admiral
(then Commodore) Schley at Cienfuegos.
It told Commodore Schley that Sampson
believed the Spanish fleet was at Cienfuegos,
where Schiey’s Flying Squadron was sta-
tioned, and that he had decided to keep
Schley there, despite a despatch from the
Navy Department, which was enclosed,
“strongly advising” that Sohley be sent to
Santiago, where they believed Cervera to be

In his defenve to the Senate Schley said
that this letter was delivered to him by the
Hawk on the morning of May 23, and that
with it were the orders of Jater date than the
letter, telling him that the “Spanish squad-
ron was probably at Santiago,” and if he
were satisfied that it was not at Cienfuegos
to proceed to Santiago “with all despateh,
but cautiously" Appended to the later
despatch was a memorandum from Samp-
eon, which practically told Schley to go to
Santiago just as soon as he received it, and
to be there on May 24. The importance of
the time receipt of the “Dear Schley” jetter
by Schley lies in his statement to the Senate
that as it came on the morning of the 2%d
with the orders and the memorandum men-
thoned it “confused the situation and threw
grave doubts over the location of the Span-
fh fleet.” Evidence, therefore, that Schley
received the “Dear Schley" letter on May
22 would not only show that his statement
to the Senate was not true, but would indi-
cate that it could not have confused Schley
in hia interpretation of orders to go to
Santiago, which were not received until
the following day

The evidence that the “Dear Schley"
letter was sent by the Dupont was found
in the official journal kept on board the
flagship New York by order of the Navy
Department. Lieut. Marsh, Admiral Samp-
eon's flag secretary in the Spanish war,
was placed on the stand, and on being
furnished with the records sent to the
Navy Department from the New York
traced the “Dear Schley” letter through
the several volumes and finally found
an entry showing that it had been sent
to Schley by the Dupont on May 20 There
fe no doubt, as it has been proved by docu-
mentary and verbal evidence, that the
Dupont reached Cienfuegos on the morn
ing of May 22, and that at about 8 o'clock
her commander, Lieut. Wood, delivered
all the despatches from Sampson to Com-
modore Schley

During Lieut. Marsh's testimony it was
shown also that a memorandum prepared
by Capt. MeCalla, giving information in-
dicating how news might be obtained from
the insurgents about matters in Clenfuegos,
had gone to Schley by the Dupont on that
same trip) No effort was made by Sehley,
however, to communicate with the tneur-
gonts to ascertain whether the Spanish
fleet was in Cienfuegos He did net find out
that they were not there until Capt MeCalla
arrived two davs after the Dupont and
communicated with the insurgents

Much other interesting testimony was
given before the Court of Inquiry to-day
Two officers of the Massachusetts, Lieuts«
Althouse and Dewey, testified that in the
attack on the Colon on May 31, 1898, their
ship, from which Commodore Sebley di-
rected the operations, fired at ranges of
from 8.40 to 10,000 yards, and these fell
short. Ten thousand vards is nearly five
natitical miles and more than five and a
half statute miles. In one official report
Commodore Schley gavethe range as 7,000
yards, but did not mention any distance
in another repor!
In these reports he called the affair a
recounaimance” Roth officers testified
that they were told to fire at the Colon
and one of them sald Commodore Schiev
directed him to try to destroy ber, Teeti
mony damaging to Commodore Behiey
with reference to his bloekade of Cien-
fuegos and Santiago was given by these
offieere and Lieut Roughter of the Mer-
blehead

Rear Admiral Taylor, who commanded
the Indiana, was again on the stand to-day,
and with reference to the intimation of
Admiral Schier's counsel that Sampacn
had warned his captains, on the evening of
duly 2, to be on their guard against an at-
tempt of Cervera to cacape, he ead that

he hed received no such warning and
that on the morning Cervera made hia

ADMIRAL TAYLOR QUESTIONED

Rear Admiral Henry C. Taylor, the Indi-
ana's co in the war with Spain,
waa recalled to correct his testimony, and
while he was on the stand he was questioned
on an important and Interesti

Admiral (then Captain) Taylor on the
morning of duly 8. Admiral Sampson,
‘apt
accompany him to Siboney,
Taylor asked to be excused on
account of some business on board the
Indiana to which he had to attend. The
idea of introducing these signals was to
show that Sampson had made an attempt
on the very morning of the battle to with-
draw the Indiana and etill further weaken
the American fleet, and that Taylor declined
to go because he believed that the Spanish
fleet was getting ready to come out. It had
been intimated also by Admiral Schley's
counsel in questions asked witnesses that
on the evening of July 2 Schley sent word
to Sampson by the Vixen that much smoke
arising from Santiago harbor made him
believe that Cervera was getting ready to
escape and that Sampson had sent this
information by the Vixen to all his Captains,
with a warning to be on their rd. It
would, of course, be a serious reflection on
Admiral Sampeon if it could be shown that
he went to Siboney in the knowledge that
the Spanish fleet was preparing to leave
Santiago harbor The commander of the
Vixen, Lieutenant-Commander Sharp, has
testified that he did not have any recol-
lection of being sent by Schley to Sampson
and by Sampson to the several American

“I desire to the Admiral one question

Advocate, after Admiral Taylor had cer-
tifled to the report of his evidence. “Did
you have from any source information

“None whatever,” answered Admiral
Taylor

INACCURACY OF THE STADIAMETER

While waiting for the next witness, Capt
Leniy put in evidence a report from Capt
(now Rear Admiral) Merrill Miller of the
cruiser Raleigh in regard to the accuracy
of the stadiameter for measuring distances
Lieut. Bristol of the Texas had asserted
on the witness stand that the Brooklyn
was a great deal further from the mouth
of Santiago harbor in the battle of July
3 than hat been claimed by her navigator,
and that she was about 4.000 yards, and not
1,400 yards only from the Spanish ships
as Navigator Hodgson claimed, when
she made the “loop Lieut. Bristol con-
tended in giving hia testamony that the
stadiameter was inacourate in determin-
ing long distances and he had not depended
on it entirely in ascertaining the relative
positions of the American and Spanish
ships in the battle To corroborate his
testimony about the inaccuracies of the
instrument, Capt. Lemly to-day presented
Capt. Miller's report, which showed that
the stadiameter was accurate up to 800
vards, but that at 1,600 yards an error of
200 vards was found to exist

THE BLOCKADE OF CIENPURGOS

Tdeut. Adelbert Althouse, U. 8. N., sta-
tioned on the Constelbation at Newport,
was sworn and examined by the Judge
Advocate

Q Describe what the Flying Squadron
did off Crontucgs in the nature of blockad-
ing that port y day and by night A
During the 22d of May the ships remained
«ix or seven miles out until about 4 o'elock,
when they steamed in, passing east, opposite
the entrance, a distance of between 2,000
and 3,000 vards, at very slow speed. Then
they headed out again abuut 5 o'clock
and stearmed to the south for aw hile, and then
to the southward and westward They
stopped about @30 o'clock, and during
that night they held parition in column
living almost dead in the water

a. J what distance from the mouth
of the harbor? A. Between eight and
nine miles, possibly ten. Next morning,
the 2a, the ships steamed in four or five
miles, and during that day they lay around
at about that distance That evening

seven mile off the entrance. That evening
at & o'clock we left the har®or and pro-
ceeded toward Santiago
Q. What effort, if any, was made within

ference toward this testimony, Capt. Parker
said to Lieut. Althouse

time as reliable?”

“Yeu, sir,” answered the witness

Was the yeoman an enlisted man?

SCHLEY'S REPORT “ON RECONNOTSSANCE ”

Capt. Lemly took occasion in the interim
between the ane of Lieut. Althouse
and the next witness to introduce in evi-
dence the telegraphic report and the
mailed report o Commodore Schley
in regard to the reconnoissance 44
he called it, of 31, when
the Massachusetts, the lowa and New
Orleans fired at the Cristobal Colon. The
reconnoiasance, he said, was made at 7,000
yards for the pur of destroying the
Colon The first deapatch also said that
the guna at the east and west of the entrance
were of lar calibre and of long range
The second despatch was to the same effect,
but in greater detail, This despatch also
stated that “the fortifications were provided

with long range guns of large calibre.”
LigUT DEWKY DESCRIBES scuLer'’s
BLOCKADE

Lieut. P.G. Dewey, a nephew of Admiral
Dewey, now serving on the Alabama
was called and deseribed the character of
Sobley’s blockade off Santiago while he
was attached tu the Massachusetts. The
distance of the American ships from the
harbor entrance, he said, was from five
to eight miles In steaming past the har-
bor entrance at night, the ships went three
or four miles on each aide of it. The day
blockade was maintained at about the
same distance as the night blockade. He

did not recall that the squadron main-
tained any particular formation in the
daytime e knew of no orders for the

squadron to follow in the event that the
enemy came out. The Spanish ships could
have gotten out at night

By Capt. Lemly Did you have any con-
versation with the commanding officer
of the Flying Squadron or with any one
in his presence on the Siat of May in re-
gard to firing on the Colon? What were
your instructions from him or from any
one in his presence? A. Shortly before
we started in to the entrance I waa told
that the Commodore wished to @ee the
turret officers in the pilot house I went
to the pilot house and the Commodore
sail that he intended to go in in a few mo-
ments and have a try at the Colon, and
that we must fire at the Colon and be hoped
we would sink her IT asked what speed
we were to make and was told about 10
knots. I remarked that | thought that
that was giving us very little chance at
the Coton, as she would be in sight between
the headlands only a couple of minutes,
and as the smoke from the gums would
probably make our fire very slow. To
the best of my recollection the Commo
dore sail we would have to do the best
we could, and that the speed would be
10 knots
RANGES PMPLOYED IN FIRING ON THE COLON

Q What ranges did you employ in firing
the 13-inch guns from the after turret’
4 I had only one shot going and one shot
coming. 1 fired the second shot on the
run to the eastward, when I first had the
Colon in sight. 1 was told that that shot
feil short raised my sight to 8,500 yards
I did not see the fall of that shot, either,
owing to the smoke, but I was told that
it also fell short. On the return trip my
sight was 9.500 yards

Y. Did any of the enemy's shote come
near you? A. None of the shots from
the Colon came anywhere near us and only
a few other shots, two or three shota, fell
about the Massachusetts. and one, I be-
lieve, went glightly over

Q. What did you think about the calibre
of the enemy's guns? A. I do not think
they were guns of large calibre—-about
6 inches

Ry the Court— Were you ordered to di-
rect your fire on the Colon or on the bat
teries on May 31’ A Un the Colon en-

Q By whom were you so ordered? A I
cannot recollect whether the order was
given by the commanding officer of the
ehip or the Commodore, probably by |
the commanding officer At the conver

sation in the pilot house nothing was said
The idea was to go
in and sink the Colon

Admiral Schley's counsel said they had
no questions to ask Lieut. Dewey

LIRUT. BOUGHTER'S TESTIMONY

Lieut. Francia Boughter told the Court
what he saw from the Marblehead in the
Spanish-American War. In maintaining
the Santiago blockade by Schley, the Mar-
blehead, which was one of the inner pickets
was about three miles from esbhore and
about six miles to the west of the Morro
Lieut. Boughter was asked some questions
by the Court, as follows

Q Was the Marblehead in euch a position
off Santiago that the enem v's vessels could
be seen if they had attempted to leave the
harbor? A That would depend upon cir-
cumstances, upon the state of the weather,
upon how close to the shore line they kept,
and upon their being able to conceal their
If they kept close to the shore, we
were three miles off and could not see them
provided they concealed their fires

Mr Rayner cross-examined the witness
to get at his understanding as to the chance
for the Spanish ships to escape from Sant-
jago harbor and Lieut vughter ex-
plained that those on the Marblehead could
not have seen them if they had come out
at night in the manner which he had svated
to the Court

After the recess Lieut. Boughter was
asked another question by the Court

& What orders, if any, were given vou
while officer of the deck, as to the distance

from shore which the Marblehead was
to keep while on ploket duty off Santiago?
A. There were no general orders The |
commanding officer was on deck a great
per of the time himeelf and he would say
uently: “Keep the ehip about here,”

or “Run her ten minutes on this course
and ten minutes on that course back and
forward” As to general orders, | know
of none being given

IMPORTANT TESTIMONY BY LIBUT. MARSH.

Sasending’y t testimony was
given b t Eharies C. Marsh (now

of the fagahip Kearsarge), who was
Secretary to Admiral Sampson in the
war. By him the J Advocate
nowed that, according to an entry in the
official journal kept by Admiral Sampson,
the Dupont wardaad the “Dear Schley
letter from Sampeon and delivered it to
Schley at Cienfuegos. The Dupont ar-
rived at Cienfuegos on May 22. Admiral
Schley told the Senate that he did not get
the “Dear Schiey® letter until May 23, and
it confused his understanding of the orders
from Sampson, received on the 23d, to go to
Santiago
The Judge Advocate-It appears in
evidence before the court that the tor-
— boat Dupont left Key Wert on May
) with despatches to the commander of
the flying squadron at Santiago @Were
in the performance of your duty at
ey West at that time? A. Yes
Can you from memory state what
despatches were so sent by the Dupont
to be delivered to Commodore Sehley? A
To the best of my knowledge and belief
the documents sent by the Dupont to Com-
modore Schley consisted of a letter from
Admiral Sampson and a memorandum
which had been received from Commander
MeCalla
Q. Describe thease two documents? A
My reason for remembering this incident
is that we received a telegram from the
Navy Department roquestir Adimiral
Rampeon to ask Capt McCaila or certain
information concerning the neighborhood
of Cienfuegon the possibility of landing
troops there, &c. The arrivalofthat tele-
grain was nearly coincident with the ar-
rival of Capt MeCalla, and he brought a
reply to it in the form of a memorandum
This was written in cipher and was sent to
the commander of the Flying Squadron

WHEN SOHLEY RECKIVED ORDERS 4T CIRN-
FrURGOS

Lieut. Marsh said he would be able to
teli from the official record of the New York
when these communications had been sent
He asked for the official journal which
Admiral Sampson was required to keep
by the naval ulations, the press copy
book and iden ‘Geshe By reference to
the index he found entries showing that
two letters to Schley had been written by
Sampeon on May 10, Noa 5 and 6, No &
enclosing the MeCalla memorandum, and
one letter on May 20, beginning “Dear
Schley,” and designated as No. 7. With
the “Dear Schlev” letter was inclosed a
cipher despatch from the Navy Depart-
ment to Sampsop “strongly advising”
him to send Sehley to Santiago on acoount
of a report that the Spanish fleet was at

that place Tracing these despatches
through the warious record books, iseut
Marsh finally turned to the officul journal

of Admiral Sampson, and under May 20
found this entry * Following instructions,
No. 7 [The ‘Dear Schley’ letter), were sent
by the Dupont about noon to-day ”

*Does it state positively?” asked Capt
lemiyv

“Yes, sir,” anid Lieut) Marsh

The Judge Advocate then had the witness
trace despatch No &, from Sampeon to
Schiey, telling Schley to proceed to San
tiago “with all despatch Det cautiously,”
if satisfied that Cervera was not at Clen-
fuegos The journal showed that this
went on May 21, by the Hawk and the
Marblehead

CAPT. CHADWICK CALLED.

There was a stir of interest omong tle
spectators when Capt. French E ad-
wick was called, . Chadwick was
Commander of the flagship New York and
Admiral Sampson's Chief of Staff in the
war with Spain. He was admonished by
the Navy Department last r for saying
that he would not take Admiral Schley
by the hand if they should meet. To-day
he sat five or «x feet from Admiral Schley.
but they did not speak, Capt. Chadwick
has been regarded as the most ardent
partisan of Admiral Sampeon, but on the
witness stand he did net show any feeling
against Admiral Sehley

‘o questions by Mr Hanna, the Judge
Advocate's assistant, Capt Chadwick told
of seeing Capt MeCalla of the Marblehead
on beard the New York at Key West on
May 19, and that Capt. MeCaila had told him

of mening arrangements with Cubans
near Orenfuegos by which the American
vessels could communieate with them

Capt. MeCalla told the witness of the secret
code of signals which he had arranged with
the Cubans, but he did not want anything
said about it, as the Marblehead was going
back to Cienfuegos the next dav. The
Marblehead was delayed, however, and did
pot get off until the et. These signals
were bot reduced to writing, said Capt
Chadwick. Capt MeCalla, he said, seemed
to have some idea that if they were the
Spaniards might hold of them and
cause trouble for the Cubans, with whom
the arrangement waa made

“Did you communicate these signals
to Commodore Schley, and if not, why not?”
asked Mr Hanna

“1 did not communicate them to Com-

 
  

 

 

modore Sehley answered Capt. Chad-
wick, “because Capt. McCalla said he was
going to Clenfuegos the next day.”

wee nals were rently not known
to Sehlew until Met a arrived on May
24 Capt) (Now Kear Admiral) Evaus

has testified that they were known to him
at Oonfuegeos, but he did not commun:
cate them to Commodore Sehley, not be
cause he thought Schley had them, but
because he had not thought anything
about it)
SCHLEY ASSURES SAMPSON OF HIS LOYALTY
Other questions brought out from Capt
Chadwick that the Brookivn, with Schley
on board, had left Key Wert when Capt
MeCaila arrived there and told the wit-
news of the signal arrangement, and that
the witness did not remember having told
Capt. Evans about it. Capt Chadwick
wid he remembered a conversation be-
tween Sampeon and Schley on board the
New York on May Is, when Schley's equad-
ron teached Key Weat Sehley, in the
presence of the witness, assured Sampson
that be was very loyal to him and was
pleased’ to be under hia command. The
witness told also of interviews in his pres
enee between Sampson and Schley on
the New York on June 1 and June 4 off
Santiago. On June 4 there was a council
of war between Admiral Sampson, Com-
modore Schley and the commanding of-
fieers of ships, and on that same day there

was @& conversation between Sampson,
Sehley and the witness Asked by Mr
Hauna to tell what passed ou that occa-
sion, Capt Chadwick eaid

“I would not care to atate definitely

as my memory is not suffictently accurate

“Do you remember anything that was
said about the feasividity of a blockade
of Santiago?"

“Yes, | remember that as Commodore

Sehley was leaving the ship be eaid in my
preasnes. and I think to me, ‘You cannot
lookade those ships if they want to come
