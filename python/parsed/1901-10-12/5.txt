The Second Day of Registration.

To-dry is the second day of registra-
tion. The registry places are open
from 7 in the morning until 10 in the
evening.

That is information which should be
heeded by every citizen who reads these
lines who did not yesterday discharge
his duty in getting his name on the regis-
try rolls; and he should thank us for
giving it to him.

Tammany will be beaten, and badly
beaten, this year if all its natural enemics
register and vote.

 

 

A Question of Decency and Honesty.

It is the game of Mr. SHEPARD to
represent the present municipal cam-
paign as a political contest between
Democrats and Republicans

He cannot have a high opinion of the
intelligence of the voters or he would not
assume that they can be deceived by a
pretence which everybody knows to be
false. Mr. Low is not supported as a
Republican nor is Mr. SHEPARD opposed
as a Democrat. The Fusion ticket has
no stronger supporters than those Dem-
ocrats who wish to do away with Tam-
many misgovernment

As Justice Jerome, himself a Demo-
crat, said in a speech on Thursday:

is more than & fant, more
It ta more to me than

"To me Democracy
than an aggrecate of persons
& group of men banded together for purposes of private
gain through public plunder You cannot catch

A campaign of decency against in-
decency, of honesty against thieving
Acampaign of honesty against ‘‘graft,”’
as Mr. Jerome cails it. If that cam-
paign is succeasful, if Tammany is
driven out, the Democratic party in the
State and the Nation will be freed from
a reproach that has long been used
against it-—-the reproach of Tammany

A Piece of Tammany Cynicism.

 

It has long been the cynical boast of
Tammany that it had only to offer office
to leaders of reformers waging war
against it to bring them over to its camp;
and it cannot be denied that the history
of reform movements in New York has
furnished some justification for the
boast

|

 

|

!

| battleships as the proper and effective
i type of vessel.

 

Mr. Suepann is only the latest example |

of sucha capture by Tammany, through
appeal to greed for office. His is the
most shameful example among them
all, however, because he has deserted
to Tammany at a time when it haa be-
come more offensive than ever to the
public sense of decency

When, four vears ago, Mr. SHEPARD
was denouncing Tammany as a disgrace
and a peril to our civilization, it would
have been no less discreditable for him to
make terms with the Croker-Devery or-
ganization during the progress of the cam-
paign than it is now for him, at the initia-
tion of a supreme effort to rid New York
of that diagrace, to go over to Tam-
many's aid and to apologize for it when
its corruption is demonstrated even
more fully

The expression is harsh, but it is true:
SrEParRD has “sold out" to Tammany,
not for cash, of course, but in his greed
for office. His apology for accepting
ite nomination is confused and dis-
jointed, but the influence of that con-
sideration with him could not be con-
cealed under a flood of inconsequen-
tial and laboriously casuistical words.

He has justified the cynicistn of Tam-
many and earned the contempt which,
naturally, it gives to a purchased “ re-
former." Mr. CumMinas bravely glor-
ifying Tammany in his speech to the
candidate is deserving of infinitely more
honor than Mr. SHEPARD apologizing for
it with his clumsy casuistry.

It is such reereancy to principle as
that of Mr. Suerarp which keeps Tam-
many in power in New York, When
CROKER gets in dire straits, as he is
now, he seta to work to seduce a recruit
from the ranks of the loudest reformers
who have been enlisted against Tam-
many, and he finds the man. That is
Tammany's way of heaping derision
on reform movements. It shows how
easily it can get a reformer himself to
be its figurehead whenever prudence
suggests the peril of taking a man from
its own ranks.

That Tammany should have gone to
the pains to recruit Mr. Sugparp for
such service is, of course, convincing
evidence that it is conscious of ita great
danger in this campaign. Taking the
leader of ita ticket from among the
loudest of its enemies of four vears
ago, stealing
of heaven te serve the Devil in,” it
gards as a clever trick which will deceive
even the saints

So transparent a diaguiee, however,

frage disqualifications in 1891, 1806 and

State Constitutional Convention in 1804
and then adopted many important altera-
tions in the organic law of the State—
the separation of municipal from State
and national elections, the altered pro-
cedure of the Legislature in the con-
sideration and adoption of new laws,
the readjustment of Legislative dis-
tricta, so that the city of New York could,
at no time, secure a predominating con-
trol of the Legislature, and extending
the period of probation, before suffrage,
for naturalized voters. These changes
as adopted by the New York convention
were duly ratified by the voters. Penn-
sylvania has adopted amendments to its
Constitution. Missouri, the Constiiu-
tion of which was adopted in 1875,
has long felt the need of a new Consti-
tution, and the demand for it has been
carried on vigorously, North Carolina
adopted a new suffrage clause to its
Constitution in 1900, and Rhode Ivland
has made changes from time to time,
the chief being the abolition of a prop-
erty qualification in 1888, and the re-
quirement of a popular majority for
elective officers in 1993.

State Constitutions are in many essen-
tial particulars being revised every where;
but the Federal Constitution femains
intact, unaltered, and with no serious
suggestion of any radical change

The President and the Army and Navy.

The views of President Rooseveit
on the development of our army and
navy, aa set forth last week in THe SUN,
are in the highest degree important.
Although a President has no direct in-
fluence over thy making of laws, he is able
to exert much indirect and legitimate
power over Congress, and thus to shape
legislation with considerable certainty
President Rooseve.t approaches the
subject of law-making for the army and
nav’ with peculiar equipment for the
task. He has studied the history of the
navy, and written of it authoritatively;
he has, within four years. been Assistant

 

in active service in the army in time
of war.

Briefly stated, the President believes
not so much in a large army and a large
navy as in an efficient army and an
efficient navy Ae concerns the navy,
he is opposed to a merely commerce-
destroving fleet; he looks on sea-going

And as ability to use
the guns provided is of the highest im-
portance, he believes in continued target
practice. Fleet mancuvres, on a scale
not adopted hitherto in this country
are likely to be advoeated by him

Mr. ROosEVELT'S experiences in the
Spanish war have shown him various
weak points in our army system. Some
of these have been abolished by the
legislation prepared by Secretary Root
and approved by President McKinigy
in February last, notably the weak
points of our staff system; but much
remains to be done to strengthen the
organization of the army as a whole
Our report shows that the President
does not believe in the separation of the
Ordnance, Quartermaster'’s and Com-
missary departments from the line of
the army, and that he would have officers
detailed to those bureaus from the line,
so that the men who wee the guns and
the supplies should have some voice in
the matter of providing them.

Mr Roosevei’ believes putting
the army transport service into the
hands of the navy. This ia a matter
to which civilians as a rule have given
little thought; the rule of all other coun-
tries has been and is that army control
ends in the water, where naval control
begins—in other words, that beth trans-
port and torpedo service should be

managed by the navy. The President
ia in line with military experts on these
|

$$$

matters.

The President believes that the equip-
ment of an army is an essential feature
of ita efficiency, and that the chief value
of an army depends on its readiness for
service. To keep it ready, he believes
that officers and men should be trained
in peace under conditions reproducing
ns nearly as possible those of war; that
ita arsenals should be filled with modern
ammunition and smokeless gunpowder;
the coast defences in a high state of
efficiency; the guns of recent make,
and kept in perfect condition; field
transportation in sufficient amount;
clothing on hand suited to the climate,
and plans prepared to meet any emer-
gency that may arise, and officers and
men kept in training

His views on this question of effi-
ciency apply to the navy, mutafia mu-
fandia, in the same manner On theae
points, be intends to make earnest
representations to Congress; and with
Secretary Root and Secretary Lona
as his advisers and assistants, it is likely
that his appeal will have important
results for the two services, and make
them more nearly a “ united service "
than they have been in the past

 

Great Demand for Horses,
Especially for Cavairy.

The

England is finding difficulty in obtain-
ing horses suitable for its mounted in-
fantry in South Africa. Her agenta
are ranaacking the horse-breeding dis
tricta of Purope, but the supply ia not
equal to the demand.

In Furope there were, at last accounts
about 43,000,000 horses and mules, tnore
than twice es many of these animals
as are to be found in our own country
The trouble in Fngland is not due to
any dearth of horses, euch as they are
but to inability to find a sufficient num-
ber of the animals with the breeding
and general characteristics desirable for
military Purposes

The breeding of cavairy horses w
Continemal Porope i a great business
but the supr’) newer seems to enoeed
the demand of the Powers that naintain
large standing arnues The preferred |
heres are thase that are expecially bred
for seddie purpoess and are trained |
from theu firet wear to military enercises
A large pan of Germany's supply comes

draught horses for its needs, England
buys about one-half and Germany a sixth
of all the horses we have to sell.

None of the Powers looks to Russia
as a source of supply for cavalry horses,
though that country raises nearly half
the horses of the Continent. The Gov-
ernment and the owners of the large
landed estates in western and central
Russia have use for all the fine horses
that are bred in those regions; and the
great plains of the south, where most
of Russia's horses are raised, with no
care whatever as to breeding or train-
ing, do not produce the quality of ani-
mals required for army purposes. The
result is that comparatively few Rus-
sian horses are exported Austria-
Hungary raises more horses than any
other part of Europe excepting Russia
and is a large source of supply for the
cavalry of the Continent. Great herds
graze on the flat, treeless, grassy plains
or pusrtas of Hungary, and thence the
Italian Army, not being able to obtain
all the horses it needs in the home mar-
kets, procures much of its supply Eng-
lish agents are now said to be trying to
buy 8,000 Hungarian horses 4 month
at about $150 a head

The English do not appear to be look-
ing in our direction for army horses.
Our cavalry officers would not be slow
to assign a reason for this fact. They
have asserted for years that they rarely
got the type of horses they need; that
the animals usually bought for our
cavalry are bred o! very ordinary strains
and for farm work and can never be per-
fectly trained for army service because
they are bought at from 4 to 6 years
old. The bulk of our exports of horses,
worth about $3,500,000 a year, are sent
abroad solely for d aught purposes.

Our stock raisers as a whole may
learn a useful lesson from the condition
of the horse market in recent years and
the inability of England to get all the
better-grade animals needed for South
Africa. Many of our farmers came to
the conclusion, some time age, that,
with the introduction of electricity, |

edern machinery and automobiles, |
the period of profitable horse-raising
was at an end The fact is, however, |
as the atatistics for the five vears ending
in 1900 show, that the prices for really
good horses in the coach, saddle and
draught classes have been slowly rising,
while the prices for second and third
grade animals in all classes have not |
held their own. The same report comes
from Canada, where it is said to be diffi-
cult to get together a large number of
first-class animals for export because
the country has been drained of its best
material. Farmers in America who are
raising only first-rate horses for wale
are not complaining that the industry
has become unprofitable

The Futility of an Old Scheme.

We see that in the South the familiar
proposition that hereafter all incor-
rigible colored criminals and, more |
especially, those whose offences are |
of the sort to incite the ardor of lyneh- |
ers, should ‘be aent to Liberia,” is re-
vived again, with the usual support)
of a colored minister

Long before the Civil War, from the |
very earliest days of this Republic,
the project of ‘sending negroes back
to Africa,’ either as a means to their
material advancement or as a penalty
for criminal offence, was much favored
by certain Northern and Southern phil-
anthropista and an African coloniza-
tion society for the purpose was formed
Liberia was chosen as the special field
in Africa for the negro colonists, for |
there, as in Havti, the colored popula- |
tion very largely predominates and is in |
undisputed control. The lest Liberian |
census showed 1,075,000 inhabitants of
exclusively African birth; and only 20,000
natives of this country

We have maintained for many years |
diplomatic relations with Liberia, and |
societies for promoting intercourse be- |
tween the colored men of that part of
Africa and those resident in the United
States have been numerous, but, #o far
as Liberian statistics show, without |
any considerable practical result. That |
African republic is called officially the |
United States of Liberia, and ite Consti-
tution is based upon that of this country
It has a President, a Senate and a House |
of Representatives. Business is ell
acted on the basis of American dollars
and centa and American methods prevail,
except that weights and measures are
of the English standard. Liberia, how-
ever, transacta little business with the
United States. Its exports to us, only
99,400 two years ago, fell to $4,800 last

'
!

year, and the American exports reached
only $25,000, insignificant sums,

Liberia, moreover, is heavily in debt;
much of its commerce is in the hands
of white foreigners; it is without in-
fluence in the affairs of other African
countries and colonies. This African
movement, therefore, has presented
nothing to encourage wholesale colored
emigration from this country as a meas-
ure for advancing the interests of the
colored race. Besides, the South needs
all its negro labor and reasonably re-
sents all such attempts to induce the
nerroes to leave it

THE PRESIDENT AND THE BOERS.

Called Upen to Express American Abher-
fence @f the Barbarities of the War.
To Tus Eprton or Tan Sun —Sir; It te
incredible that there is no way possible for
the Amerioan nation to express its abhorrence
of the Bouth African war. It is incredible
that no way can be found within the bounds
of honor and prudence whereby President
Roosevelt might do what Gladstone did when
he denounced the barbarities in Bulg
Gladstone did not stifle bis noblest instincts
in the cobwebs of diplomacy when murder-
ous destruction of human lives was going on
before his eyes And though the timid
shrieked at him and cynics sneered, history
declares Gladstone a nobleman in virtue of
his large-hearted humanity
Why cannot Koosevelt do what Cleveland
did when he brought Englishmen to think
about the Venezuelan dispute? In all his
life heretofore, and especially in his reeent
career when he risked that life to uplift an
oppressed people, Theodore Roosevelt has
given the world assurance of a man, and
his countrymen have responded to his nobility
by their love and esteem Was it not this
very trait of splendid maniiness winning

American admiration, which won him at the
same time the opportunity to be placed in his

| yee high «tation? And now when Destiny
pla him upon the heights of great
ower and authority, must. he shrink from

he atature of a man to that of a wily diplomat?
To whom much is given, of him much will
be required!

for the continued degradation of humanity
in South Africa be construed as inimical to

THE RITUALIST PARTY.
The Impessibitity ef Crushing It tn the Kpts-
copal Church.

To tas Eviron or Tus Sun--Sir: Your
recent editoria| expression, to the effect that
the Kitualists in the Episcopal Church might
be crushed but would never surrender, hit a
very bright and particular neil squarely on
its uplifted hee¢ That is just it But there
is no danger of any crushiag Before each
General Convention a hue and ery is raised
against them, with a view to stimulating a
hot opposition, but it is the same old rebel
yell Each convention meets, and lets ritual-
lam severely alone

Well it may, for sinee the convention of
1871, that pases! canons against ritualiem,
the Episcopal Church has become permeated
with the “evil, and many who eried against
it in the old days are now thoroughly steeped
in the “sin” Nearly everything the Ritual-
ists have contended for has been generally
adopted and pra: (ised throughout the United
States, in both “High Chureh* and “Broad
Church” parishes hence the few anti-Ritual-
fats find it impossible to draw a line without
cutting themselves out altogether Every
Episcopalian is « l\ituelist, of some kind any-
way, and to the normal Protestant he is a
good deal of one The moment one grants
the platform of Apostolic Succession, clerical
vestments of any kind, and the altar, he
concedes the diferentiating principles. and
any fuesing with a brother Churchman about
minor details tommyrot It is just as
wicked to have a cross above an altar as to
have candies and just as sacrilegious to
wear @ Geneva gowao, or & white surplice,
as a chaguble or cope The worshipper who
denies the Virgin birth of Christ is surely
as reprehensible as another who believes
in the tnveeation of Mary and the saints
One that stubbornly elite in prayer has no
right to take a fing at another who genuflects
or signs bimeelf with the cross The funoy
thing about it is that the anti-Kitualists
fail to see the point

The Episcopal Chureh t« really the Church
of England in doctrine, discipline and worship
albeit presented under a modern name, and
ite Prayer Book and order of services were
set forth on purpose to humor both Catholics

and Puritans How stultifying, then, for
either side to hound the other One would
resume that in these United States in the
wentieth century a Christian might be suf-
fered to worship God in peace, without being
persecuted because of his postures, raiment
or hoje tu devotion Have you not notices
that for fifty yeare the martyrdom has been
endured by the Hitualists Who has ever
heard of a Low Churchmen ora Broad Church-
man undergoing spiteful persecution for his

GEN. STERNBERG’S REPORT.
The Health of the Army Unusually Good
Wasminotox, Oct. 11. -Surgeon-Gen.,
, in hie annnal report to the
of War, makes the following ob-
servations on the health of the army
“The health of the army must be regarded
as having been unusually good during
the calendar year 1900. The adminsion
rate for all causes in the army, volunteers
and regulars, with armean strength of 100,980

in 1900, wae 2,311.51 peryi,000 of etrength, |

as compared with 27,178.00 in the previous

year; but during the year 1800 only 30,280 |

men out of a total of 106,546 were serving
in the Philippines, while during the past
year 06,882 of a total of 100,380 were thus
serving. This is an important point to
remember in considering the sick rates
of the two years

“The death rate in China was large,
47.76 per 1000 of strength, 23.47 from disease,
and 24.14 from injury
the calendar year 1900 to the latest reports,
the health of the troops in the Philippines
had been steadily iinproving = Smatipox,
so prevalent and deadly in the early cocupa-
tion of the islands, has been almost
entirely suppressed. Dysentery, consti-
tuting 13.44 per cent, of all cases of sickness,
is the dangerous disease The health of
the troops serving in Cuba was excellent
during the year The medical record
of the troops in Porto Rico for the year
1900 ie an excellent one, comparing favor-
ably with that of troops serving at the home

stations
Referring to alcoholism in the army, Gen

Sternberg says: “The steady decrease of |

late years in the admiasions for alooholiam

among the men of the Regular army i* a |

matter for congratulation Military of-
floers may be said to be unanimous in their
opinion that this was mainly the reeult

of the establishment of a post exchange,

or canteen, at military posts There is
jess drunkenness among troops in active
eervice than in a command doin arrison

duty in time of peace. Inthe Philippines
during the past vear the admission rate for
aleoholiam among the volunteers was 5.65,
and for regulars 12.41; for troopa in China,
770 ‘These statistics do not sustain the
hewspaper reports of drunkenness among
the troops in the Philippines In fact, med-
cal officers report the habits of the enlisted
men in the Philippines as very much the
same as in the United States ~
