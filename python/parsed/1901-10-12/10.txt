“4MERICAN BOARD ADJOURNS.

 

Harrronp, Conn. Oct. 11.—-The meeting
of the American Board came to a close
with the session this morning, and Presi-
dent Capen, in his response to the farewell
word from the Rev H H_ Kelsey of this
city, said it was the most successful meet-
ing the board bad ever had = He referred
not only to the large attendance upan and
interest in the meetings, but the epirit of
giving which took possession of the people
when the appeal was made to help the
board out of ite financial difficulties The
gifie which poured in so generously last
night were supplemented by further dona-
tions this morning, and the total of the
»ledges and contributions reached about
107 000

Among the contributors this morning
were Mr Bulkeley, wife of former Gov-
ernor Morgan Ui. Bulkeley, for $1,000) and
Mre © P Turner of Philadelphia, formerly
of Hartford, for a like amount The Hon
J._M_ Allen centrituted §00

President Capen said *The ninety-
eecond annual meeting, which is now
chosing, will be romonsioeed. I believe, as
the greatest we have ever held We met
under an awful shadow, caused by our
intense fear for the safety of our beloved
Miss Fllen M Stone, still in the hands of
the brigands. This has given tenderness
and sympathy thraughout all our sessions
Last night we saw perhaps aa never be-
fore, God's power, when He came and, by
a series of peculiar providences, having
to do with many minds, of men widely
scattered, led to the payment of our debt
Tt was a wonderful scene, which can never
be effaced in the memory of thase who
were permitted to be present. We have
entered the new oentury with the debt
clared away and ready, under Gedi's
leadership, for larger things in missions
The million dollars a year to carry on our
wor) is not, we will believe, now, very far
away

One of the $1,000 contributions this
morning was from Judge Orrin H. In-
graham, of Fau Claire, Wis, who also
offered tou be one of ten to give the halance
of the money for the ransom of Miss Stone
A resolution carrying salutations to Judge
Nathaniel Shipman, of the United States
Court, was passed. Judge Shipman eus
tained a paralytic stroke about a week
ago and he is still confined to his bed

Addresses were made by a number of
new missionaries who are about to etart
for their fields The new missionaries
are Foochow mission, the Rev. and Mrs
Louis Hondous, the Rev. and Mr FE. H
Smith, Mine Harriet Osborne, Miss Evelyn
Worthiey; Madura mission, the Rev and
Mra J. J Banninga, European Turkey,
the Rev LS Ostrander, Japan, the Rev.
H. J. Bennett

The following were elected members
of the predentin Committees Dr Wo W
Jordan, Clinton, Mass, Dr Elijah Horr,
Boston; Charles A. Hopkins, orcester,
