tig Curtis Loses to Miss Herron —Mre.
Manice Draws a Close Finish With Miss
Hecker After Having Been Five Down

A Grand Contest in Mixed Foarsemes.

A surprise in one match and nearly as
great a surprise in the other marked the
two semi-final matches in the annual wo-
men's championship of the United States
Golf Association yesterday at the Baltuaro!
Golf Cub. One surprise was the victory
of Mies Lacy Herron from Mise Margaret
Curtis. in this match the win being re-
corded by 3 up and 2 to play, after a atren-
yous contest in which all but five holes
had been halved. The other surprise was
that after Miss Hecker had been 5 up on
Mre Manice at the ninth hole she only
won by 2 up and Ito play. Quite as great
a surprise, in the opinion of the Lenox
ort. was that Miss Hecker should have won
at all, but the “gallery,” which was mostly
made up of MG. A. players, was loyal to
Miss Hecker The applause, however,
was very fairly divided. At the etart the
handelape were for Mise Hecker on account
of her fine drives and second shots, but later
on the salvos were for Mrs. Manice in honor
of the spirited way in which she made
the hormeward journey

If Mra. Manice had not putted too fast
on the seventeenth green she would prol)-
ably have gained a half, but this, it seers,
was not her fault. With the mateh finished
Mrs Manioe, after the handshake with the
winner, only eaid to the others that she
had been doing her best and that “angels
evu'd do no more”

“It was all my fault,” said her husband,
who had caddied for ber. “I misjudged
the seventeenth green, took it for twice
as fast as it was and told,my wife to put
up sharply. As soon as she touched the
ball | saw my mistake

To-day's final like the two semi-finals
yeaterday, will be between players who
will contrast the use of the lively ball with
the old solid gutta perchas Miss Hecker
and Miss Curtis used the old e«tyle and
Mrs. Manice and Miss Herron the lively
ball. Honors were even yesterday. Mrs
Manice had rather the better of the long
game after the first four holes, but she
could not equal Miss Hecker in eppranch-
ing and putting, while Miss Curtis had the
better of the long =. but was wild in
approach! an bh puttin In brief
as far as the use of the balls went onls
the old knowledge was repeated-which
is that t improve the long game of
those who have not a full swing, leaving
oo to luck

e accessory delights of the day in
cluded music on the club veranda, many
driving parties rolling up for luncheons
and dinners, and an afternoon tea attended
by the country house folks for miles around,
with quite a number of guests from the city
It was the opinion heard on every side
that the tournament had been the best
managed of any of the women's champion-
ships. Louis A. Keller, the Secretary
has worked hard, and W. Fellowes Morgan
L. P. Bayard, Jr, and the of her committee
men have also helped him out. The US. G
4. has intrusted its affairs to R. Bage Kerr,
the Secretary, who has not been found
wanting

On the start of the Mies Hecker and
Mrs. Manice match the feature of the first
four holes wae that Miss Hecker had the
better of the long game, although she was
nut using a lively ball Of the five holes
remaining to the turn the fifth was won by
Mise Hecker in a perfect 4 to Mra. Manice’s
& Plaving the sixth Mre Manice was
nearly dead to the cup on her third, Miss
Hecker tryin “gobble” the hole on her

fourth played from the edge of the green
The attempt overran and Miss Hecker
lifted, losing the hole in 4 to 6 Playing

the seventh Mre Manice began with some
bad plays on her long qm, which Miss
Hecker played perfectly Miss Hecker
mixed u r short
played it perfectly barring the miss of the
last put whieh cost her a poorly played
hele in 7 for Mise Hecker and & for Mra
Manice. Miss Hecker scored a 4 on each

of the vext two greens, flawless play, and
as Mra. Manice was a stroke to the bad
on each green the M G A champion was
Sup at the turn. She had gone out in 45
to tien Manice's 49 a

Mrs. Manice won the tenth in 3, the elev-
enth in a very good 4 and she should have
made the twelfth in 4, for Miss Hecker
was in the bunker on her second, but that
her short put failed through the too lively
hall rebounding from the cup after every-

hody had thought it had dropped in. She
was now but 3 down with 6 to play, po!
by any means a hopeless situation But

the next hole was played by Mise Hecker
as cleverly as a Vardon might have done
it. Over the brook and on the edge of
the green in a drive and a brassey, Mins
Hecker laid her approach put dead for @

4 and Mrs. Manice, who had taken 4 to
the green, gave up the hole. A clever
, to 6 won the fourteenth hole for Mre

Manice, Mias Hecker taking 4 to the green,
and Mrs. Manice also led her to the green
wn the fifteenth and won in 6 to 8, the bigh
figures on her opponent's card being due
'o some poor putting. The next hole Mrs
Manice made absolutely no mistakes on
ind won in6to7. She was now but t down
vith 2 to go and her chances soermel very

bright. But the story of the seventeenth
hole has been told by Mr Manice it
coat her the match by 2and 1. The cards

Mise Herron and Mise Curtia were all

TO-DAY'’S WIRE WILL BE
SENSATIONAL IN ITS CONTENTS.

The Maxim & Gay Company is nearing the close of an Eastern season, in
which its success has figured as the year's turf sensation. [ts policy has
been liberal, but during the remainder of this month it purposes to spend money
unstintedly, even lavishly, to obtain such information as will enable it to turnish
its clients winners at good odds daily, and compel recognition of the Maxim &
Gay Co. by every horseman from Maine to California, To-day’s wire will
be a sample of what a renewal of energy and large expense of cash can secure
in the way of winning information. Next week's will cap the climax
