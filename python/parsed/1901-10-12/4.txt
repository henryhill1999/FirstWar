DIVORCE CANON DISCUSSED.
EPISCOPAL DEPUTIES ARGUE FOR
AND AGAINST REMARRIAGE,

 

 

Amendment Preposed to Allow Innecent
Partics In Diverees Granted for Adul-

San Francisco, Oct.

11.—All day the

t remarriage of divoreed persons, and
when the seesion ended action had been
postponed until next M wnday when the

ers at the morning session defined clearly
t of argument as between the abeo-
! prohibition of all such marriages, aa
re mended by the House of Bishops,

he more liberal position of the Episco-
Chureh at the present time, allowing

i]
the innocent party in a divorce action to
have a second marriage solemnized by a
0 ster of the Chureh

Ss oporters of this latter, headed by Dr
Huntington of New York, maintain that
{' contrary to the teachings of Christ
t wo such a sweeping regulation
ax that proposed. The other side aay that

of t family relations, which ix in the
greatest danger in the United Staes at

The theological and moral side of the

soon drifting away from these more or

less technical and rigid rules to the broader
of adopting one

. Dr. J
1 the afternoon session by a
speech In favor of the canon. He main-
tained that it was an attempt to raise
standard of marriage every where.

George H. Williams of Oregon, eox-At-
torney-General of the United States, said
*I have known a woman to be ill treated
or abandoned by a drunken, worthless
husband. Why, if a good man wants to
marry her, to give her children a good
father and her a good husband, should

the Church forbid her the right and for-
bid ite ministers to marry her? Aa for
ublic opinion, you propose to puntel

raise the standard of
No matter how good a
woman may be, how pure, if ahe has been
divorced, you stigmatize her as though
0 an unpardonable sin

ita, you admit
f a poor woman,
who has been compelled to separate her-
self from a worthless man, applies to you,
you would close your doors to her and eay
her ‘You have committed an = un-
pardenaiel sin; there ix no place for you
ere; you can go to the devil’ ”

Dr Huntington of New York anid he
desired to withdraw the amendinente to
his amendment and speak only to le orig-
foal motion. He ait

“In our zeal for sanctity let us not forget
sanity. There are innocent parties in every
criminal cause which involves the rights of
more than one I do net vield to any one
home,
but I don't want to overlook justice *

The Kev. Ro J. Nevin of fhe American
Church in Rome opposed the proposed
canon, basing bis objection upon his obser.
vation of the reault« of the laws in Italy
There. he aaid, it had come about that in |
the desire to avoid divorce the enormous
ain of adultery had come to be considered
of little account ao long as undiseo vered

The Rev. Dr. Reeve Alsop of Long Taland
anid “Many of us wonder whetber we dare
attempt to be more strict than our Lord
Ax for expediency, vou have met men who
said they were brought up «> rigidly in
observance of a Puritan Sunday that the
idea became distasteful. Take the extreme

DISS DE BAR'S TRIAL.

@ue of Her Dupes Testine; Against the
“Bpeck Priestess” and Her Pal.
Speetal Cable Despateh to THe SUN.

Lowpon, Oct. 11.—The hearing in the
case of Theodore and Laura Jackson was
resumed in the police court to-day. The
last named is the woman well known in
America as Ann O'Delia Diss De Bar, the
“apook priestess.” There are a number
of charges against the pair, one for ob-
taining money under false pretences from
various young women, and others against
the man for assaulting several young wo-
men while pretending to initiate them into
Jackson's cult, which was known as the
“Theoeratio Unity.”

When the case was called to-day “Laura
Jackson” requested that ahe be permitted
to defend herself and her husband. The
Court said she would be allowed to act as
her own counsel, but not as her husband's

Miss Vera Cregsdale, one of the young
women who were duped by the Jacksons
and who testified against them yesterday,
went on the stand again to-day. She told
of the initiation ceremonies of the peculiar
order of the Jacksons A red cross, a
lamp anda bow! of water were used She
was also made to taste brea, wine and ealt
Then, later on, she had to submit todackson's
advances, “Mra. Jackson” promising ber
that no harm would come from so doing
Mies Cregadale testified that she objected
to this, but she was always compelled to
submit after she was put under the sup-
posed hypnotic influence

Jackson crom-examinel the witness
She maintained that ail her setate-
ments in regard to the assaulta were

true. Jackson then declared that he was
incapable of performing the acte charged
and demanded an examination

Mra. Jackson (Diss De Bar) also ques-
tioned the witness Mis Cregedale in
sisted that the woman was present when
the acta charged were committed Mra
Jackson became violent during the ex
amination and was called to order by the
Magistrate. The real names of the pris-

Toronto, Ontario, Oct 11 —To-day's

Duke of Roxburgh and a mounted «taf,

made his appearance on the parade ground

The Duchess of York and ladies of

the royal party had previously reached

the grounds and taken their places on @
dais near the saluting point

Aathe Duke, uniformed in (he regimentals
of a Colonel of the Dublin Fusiliers, gal-

MAST UNSTEPPED.
Mr. Jameson Refers in a Speech to the
Accusations Made Against Him.

The tall pole mast of the Shamrock has
been unstepped and has been stored away
in one of the houses in the Eric Basin docks
All the other spare have been put away
and the sails have been carefully folded
up and wrapped in burlap. The bull of
the yacht is now ready to be taken out of the
water and this will be done in a few days
and then a house will be built over the
hull to protect it from the storms of the

winter

Yachtamen generally were not surprised
to learn that Sir Thormas Lipton contem-
plated having another try to “lift” the
America’s Cup and his remarks to the
members of his crew at the banquet on
Thursday evening gave a very good idea
of what his plans are It ie generally
thought that Sir Thomas will begin to
make his arrangements at once and that
if there is not a challenge for a race next
year then he will challenge again for a
race to be sailed in 10083. When he an-
nounced this to bis men they stood up and
cheered heartily and there was not a man
in the room who did not think that Sir
Thomas would keep on trying until he
finally won

The dinver was a novel one It was the
firat time that the owner of a big racing
yacht had shown his appreciation of the
work hia men did tn sucha way = he men

 

liked the compliment, too, and if they
should come back on another of Sir
Thomas's yachts they will work harder

for him than ever

it was after 1 o'clock when Auld Lang
Svne was sung and the men returned to
their ships Sir Thomas (oasted every
one He paid Capt Sycamore a high com-
pliment, then told what Mr Watson had
done, complimented Mr HKateey on hie
eails and then called for a toast to Mr
Jameson, who, Sir Thotnas said had done

everything in his power to make the Sham
rock a wioner. Mr Jatneson in rernying
took oceasion to say that the yacht hac
lost because of the baffling winds of the
last dav. He spoke of the accusatiols
made against hira ly a writer for a morning
paper and said that he thought that those
who sailed the Colurnbia were having just
as hard atime in the fluky winds as they
were on the Sharrock and that it “as
the wind that beat the English yacht that
day

Capt Barr and the crew of the Columlda
were toasted and Sir Thotnas spoke highly

of the wav they had handled their yacht
and after the toast bad been drunk, three
hearty cheers were given for the men of
the winning vaecht Between toaste there

The Secret
of Strength

The secret of is perfect digestion. This
applies to mental stren as well as physical strength
and is ectly logical if you think about it for a moment.

Johann Hoff's Malt Extract always successfully helps
digestion. Indeed, it is the perfect assimilator of food.
Every person who takes Johann Hoff's Malt Extract with
his meals will realize the difference. Not only is che dis-
tress gone from the stomach but there is also the unmis-
takable prompting of strength and energy because the
nutrition in the food is penetrating to every portion of
the body.

Johann Hoff's

Malt Extract

is not a stimulant with a reaction. It is a glorious aid to
natural laws. In fact, it makes natural laws operative and
never disagrees with any one. These statements are facts,
and the unimpeachable record of over half a century
proves it. You won't find weaklings, physically or men-
tally, among those who use Johann Hoff's Malt Extract
with their meals.

EUGENE SANDOW, the strongest man In the
world, writes:

‘*The secret of my strength is perfect digestion. I
use Johann Hoff's Malt Extract and find that it always
aids me in the proper assimilation of food."'

BEWARE OF CHEAP -MITATIONS.

Get the Genuine Johann Hoff's and you will
not be disappointed.
