Charges -Prove to

CONGRESS CALLED ON

Ohio Representative Asks
for Investigation
of Secretary.

 

AGH OFFICIALS NAMED,

yecusations by Their
Silence,

|

inc ton, July 3.—An investigation
the Treasury Department by Congress
will probably result from the resignation
to-day of Dr. A. Piatt Andrew as second
Assistant Secretary of the ‘Treasury, |
accompanied by sensational letters ad- |
dressed by Dr. Andrew to both the Secre-
tary of the Treasury and the President.

It is being predicted here to-night that
sensational allegations made by Dr.
Andrew concerning Mr. MacVeagh's con-
duct of the Department will result in the
withdrawal of the Secretary from the
tabinet if Congress finds the situation |
to be as deplorable as Dr. Andrew paints |

 

qst

Representative Cox of Ohio has in- |
troduced a resolution for the investigation. |

Dr. Andrew names in his letter to the |
President some half dozen high officials
of the Department who, he says, will con- |
firm his statements regarding conditions |
in the Department and the relations ex-
isting Letween the various division and
bureau heads and the Secretary. Dr.

Andrew invites an investigation by the
President

None of the officials named who were in
the city to-day would discuss the letters
ot

Dr. Andrew, but some of them ap-
ared willing for their failure to deny
ew's statements to be interpreted
as confirming them.

The officials referred to ara Lawrence
0 Murray, Comptroller of the Treasury; |
Joseph E. Ralph, director of the Burean |
ot Engraving and Printing; Lee McClung,
lreasurer of the United States; Charles
4 Kram, Auditor for the Post Office De-
partment; Royal E, Cabell, Commissioner
of Internal Revenue; his immediate prede- |
cessor, Charles D. Norton, who was private
secverary to the President after leaving
the Treasury; Charles D. Hilles, formerly
an Assistant Secretary of the Treasury
and now secretary to the President;
James Knox Taylor, who recently resigned
as supervising architect of the Treasury, |
and Charles P, Montgomery, who re-
sizned as chief of the division of customs. |
It is understood that unsatisfactory re- |
lations with the Secretary were responsible
for both these resignations.

While Dr. Andrew's letters indicate
that his resignation was tendered volun- ,
tarily, a statement issued by the White
House said it was not. Dr. Andrew's
etters, which had been written a week |
or more ago, were sent to Secretary Mac-
\Veagn and the President this morning '
after he had been informed by the Secre-
tary late yesterday afternoon that the |
President would accept his resignation. |
Dr Andrew mailed copies of his letters ,
to the newspapers, which was the first
intirnation of his action, j

Following the publication of th#letters,

the White House issued less than three
lines of typewriting as follows:
“Mr. Andrew's resignation as Assist-
ant Secretary of the Treasury was re-
siested, submitted and accepted in view
of his failure to obey orders given him
ty the Secretary.”

further than this the White House
ined to discuss the situation, In the
wosence of Secretary MacVeagh, who left
lst night for Lancaster, Mass., neither
Acting, Secretary Curtis nor any one else

PARKS AGLOW WITH LIGHTS.

Fourth of July Dress Rehearsal
Drew Crowds Last Night,

 

As a sort of dress rehearsal to the
eafe and sane Fourth of July festivities
‘the parks and driveways which have
been decorated throughout the city
were a blaze of brilliant color last eve-
ning. City Hall Park in particular looked
like a slice of Coney Island picked up
bodily and set down among the high
ofice buildings. It delighted the regu-
lar sitters who keep daily and nightly
oftico hours on the park benches and
also crowds of passersby who stopped
in their mad rush subwayward long
enough to admire the unusual  soene,
The City Hall building was outlined
| with long strings of incandescents, while
| thousands of red, green and yellow

the branches of the trees.

iIMAY CONFER WITH BRYAN
\Candidate Shows Disposition to

Do a Good Deal of His
Own Thinking.

 

| Sra Gint, N, J., July 3.—Decision as t»
{whether Woodrow Wilson will resign as
Governor of New Jersey immediately or
will wait until fall or until after January t
}next will not be made until after nexs

| Monday.

| ‘That will give the Governor s chanse
{to consult first with his persone! friends,
| with the Democratic National Committee
|to-morrow, and finally with the entire
‘New Jersey State delegation to Balti-
| more, which is to visit him in’ a body next
| Monday.
| The Governor's only answer to quecios
ion the subject is:
| “I have not had time to conmualt with
| my friends and advisers.”
| Yet the ultimate decision will be up tu
him, as all other decisions affecting his
‘course in this campaign will be. If ho
| Were to take the advice already given ts
him verbally and by every other form of
jcommunication be will stick until tire
'next election shows whether there is t>
be a Democratic State Senate.

Vhe reason is not hard to find. The

President of the State Senate becomes

Governor in the event of a vacancy in that
| office and the present incumbent is Prof.
John Dynley Prince of Columbia Uni-
versity, a straight out and out Republican
and stanch organization man and friend
of Nicholas Murray Butler.

The Democrats tell the Governor it
would not be fair to turn the power and
patronage of the State administration
over to a Republican at this critical moe
ment, and they instance Grover Cleveland,
Governor of New York, and Theodore
Roosevelt, Governor of New York, both
,of whom stuck to office after they had
been nominated on national tickets.

National Committee to Call,

The Dermocratic National Comrmnittes
iwill reach Sea Gire to-morrow afternoon
‘from Baltimore, and the conference which
will be hel! immediately atter they get
here will go far toward settling several
important things

The coumiitee will ask the Governor
to select the Democratic national chair-
| gan and the executive conummittee and to
indicate upon what lines he wants the big
i national fight mapped out.

Juri whom the Governor will name is
net known by any person, Many feom to
think he will want William FP, McComba,
who certainly showed talent of a higa
order at Bahinore, but MeCombes ia far
from robust, Word came from Baltimors
(o-night that he was so worn by the week's
strain that he is now in bed there under
the cere of a physician

'
|

The Governor heard of this to-night
end expressed great concern,
| Another man mentioned is Robert

Hudspeth, Democratic committeeman for
New Jersey, who led the Eastern came
poigns of Bryan and Alton B. Pager.
Joseph E, Davies, Democratic Nationa)
Commitieeman for Wisconsin, who was
ihe Western manager for Wilson, is heard
of and so is Dudley Field Malone. Some
want Senator O'Gorman of New York.

Goy. Wilson will have lots to say about
this selection, although he said to-night,
“I wish to consult with my friends.”
He will insist on an undoubted progres-
sive for the job and a man with broad
and practical experience,

May Await Bryan's Advice.

It would not be surprising if the selec-
tion were held up until Mr. Bryan is
sounded. Mr. Bryan sent a message
this evening that he was going back to
Lincoln and therefore cannot come with
the National Committee, but he will
soon return to the East and will call.

When the National Committee comes
to-morrow it will be entertained at a
buffet luncheon on the lawn and there-
after will go into the big hall of the White
House for the conference. Not only
will they talk over managers and plans,
but they will discuss also the letter of
acceptance and the formal notification
ceremonies.

The Governor says to-night that he
has not given either the letter or the
speech he will deliver to the notifiers
any thought yet. “That will come after
the conference,”

“In other words, Governor,” said one
of his interviewers, “you will place your-
self entirely in the hands of the commite
tee.”

The Governor shot a quick glance at
his questioner and his jaw stiffened @
little.

“Oh, no, I will not,” he said, “I think
