farae
the Hilow Handicap, at a mile and a quarter,
nin over the Brighton track yesterday after-
noon He was in a direct line with the Anish
of one of the most exciting horse races ever
pees) on 4 tnetropolitan track, and his verdict
favored Willitm Astor Chanler’s Salvatella,
act) | shot, by a nose. Mra. L. Curtis's
consistent mare, Eugenia Burch, second

choiwe, was placed second, with an eyelash
over \\ 1). Leeds's Hurstbourne, the favorite,
a crowd of 20,000 people going wild over the
reaut Lo many horsemen who viewed
the struggle at the wire from various angles,
Fugen Burch had a slight advantage, but
Jidge McDowell was in the best position
to devide, and his ruling was undoubtedly
just

It was the third of the Seaside Serials,
and Hurstbourne carried top weight, giving
one pound to Eugenia Burch, ten to Stamping
Ground, twelve to Salvatella, alxteen to
fheriff Bell, eighteen to Lux Custa and six-
teen to Kightful. Stainping Ground went to
the front instantly, and, attended by Lux
Casta, set a terrific pace into the backstreton,
tle half being covered in 0:48 4-5, the five
furlongs in 1:01 3-3 and the three-quarters
in ius. But as they died away, Hurstbourne
and Eugenia Burch took their places, still
maintaining the hot pace, the mile being
turned in 1:39 3-5, At the head of the stretch
Hurstbourne led Eugenia Burch by half a
length, Odom riding Mr. Leeda’s colt for all
he was worth. Hicks was busy with the
ken Strome mare, too, when suddenly up
from the ruck came Salvatella, Redfern
having taken the outside.

At the last sixteenth all three Jockeys
were whipping and the horses were racing
as if controlled by a single bit. The crowd
broke into a tremendous roar and outside
affuirs for the moment were forgotten. A
few yards from the wire Salvatella seemed
to get her nose in front but in the next jump
Eugenia Burch, who was in the middle, appar-
ently regained her lost advantage. Hurst-
bourne spurted too, and they passed the
judges so close together that nothing but
the hoisting of the numbers set at rest hun-
dreds of disputes. The time was 2:04 1-5,
one second siower than Waterboy’s world’s
reeord of 2:03 1-5, made in this year’s Brighton
Handieap,

It was 4 lucky day for FE. R. Thoma s when
fe purchased Stalwart, the game son of

leditler--Melba, at the recent Whitnay aale
Jt will be remembered that after the colt
had been knocked down to Mr. Thomas for
$12,000. Mr. Whitney expressed a desire to
repurchase him, to no avail. Stalwart amply
repaid Messrs. Phomas and Shields yesterday
when he won the second part of the Produce
flukes. for two-year-old colts and geldings,
the Winner's share of the race being $4,258
fd the stable placing a heavy commission
in the rig. Stalwart carried stake weight,
giving away as much as fifteen pounds.
kedfern had the leg up and the colt, opening
atéto 5, was hurriedly backed down to 9 to 10,
Dick Turpin and Kohinoor, added by the
Keenes, receding to 7 to 2 and 4 to 1, respec-
tively. Bullman got Dick Turpin, a Belmont
cast-off, away from the post flying, but be-
fore he had covered a furlong Stalwart went
to the front with meteoric speed.

They raced close together to the head of
the stretch with no let up until Dick Turpin
began to tire, whereupon Odom moved up
with Orthodox, 8 to 1, also a former Belmont
representative, who showed so much game-
ness that Redfern went to a drive. Stal-
‘wart continued under the pressure and won
by a length in 1:12 3-5, only three-fifths of a
second behind the track record. Orthodo
finished two lengths in front of Dick Turpin,
who had the same margin over Kohinor.

‘The Chantilly Steeplechase at about two
miles and a half was not only a travesty
on the jumping game, but also came near
being a human killing, Going up the back
Stretch the last time, with J. E. Widener’s
Enright, third choice, having a comfortable
lead, Gascar, a coupled favorite with Judge
Phillips, fell at the second jump. Baron
Pepper, who was right at his heels, fell over
him and both Soffel and W. Heider were
thrown headlong. slong came Gypsic at
top speed with Heider directly in tle path,
As the latter was in the act of rising, Gypsic
kieked him in the back of the head ‘and the
pokey. fell, apparently lifeless, on his face.
Bernhardt, who rode Gypsic, was 60 un-
nerved that at the next obstacle he, too,
went on his head. All three riders were mo-
tionless on the soggy turf, "while Enright

illoped on to a hollow victory over Judge

Pas the only other horse that had a
rider,
Bernhardt suddenly came to his senses and
Pluckily ran over to Gypsic, who had been
caught, and, remounting him, went on for
third money, getting an ovation as he came
to the wire with bruised face and tattered
jacket. Soffel had a leg and an arm wrenched
and rode to the paddock in the atarter’s car-
riage. Helder, unconscious and _ bleeding
from an ae cut at the base of the brain,
was placed in an ambulance and carried to
his brother's house in Sheepshead Bay, where
@ surgeon said that he was suffering from a
slight concussion of the brain, but with per-
feet rest would come around right. There
were aome hard words for steeplechasing
after the race.

Fuller divided the riding honors with Red-
fern by handling two winners, too. His best
Performance was tn the fifth race, for platers
at a mile and a aixteenth, on_ Unmasked
the 2 to 1 favorite. The son of Domino had
the extreme outside position at the post, but
Fuller made a dash for the rail, using his
whip in the effort and, after securing the
coveted place, he st#ved there in front, keep-
pre Unmasked under visible restraint. The
Jomino gricing, who has Jately developed
marked ability to go a route, was full of run-
ning, and when Fuller skinned the rail with
him at the head of the stretch it was all over.
Unmasked was not even hurried, and won
easily by a length in the fast time of 1:46 2-5.
Gaviota, 60 to 1, who was practically left at
the post, ran superbly under Tommy Meade's
kuidance, and finished second a half a length
in fro&t of Locket, also a 60 to L shot. Payne
heavily played at 11 to 5, was knocked out o
it at an early stage, and Higgins made no
attempt to proceed after that.

Fuller helped the Weston Geabies Pol
Roger, § to 1, to get out of the maiden two-
year-old class in the first event at five and a
half furlongs, the colt running over Rob Roy,
the favorite, In the last sixteenth and beating
him a head in 1.07 3-5. Lady Mirthful, 50to 1,
Was third, beating The Bowery, backed down
to7 to 2, by a head.

Another thrilling finish wound up the card.

)). Morgan's Contusion, the favorite in the
concluding event, a highweight Rendicep
4U6ix furlongs, made the running to the mid-
die of the stretch, where she began to tire.

en Gay Boy, 7 to 1, and Damon, 8 to J,
vallenged, and in a ding dong drive Ga
Koy beat Damon a head, Odom putting t
over O'Neil], Contusion was a length and a
hill away. The time was 1:12 3-5, Four
fivorites lost and the layers went away
founting the money. Thus came to a close

BRIGHTON TURF GOSSIP.

J. B. Haggin to Send Bread Mares tn Feal
te Seuth Africa.

Racing is in a thriving condition in South
Africa, with Johannesburg the Mecca for
turfmen from all over the world. Many
English stallions and brood mares have been
sent there already, and now comes the an-
nouncement that James B. Haggin, the most
extensive breeder of thoroughbreds in Amer-
ica, will take a hand in the game. It was
stated at Brighton yesterday that Mr. Haggin
had Practically made arrangements with
William Easton, the well known auctioneer,
to take a consignment of 150 brood mares
in foal to South Africa this winter. If the
enterprise is productive of success, it is pos-
sible that Mr. Haggin and other American
breeders will go further. At recent sales
several turfmen have purchased racehorses
with a South African campaign in view, and
it is believed that before long there will be
something of an exodus of fortune seeking
owners from American shores. Racing in
fos Bo intone Sond ioeas on a lines of
has already set {n. india ie sated

The appearance of the famous Brigadier
{n the last race yesterday brought to mind
the remarkable performance of tne six-year-
old son of Rayon d'Or—St. Bridget when he
hung up the world's record of 1:37 45 fora
mile on a circular track in 1901, nis four-year-
old year, at Sheepshead Bay. These figures
remained umtouoned until last August, when
the crack Western three-year-old Dick
Welles ran a mile at the Harlem track, Chi-
cago, in 1:37 2-5. Brigadier is now owned
by Frank Farrell, who has hac him for more
ape a6 ¢ hopetent cripple, ont Trainer Reeth

Tt e cr e,
Weir nas handled him carefully, with t a iden
of getting him to a race. Brigaaier looked
high in flesh yetserday and had little epeod,
He Rillen up sound,

After the races yesterday turfmen were
of the opinion that the sport at Brighton nad
been of a higher class than usual and that
form had not been far from the public cal-
culations. During the meeting just closed
there was not a race which caused scandal-
mongers to get busy.

Goodwin's OMelal Turf Guide, No. 18, nas
{ust been issued, with tne usual valuable
formation for turfmen.

PRINCETON WINS AT GOLR

REINHART ‘INDIVIDUAL INTER-
COLLEGIATE CHAMPION.

Chick of Harvard Bcaten in the Final
~—O'Conner Abead at Essex County
—Handicap at Dyker Meadew Won
by Deubleday—st. Andrews Score.

Princeton won its third victory in the Inter-
collegiate Golf Association championship
yesterday at the Garden City (Golf Club,
when Frank ©. Reinhaft defeated W. C.
Chick, one of the Cambridge cohorts. The
roster now makes Princeton even with Har-

 

vard, with two wins for Yale, but on the |

team championships Harvard has the lead.
There was a great interest in the match be-
tween the finaliste, for Reinhart, besides
two victories over Walter J. Travis, has been
very prominent in golf about New York,
occupying, indeed, much the same position
in golfing reputation that Chick holds about
Boston. It was the one match of the week
in which the club members and the sojourners
from the Garden City Hotel bought and sold
Pools about. This, of course, is an outside
matter, but the betting was $100 to $75 in
favor of Reinhart.

They ved the first hole in 4 setting out.
but then, &s Reinhart topped into the pit and
Chick pulled off into the rough, the second
hole, which is un eusy 3, was halved in
5, Thereafter the one striking feature of
the outward journey was the poor puttin
by Chick, who on the fourth, fifth, sixth an
seventh greens required three strokes, when

wo should have sufficed so at the turn the
rincetonian was 3 up. Chick improved
on his game thereafter, but his chase was a
hopeless one, for there is not an amateur in
the OMe who can give to Reinhart a lead
of four holes and a beating. At the end of
the morning Reinhart was still 4 up, and, as
in the afternoon, nothing but a phenomenal
series of holes would have beaten him, The
Princetonian retained this lead to the end of

HORSE AND CARRIAGE TRADE.

 

Recent visitors to England have noticed
on the strests of London, Birmingham and
one or two other large cities an entirely new
idea in private haneoms. This vehicle is
probably as original a departure from old
models in vehicles as the carriage world
has seen for some years. As a rule, novelties
in carriages are not considered desirable,
but the new hansom has come into instant
favor among the best people abroad, and

 

is destined to be just as popular in the United |

States. The patent rights on thia vehicle
have been secured for the United States
by Studebaker Brothers’ Manufacturing Com-
pany. It is now on exhibition at the New
| York repository, Broadway and Forty-eighth
street.

 

One of the busiest spots in Greater New
York is the repair shop of Edward Callanan's
Sons at 164 Weat Forty-sixth street. During
the so-called dul] season of summer this
shop was worked to the full capacity, and
even then was unable to keep pace with the
demand, Now, that many have returned
to town and the work made ready during
the summer is in use, the vehicles used during
the outing season are sent to the shop to be
overhauled and made bright and new in
readiness for use when wanted. it is true
economy to keep carriages in good order,
and a coat of varnish at least once each year
—six months is better—will add years to the
life of a vehicle.

W. H. Gray at 68 Wooster street, reports
@ good fal) trade in second-hand and shop-
worn carriages. There is a growing demand
among thrifty buyers for a carriage that is
practically new and has as much service as
when it left the hands of the builder. Of
course the original price is in many cases
cut in half. At the Wooster street emporium
a good line of station Rockaways is shown.
Some have glass front so arranged as to take
the place of a brougham in stormy weather
and to be opened and become as airy as @
park trap when the bright October deys
invite the change.

The Bedford Wagon Works at 754 to 760
! Bedford avenue, Brooklyn, have a stock of
: business wagons to which they call attention.

———

| This style of wagon is a specialty and is made
in a manner far superior to ordinary factory
work. Furniture vans are also made in dif-
ferent sizes for one or two horses. All these
are offered at moderate prices, and if desired
small weekly payments will be accepted.
Exchange wil] also be considered.

One feels like indulging in a canter through
the Park after a visit to the equestrian de-
partment of Cammeyer. At no place in the
greater city can there be found a more com-
plete stock of foot wear suited to the needs
of those who find pleasure and health in the
saddle. Riding boots for men,.made of Rus-
sia calf, are quoted at $10: enamel leather costs
$1 more, and the regulation army boots
$1 less, French calf bouts tor couchinen are
quoted at $12; pigskin russet leggins for men
are listed at $5.80 and grain leggins at #4.
Brown buckskin riding leggina cost but
$3.50. The assortment for women who ride
is equally complete. French calf boots
cost $10 and those made of kid are $1 more.
When made of all patent leather another
dollar is added to the price. Riding boots

d for women who ride astride are
quoted at $11, The assortment for younger
members of the family is also complete.

Fur robes run from $5.40 to $24.99. Stable
blankets and atreet blankets are also quoted
at equally favorable prices.

Over in the borough of Brooklyn, where
life is not quite so strenuous or the expense
of doing business quite like Manhattan, the
I. S. Remson Manufacturing Compuny has
a stock of CArTiA ge, harness and stable
requisites that will compare favorably in
extent and quality with any shown in the
greater city, In the carriage department,
more than four hundred are are shown, the
range including every useful and fashlonable

Van Taesell & Kearney announce auction
sales of horses and carriages on Tuesday
and Friday of each week, at their miurt, 130
and 182 Fast Thirteenth street. This leading
house in the trade has been established since
1867, and each year has brought added pros-
perity and increase of business. It is gen-
erally conceded to be the best place for buy-

At the salesrooms in Newark, J. M. Quinby

Co, are showing a fine display of sta-
tion wagons that are really a credit to the
masufacturers, The rockaway has always
been a popular carriage with the general

ublic because in cold or inclement weather
t can be made asfwarimn and coseyasa broghain,
while in mild autumn, spring or summer
it can be as pleasant and cheerful as a surrey
or phacton. Quinby & Co. have long hud a
reputation for making the best in vehicles
that skill and conscientious duty to patrons
can produce. Many of the designs are
original, especially in the ever popular
station rockaway, for which the house has
become the leader in novelties.

It seems like adding line upon line and

out doubt the most complete to be found on

applies to the harness department. More
