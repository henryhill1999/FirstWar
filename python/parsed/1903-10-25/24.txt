DEMOCRATS APTER BAY STATE,

ALL UNITED AGAIN, AND THINK
THEY'LL WIN ON STATE ISSUES.

 

 

Georne Fred Williams Kept Quiet and
Olney Trotted Out te Rall Against
Republican Extravagance—-Big Vote
Sure—lt May Make Gaston Governer.

Boston, Oct. 24.—Maseachusetts is in
the midst of the most strenuous State cam-
paign it has experienced in a long time,
and the opinion is freely expressed that
when the votes are counted on the first
Tyeaday in November the total number
cast will not be far short of the vote in a
Presidential year. The Democrats have
pet the pace, and while the Republican
managers have been rather slow in getting
garted, they are now making the utmost
endeavors to bring out a big vote.

Col. William A. Gaston, the Democratic
nominee for Governor, has been touring
the State for three weeks. and has attracted
so much attention that his State committee
really believes he will defeat Gov. Bates,
the Republican candidate.

The Democrats present a united party
thisyear. Bryanism has been blue pen-
cilled from all the speeches; George Fred
Williams, the most ardent admirer of the
Western statesman, is keeping quiet, but
will vote for Gaston; money is plentiful,and
the Hon. Richard Olney has used his pen
to say a few words in support of the Demo-
cratic nominee. All these things are re-
garded as omens of success by the Demo-
crats, and they have more money to spend
than has the Republican State committee.
Nothing is being left undone to poll a big
vote for Gaston.

It is hinted that Mr. Olney's interest in
the campaign is due to the nomination of
his nephew, Richard Olney 2d, as the Demo-
cratic candidate for Lieutenant-(Governor.
If that is the cause, the Democrats made a
clever move in placing the young man in
nomination, for the former Secretary of
State is the idol of thousands of Mugwumps
in the State.

There is no doubt about the Republican
managers being worried. They realize now
that this is not a year when they can rest
entheiroars with the expectation that Gov.
Bates will drift into the Executive chair
again. A month or so ago no unusual
preparations were being made for the
campaign, but things are different now.
Secretary Moody, ex-Secretary John D.
Long of the Navy Department, many New
England Congressmen, and the leading
spellbinders in the Bay State have been
called upon to stir the Republican voters
into action and bring out a full party vote.
From now on the Republicans will keep
busy, andit is believed that the full voting
strength of the State will go to the polls.

Col. Gaston has been after Gov. Bates’s
record in office in red hot style. Extrava-
gance is the strongest club he can wield;
but the people are getting tired of this, and
before many days Gaston will have to go off

on another tack. Some of the other Dem-
ocratic speechmakers are pounding away
at Gov. Bates and the Republican Legisla-
ture for interfering in municipal affairs.
In Boston there is not the slightest doubt
that the crusade of Chairman Emmons of
the Police Board againet drunkenness has
made many Democratic votes. Boston will
give Gaston a big majority; some estimates
are as high as 20,000. i

Not long ago a Democratic weekly up in
the Berkshires gave prominence to a letter
received from Chairman Thomas Talbot
of the Republican State committee. The
letter asked for support for the Republican
ticket. The lack of funda in the campaign
treasury on account of. this being an off
year was mentioned, and promises of re-
ward next year weremade. The same letter
was sent to papers all over the State, but
the Democrats immediately raised a great
hue and ery about the “corruption” of the
press

The men who denounced this Jetter must
have known that bribery was not intended,
but that payment would be made for the
publication of the campaign literature.
There has not been a year within the mem-
ory of the oldest Democratic politician in
Massachusetts when speeches, pictures of
car didates and eulogistic notices have not
hee published as advertising.

If the action of the Republican State
Oonmiltee chairman was corrupt, Gov.
Bales would like to know about certain

communications sent to newspapers askin
for rates for the publication of political

reading matter in their columns. In a
recent speech he quoted this letter; sent out
as! vear to many of the newspapers of the
Mate by an advertising agency in Boston,
reading as follows:

itr of placing some advertisin or the

setts and would like to know if you would

“Is there any one here that does not know

is there any one of the people that does
not know,” asked Gov. Bates in a speech
in which he quoted this letter, “that that

request was made in order that the matter
80 paid for by the Democratic State com-
mittee might appear not @8 paid advertising
matter, but as editorial or news matter?
And this very year the Democratic State
Committee is doing the same thing.”

Ex-Secretary Oiney, who was invited
tothe dinner of the } achusetts Demo-
fratic (lub last Monday night, sent a letter
In which he said

——

BASEBALL CAMPAIGN OF 1903.

 

Telting How Teams of Two Big Leagues
Moved About.

As between the National and American
leagues in the basebal! season of 1903, there
was more shifting of positions inthe Ameri-
can. Neither race was as exciting as each
has furnistied in previous years, and in both
the team that was in first place on July 1
stayed there to the finish. In both leagues
the most interesting fight was for second
Place, the result of the tussle for this posi-
tion in the American League not being de-
cided until the next to the last day of the
race. Second place in the National League
was in doubt until two days before the
finish, but in the American the second place
competitors changed places two days before
the finish, whereas in the National the
New Yorks, who finished second, were in

that berth continuously after Aug. 15, | mer in ridin,

In the American League the Washingtons
were always last from June 1 on, while
in the National St. Louis took last place
away from Philadelphias as late as the
middle of September.

The New York Nationals played with
Notable steadiness all through the season,
and the fact that only one team—Cincin-
nati—won the series from them, shows
ye ao even consistent game they played.

hey were first on May 1 and stayed there
till May 15, when they took a slight drop,
but by June 15 were back in first place.

They did not stay there long, being second
again on July 1 and by the end of the month
were down to third place. July was their
worst month, With the coming of Auguat
they began a rally and by Aug. 15 had
worked up to second place again, where
they took root and remained. The cham-
pion Pitteburgs were at their lowest point
on May 16—that is after the firet few ganies
when teams might shift 250 points with a
game-—when they were third. They were
still there two weeks later and then began
to show the form that made them far and
away superior to all else in the National
League. They started upward in June,
were at the top by July1,and until the end
of the season never were in danger of re-
linquishing the lead.

_The Chicagos, with the Pittsburgs and
New Yorks, were the only National League
team that had the honor of occupying
first place after the season was far enough
under way to count. They were third on
May 1, second on May 15 and first on June 1.
The month of June found them crossing
the path of New York and Pittsburg. On
June 15, the New Yorks having passed them
and gone to the front, they shared second
place with Pittsburg, but two weeks later
they were third and Pittsburg was first.
By Aug. 1 they had ousted the New Yorks
from the second station, but by Aug. 15
the New Yorks had returned the compli-
ment, and from that time on the Chicagos
were third. More sweeping changes at-
tended Cincinnati’s career than any of the
firat three clubs. The Reds were bringing
up the rear on May 1, but had jumped up to
fifth place by the 15th. They hovered about
this position for over a month, July 15
finding them in fourth place, and there they
finished with no advancement, and only
Brooklyn having any chance of passing
them. ;

Brooklyn's campaign was attended with
marked in and out playing, but not much
fluctuating in position. Their career, like
the National’s race in general, was tame.
They were sixth on May 1 and on May 15.
On June 1, 15 and July 1 they were fourth
place occupants, and had fallen to their final
destination, fifth place, by July 15. May
was Boston's beat month. The Hub men
were in the first division then, being fourth
on May 1 and May 15. OnJune 1 they were
sixth and in the same position at the end
of each succeeding two weeks to the finale.
The Philadelphias always were lowly.
They were seventh on May 1, last on May 15,
seventh on June 1 and 15, last from June 15
to Sept. 1, and seventh again by Sept. 15.
The St. Louis team finished a notch lower,
but soared higher than their Quaker rivals,
the latter, incidentally, showing marked
improvement in the last two months. The
Cardinals were as high as fifth on May 1,
then they shot down to last place in the
next two weeks. They were seventh most
of the last three months, being relegated to
the tail end in September.

Tangled lines characterized the May and
June campaign in the American League.
Ups and downs were numerous. The
champion Bostons were 80 inoffensive in
the first two weeks that May 1 found them
in sixth place. But once in their stride
their ascent was swift. They were third
by the 15th of the month, second on June 1,
first on June 15, After that they never
were headed. The Philadelphias did not
get so low. On May 1 and 15 they were
second, third on June 1, second on June 5,
July 1, 15, Aug. 1 and 15, third on Sept, 1
and 15, and second at the finish. The Cleve-
lands were slow beginners and took a big
drop early in the season, The fence break-
ers were seventh on May | and 15, but began
a rapid climb at that period. They were
fifth by June 1,--but did not tarry there.
They had gone into third place by the 15th
of June and in that position they anchored
for two months. By September they had
forced the Philadelphias to give up second
place to them, being ousted In turn by the
Quakers just before the close.

The career of the infant of the American
League, the New Yorks, was checkered,
but withal most creditable for a new team,
thanks to the efficient manager, Clark
Griffith. The New Yorks were third on
May 1, but had tumbled to seventh place
by June 1. All the month of June they
were trying to “find themselves,” and it
was not until July 1 that they began to get
together and move up. Then t ey went
up with a rush and were fourth by July 15.
They were fifth on Aug. 1, then jumped
forward to third place, dropping to fourth
by Aug. 15. They had a criss-cross time
with the Detroits for a while, but forthe
greater part of September were fourth
where they finished. The Detroits had
a seataoria HORADITIE, By May | they had
scaled the heights to the pinnacle, It took
them g month to toboggan from first to
sixth place. They stayed sixth in June,
but improved in July to the extent of reach-
ing fourth anes By Aug. 1. By the 15th
they were fifth and there rema ined except
for a few days when St. Louis was aliead
of them, ;

The St. Louis Browns made a big detour
in the first three months, They were last
on May 1, fifth on May 15, third on June 1,
fourth on June 15, fifth on July 1. seventh
on July 15--truly a diversified existence,

By Aug. 15 they were sixth, while in
Seplember they were fifth momentarily
and then sixth at the finish On

the imaginary chart of the season's de-
velopments they covered the widest range
of all. The Chicagos were a good early
season tea, being fifth on May } and first
on May |. They led the field until June 1,
when they began to seek their own level
They ea plunged to the depths of fifth
slace by June 15, had risen to fourth place
oy July 1 and were sixth two weeks later,
It took them a month to reach seventh
jlace, where they were from Aug. 15 to
the wind-up. The Washingtons had a

On May | they were as good as fourth, but

A DISCOVERY IN THE BAD LANDS
OF PLAINS LIFE LONG AGO.

Relics, Maybe, of 50,000 Years There
—Porsibly the Oldest Traées of Hue
mans on This Globe—Likely te Stir Up
Debate Among the Archacologists.

LINCOLN, Neb., Oct. 15.—What are be-
lieved to be the most ancient evidences
of Indian occupancy of the plains of the
United States, and are indications of the
existence of human life upon this sphere
anywhere from 20,000 to 50,000 years ago,
have just been collected by A. E. Sheldon
an agent of the Nebraska State Historical
Society, and are now in the State’s museum
in this ayy

Mr. Sheldon spent nine weeks this sum-
about the Sioux Indian reser-
vation at Chadron, gathering material
for a life of the great chief Red Cloud, At
the agency he received a hint that Ulysses
Farnham, an Indian boy had found an
ancient Indian fireplace far up in the Bad
Lands. Mr. Sheldon rode seventy miles
to investigate the story, and found it true.
In Lost Dog n, some seventy miles
north of the Nebraska line, within a few
miles of the spot at Wounded Knee Creek
where the Indians of North America made
what is very likely to be their last stand
ngainet the white man, two of these fire-
places were discovered.

Riding through the cafion one day, youn
Farnham noticed a big black spot hig’
up on one of the small buttes. He had
the curiosity to examine it and found evi-
dencea that it had once been a cooking
spot. There were large masses of chure
coal, burnt rock, ashes and other débris,
The boy casually mentioned this at home,
and {it came to the ears of Dr. Walker,
agency physician at Pine Ridge, who set
the curious Mr. Sheldon on the scent.

The find promises to make a stir among
archaologists as soon as its value becomes
known. The question is: How many yea:
ago was this fireplace in use? At that
time it must have non the ground, the
black dirt about it
found it was covered by from five to nine
feet of soil, definitely marked in seven or
eignt strata,which is evidence of its burial,

mmediately about the fireplace is a
4-inch stratum of black dirt. Next this isa
lighter soil filled with periwinkles, indi-
cating the presence of water over the spot
at the time the soil deposit was made. e

roblem_ which archwologists will rneet
ere ia; Was this deposit made immediate]
after the great drift, when lakes were left
at many spots, or does it simply mark the
spotof agreat overflow? Nobody knows.

The next three or four strata are of vary-
ing thicknesses of butte clay, thinner, but
well marked. In the section of the soil
on exhibition at the museum a distance
of eight feet separates the lowest from the
top layer. In addition to the years that
it has taken for these seven or eight
strata to form over the abandoned fire-
place, there must also be computed the
number necessary to expose it at its present
height above the lower level surrounding it.
This latter was evidently by erosion. The
question is: When, and how long did it take?
/ The curious formations of the Bad Lands
have been the theme of many interesting
articles. Through a part of them runs
the White River. This stream is fed by
numerous little creeka—Lost Dog, Bear
in the Lodge, and others of similar descrip-
tive titles. Where the creeks em oty into
the river these butte formations are found.

The mouth of the cafion down which
these small streams run widens as it a
proaches the river until it forms a cir-
cular basin dotted with these odd-shaped,
rounded mounds of earth, looking like

iant toadstools, the lower parts having
een washed by the water at some re-
mote period until they leave each with
a gigantic ile

© add still further years to this relic
the spot where it was made is a sort of
tableland leading off one of these buttes,
showing it to have been filled up after the
original buttes were eroded. It is sup-
pores that at one time this was a land-
ocked basin, and that the action of the
water in seeking an outlet in times of storm
caused these washings away.

At the bottom of the cafion which con-
tained thes old fireplaces, immediately
below them, were picked up chipped flints,
bits of pottery, and the bones of ten or
twelve kinds of animals. The theory
is that these were once a part of the fire-
place, but the erosion occurrin {bee where
it did separated them from their original
resting place and deposited them lower.

The presence of the pottery is in itself
evidence that the place was used bya tribe
that antedated the Sioux. The latter, it ia
definitely known, have occupied the land
of the Dakotas for more than 200 years.
As they did not make or use pottery, the
fireplace was not one of theirs, even if it
is not as old as the topsoil evidences indi-
cate. The Pawnees were the tribe furthest
north to use earthen vessels. The Sioux
disdained them.

Careful inquiry was made among the
ranchmen in the vicinity of these buttes
as to what differences in their physical con-
formation have been noted. en who have
been in the neighborhood for forty or fifty

ears say that there is very little change
hh their outward appearance. Taking this
evidence as a basis of calculation, it must
have been many centuries ago when the
fireplaces were in use.

Science has yet discovered no infallible
rule of time measurement a# to the deposit
of soils, and only conjecture enters into
this problem. If the change in half a cen-
tury has been so slight as to be scarcely
noticeable, how many years or centuries
dic it require to pile seven or eight strata
© soil upon the abandoned fireplace, and
then by erosion to cut down through these
laye: of earth so as to expose it again
to ow

Anywhere from 20,000 to 50,000 yp, says
FE. E. Blackman, archwologist of the State
Historical Society. Mr. Blackman believes
that somewhere in the Western plains will
be secured the final evidence which will
sustain the claim of science to the many
centuries of age made for the earth. At
the bottom of a driven well 4n Kansas, not
long ago, were found flints and bones which
point to centuries of antiquity, and here
and there are uncovered bits of evidence,
like this up in Lost Dog Cafion, which point
to living human occupanoy tho of
years ago. r
“ The archives of the State Historical So-
ciety give the information that the firet
known of the Indian population of the great
plains region was gleaned By the Coronado
expedition of 1541, On April 23 of that year
Francisco Vasquez de Coronado marched
from Mexico north to find the fabled land
of Quivirs. ar

According to the traditions whioh had
reached the Spanish invaders of the land

of the Montezuinas, somewhere to the north |

was a kingdom where dishes of gold were
used io serving the nobles, where there were
houses several stories in height, and where
the king and his lords rode under golden
canopies in cances with twenty rowers on
a side, Coronado did not find any of this

olden splendor, but he did discover two
Golan nations living only a few miles apart,
barbarous, eating its meat
rude implements of
fine flint imple-

one rude and
raw, and fashioning —
flint, the other makin, ‘
ments and pottery and living in houses,
whose foundations still stand. His ex-
yedition proved beyond a doubt that either
Kanes or Nebraska was the great centre
of Indian population on the plains before
the coming of the white man. |

In later years Nebraska historians have
conceded that Coronado never reachea
this State, although there is evidence to
the contrary in the disinterment in Franklin
county recently of a Spanish stirrup of
Moorish design and in Hed Willow county
of a straight, two edged Spanish sword
of sixteenth century design used upen
guite of chain mail
