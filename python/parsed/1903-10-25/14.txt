A CHAT WITH
MARION C

 

WRITING

The most etriking object in the room
where F. Marion Crawford
visitor Was a huge poster of “Francesca da
Rimini.” It greets you full face as you en-
ter and suggests immediately the dramatist
rather thar the author, the sailor, or the
biographer of the Pope, in all of which réles
Mr. Crawford has appeared before the
world

Mr. Crawford coiled himself gracefully
in the big brown leather chair while he
talked of his dramatic experiences, past,
present and to come.

‘] like that poster. Fine, is it not?® he
eaid. “She is a wonderful woman.”

The “she,” of course, referred to the
divine Sarah.

“How did I come to write a play for her?
It was this way. It came about most
naturally.

“We bad been to a luncheon here in New
York. Driving back afterward she said to
me.

“‘T want a good play. Why don’t you
write me one?’

*[ had no play in my mind that I thought
would suit her, but after a little reflection
and my usual reading of Dante, of whom
T have always been more or less of a student,
T believed that in Francesca I had found
the part suited. Events justified that pre-
diction.

“] sketched a scenario on a ecratch pad
and a few days after read it to her. She
liked it and after my return to Italy I com-
menced the play.

“The next time I saw her in regard to it
was in London. She was staying at the
Carlton Hotel and one summer afternoon
I found her there wrapped in rugs, every
window and shutter closed, drinking strong
black coffee.

“We went through the finished play and
she was satisfied with it. I had swept aside
the historical balderdash in regard to Fran-
cesca, which has been emphasized by the
pictures of Ary Schaeffer. [bad found that
Francesca at the time of the tragedy was

about 32 andthat sie had loved Paolo for

with that what I imagine is rarely done
| read the scenario of the play to Miss
Viola Allen before the book was com-
menoed.

“Then I wrote the book. It was pub-
shed and after that the play was evolved
Rather a turning of the tables, was it not?”

Mr. Crawford is most diplomatic in his
treatment of his contemporaries. It is
here that his cosmopolitan training is most
in evidence, The average American inter-
viewed gives his opinion and then retracta,
Mr. Crawford saves time and strength by
not voicing his at all.

“D'Annunzic? He is a man seething
with talent, but he will not study stage
technique. Please do not ask me my

opinion of his work—e brother playwright,
you know,

“Mise Allen? You really do not want
me to express my opinion about any actress,
Miss Allen especially. You see, there are at
least 1,000 actresses, and should I be ao indis-
creet, what woulc the 999 Bay?

“Hall Caine? No. it is true that he is not
an actress, but the same rule applies—a
brother novelist, you know.”

Mr. Crawford uncoils and coils again
and remarks laconically: “I co not read
Mr. Caine’s books and | have not seen
‘The Christian’ and ‘The Eternal City.’

“The play that brought me over this
trip?” he resumes. “There aretwo. There
is the Venetian play which we hope to
bring out this season and in which Miss
Allen will appear in the title idle

“She will take the part of a Venetian
actrese of the eighteenth century, the
time, you know, when Venice was the
Paris of the world and when no gentle-
man's education was considered complete
unless he had visited there; when the Gov-
ernment took cognizance of the gaming
and did everything to make the city at-
tractive to the stranger, :

“She is one of Goldoni’s troupe. Geldoni

Bernhardt.

“Difficult to please? Not at all. She
sugyested only a few changes in the last
act and requested that I have the play
translated by the same man who translated
Hamlet for her into French, He is prob-
ably the greatest authority on mediseval
Freneh in the world

“The play had quite a run in Paris, but
wat never translated and played here I
don’t know of any actress who would quite
dare to attempt the 16le, It was essen-
tially a Bernhardt play, written tor her.
Yes, she is a wonderful woman.”

“My first play?” Mr. Crawford shrugged
his shoulders. “I have been writing
plays for ten years and we don't speak of

are never produced, do we?

Mr. Crawtord kindly corrected the in-

it was quite different. Jt was a charming

*What relation do D think the first night

bears to the play?

Mr Crawford thought a long Wine before

hair with his bands.

“The press has an enormous influence
here over the initial performances of a play,

Tf ite eriticiams on a play at the opening
night are favorable, it can fill the theatre
for weeks; but there is one thing it cannot
do—tt cannot make a really bad ploy ro
after the first week or so and it cannot kill
4 really fine production. Advertising does
agrent don! 4 does nor ce all"

“And the first night in Ialy?®

Mr. Crawford suiied tow as he smiled
all through the interview whenever the
Italian drama was mentioned

|

|

} “The first, night in Italy? Well, they
| can kill a play pretty quickly there, They
, are rather emotior al a en it comes to the-
| atrical productions. If they don't like a
play the theatre is pardemonium And
they very often don't like plays You see,
the run of a production is so briet that

it has to be pretty good.”

“It must be ra! her hard on the drarratist,”
was interpolated “Do they ever Joll him
when he respor ds to a curtain call?"

“Curtain call? Nobody does that
unless he happens to be very vour g
do it here? They would rot thir k of dob ¢
it in Italy or Lor don. Imagine D'Annu zo
or Pir ero making a speech the first night!
IT simply cannot. That is very out of
date.”

Mr. Crawford reminisced

“In St. Louis my play ‘The Palace of
the King’ took very well, The first night
T was in the audience about half way down
the orchestra seats. There was a loud
call for the author, and Isat there listening,
very much amused. Nobody knew me,

“That is a dramatization of my book
‘Zoroaster.’ [t will not be produced until
September, 1904. It is to be an enormous
production, 600 people on the stage at once;
and, of course, there is endless work to be
done on it. I aim in constant communica-
tion with Klaw & Erlanger, who will bring
it out.

mitted boxing in public, acroit means were
used to inform the sports of an impending

personal way, the promoter going from
one «port to another and telling them to
gather at a certain place at a certain hour
on a certain night. Printed invitations
were not considered necessary then. Now,
however, such procedure is essential to
the financial success of a fight, no matter

Those who engineer prizefighte nowa-

may lack in intellectua! ability is made up
for in shrewdness and craftiness. They
make sure of their ground before they
proceed, yet often their p'ans miscarry
and fa)l into the hands of the authorities.
Many fights have been decided in New
York and vicinity during the past three
years, of which the police and genera! publie
have heard nothing. Invariably these
battles have been for side bets atone, only
a handful of sports, most!y intimate friends
of the contestants and promoier attending.
A budding pugilist is looking for al! the
notoriety he can get. It is his stock in
trade, so to speak, and it is hia ambition
to get his name in print as often as he pos-
sibly can. This medium is the newspapers;
and hia manager or sometimes himee!f wil!
visit the sporting editor and tell him of
a fight that is soon to be held in which he is
to be one of the contending parties, end often
he will ask for a preliminary notice. Of
course, he will insist that no correct date
of the impending mil] be mentioned. Then,
after taking the newspaper into his con-
dence, he will ask one of the obliging
scribes to write out an invitation that will
appear innocent enough on the surface,
but which has a clear and well defined
meaning to the one who receives it

The success of a fightin private often
depends on the ingenuity and conetruc-
tion of some of these invitations. They
must be original and calculated to attract
A prospective spectator. Very often the
reciplent of one of these invitations, usually
printed on cards of the width and length of

ordinary ball tickets, is @ business man
with a penchant for witnessing fistic en-
counters, He is often recommended to
the promoter by some well known sport,
who wi!l vouch for hia honor in keeping
a secret. After reading the invitation,
which seems as meaningless as some of
the hieroglyphica on the Obelisk to the
Wnlniuaeed mortal, he invariably com-
minicates with the sender; and, if con-
vinced that there is good sport ahead,
will forward the price of admission, which

“Il have found a town in Pennsylvania
as wild and lawless as any place in the heart
of the Calabrian Mountains. You won't
go to that place?” asked Mr. Crawford anx-
lously, naming it with distaste; ‘‘not even
to interview anybody?”

The interviewer promised, and Mr. Craw-
ford looked relieved,

“Yea, when people say that Iam not an
American I don't know what they mean
exactly.”

“You can write your plays here as well

as in Italy?” The question was asked
while in the mind of the interviewer was a
pi re of the difference between the big,

table strewed with proof sheets and manu-

hese fights do not always begin on
schedule time. The sports are often slow
in gathering. The promoter waite for
them, because it is necessary that he shou'd
do 60. It is his aim to conduct the battle
in a way that will not reflect on his man-
agement, as he ia looking for future patron-
age, and he knows he wil] not secure it un-
less he gives his followers a run for their
money.

Most of the invitations which have been
iseued lately for private contests of the
maniv art have been calls to attend the
meeting of some mvthical association or
lodge. Thev direct the recipient to be
present ot such and suchatime, at such and
anch place, and are invariably signed,
“The Committee.” Not long ago a local
sport received the following card:

The B. A. A. A. will hold its regular meeting
at Tall, on Sunday, Sept, -——-, at 9
o'clock. In order to insure a cool and pleas
ant evening's fun, bring your own ice.

One misguided snort, who is known as a
wag on the East Side, brought his own Ice,
but it was in the form of a bottle of pre-

ared cocktails. He was liberal with the
wverace, and befere the fizht started he
was well on the road to a jag.

The invitation to the fidht between Kid
Retts and Lew Curley, which was to have
been decided last Sunday, but whieh was
frustrated by the police, who swooped down
upon seme sixty and odd sports and caused
a wholesale raid, was innocent enough.
Tt read:

Installation of members of the A

at 30 sharp. Brothers are respectfully |
requested to be present _on time to avoid
delay Ti COMMITTEE.

Whatever “A. A. A.” stood for has not
been as vet clearly defined, but it was not
a sufficient “stall” to prevent the raid.
Roundsman Jackson of the Fifth street
police station found one of these cards
and without much atudious effort divined
its true purport and nipped in the bud the
scheme of holding the fluht.

Probably the cleverest invitation to one
of these fistie séinces was constructed by
an ex-puyilist a few years ago. He was in
need of some ready cash, and, having several
pupils under }is wing, connived ut holding
a private mill. He then had printed the
appended ecard

NATIONAL UNION OF WORKERS.

Started by a Spokane Engineer, and Open
to Bosses as Well as Emptoyees.

There’s an engineer named George B
Weaver out in Spokane, Wash., who has
been fighting the union way of doing thinge
by getting up a non-union union. Now

all the other non-union organizations in the
country together.

Engineer Weaver, from all accounts, is a
hustler
had a lot of union rule--more than most
people wanted. It was when the unions
were declaring strikes and boycotts right
and left that Weaver and some of his friends
formed the American League of Inde-
pendent Workmen. They didn't get very
! many members at first n fact, the small
club with the big name had a struggle for
existence

Things in Spokane are, however, not just
what they used to be. Here is what one of
the members of the league writes ina letter
which was received here the other day:

“We are growing fast, and we have got
the unions on the run. They have under-
taken five strikes in this city this year and
they have failed in every case

“We are now building more buildings
with non-union than with union men in this
city.

Weaver's organization hits at about every-
thing that union rule has made objection-
able to lovers of liberty. One of its objects

; is to furnish opportunity 10 apprentices.

TAMMANY HAVING LOTS OF FUN

 

Like San Francisco, Spokane has.| HUMOR OF THE CAMPAIGN BUB-«

BLES IN THE “FUSION RECORD”
Parkhurst and Tim Woodruff Will Leara
Something to Their Advantage by
Consulting the “Personal” Colunm
—Gypry Queen Odell--The Greene Light

There is no spotters’ town advertising
in this campaign to ‘brighten the display
places with pictures and verse as was done
two years ago. Instead, the opposing
parties are asking questions of each other
in tall lettering on the bill boards or de»
claring in epigrams what the election of
one ticket or the other will mean to’ New
York.

The strongest play at humor has bees
made by Tammany. Ita campaign book,
put out under the title of “Father Knickers
bocker Adrift,” was a mixture of facta,

Another is “to compel the labor unions to | misstatement, fun and sarcasm. Tt has

observe the laws
tion “to prevent boycotts and sympathetic
strikes.” Employers are as welcome to
membership as the employees. The second
article of the constitution provides that
“all American citizens over 16 years of age,
of good moral character, who shall declare
their adherence to the principles and the
laws of this corporation, shall be eligible
to membership.” In connection with the
work of the league, President Weaver says:

“We betieve that every American citizen
has a right to work for whom he pleases,
when and where he pleases, and under the
Constib.tion of the Tinited States no man
or body of men has a right to dictate to
him, We do not discriminate against
union men, On the contrary, we insist
that all laboring men be on an equality
and that all have the same right to work
any workshop.”

President Weaver is working day and
night to get up a national convention of
the non-union bodies of workmen. His

sibly Indianapolis, as soon after Jan. 1 as
is possible.

So far he has had reports which he con-
siders very hopeful. There are lots of
non-union organizations around the coun-
try. When the work of all of these is shown

his friends think that one of their great
ohjen® will have been accomplished.

t is their idea that many workmen—
many of them enrolled in the unions—have

secretly with the plan of letting every man
do what work he wants todo. When there
is a national organization confidence is
felt that many of these sympathizers will
declare themselves.

“Perhaps they won't do it right away,”
said one of the non-union enthusiaste of
this city the ether day, “but the organiza-
tion can't heip having ita effect sooner or
Jater. It may take months and months
before we make much headway, but I am
just enough of an American to have great
faith in the honesty of the average work-
man

“Where you have honesty it’s an easy
thing to build up independence. Union
rule has done {ts best to stamp that out,
but its methods can't prevail forever. At
any rate, thie work will go on and on. I
am sure of the result.”

From all over the United States Mr.

course. Many of them come from indi-
vidual workmen who would like to join
his movement.

In Indiana he has found several organi-
zations which were built on plans similar
to those advanced by the Spokane league.
Marion, Anderson and Muncie have already
got their start. President D. M. Parry of
the National Association of Manufacturers
has done valiant work in assisting these
non-union bodies.

In some cases the Indiana non-union
unions bave had to fight fire with fire when
the inveitable boycott was started, but
they have fought with such sturdiness as
to gain a wholesome respect

All of these organizations have dec
themselves against strikes, boycotts and
walking delegates

New York State has one such body, that at
Elmira the Independent Labor League.

GET DRUNK ON COLOGNE,

Indians of Northwestern Canada Fond of
Tollet Preparations.

OTTAWA, Oct. 24.—Kau de cologne and
other toilet preparations are doing a great
deal of harm among the Indians of Peace
River district in northwestern Canada,
according to a member of the Canadian
Geological Survey who has just returned
from a visit to that region.

The harm FRE Tan the faet
Indians drink them.

Cologne and yarious other concoctions
known as Florida water, essence of ginger
and essence of peppermint are prepared
especially for internal use by traders, who
ure not permitted to sell whiskey to the In-
dank. Thestulf isin reality nine-stenth» pure
alcohol. J.M. Macoun of the Canadian 8 ir-

guised has become such a serious matter that
the missicna ies have become discouraged
and the business of the Hudson Bay Com-
pany protiises to be embarrassed

YVhe Indians have learned that the sweet
smelling things are to drink and are not to
he wasted as esterior ountments. If one
were to consult the Dominion reeords of
importations, one would suppone that the
yntan half-breeds of the »orthwest had
suddenly developed a remarkable fondest

Another is by arbitra-! heen followed by two issues of the Fusion

Record, the second of which is printed to=
day and will be distributed this week.

All the advertising departments of a
daily newspaper are conducted in the usion
Record in a style to relieve the solidity of
the serious arguments for the election of
the Tammany ticket. This newspaper
was got up by Willis Holly, a newspaper
man of long experience and a campaign
manager of high repute. Last year Mr.
Holly ran Francis Burton Harrison’s cam-/
paign for Congress in a district sup
to be safely Republican.

Of course, Mr Holly has a personal column
in a Tammany paper, and a clairoyvant
column, too, but no massage parlors are
exploited. In the personal column one

in | finds these items:

WILL the dark gentleman with the black chim
whiskers please preach about Reform next Sune
