falls low over the shoulder.

Plumes are laid flat upon the top of low

they cluster in bunches upon turbans.

And such ostrich feathers; they come in
all hues of the rainbow, and marvellous
shaded effects and color combinations are
achieved in one single plume.

on the subject there are clusters of tiny
birds which are in lovely colorings and are
grouped and used much as flowers would
be. Then there are larger birds laid flat
upon the top of a low crowned hat or turban
or upon the turban side on turned up hat

Quills of every sort and condition are
shown in the millinery shops and some of
the most attractive are excessively broad
and plaited in dull colors. .

Metal, enamel and jewelled hat ornaments
are handsomer than ever, and the high
crowns have called for long slim buckles
through which may be slipped silk, satin,
or velvet folds encircling the crown. Tiny

| ostrich tips are sometimes clustered around

 

the high crown. Little flowers of some sor
are set closely together around it, forming
a broad flower band, and loops of narrow ,;

mine and some other fur have hate included
in them; but when this is not the case, a hat
of white beaver trimmed in black plumes,
and possibly a touch of black velvet, is
used to carry out the ermine idea.

Beaver has attained great favor and
taken on many novelties. Shaded two
tone beavers were advanced as an experi-
ment last winter, but this season they are
a fact assured, and many lovely effects
are obtained in them. Plaided beavers
are also among the millinery novelties.

Silk hats made by men’s hatters are a
new thing among tailored hats, but are,
so far, finding little favor

Bonnets, with and without strings, are
to have a chance for their life, but just
how far they will succeed remains to be
seen. The bonnet command for — last
spring's drawing room in England started
the ball rolling, and Paris took up the idea,
but the fashion is still experimental.

In ita latest form, the modish bonnet
ia much like an Alsatian bow, with a hand-
some ornament in its centre and a little
froth of tulle or chiffon behind it to do
duty as a crown.

 

 

RECORD OF MRS. ALLEN'S CLOCK.

tt Is Now Being Repaired for the First
Time in 125 Years.

Pierstown, N. Y., Oct. 24.—A grand-
father’s clock was brought to a watch-
maker's shop in this place this week for
repairs, the first that have been imade
upon it since some trifling one in 1778, which
were due to the raid of the
Brant and the Tory Butler at Cherry Valley,
in November of that year

clock to the woods and buried it under

It was all that he saved from the torch,
and days passed before he ventured to re-
cover it. It needed but slight repairs to
set it going as well as ever,

The clock, which bears across its face the
name of Thomas Jenkin, Sandwich, has
long been in possession of the Allen family
of Pierstown, and it is Mrs. James Allen
who has brought it forth for its first fixing

MISS WEEDS DEBUT IN OPERA,
American Girl Who Introduced a

New Wrinkle at Bayreuth.

Marion Weed, one of the Americans who
are to sing at tle Metropolitan Opera House
this season, arrived here last week. She
has sung in her own country in concert, but
will make her first appearance in opera
this winter.

Miss Weed comes from Rochester and
was first heard here in the conce:ts of the
Symphony Society at Steinway Hall, She
returned to Europe with Mme. Lilli Leh-
mann, who prepared her for the operatic
stage.

After several months of study, Mme.
Lehmann, who was going to sing at Bav-
reuth, thought that Miss Weed would be
equal to one of the smaller rédles and wrote
Mme. Cosima Wagner to that effect. ‘The
American girl was summoned to Bay-

STRIKING CONTRASTS IN MRS.
MARY LAYTON’S LIFE.

 

 

Was a Car Cleance Seven Years Ago; Hircs
Pullman Cars Now—Owns the Bullding
Where She Used to Wash Dishes —The
Change Came in a Winter at Dawson.

Los ANGELES, Cal., Oct. 20.—Mary Hogan
Layton was a Pullman car cleaner at $1.20
a day in this city seven vears ago last April.
Nowadays she charters Pullman cars for
herself and her friends. In the winter of
1895-06 she was glad to get a job as dish
washer in a restaurant in Los Angeles.
Now she owns the whole building in which
the restaurant is located, and a few days
ago she refused $76,000 for the property.

She has invested $40,000 in a Fresno vine-
yard, has lent $75,000 on mortgages, and
owns a good sized block of Atchison pre-
ferred stock, Also, she is about to build a
$35,000 residence at Santa Cruz, Cal., where
she was a servant girl at $4.a week ten vears
ago.

“IT am proud of my rise from penury
and want,” she said a few days ago.
“Every dollar of mine has come by hard
work, by enduring grim privations, by
strenuous living, and by the exercise of my
best judgment. To be sure, there is a large
element of luck in my rapid success as a
money getter I ran the first hotel in the
Klondike.”

Mrs. Layton was one of Michael Hogan's
eight children and was born at Atchison,
Kan. She went out to earn her own liveli-
hood when she was 13. That was about 1880.
Her husband, George Layton, a teamster
at Emporia, Kan., died in 1890, leaving her
with a debt of $250 to clear away while

 

 

earning $18 a month.

The year 1896 was the most eventful in
the life of Mary Hogan Layton. She went
to San Francisco early in the year, and a
dying woman, whom she nursed, left her
$300.

Among the offices in which she washed
windows and mopped floors was one where
several miners from the Yukon River
placers in Alaska met. The stories she
heard them tell about the gold camps de-
cided her to try her luck as a cook at Circle
City on the Yukon.

A party of twenty-two pioneers, aix
married men and their wives and ten single
men, were to leave San Francisco for Circle
City in July, 1896. Mrs, Layton agreed to
go with them as cook at $75.a month.

They reached Circle City just after the
first discoveries of gold along the Klondike
had started the rush to Dawson. Conse-

++ -

} quently Mrs. Layton’s party went to Daw-

son, too.
Mrs. Layton started the first meal place !
in Dawson. She bought two tents and put |
them together, laid pine boards aogose |
barrels for a table, and made a bench at the |
table by laying other boards across boxes. |
For a meal comprising such things as stewed |
codfish,one boiled potato, salt pork or bacon,

——.

bread and stewed prunes, she got $1.50 or | |

two penny weigiits of gold dust.

For weeks her daily receipts averaged
$156. The daily average of expenses was |
$65

There was a demand at Dawson, from the |
firat, for a hotel where men could find some
sort of home. Naturally Mrs. Layton was
looked to as the most likely proprietor of

 

_ —

of 1890 she wae sluicing a pound of gold a
day, and her returns for the year were
upward of $18,000. The next vear she made
more money.

With the close of the summer of 1900,
Mrs. Layton was, altogether, some $45,000
better off by reason of her inyvestinent.
But the hardships and loueliness of her life

as a placer miner began to tell upon her. |

So she eold her claim for $40,000,

Still seeing possibilities to make her
capital earn large interest, Mrs. Layton

She became a money lender, and did well |

at this also.

IT RAINS IN PORTO RYLI?!
The People Den’t Don Rubbers There for
Leas Than Second Story Weather.

“That must have been a right damp lit-
tle drizzle,” was Lochinvar Leary'’s com-
ment upon the West street saloon keeper's
vivid word picture of the recent rain-
storm.

“Damp?” said the saloon keeper. “Well,
I should say, yes’! Why, West street was

dream of putting up his umbrella until
the weather has reached chimney level.

“Why, except for the rain down there
the people would starve to death. Porto
Rylians wouldn't any more think of going

They subsist entirely on the fish and oysters
that they find in their kitchens after the

E have told you of the Arnold Knit

Night Drawers, we have told you ot

the wonderful and sensible Baby

Knit Outfits—now we want to tell you of a de-

lightful sleeping garment for women and misses,
A very fine white Domet flannel nightgown.

For women who are not familiar with the

term ‘Domet,” we state it is not to be con-
fused with Canton flannel, but is a very soft,
light fine flannel with a short tleecy nap on both
sides. The garments are so light and fine that .
they are never too heavy or overheating for
steam heated rooms, are grateful and pleasing
in contact with the body and weigh only one
pound, Have a tucked yoke tront with a pretty
lace edging at collar and cuffs. Are cut full and
ample. We venture the statement that no other
store can match this garment at the price, $1.25.
Misses’ sizes in 2, 4,6, 8, 10 and 12 years, at
75 cents upward,
