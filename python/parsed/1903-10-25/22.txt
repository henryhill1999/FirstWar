the toute who didn’t know hira by sight

“One afternoon a newcomer among the
touts, a fellow just in from Chicago, who
didn't know the faces of any of tiie Eastern
racing men, sidled alongside old Bill in a
corner of the betting shed—the old man
was having an awful struggle with himseif
aa to whether he'd better bet a ten-dollar
note on the chance of a horse of his that
was just about to run--and the tout said
to him:

“ ‘Pat, there’s @ rough neck owner of
hosses on this lot that’s a world beater
when it comes t’ knowin’ when, I jes’

IN DRAW POKER.

Some a Cashier Found in Playing
Double or Quits With the
Bank’s Maney.

Theodore Jones, cashier of the Second
National Bank in a «mall city not a thousand
miles from Chicago, was in serious trouble.
He had made a mistake that day which
he was unable to rectify.

It was Saturday afternoon and he had
discovered the mistake when he was work-
ing over the books after hours. More
than that, he knew just how the mistake
had occurred.

Putting on his hat he walked a few blocks
up the street to the office of David Gray,
& prosperous manufacturer, who was one
of the depositors in the Second National
Bank. Mr. Gray was an austere man,
who was noted in the town for his closeness
in money matters, When the bank cashier
entered the manufacturer's office he asked
for a private interview, and the two were
presently seated in an inner room.

“You came to the bank this afternoon,”
said Mr. Jones, “with a check for $1,138.45,
for which you anted the cash.”

“I did,” said Mr. Gray.

“In giving you the money I made a mis-
take of $900 and gave you $2,038.45. You
found it out afterward, didn't you?”

“No,” said the manufacturer, as coclly
and steadily as before. “I did not get
any such money fron you.”

“But you did,” insisted the cashier. ‘I
gave you two packages of ten dollar bills
instead of one package of tens and one
package of ones. I remember it distinctly
now.”

“If you had done ao,” ssid Mr. Gray,
steadily, “I would certainly have discovered
it when I ised the money to pay off my
hands, but I did not discover anything of
the kind. There was exactly enough for
my payroll.”

The cashier was staggered. Then, seeing
that Mr. Gray was determined to keep the
money,he felt that further pleading would
be useless, and leaving the room he walked
back to the bank.

Going to the bookkeeper's desk he
opened the big ledger and appeared to be
working over it. In reality he was studying
his predicament.

It was clear that he was unable to make
up the loss. His invalid wife, whom he
loved devotedly, was a great tax on hia
income, and it had been only by means of
the strictest self-denial that he had kept
out of debt. For her aake he had broken
away from his fast life in Chicago and had
settled down to busineas drudgery.

“Now, what does it all amount to?” he
asked himself, bitterly. “I would not be
any worse off if I had stayed with the old
crowd. Why,1 could win or lose a thousand
in a night when I was—--”

And then he stopped, almoet stunned by
the thought that came to him. Then he
looked around, almost as if he had a guilty
fear of being seen, but there was no one
there.

Then he thought over a plan which had
come to him like a direct inspiration of
Satan. In half an hour a train would paas
through the city, which would bring him
to Chicago at 9 o'clock. A half hour at
the barber's and an hour for dinner, would
leave him time to reach the old club rooms
by the time the invariable Saturday night
poker game would be fairly under way;
and then---—

But there were other things to consider.
Yes, he would get a train back Sunday
night, and no one need know he had been
away. But the money. He had _ forty
or fifty dollars in his pocket, and no more
of his own that he could lay his hands on
at the moment. And that was no capital
for the game he had in mind to play.

There was money~ great quantities of
money—almost under his elbow. The mere
thought sent a shiver through his whole
frame, and his heart seemed to oease beat-
ing. He had never stolen a cent in his life.
Then he laughed aloud, and muttered:

“It's the old game, double or quits. I'll
have the name of stealing nine hundred,
so [ll make it eighteen or nothing.”

He had at least one quality belonging
to a good poker plaver. There was no
hesitation after he had decided, Count-
ing out exactly $900 of the bank's money,
he put it in his pocket, and after locking
everything up securely, as was his habit,
he walked to the railway station.

When he entered the old, familiar card
room he looked with some anxiety to see
if his former intimates were in the game,
but in the six who were playing at his
favorite table there were only two whom
he knew--George Parker and Ben Davis.
They were both hearty in their greetings.

“Sit right down,” said Parker. “Mr.
Jones, Mr. Gilbert, Mr. Harris, Mr. Daven-
port, and Mr. Benton.” :

Jones bought $100 worth of chips. It
was table stakes, and the ante was $1, call-
ing $2.

Not for three long years had he had a
poker chip in his hand, and the familiar
touch of the smooth disks made his fingera
tingle as a glass of whiskey tingles on the

valate of the man who has sworn off fora
OnE period. As he shuffled the cards the
old fever came back on him.

At the start he had some little luck,
Without any notable struggle and with no
considerable hands against him he pulled
in three or four small pots, aggregating
some thirtv or forty dollars, when there
came a jackpot that had been sweetened
up to $35. The original pot was $14, and
there had been three PESO ES:

Looking at his hand he found a straight,
ace high; and as he sat at the dealer's left,
he opened for the amount in the pot. All
the others dropped but Benton, who had
been the largest winner up to that time: and
Benton raised him $35,

Jones's first impulse was to raise back,
but something in Benton’s manner gave
him the impression that a straight was
a doubtful proposition, 30 he merely made
good,

On the draw he stood pat, of course, and
was a little surprised to see Benton take
one ecard. Reviling himself then for not
having raised before the draw he threw in
a white chip. .

“I top you,” said Benton, and Jones
counted his chips. "

He had a trifle over $60 in front of him,
and he pondered awhile. [f Benton had
made a flush or a full, of course, he would
win, and it did not seem likely that he
would have raised on anything leas than
two pairs, but, on the other hand, he might
be bluffing on the chance that Jones had
stood pat on a weak hand.

“Anyhow, there was $235 in the pot, and
an ace high straight seemed worth a $60
call, So he called.

“I played for a straight flush,” aaid Ben-
ton, showing down, “and [ made a king
high flush.” ‘

from that time on Jones did not take
a single pot till he had bought his sixth
hundred dollars’ worth of chips

As he caine to the last blue chip of hiw
wixth hundred, he caught a pair of jacka
in a jackpot, and opened it for what he
had. No one came in against him and he
took the pot, On the next deal he took in
$12 a' don the next $18,

*Looks like the turn had come," he
thought to himself, and when he found
three aces in his hard on the next jackpot
he felt serenely confident

Ir waa opened before it
for $14, and he made it $28 Parker sat next
to him, and he made it $56. The operer
dropped and Jones stayed for his pile,
but Parker had a e#mall full and Jones
failed to better

His little flurry of luck was over, and his
seventh and eighth hundred went as the
others had, on a dreary succession of fairly
good hands beaten ard u tiresome chipping
of antes with no hands cons g

As he bought his last hurdred he felt

of that went in driblete without a single

winning. A single blue chip was all that

was left of the money he had stolen to

replace that which he had lost.

‘or a moment he wondered what he
would do when that was gone, for strange
to say he had not considered that question
before. It had seemed to him that he
must win. But now that the ‘thought
obtruded itself he turned resolutely away
from it.

“Time enough for that,” he said to him-
self, “when I am out of the game, I'm
in it, yet, and there’s always a chance

PRINCESS MOONLIGHT.

 

 

Origin of the Firefiles as It Is Related in
Japanese Folklore.

Ounce upon a time, many centuries ago, |

a woodchopper, returning at dusk from
his long day's labor, saw, as he passed
through the forest, a soft shining light
on a bamboo branch.

Surprised, he hastened toward it and
found there a tiny baby girl, surrounded
by a radiance like moonlight.

“Now this woodchopper and his wife
were often sad because they had no little
one of their own, and the baby was carried
to their humble home, where you may be
gure she had tHe most loving attention.

She grew rapidly, and the light that the

tage waa filled with its glow.

It even shone through the paper screens
that formed three of the outside walls of

the cottage—for all this happened in Japan, |

where the houses are inade of bamboo and
paper acreens. f ;
eople called the little girl by the pretty

name of Princess Moonlight, for, as they
saw the light about her increase, they
knew that ashe must be a moon child.

The woodchopper and his wife felt very
sad. They knew that it wae not often that
a moon child came to the earth, and that
when one did it was obliged to go buck to
Mother Moon when 20 years old.

Years passed, and Princess Moonlight,
now a lovely young woman, sat on the

veranda one dark sight, shedding a soft ,

light all about her.

tt happened that that very night the
Emperor and his cvurtiers were returning
from a day's «port in the forest. Afar
off (hey saw what seemed like moonlight,
and, filled with wonder, they went to sea
what it could be, fer the moon would net
be up for several hours

When the Emperor beheld the beautiful
maiden in the midst of the light he fell in
love with her at once, and begged her to
be his wife. Bui alas! though the Princese
loved him deariv she knew that she never
could be his Queen, and that in three daye
ahe must leave the earth forever

The Emperor wae filled with grief wien
she explained to him that she was a moon
child, apd he went his courtiers home, but
he stawed with the Princess, dreading to

leave her for even a single hour, knowing

how soon he must part from her fo er

So him brood ober it, till him call a meet -
ing ob all him frien’ and relation, an’ dey
