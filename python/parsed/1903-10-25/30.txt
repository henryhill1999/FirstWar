elephant Columbia has gone back

roo oba Colm ia is a gentleman elephant,

cthstanding hie name. Conev Island

preathes easier now that he has gone. How

tuba will receive him is a matter for apecu-
ation

if he were a man, Columbia would find
gi indictment for homicide awaiting him
ai Havana = In Cuba last summer he killed
WW. Goodrich, one of the owners of the
Quintard Circus, which got some notorie! y
from the troubles of Quintard and Mias

Bradley of Stamford, who afterward took
a financial interest in the show.

After killing Goodrich, Columbia was
brought to this country and exhibited
at una Park under the management of
Teny |.owando, who in his apryer days was
abarebacs rider of great renown.

Columbia kept things moving at Coney
faland. On one oceasion he broke from
jus moorings and asaulted the Luna Park
paint shop with variously decorative effects.
as he was led through Brooklyn yesterday
on his way to the Clyde liner Mexico, on
which he was to sail to Havana, the light
green stains of that jamboree were still
faintly vinible on his broad flanks.

Columbia was taken to Coney Island
with the idea that he would “do a turn”
with three trained lions. He seemed far
more anxicus to twist the tails of the lions
and step on their toes than to carry out his
part of the programme, and had to be cut
out of the performance.

After that he stood with hia forefoot
chained to a post and swayed and glared

vith his red pig eyes at folks who came to
stare at the “Horrible Mankilling Elephant.”
This was monotonous, When it was made
clear to him early yesterday morning
that the show was going to move Columbia
manifested perfectly intelligible glee. He
lifted his trunk and trumpeted his joy. He
slapped Tino, his diminutive bthiopian
valet, gently with his trunk. He kneaded
the earth under his feet most vigorously.

Duke, Wallace, and Brute, the lions,
lopsy, the trick donkey, ana kliiah Ii!.,
the goat, were all put in boxes and loaded
Hosa CONS, BOD WALD @1g@nt oF tel aba rie
unnamed dogs and miner goats. Sport,
Harry and Charlie, the horses, and Columbia
marched on foot behind.

fino found that he had his hands very
full with Columbia in his cheerful mocd.
Columbia long ago discovered that horses
are afraid of him. He went his ponderous
way down the street and as a horse wouid
rear and dance at sight of him, the brute
would veer over toward it. Then just as
he seemed likely to pass by safely, he would
tora his trunk in the air and let out a squeal
and a trumpet that might well have terrified

he steadiest atreet car nag that ever started
and stopped at the sound of the conductor's
bell There were four runaways and one
tip-over caused in thie way between Coney
Island and the Thirty-ninth street ferry

Once in the ferryhouse, Columbia became
very serious. Life wasn’t a joke any longer
He didn’t like that ferryhouse. Especially
he did not like the bridge from the house
\o the boat. He tried his weight on it
with one fore-fcet and then with the other.
Then he swung his trunk, caught Tire
hy the small of the tack, knocked him
half way acro#a the bridge and galloped
bubnely out into Thirty-ninth street and
iberty

He snorted his way along to Second
avenue and there created a wild jumbie of

itrucks. When it waa thoroughly mixed
> and the language of the chorus of truck
divers was almost loud enough to drown
‘is own trumpeting, he strode into the
middle of the mess, grabbed a horse by
bah hind legs and snorted with pure mis-
chief.

The horee rose up and tried to rear and
Columbia promptly yanked the legs out
from under him. For about two seconds
there was a maelstrom of horses, trucks,
drivers and cuss words. Then the tangle
broke and Columbia was left, swaying, ard
perfectly content, in the middle of the
street.

Tino came up and hooked on to his ear
and led him down to the ferry and aboard
the boat, meek as a Jamb. The beast made
one or two slight efforts to get the horses
on the ferryboat to jump overboard, but
the deckhands succeeded in preventing
it

 

 

On this side of the river Colum ia at once
hecame the centre of a great crowd. He
uid no attention to the commotion around
hh until he got to the corner of Pearl
street and Whitehall. There folks began
1» crowd him. He looked the crowd over
and sald something that sounded very
like a poticeman’s “G'wan!” Everybody
g'wanned. f :

Ignoring Tino’s efforts to start him again,
Columbia walked over to an elevated pillar,
took a squint at the structure above, knelt
down and twined his trunk around the Ree
Then he pulled and hauled most mightily.

“Gee!" chuckled Tino. “This ia my time
‘o laugh. The old fool thinks he can pull
the elevated down,”

The elevated did not come down and
Columbia arose with a sniff of disgust. He
didn't want to pull tbe old thing down,
anyway. He Just wanted to see whether
it was well built.

He sauntered on over to South street
and to Pier 16, where the Mexico was wait-
ing, and stood there patiently awaiting his
turn to go aboard, like the seasoned travel -
rr that he is. At a little after 12 he wa
ed up to @ great box that had been built
for him, entered it and surveyed the excite-
ment occasioned by his being hoisted to
the upper deck of the veasel with great
complacency.

High above the cheers of the folks on the
pier and on the decks of the Mexico, as
the ship swung out into the stream, could
he heard Columbia's farewell whoop to
American soil

ADA REHAN AND DALY ESTATE.

@bjection of the Actress te the Accounts
of the Exeouters.

Ada Rehan has made a number of objec-
tions to the accounts of the executors of
the estate of Augustin Daly, the theatrical
manager and her lifelong friend. A ref-
eree will probably be appointed shortly
to pass upon her objections, which affect
@ large part of the residuary estate.

Through her counsel, Wetmore & Jen-
ner, Miss Rehan saye that $10,000 ia not a
fair valuation for the contracts for the
American rights of the comedies, “Geisha,”
“Cirous Girl,” “Runaway Girl,” “San Toy,”
“Greek Slave,” aud “Country Girt,” all of
which Mr. Daly owned. She says the ex-
ecutors should have turned the contracts
into cash. Miss Rehan also saya that a
number of copyrighted plays should have
been sold instead of simply appraised at
$10,000 and she objects to the failure of
the executors to dispose of some $55,000
worth of British Consols belonging to Mr.
Daly, and of his interest in Daly's Theatre,
London.

Other items that Miss Rehan objects to
are the allowangea of a claim for $34,308
in favor of Mra, Daly; the payment of §43,-
499 to Mrs. Daly on account of the sale of
her husband's library, and the payment
of $26,200 in royalties to Mr. Daly's brother,
Joseph F. Daly. Miss Rehan also says
that she has been debited with $18,500 as a
part payment of her share in the estate,
whereas, she says, she merely purchased
that amount of.scenery and properties.

When Augustin Daly died on June 1, 1898,
his estate was much involved, and it was
thought when the appraisal waa com-
pleted, that there weuld not be enough to
pay all the legacies, which include several
to Roman Catholic and charitable _ insti-
tutions, There is, however, now in the
hands of the executors a cash balance of
$184,195. They have disbursed $367,802
and received $552,087. Miss Rehan still
has an action pending against the estate
to recover some $6,000 as lance of salary
due her by the testator.

 

 

CAMPING AT PROSPECT PARK.

 

Company F, Fourteenth Regiment, @ut for
Practice and Recruits.

Capt. Gustav T. Bruckman, commandant
of Company FE, Fourteenth Regiment,
N. G. N. Y., has eetablished an outpost
and recruiting tent in the rear of the Pros-
pect Park parade grounds, Brooklyn,
where he is giving his men practical il-
lustrations of a soldier's life--with the hope
that the young men who frequent the foot-
ball games, as well as the youth of Flat-
bush, may be attracted to the glories of
membership in the “Fighting Fourteenth”
and Company E in particular

Capt. Bruckman says that his scheme
is to give the members of his company
some experience of the practical side of
military life and to attract good material
into the company.

“We mean@¢go stay until the cold weather
makes it necessary to abandon the out-
post,” he said. “I believe in hustling and
making every man hustle. Company E
will have the kind of men who can care for
thernselves and who will need little or no
hardening should they be needed for-
service. As far as the recruiting is con-
cerned, we will take only the best materia),
and they will get right to work. We are
not going to stay in one place. After the
present location has been thoroughly can-
vassed we will pull up stakes and pitch
our tent in some other part of the city.”

“Are your men to cook their rations?”
was asked,

“If they don't they will go short—or
home,” was the curt answer

 

WANTS ELECTION CADI TO PAY

For Detatning Her Several Hours Because
She Had a Registered Lodger.

Gustavus A. Rogers, as counsel for
Mrs. Jeasie Dailey of 21 Delancey street,
served a summons yesterday upon Super-
intendent of Elections G. W. Morgan,
directing him to appear with his deputies
before the Supreme Cour , 80 that facts may
be ascertained upon which Mrs. Dailey may
base an action against Morgan for false
arrest and detention on Oct. 15 last

On that date she saya J. D. Maher and
Isaac Silverman, two deputies, went to
Mrs. Dailey's house to arrest one Heins,
who boarded there, They took Heins
with them, and also Mrs. Dailey, to Mr
Morgan's office, and there examined Heirs
concerning his residence at the house, He
was detained until 7 o'clock in the evening,
and meanwhile Mrs. Deriiey also was kept
waiting. A pocketbook whieh she had,
belonging to Heins, and containing only
some pawntickets, was taker from her by
Silverman, and afterward returned to
her when it had been examined. After
seme questioning she was allowed to go,
and she then determined to bring suit for
her detention

THE REAL ESTATE MARKET.
OUTLOOK LESS DISCOURAGING
RUT TRADING LIMITED.

lavestors Look for Dectining Prices, anid
Operators Mesitate to Renew Inter-
rupted Speculative Movements - Kast
ide the Only Seat ef Activity.

 

 

The situation in the realty market is
undoubtedly better than it was a short
while ago. The improvement, however,
has been in the matter of sentiment rather
than in actual business. The increase in
the volume of trading haa been incon-
siderable. Last week eighty-four sales
at private contract were reported, as against
seventy-eight the week before. The field
of activity also remains as narrow as it has
been for months past. The bulk of the
dealing continues to be in flate, tenements
and inexpensive dwellings. A few build-
ing sites are being sold for improvement,
chiefly with tenements, but the number is
below the average at this time of year.

Ot course, the improvement in sentiment
has hardly yet had time to express itself in
the way of a marked departure in trading.
At the same time, it is equally true that the
change in sentiment is based rather on a
feeling that something akin to a panic
has been avoided than that the old con-
ditions favoring speculation and invest-
ment have been restored. The public is
reassured that there is to be no collapse of
general industry, but the knowledge re-
mains that a readjustment of production
and prices is going on in many branches
of business which eventually is certain to
affect realty valucs.

In real estate, as in general industry,
there is a disposition to question the sta-
bility of existing prices. Investors are
critical, timid and hesitating. The number
of sellers hes increased, while buyers are
less numerous. Until recently the latter
were eager to purchase at market prices, in
the expectation that quotations would soon
be higher. At present purchasers have to be
persuaded that they are obtaining bargains
which will stand the test of less pros-
perous times. They are influenced both
by the belief that they may have to face a
decline of prices and by the conviction that
they may have difficulty in realizing on their
purchases, if need be, on a stagnant market.

Furthermore, while it may be disputed
that the real wealth of the country has been
materially affected by the great contraction
which has taken place in Wall Street securi-
ties, it is not open to question that the pur-
chasing power of investors in city real
estate has been reduced by many imillions
of dollars.

Professional operators are no less hesi-
tating and uncertain than the investing
public. It is felt that, except as regards
one class of realty, the continuity of specu-
lation has been broken. In the absence of
a further expansion of trede and industry,
there is no room for speculative buildin
in the mercantile districts. The demenc
for offices and lofts is already on the decline.
The preduction of apartment hotels and
expensive private houses has been in excess
of present requirements.

The latest slump in the stock market
left forty-seven new residences, valued at
$9,350,000, in the hands of their builders in
the Fifth avenue section between Thirty-
ninth and Fighty-ninth streets, while de-
pleting the source of possible buyers.
So seriously has the Purchasing demand
for high priced dwellings been affected
that many builders are offering their houses
for rent, although it is well known that,
once occupied, REvAg residences lose
much of their selling value. The apart-
ment house situation ia also by no means
encouraging. Many such houses, the com-
pletion of which hae been delayed by the
strike, will be opened in the course of the
winter, and their number will be sufficient
to satisfy the immediate need for that
class of housing. h

A vast amount of speculative capital
is tied up in the various kinds of new build-
ings mentioned— offices, lofts, apartment
hotels, apartment houses and private
dwellings. Meantime, the investing public
is not only much more critical, but less
able to buy than it was a faw months ago.
Professional operators consequently have
good reason to hesitate about resuming
speculative building in the neighborhoods
and along the lines recently exploited.

This would be so even if the price of build-
ing materials were not excessively high.
The cost of lumber and of brick particu-
larly, is practically prohibitive. The year's
output of brick in the Hudson River yards
has been reduced by labor troubles, and the
recent losses through rain and floods to
one-half the normal annual amount. The
price of many important materiais is un-
doubtedly falling, but builders are no more
eager than other producers to undertake
enterprises on a declining market for their
raw materials, i

Another factor which tends to obscure
the building outlook is the near completion
of the rapid transit road. What will be
the effect of the phen s of the subway on
the old centres of population? Will Wash-
ington Heights or The Bronx be the Prnee
seat of building ROLLY next year? Will
the bulk of the demand be for apartment
houses, flats, or small dwellings? These
questions will have to be settled before
speculative building can be reaumed on a
large scale, and they cannot be determined
for months to come Ff

The one clase of property in which the
continuity of speculation and investment
has not been severed by the developments
of last summer is that occupied by our
foreign colonies, The great bulk of the
population of Manhattan is housed east
of Broadway and Fifth and Lenox avenues,
The growth of population there has been
sufficient to defy the general influences
which have depressed realty elsewhere
In 1900 about 60 per cent. of the population
was housed in a territory comprising about
90 per cent. of the acreage of the borough,
and this district has received the greater
share of the increase of population through
immigration since then, j

The foreign immigration of the last few
veurs has profoundly affected realty values
throughout the whole of the East Side,
and the movement in tenements, flats
and inexpensive dwellings which has been
in progress there shows no sign of abate-
ment exeept south of Fourteenth street
The extraordinary activity. in Harlem,
which is the chief feature of the present
market, is explained to some extent by the
registration figures this fall, The bulk
of this increase in registration was in the
territory extending from 110th street to
the Harlem River. The increase in the
Twenty-third Assembly district, the heart
of Harlem, waa 18 per cent. as compared
with the registration of 100), That for
Manhattan and The Bronx. -the old ay
was lesk than 3 per cent. The Bronx dis-
triet adjacent to Harlem showed a growth
of 12 per cent. in the number of its regis-
tered voters
