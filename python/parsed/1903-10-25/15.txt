The autumn dressmaking season 1s in
full swing and a cursory view of shops
and warkrooms suggests an impending
epidemic of nervous prostration for both
the women who make the clothes and
the women who wear them.

have returned to town, and as a result
fashion models that had been held back
for the day of the most fastidious trade
are coming into view, and the season's
modes, purely experimental last month,
are gradually beginning to crystallize into
certainty.

Of course it is a foregone conclusion
that some novelties now finding ready
acceptance from the unwary will later
die of their own success and prove too

ie

The full skirt and the pelerine were fore-
shadowed by the late summer fashions,
but in both there are innumerable new
developments, and a host of ideas only
hinted at during the summer have found
striking expression now

Perhaps the most noticeable feature
of the new fashions is the emphatic insist -
ence upon the importance of the line That
ix, much intricate elaboration has given
place jong, sweeping lines, although
there is stil a wealth of elaboration in
certain details. Frills, flounces, shirrings,
_ are legion, but, on the other
smartest models

ruchings, &
hand, a majority of the

| turned out by the leading Frenc h makers,

 

show long straight skirt lines and flat hori-
zontal trimming at the bottom.
American women show a tendency to
rebel against the skirt fulness beginning
ut the very waistband, and to insist upon

    
 
 
 
 

the skirt yoke; but upon imported models
the skirt yoke is practically unknown,
and the canny woman will reconcile
herself to the fact In soft goods this ful-
nessa is not of necessity cumbersome, and
almost all the materials of the season,
with the exception of the mannish tailor
suitings, are soft.

The popular zibeline is the

possibly

 

greatest problem in connection with the
full skirt; for this |
elaborate frocks, and cannot, like the lallor

suilings, be made up with gored and flaring |

severity; yet, though soft aod pliable, it hes |

like a continuance of the circular upper
part, and the joining must be hidden by
trimming. This trimming must, of couree
be repeated lower or be a plausible part of
a whole skirt trimming scheme, so that its
real purpose will not be in evidence as it
would be were only the single trimming
line used

The double or triple skirt is another
method of achieving the skirt flare without
plain goring, and this mode will continue
ite popularity. In Paris, another skirt
model finding favor is formed by super-
posed folds, graduated from nine or ten
inches at the bottom to four or five inches
at the waist and sloping upward slightly at
the back. These folds are cut cireular
and laid on Sat, with only the upper edge
attached to a foundation

Similar in idea, though not carried to
such an extreme, is the well liked skirt with
close fitting cireular top whieh falls like
a deep shaped flounce or tunic over two or
three narrower circular flounces. The
edge of the wpper shirt and of the flounces
fs usually trimmed with a line of embroid-
ery, braid, lace or fringe, and in many cases
this edge has a waving line.

The straight full ekirt finished with deep
Paquin tucks at the bottom is considered
one of the best of the season's models for
woollens and the heavier silks and satins.

The skirt, whatever its model, save in the
caso of the trotting costume and the formal
evening frock must be round; that is, it
must be on the floor two or three inches at
front and sides and slightly more at the
back, but must have no train. This applies
even to the handsomest of carriage and
afternoon frocks, and even dinner and even-
ing gowns in many cases follow the rule,
although in such costumes the train is
correct.

The proper effect is obtained by standing
the wearer upon a book or block three
inches thick during tle skirt fitting and
making the skirt touch the floor evenly
at front and ides. The mode is an absurd
one, an uncomfortable one; but, as the
French dressmakers say with expressive
slioulder shrugs, “It is the mode,” and for
the woman of fashion that settles the mats

ter.
One word of warning is in order. This

in to give relief from the skirt fulness and
trimmed in some way down its sides. Sev-
era) examples of this skirt treatment are
shown among the sketches here.

One of the evening frocks grouped in the
large cut is of straw colored taffeta of the
new quality that is as soft and pliabie as fou-

 

lard. Its full akirt has a plain front breadth
spreading out fan-like toward the bottom
and bordered down its sides by bouillonées,
or puffing bands of the silk edged by tiny
frills of narrow cream valenciennes.

Frills of the lace are applied in festoon
design to the bottom of this front breadth.
The full bodice has ita décolletage finished
by a silk bouillonéa edged with lace. This
falls well off the shoulders and below it
is a particularly good arrangement of the
popular berthe.

It is of heavy lace and falls in a deep
point over the arma, reaching quite to the
elbow, but slopes up front and back until

skirt becomes absolutely unmanageable -

and without grace, unless well held out
from the feet; and this demands carefully
adjusted petticoats and a cleverly con-
trived and flaring drop skirt.

The dress skirt, if properly cut, will flare
at the bottom eo that it will naturally spread
out on the floor, but it will need assistance,
and the ailk drop skirt finished by one
plaiting just touching the floor—which is
still, for some inexplicable reason, the

average American dresainaker's idea of a
drop skirt—will not give this assistance

mousseline or chiffon which tbe Parisian,

tume’s color scheme and often wonderfully
lovely, are favorites, as are gun metal and
old silver buttons, the latter often veritable
works of art. Hand-embroidered buttons
may be bought in the shops, but are pref-
erably made to order to match the em-
broidery upon costumes.

Buttons of inlaid wood are novelties,
sometimes very effective, and huge fan
buttons are considered most chic upon
cloth garments trimmed or lined with fur.
The gold buttons trim dark wool frocks
effectively, and it is perhaps their popu-
larity that has led to the military fad.

Military collars appear upon many of
the suit coats and separate coate, and with
their dark velvet, narrow gold braid and
dash of some bright color they redeem
a dark coat from sombreness and give ita
touch that is becoming and youthful. Mil-
tary braiding and frogging are also used,
as are the cordeliéres.

The heavy cordeliéres of plated gold
which appear upon some military uniforms
are introduced upon a few of the imported
coate; but the idea is too extreme for good
taste and it is better to confine the mili-
tary suggestion to the dark braiding and
cords with gold buttons and a hint of fine

id at collar and cuffs.
ee cape coats of dark blue,
lined with gay color and having gold but-
tons and military collars, are fetching gar-
mente for certain kinds of wear, and will

 
 

 
 
  
 

be most attractive upon youthful wearers
when cold, gloomy days come.

There are, indeed, indications that we
are not to be afraid of bright coloring this
winter. The pastel shades will still be
used extensively, but for street wear many
of the more pronounced hues are gaining
favor, and touches of very gay reds, rose,
greens, blues and orange appear in trim-
ming.

Named in the order of thelr popularity
the favorite colorings are evidently to be
blue in all shades, but particularly in the
bluet shadings; browns, eenectally in the
castor, wood brown and mole shades; the
flowerlike purples gbluish reds and mauves,
the grays and certain bright soft greens.
The all black and all wiite frocks and the
black and white combinations retain their
vogue.

‘or evening wear pale straw oolor, often
in Youls XV. combination, with pale pink
and blue, pink mauve, and very delicate
blue, are especially favored, but all of the
light tints are acceptable and there la a
profusion of wonderful flowered effccts.

There is a decided impulse toward the
gatins, silks and velvet for evening wear,
and some of the models in these materiale
are lovely enough to tempt one to forswear
the dainty filmy chiffons and mousselines,
Not that the latter are out of fashion--far
from it. They are lovelier than ever and
are unquestionably more youthful than
the heavier materials.

On the other hand, the eilks, satins and
velvets are more duruble and newer, and
since they do not usually require the wealth
of, hand work Invished upon the sheer
stuffs, are, despite the cost of some of the
materials, not more expensive than the
elaborate frock of chiffon cr mousseline.

Chiffon velvet, which is as light and soft
as ciépe, in the delicate shades, makes a
most delectable evening frock when re-
lieved by touches of rich lace, and the plain
and broeaded silks are exquisite; but among
the new models the sotin dinner and even-
ing frocks are perhaps the most charming.
Satin, rich, yet falling as softly as orépe,
is chosen and ita lustre gives a marvellous
bloom to delicate coloring.

Jie material is ideal for the full skirt,
having body, yet falling in clinging, grace-
ful folds and gleaming with light and shade.
Appreciating this effect, the makers have
given to moat of the satin frocks straig!.t,
full ekirts, with some bottom trimming,
and have reserved the elaboration for the
bodice, which is largely contrived of lace
ohiffun and hand embroidery.

combined in efforta to bring about « re
vival of silk wearing, but various efforts
fell flat. Women would have none of
them.

Gradually, however, through the slow
introduction of Restoration, 1830 and
Svoond Empire modes, women have been
brought to the point ef capitulation. A
more general use of silk fe the next logics!
step in tashion’s march, and the French
dreesmakere are turning out meny eilk
and velvet frocks for street wear, reception
wear, carriage wear, evening wear.

Cloth is still very fashionable, but it does
not reign supreme, and the well dressed
woman will, this winter, walk in silk attire
where never before would she have dreamed
of wearing a silk frock. Even the quaint
silk and fur combinations of the 1834 period
are reappearing, and while the effecta
seem odd, one must admit that they are
charming.

There is, for example, an imported model,
for street wear, in Parma violet taffeta—the
soft, heavy, lustreless taffeta, whiah le
one of the manufacturer's triumphs. The
full, straight akirt is trimmed at the bottem
with two bands of ermine and the little
pelerine of silk is edged with fur and has
shaped fur epaulettes.

A high silk corselet mects the pelerine.
The yoke and deep cuffs are of Venetian
lace.
Another costume similar to this is in
changeable light blue taffeta, trimmed in
chinchilla. Other silk street gowns are
trimmed in cloth, and for these the shot
silks, with cloth trimming in one of the
shades in the silk, are considered particu-
larly amart.

Velvet alwaya lends iteclf readily to fur
trimmings, and, while fur trimmed street
costumes of velvet will not have the quaint
novelty of the silk frocks, they will be very
handsome and tremendously modish.

The chiffon velvet is a boon to dreas-
makers, and {is so easily manipulated that
it lessens greatly the difficulty of making
velvet frocks. As it does not crush and
rumple #0 disastrously as the old time silk
velvet, it is a comfort to the wearer as wel!
{a to the maker.

The fancy velvets are legion, and for
commoner wear velveteen and corduroy
will be very fashionable. Both of these
materials have bean improved in quality
until they bear little resamblance to the
earlier goods of the aame name, and a vel-
vetean frock may be made a genuine thing
of beauty and of fashion.

Ermine, miniver, white caracal, mole-
akin, mink, Persian lamb and beaver areal]
pressed into service for the trimming of

these silk street frocks, and if the mode is
accepted afternoon social functions, mati- |
nées, restaurant luncheons, &c., will show |
an entirely novel kind of costume this!
The imitation fur trimmings are {

winter.
also used, and although imitations are
usually objectionable, those of this season
are exceedingly clever.

Musquash, dressed and colored to mole- |
skin oolor, is almost as effective as mole- |

akin itself, and more durable, and the imi-
tations of ermine are remarkably good.
Imitation white caracal and black caracal
are hand embroidered and sold for band
trimming. Occasionally real furs are
treated in the same way, but this is done
only to order, and the trimming is, of
eourse, very expensive.

Bear cloth, a very long, straight haired
gibeliue, is liked for trimming and for
whole coats, boleres, &o. A curly, long
haired zileline, taking beatuiful sheen
and coloring, is used in the same way.

Innumerable braids, galons, motifs, pen-
danis, fringes, laces and banda are pro-
vided for trimmings, and there seems to
be no reaction as yet from the swaying
and pendent idea. Fringes of all sorts are
seen in the shops; but, as yet, are being taken
up slowly here, in spite of Paris approval.
Jet and paillette fringes are perhaps ac-
cepted more enthusiastically than any
others, and are much used with good effect
upon the all black, or black and white frocks,

One of the useful magpie gowns among
the models sketched here is carried out in
black tulle over a white silk foundation
and white chiffon veiling. The full skirt
is trimmed with inset openwork, black
paillette motifs in crescent shape, from the

lower curving edges of which hangs a line |
Correapond- |

of glittering paillette fringe.
{ng motifs are set around the shoulders of
the bodice, below a deep white lace yoke,

with the points touching, #o that the line |

ig unbroken.

Another blaok and white frock sketched
here is in the ever practical black chiffon
over white chiffon, which always forms a
charming dinner gown for an elderly woman
and may be fashioned into 4 most satla-
factory all around frock for a younger per-
son. This one model has inset white lace
upon its skirt and a deep lace berthe, while

the yoke and the voluminous plaited sleeves |

are of white chiffon.

A yoke dimer frock that may be worn
either décolleté or high is a useful posses-
sion, and this season the happy result is
achieved in some of the new models more
easily than by the usual guimpe method.

A yoke and collar closely fitting throat
and shoulders is finished around the bottom
with a deep berthe and worn over instead
of under the décolleté bodice. Tlis dows
away with the disjointed effect so often
visible where the bodice is worn over a
separate guimpe, and does not advertise
the yoke as a makeshift.

And, whilecombinatlon gowns are under
discussion, mention should be made of cer-
tain complete costurnes which, while their
initia) expense is great, cover so many needs
that they may in the end be economical.
One skirt suffices for the costume, but it
ia In the upper part of the frook that the
transformations occur,

Say, for example, that the skirt {sin mauve
broadcloth with trimming of dyed mauve
lace and deeper mauve chiffon velvet
There may be a bodice of the velvet trimmed

} in cloth and lace, or of cloth trimmed in

velvet and lace.

For house wear, when such a bodice would
be too warm, and for dreasier occasions is
a blouse of mauve lace or chiffon trimmed
in cloth and velvet. To this @ pelerine or
mantelet of the mauve velyet would be a
chic addition on certain occasions, and @
handsome coat of the cloth trimmed tn
velvet and lace will anewer a purpose for
which the pelerine would be Wadequate
With such a five plece costume one could
be ready for many emergencies, and many
such complete costumes have been made,
though of course the details vary
