can depend? Why experiment when
you can purchase from us the “OLD
RELIABLE” —world famous for ai.
most halt a century. Remember you
purchase a Piano for a lifetime.

HIS MUCH TRIMMED SUIT CASE.

 

A Drummer's Improvement on a Way

Some Tourists Have.

A new joke blew over from Jersey yee-
terday on a Pennsylvania Railroad ferry.
It was in charge of a young man whose
suit case and a quite obvious sample case
on the deck beside him proclaimed him to
be one of the great army of drummers.

The suit case was the joke. Its sides
and ends, its top and bottom were pasted
over with labels of every variety of size,
shape and color, and of such number as
to conceal the body of the case.

At a distance of thirty feet the conclusion
drawn from these decorations was that the
owner had travelled in every known country
of the globe and stopped at every cele-
brated hotel, or else he had bought the
whole lot of labels on Broadway; but on
closer view of the labels a certa in famil-
iarity of appearance struck the observer,
It gave rise to the feeling one has upon see-
ing a familiar face in a to Hebd unexpected
quarter, and the fooling fixed your atten-
tion until slowly the whole truth dawned
upon you.

Whatever your first cop iact ure had been
you involuntarily said; “Well, that’s one
on me,” for those labels were of beer, beer,
beer—nothing but beer of ever known
brew; domestic beer, imported beer; but
always beer, beer, beer. It made you
thirsty to look at it

When the full significance of the matter
had settled upon one Observer's mind, he
spproached the man, seeking information

Say,” he said, “where'd you et em?”

“All over, but mostly off bottles," was
the reply. “Where would you think?”

“It's a great gt  geywey How'd you
come bo int of of :

*Well, A'l) tell pH You know there's
two kinds of people who wear labels on
their grips One kind has really been
across wad, of course, there's bovbing erin
inal, but the wa he y keep otk king thom
labels in front of you when they yet back
the way they alwaye set their Bribe de wh
wo that the labels will show up well, makes
mae tied

“They're bad enough, bh
have got ‘em beaten to a pulp They ge
out and buy # ninety-@ight-cent grip and

y a dollar for lalele bo etlok op it Nhey're
be Jimit. But it don’t matter to ine whieh
class they reprement. I've 4 ‘am both
skinned forty ways. Am I right?”
