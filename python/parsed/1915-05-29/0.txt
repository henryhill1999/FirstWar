Thousands Dying of Hun-

President Wilson and the “watch-
fal waiting’ policy in Mexico have
come to the parting of the ways.

The President issued an appeal
yesterday to the American people to
contribute funds to the Red Cross for
the relief of the starving people of
Mexico,

This appeal was taken to commit
the Administration to the task of
feng that the food supplies reach
interior points whether or not the
warring factions are willing.

The President has two courses open,
It is believed, to recognize either Car-
ranza or Villa or intervention.

It was announced at the White
House that a statem« |. will be issued
ina few days which will carry warn-
ing to the factions in Mexico tit
they may expect action by the United
States unless conc¢‘tions are greatly
and speedily improved.

The Red Cross also issued an ap-
peal for funds and supplies as the re-
mit of reports from Consuls and
others of starvation in Mexico.

People are eating the flesh of mules
and other animals. Food riots are re-
ported in many cities, Unless some-

WILSON'S APPEAL FOR MEXICANS

WasuHiyoton, May 28.—"To the public:

“The American people, with characteristic Generosity and an {mpartial
spirit of brotherhood with al! nat.ons, have contributed liberally toward ||
the relief of the appalling suffering caused by the unprecedented war in IN
Europe. |

“There has now arisen a condition of equally great suffering and
need close to our own borders. Due to several years of internal dis-
turbance the unfortunate people of many parts of Mexico have been |
reduced to the verge of starvation and unless aid ‘6 |
die in great numbers for lack of food. }

“The American Red Cross ts ready to undertake relief work for the {|
benefit of the Mexican peopie. I appeal most earnestly to our people, =

rendered they may

therefore, to contribute both money and supplies of food to mitigate the
euffering and misery so close at hand. Ali contributions in money may
be sent to the American Red Cross, Washington, or to its treasurers.
Those who are able to contribute corn, rice, beans or flour are requested
to communicate with the American Red Cross headquarters, Washington,
for instructions.

BERNSTORFF ACTS.

 

Here for Reply to Note.

Wasninoton, May 28.—The bette?

| that the American steamship Nebraskan

was torpedoed was strengthened here
to-day with the receipt of an official re-
port asserting that the chief engineer of |

the Nebraskan had said without quall- |

fication that he saw the white wake of a
torpedo just before the

curred

With the probability that several days |

must elapse before, ali the facts are

definitely known regarding the Nebras- |

kan, offictals to-day were greatly In-
terested in reports from Berlin that the
German Government !s about to send its
reply to President Wilson's note and
that this reply is to be of a preliminary
and not a final character.

The reports that Germany wants to
have the facts in the cases of German
submarine and aerial attacks on the
American flag, American life and Amer-

ican property determined to the mutual
satisfaction of both Governments before

making her reply to President Wilson's
demands caused no surprise here. It
has been the expectation chat the Ger-

man answer woul’ drafted largely
with the purpose of engaging the United
States in a more or less protracted dis-
cussion of the issues Involved

While it is asserted that there need
be no fear that the Administration will
permit itself to become so entangled in
the intricacies of diplomatic correspond-
us to lose its power of action on the

ence
vital issues involved, it is pointed out
that Germany has a right to ask that

facts in the cases be determined to
satisfaction. It is asserted,
however, that even if a further note is
devoted to a setting forth of the facts
in all cases as this Government under-
stands them the United States will not
permit Germany to make this an excuse
for undue prolongation of the
spondence to the disregard of the very
clear demands made by President Wii-
son as to German submarine operations,
Questions as to whether these vessels
earrying contraband or not, or
whether they were armed or not will be
excluded from
of the cases so far as its demands for
yespect for the American flag and Amer-
ican lives are concerned,

It is asserted that the important point
to be kept always in mind is whether
Germany tntends for the future to re-
spect American rights as existing under
treaties, international law and the laws
of humanity. It is pointed out that if
Germany does conform tn the future to
the United States this
Government will be to a large degree
sutistied for We present.

In the reports of the last
however, little evidence is seen

With regard to the statement of Capt,
(ireene that he does not know whether
it was a mine or a torpedo that caused
the damage, it is pointed out that the
captain has said that he was in his
cabin at the time, so that he could not
have well seen whatever evidence of a
submarine or mine might have been
observable, It is now particularly de-

Ullery combat continues between our

between Lakes Idro and Garda, |

Notables of ‘Teazze in Val Sugana

ing sentiments of patriotism and the
devotion of the population.
