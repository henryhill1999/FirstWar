;Or men in khaki, soldiers who were

waiting for trains to take them away
from Washington. They formed two
lines through which the Presidential
party had to pass. P r “pleasent

please the President greatly, for he
smiled broadly, waved his hand and
shouted back “thank you" in a voice
that kept pace with the smile
