FATAL SPLOSION.

One Man Is Blown to Pleces and Two Are
Injured —-Sawemelll Demolished.

PATERSON, N. J., Noy, 10.--One man was
blown to pieces and two were severely in-
jured by a boiler explosion at the Riker
sawmill at Wanaque this morning, The
mill, a one story building, was completely
demolished, and what was left of the boi'er
was found 150 feet from the spot where the

mill had stood.

The explosion occurred shortly before
7 o'clock. Josiah Riker, who owns the mill,
was preparing to put his men to work and
was talking to the foreman, Daniel Beattie,
when the explosion took place, Beattie's
body was torn to shreds, ftiker and Joseph
Retmer, a workman, who had just entered
the mill, were blown fifty feet to the op-
posite side of the road. Besides nue
from flying projectiles, both were badly
scalded by steam and hot water.

No one knows the cause of the explosion,
but it is supposed that some dynamite
used for blowing out stumps of trees was
stored in the sawmill and was discharged

CALDWELL PORTRAIT DOWN,

Picture of the Marquise de Merinvi
of the Catholic University.

WASHINGTON, Novy. 10.—The board of
traisiees of the Catholic University held its
last meeting yesterday, when they hung
a portrait of Cardinal Martinelli in the
main parlor of Divinity, or Caldwell Hall,
The portrait was hung in a spot previously
occupied by that of Miss Gwendolyn Cald-
well, now the Marquise de Merinville. The
portrait was taken down at the urgent
request of her friends and was sent to her
home at Lakewood, N. J., where she now
is in a serious condition of health.

The removal of the portrait was made
reluctantly by the trustees and no dis-
cussion of the Marquise and her withdrawal
from the Catholic Church was indulged in
at the meeting, An expression of &ympa-
thy was made by all the trustees for her
and her condition of almost total blindness
and approaching deafness. No action was
taken with regard to the changing of the
name of Caldwell Hall, and none will be
unless the request comes from the legal
advisers of the Marcuise.

Caldwell Hall was built and presented to
the university by the Marquise before her
marriage, She presented the portrait of
herself later, to be hunuginthe parlor, ‘This
is the portrait which created much com-
ment because of the décolleté gown in
which the subject was painted, On the
morning after it was hung the good fathers
in the university were astonished to see the
bare neck and arms of the donor properly

WHY NOT STICK TO THE TRUTR.

 

Election Excitement Responsible for a
Fine Crop of Lies.

The report that Mr. Hearst caused scores
of thugs and repeaters to be brought on
from San Francisco and Chicago to Coney
Island and other districts of the Borough
of Brooklyn, and that the returns from
those districts were held back on election
night in order to make a bigger Hearst
showing, is found on investigation to be
untrue.

The statement, widely printed, that four
ballot boxes were taken from voting places
or police stations and thrown into the

| North River is found on investigation to be

 

|

; Director

untrue,

The assertion that ballot boxes were
burned by Tammany heelers and those
interested in the election of Mr. McClellan
has no foundation in fact whatever.

The published reports that repeaters
were brought from New Jersey, Connecti-
cut and other States and paid $5 for every
time of the fifteen or twenty times they
voted the Tammany ticket have been inves-
tigated and found to be false.

The averment that seals were broken and
ballot boxes tampered with in police stations
is found on inquiry to be untrue,

It has been stated that blue pencils in-
stead of black ones were placed in some
booths in order that ballots marked there-
with would be invalidated, Careful inquiry
by Tue Sun's reporters fails to discover a
single case of this sort.

The story that ballot boxes were st uffed to
any degree is proved untrue by the fact that
the vote on Tuesday was entirely normal.
Any extensive ballot box stuffing or any ex-
tensive fraudulent voting would have
affected the total vote and made it more

} than normal,

TWO NAVIES MEET AT TABLE,

,APOLIS ALUMNI ENTERTAIN
THE VISITING BRITISHERS.,
Informal Affair, With Lots of Noise From
Youngsters: of Both Fleets—Friendly
Talk From Prince Louls, Who Is Also
Moved to Sing—Miss Gould Cheered,

 

The Alumni Association of Annapolis
entertained the officers of the British fleet
at Delmonico's last night, This was purely
a service banquet; with two or three ex-
ceptions every man present had been
sworn into one service or the other, Half
of them were in uniform, and the scene was
almost as picturesque as was the British
banquet of the night before. Miss Helen
Gould, by special invitation, sat in the gid
lery with Mrs. Wade and Mrs. McAlIpin,

wives of Commander Wade and Gen,
McAlpin. In the tail of the evening Miss
Gould) got a heavy ovation and three

rousing navy cheers,

Every British officer was there except
the five or six necessary to keep house on
ship—every one from the Admiral
down to the latest little middie, whose
paten® lepther shoes hardly reached the
floor and who was having a hard time with
his black cigar, These younger fry were
in the back of the room, mixed with the
middies and lately appointed ensigns of
the American fleet, From this end of the
room radiated the cheerful noise of song
and clinking of glasses all the evening long.

They called themselves the “Fourth
Ward,” these navy boys. As the evening
wore away they took to giving the navy

else

i yell, to the wonderment of the British

officers.

“Really, quite unusual, you know,” said
a British marine officer, “but quite chah-
ming, nevertheless,”

Everything quite formal. Prince
Louis and his officers had come only in
half dress; there were no speeches; and the
small fry were allowed to lift up their
voices and sing whenever they felt like it,
Admiral Coghlan told some of Ws old
stories and paid his compliments to matri-
mony, and Gen, Horace Porter broughy
down the house by his narrative of the
time when he went to sea in the civil war,

Even Prince Louis, who is always ner-
vous before a speech and sad afterward,
appeared very much at his ease now that
he was facing men of his own profession.
He gave an easy and friendly talk upon the
American navy, Annapolis and his hopes
for international friendship.

Along in the tail of the evening Com-
mander Aaron Wade made a few remarks
appertaining to the girls they had left be-
hind them. He happened to glance up
toward Helen Gould, and the “Fourth
Ward” caught the idea.

The yell leader, an ensign off the Maine,
whooped bis wild middies to their feet
and they let out the old siren yell, with
“Miss Gould! Mrs, McAlpine!” at the end,
Miss Gould smiled, bowed and, blushing
a little, stepped over to the orchestra.
The leader struck up “Auld Lang Syne."
The guests rose, joined hands about the
tables and sang it witha will, the ladies
leading. Even Prince Louis sang, and this
is said to be the first time that he has lifted
his voice in melody since he struck our
shores.

At the end of the song the “Fourth Ward"
gave another yell for the Royal ‘Navy,
and the British applauded.

Gen. Wade spoke for his branch of the
service and rubbed it in a little over foot-
ball. Bob Evans gave a short and snappy
grow! of welcome. Rear Admiral Browne
son spoke for the Naval Academy, and Mr,
Loyal Farragut gave a few reminiscences
of his father.

Col. Robert M. Thompson presided.
