the contrary notwithstanding.”

This amendment will be supported by
the National American Woman Suffrage
Association, and the fight will immedi-
ately be begun all over again. Mre. An-
toinette Funk, the lawyer of the Con-
gressional Committee of the National Suf-
frage Association, made the following
Statement regarding the new proposition:

“Every equal suffragist, of course, hoped
that the amendment for full suffrage
might have been favorably considered at
this session of Congress. Such hope can-
not be realised largely because of thu
constitutional squeamishness of certain
Senators and Representatives.

“But we want Federal legislation, and
the new amendment cannot fall to find
favor with the most carping proponent
of the doctrine of State rights, because
each State legislation gives in its last
analysis to the voters of that State the
right to pass upon whether women should
have equal political rights with men.

“If this resolution is adopted the many
and irksome legislative barriers will bo
removed, and the people will vote directly
for or against this proposition”

Lonvon, March 19.—Information which |
has reached the London office of Tue
Sun from responsible sources would
seem to suggest that the Washington
Government might be interested tn!

 

 

Mr. Vopicka was sent to the Balkan |
States as the United States official repre-
sentative handicapped not only by lack of
previous diplomatic experience but by a
name which wouldn’t guarantee hig en- |
trance to court circles in any of the |
States to which he {s accredited. The
Washington Government, it has been |
learned, was notified of this fact when |
Mr. Vopicka was suggested as successor
to Minister Jackson. But what is a name |
of approbrium in the languages of the|
near East ts of suffictent dignity in Eng- |
lish, it seems, to be not at all out of |
place with the prefixed title “Minister.”

The instructions which Secretary of |
State Bryan sent to Mr. Vopicka to pro- ,
ceed direct to his post after he had de- |
livered an offensive speech at Prague, |
Bohemia, apparently have had little or |
no effect, for the behavior of the Minister |
since he has taken over his post has
staggered the diplomatists of other na-
who are constantly wondering

|“what Vopicka is going to do next.” |

Mr. Vopicka who owes his appointment |
to Senator J. Ham Lewis, was a brewer |

Garenwicu, Conn., March 19.—When

Yilliam Anthony, a Greenwich contractor
and town official, arrived ‘m his home tn
Brookridge Park this afternoon his wife
did not come to greet him as usual In-
stead Mr. Anthony found a note lying on
the hall table and signed by his wife.

Mrs. Anthony in the note said that she
realized she was becoming a burden to

|showed no appreciation of his position legs refused to carry her about to do her

as a Minister of the American diplomatic |
service. He talked freely and candidly |
and made some criticisms of Emperor |
Francis Joseph of Austria. The speech
was such an extraordinary one that the |
American Consul-General at Prague sent |
a cable despatch to the American State
Department calling attention to !t and in-
timating that it was calculated to of-
fend a friendiy foreign Power. The story

Mr. Anthony did not finish reading the
note but rushed upstairs. The door to,

tub. Looking into the tub he saw his

rushed to the point where the launch

About twenty bodies were recovered

The Cardinal Patriarch of Venice, who
hastened to the scene, gave absolution

At Bucharest, where Mr. Vopicka |
makes his headquarters, the stories of |
his doings are reported to have caused
Queen Elizabeth ("Carmen Sylva") to
remark to one of her {ntimates: “The!
American Minister, I am told, ie a very
curious person.”

At Sofla Mr. Vopicka drove up to the
palace tn a state carriage in all the for-
mality with which the arrival of a new)!
Minister is acgompanied. He said to an
American acquaintance as he got out of
the carriage, pointing to the soft shirt
he wore: “That shirt cost me $12. I wore |
{t when I saw King Charles and King
Peter, and now I am wearing it to see
Ferdinand.”

Mr. Vopicka was then carrying his cre- |
dentials wrapped up in a emall silk Ameri-
can flag, in which he presented them to
King Ferdinand.

The story of the rest of that audience |
is almost incredible, but the correspondent
of THe SUN js agsured that Mr. Vopicka!
adopted a familiar, confidential tone, say- |
ing in effect to King Ferdinand: }

“I have met Kings Charles and Peter}
and understand that there has been some!
difficulty in the Balkan Bytes. If there;
{e any more trouble come to me. I think
I will be able to arrange matters.”

Even less pleasant is the story that
Queen Eleanora of Bulgaria, who is soon
to pay a visit to the United States, hav-
ing suggested that she would take Mr.
Vopicka on a visit to the hospitals, in
which she is very deeply interested, sent
an equerry to ask the American Minister
to appoint a day on which he would ac-
company her. Mr. Vopicka replied that!
he was unable to name a day at the
moment, but that he would telephone

proposed visit was naturally cancelled, as
it is not customary for royalty to await)
the pleasure of even diplomatic represen-
tatives. The admiration of the Bulgarians
for Mr. Vopicka was not heightened when.
they learned that he saw the new year,
in at a prominent beer hall tn Sofia.

The discussions between Mr. Vopicka
and hie private secretary, Mr. Kendricks,
over matters have become almost a mat-
ter of common gossip. An Englishman
who told the story to the correspondent
of Tur Sun had the misfortune to be}
called in as arbitrator between the two
men.

Wasuinaton, March 198.—-No copy of
the speech supposed to have been de- |
livered by Minister Vopicka at a dinner
in Prague while the diplomatic officer
was on his way to Bucharest has ever
been received at the State Department.
In fact, 1t was learned to-day that the
State Department recently received from
the Minister a report in which he denied
that he ever had made such a speech
as was attributed to him and which was
understood to have led to the State De- |
partment ordering him to proceed to hia |
post without further delay. .

The understanding here had been that |
the American consular officer at Prague |
reported on the fact of Mr. Vopicka's |
speech which resulted in the telegram |
from the State Department instructing
the new Minister not to linger longer on
the way to his post.

Vopicka speech brought from Hecretary |

“The rolling prairie between the 40th.

is folded in loving embrace by the limpid

recurring miracle of the rebirth of nature,
till that perfect season in the middle |
West known as the Indian summer, when |
the ‘frost is on the pumpkin and the

the young man who insulted Father
Magrath’s sister In Charles street on the
evenine of Sunday, March 8. He has
been found, but through the intercession
of hia mother he {s spared from the shame
of arrest and the priest himself will help
the boy to keep his promise of decency
hereafter. ‘

The story of Miss Charlote Magrath—
how she and a girl friend were waylaid by
tipsy youths and were saved by a big
driver who ploughed into the gang and
waa terribly beaten, and how the priest
and his sister and the men of the Catholic
Seamen's Mission and police detectives
have been hunting the gangsters day and
night—has been told In Tus Sun.

Father Magrath heard the telephone
bell in his study ring at 8 o'clock last
night. John J, Barclay of 49 Chariton
street said over the wire that he had tm-
portant news and asked Father Magrath

to walt for him.

In a few minutes Barclay entered the
study with a gray haired woman dressed
and velled in black and a girl of 17, her
daughter.

“Father,” began Mr. Barclay, “T've Just
learned who it was that insulted your
sister, I know him and his family.
They're respectable. He !s 22 years old
and has a good job. Thia lady is his
mother, She has come to talk to you.”

Boy In Penfitent.

The woman lifted her veil. She seemed
About 55 years old. The priest eilently
listened to her story.
with four children, she sald. When she
mentioned her name Father Magrath rec-
ognized it as that of a bey who in an-
‘other quarter had been named as Miss
Magrath’s assailant. This boy is the
family’s main support. ©n Monday, the
day after the attempted assault, he read
Tus Sun story and disappeared. He re
turned home yesterday. He was deeply
penitent and near a breakdown from
worry.

He confessed to his mother that he was
the boy Father Magrath was looking for,
that he had got drunk for the first time
in his Hfe and while roaming Greenwich
Village with companions had seen Miss

Magrath and been guilty of conduct >
which he regretted bitterly. At the end
of his confession he said to his mother:
“Now what am I going to do”

“Go right to Mr. Barclay and tell him
everything,” she answered.

Mr. Barclay has been for years a

friend of the widow and her children.
The young man repeated his confession
to Mr. Barclay and the visit to the priest
was the next step.

Mise Magrath Yields.

After hearing all this and observing
the mother's demeanor Father Magrath
sald he was satisfied to let the matter
drop, but was not sure about his sister,
He called Miss Magrath into the
ference from her home at 16 Van Ness
place. At first ehe was disposed to con-

tinue the search on her own account, but |
the mother’s story won her as it had her |

brother.
Father Magrath did some telephoning

!
and presently the party In his study was)

enlarged by the arrival of Police Inspec-

tor Wakefield and men of the pricst’s|

mission flock. Father Magrath told them
of his decision and what caused it and
asked the {tnspector to take the two war-
rants back to the Magistrate who signed
thern, Miss Magrath clapped her hands,
the stevedores roared “You're always
right, father,” and the mother of the’
boy put away her handkerchief.

The mother promised that tn a few
days her son would call on Father Ma-
grath, who in turn said he would look

after him and help him keep his Promise |

to live straight.

The boy lives south of West Houston
street and therefore is not a Greenwich
Villager.

“I knew nobody in Greenwich Village
would try to harm my steter,”” said the
fighting priest.

WASHINGTON, March 19.-—-It became

of the new battleship Texas, guilty of
conduct unbecoming an officer and a gen-
tlernan in attacking J. Philip Kiesecker, a
citizen of Newport Newa,

The court sentenced the officer to the

 

loss of five lineal numbers and a public)

reprimand. but a majority of the court
recommended that the Secretary of the
Navy exercise his executive clemency.

Lieutenant-Commander Huff's difficulty
began when he objected to the manner in
which Kiesecker was dancing with Mra

Spectal Cable DespatcA to Tue Scw

LonpoNn, March 20.—The refusal bp
Bonar Law, the Unionist leader, and Sir
Edward Carson, leader of the Ulster
Orangemen, to accept the Premier's pro-
posal In regard to Ulster and the latter
refusal to make his proposals more
definite or to agree to a referendum, has
produced, for the time being anyway, @
situation which, as described by the
Unionists papers, looks extremely dunger-
ous

Jeifast is reported to be in a ferment
and !t ls declared that only the smallest
spark is necessary to set the Orange dis-
tricts of Ulster ablaze. The departure of
Sir Edward Carson and Mr. Moore, M. P.
for Belfast, last night ts ascribed to thelr
recognition of the danger and the neces
sity to curb the angry enthusiasm of their
followers.

There should doubtless be a consider-
able discount tn interpreting the Untonist
predictione and fulminatitons, but !t is un-
deniable that the whole position ts one of
extreme tension. Reports from Untontst
sources in Belfast declare that !t Is abso-
lutely certain that the Government is pre-
paring to coerce Ulster by military occu-
The movements of certain regi-

| ments are specified with other detalls, tn-

of the common, 21 2-3 per cent.

cluding an unconfirmed statement that the
Government has secured a camping
ground for a large force in Hannahstown,
on the outskirts of Belfast.

Report of Pending Arrests.
The temper of the Orangemen has been
further aroused by reporte that twenty-
elght warrants have been issued for the
arrest of minor leaders of the Wster
Unionists, and although this and another

rumor that Sir Mdward Carson and the
other big leaders are to be arrested are
known to be Inaccurate, {t te declared

that the list of twenty-eleht ls made out
and only awaits an executive order. The
Unionists say that the first arrest will

start a civil war Immediately

Winston Churchill's speech eat Brudé-
ford last Saturday in which, among other
things, he accused Str Edward Carson
of treasonable conspiracy, !s largely rr
sponsible for the increase of anger in
Ulster, and this has been strengthened
by several local ine!dents Sir Edward
Carson on leaving London for Ulster last
night, said to an interviewer “My place
is now with my people,” and {f this may
be interpreted to mean that his presence
{is needed to calm the hotheads never
spoke @ truer word

Capt. James Craig, M P #nother
Orange leader, who went to Belfast on
