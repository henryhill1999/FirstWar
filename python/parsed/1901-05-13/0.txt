iG HURT IN TROLLEY WRECK

CAR JUMPED TRACK AT FOOT OF A HILT.
NEAR LEONIA, N. J.

 

 

Motorman Says the Brakes Didn't Work, and
Passengers, Who Were Thrown From the
Car and Ptled on Tep ef Each Other,
Say the Car Was Going at High Speed.

Sixteen Sunday pleasure seekers were
taken to the Englewood Hospital as the
result of an accident to a three-ton open
trolley car that rolled over on them and
blocked traffic on the New Jersey and Hud-
son River Railway Company's tracks at
Leonia yestorday afternoon. No one was
fatally hurt and only one person sustained
broken bones, although the possibilities
for a serious accident were great.

The accident was at 4:30 o'clock. The
New Jersey and Hudson River Railroad
Company runs the trolley road and also
operates the Fort Lee ferry, carrying
passengers to Englewood and as far as
Hackensack. The trolley road, starting
at the Fort Lee ferry, climba the Palisades,
makes long loops around the ridges of the
cliff and then runs along the top of the
Palisades. The cars are run tn two seo-
tions, and travel-on standard weight gauge
rails laid on ties, The oars make a speed
of alxteen miles an hour and the road goes
mostly through woods,

The oar that was wreaked was the first
one of the section. It seated eighty-four
passengers and there were ninety-seven
aboard. It ran through the vilinge of
Port Lee and down through Leonia, There
ts a steep hill here, at the bottom of which
there is a sharp curve where the road turns
to the right to Englewood. It was at this
ourve that the accident oocurred. The
front truck of the car took the ourve all
right. The rear truck did not, Tho body
of the car ts attached to these trucks by
steel kingpins, 1% inches in diameter.
When the fear truck went off the track
the body of the car ralsed itself, pulling
out the kingpins. The rear truck went
off into a fleld a short distance and the car
turned completely over on {ta side,

Some people who were on the right side
of the car jumped off. Those on the left
side were thrown on the ground and the
passengers jammed on top of them, As

the car only dragged a few fect the people |

who were caught on the bottom were in-
jured by the others being piled on top of
them.

General Manager Bacon said that the
oar was equipped with three brakes, a hand
brake, a power brake and an electrio brake,

With several others, were sitting with our
backs to the motorman. I was sitting with
my little girl, and my boy was standing in
front of me. We were going at a very high
rate of speed. The moment the car struck
the curve my little boy shot right out of the
oar as if he had been shot out of a gun, and
ho landed at what seemed to be a distance
of thirty feet from the car. Luckily, he
struck on his shoulder and was not badly

Mr. Robinson also satd he heard that the
motorman lost control of the car because
the brake chain brolce,

Another passenger was Arthur 8, Stone,
a wholesale fruit merchant at 270 Wash-
ington street, who lives at 280 West 122d
street. He was cone near the middle
of the car with bis wife and twelve-year-
old boy Artbur, Mr. Stone was badly cut

be seen for bandages and court plaster,
Mrs. Stone and the

Mr. and Mrs. A. N. Whitesell of 400 West

the car, It was said at their home last
night that Mrs, Whitesell was delirious

ying at her house, were on the car.
radford’s face was badly cut.

Mr. von Gontard was thrown violently
against the standard at the end of the seat
and struck on his hip. The ambulance
surgeon said that Mr, von Gontard would
have been jously infured if it had not
been for a fat pocketbook that he had in
his hip pocket

The car behind the one that was wrecked,
but which was in the same section, was
stopped by the emergency brakes just be-
fore the curve and at about a car's length
from the wreck, There is quite a settle-
ment near where the accident oocurred
and @& good-sized crowd quickly gathered
which was increased by the passengers of
other cars,

The line on which the accident occurred
has been in operation about flve years.
There have been three other accidents at
this corner, but none of them has been as
serious as the one of last night.

MRS. M’KINLEY IS ILL,

PRESIDENT GOES WITH HER TO SAN
FRANCISCO AHEAD OF SCITEDULE.

 

 

Sho Will Rost at the Residence of H. T. Scott
~Tour Will Not Be Abandoned Unless Her
Condition Becomes More Sorious—Prest-
Gent May Rejoin the Party at Santa Crez
or San Jose for To-day'’s Ceremonics.

DELMONTE, Cal., May 12.--Because of the
continued ill health of Mrs. McKinley the
President decided to-day to accept the
suggestion of Henry T. Scott of the Union
Tron Works, who is travelling as a member
of the President's party, to proceed imme-
diately to San Francisco, Early this after-
noon the President, accompanied by Mrs,
McKinley, Dr. and Mrs. Rixey, Secretary
and Mrs, Cortelyou and Mr. and Mrs. Scott,
went on board the private car Olympia,
which was detached from the special train,
and left for San Francisco. The intention
Was to go immediately on arrival to the
residence of Mr. Scott, which some time
ago was placed at the disposal of the Preni-
dent and Mrs. McKinley for their visit in
San Francisvo

According to the schedule of the Presi-
dent's tour the party would not have arrived
in that city until Tuesday, but it was deemed
prudent to have Mrs. McKinley go there
at once in order that she might have com-
plete rest and quiet in a private residence
until she is recovered from her
indisposition.

Tast night there was some alarm re-
garding her condition. The excitement
of the President's journey had caused some
fatigue, and it was apparent a week ago
that she would be obliged to forego some
of the special functions arranged in her
honor by the ladies of several cities and
towns along the way. Her weaknees was
aggravated several days ago by the appear-
ance on one of her fingers of a feion that

lancings and

present

subsequentiy required three
brought on a low fever.

Mrs. McKinley's stateof health has led
to some serious consideration of the wis-
dom of abandoning the rest of the Presi-
dent’s tour. Unless there should be an
alarming change for the worse, however
the programme arranged for San Francisco
next week will be carried out

All the members of the Presidential party
except those mentioned are etill in
monte and the President's special train is
here. The plan was to go to Santa Cruz
and San José to-morrow, a visit to the Big
Trees being on the programme attheformer
place and agroat flower carnival at the

latter, This plan will notbe abandoned
; unless word should he recelyed that Mra
MeKinioy's condition ia alarming, and

| this is not looked for. If ler health per
roite, Mra, McKinley will meet the party
in Santa Cruz or San José to-morrow, but
if he prefers to ramain by her side, Secre-
tary Hay and the other members of the
Cabinet will visit the intermediate places
| and rejoin the Prosident to San Francisco
Among the friend4 and associates of the
President in the party there is a disposition
| to believe that with complete rest for tho
few days Mrs. McKinley

recover her normal

will ra

health, and she will

 

‘ next

'
] be eager to make the rest of the Journey
’ Should she be unable to do eo, the Preside nt
will, of couree, abandon the tour north and
} enst of San Francisco and the special train
| I! return directly to Washington, Tha
stay in San Francisco will be a week long,
| and Mrs
good rest
It is pointed out by the elose friends of
the President and Mrs. MeKinley that her

health is not now worse than it has been on

w

several occasions during the laat two or
three years, and that she does not sulfer
nearly 60 much from the fatigue of trav-
eliing aa might be aupposed. Although an
invalid, it ia well known that Mrs. McKinley
is what is known as a “good traveller,” and
there ia no doubt among her friends that
she is as confortable now aa if she were
in her own *partmenta in the White Louse

San Franciaco, May 13. — President
McKin!ey’s apecial reached here just before
4oclock, Great care was taken to prevent
people along the lina from learning that the
President was on the special, No stops
were made, and the train came 100 miles in
three hours, When San Francisco was
reached closed carriages were in waiting
and the party was driven rapidly to the
residence of Henry T. Scott, where Mrs
McKinley was taken to a room that had
been prepared for her several days ago.
Mr. Scott moved to Burlingame last week,
ani arranged to let President McKinley
and his wife occupy his home during their
stay here ao they could secure the utmost
privacy. The house is detached and over-
looks a pretty park. Here Mra. McKinley

+} at once felt the good results of quiet, and

| pp Rixey waa much gratified over her
| jramediate improvement The excitement

and fatigue of receptions in many cities
brought a nervous collapse, and while Mra

Mckinley is very feeble, Dr, Rixey says

| ahe will soon recover with perfect rest

DR. PEARSONS CUTS OFF THE EAST.

 

Will Give No Share of His Millions to Inatita-
tions Not West of Chicago.

Cuicaco, May 12.--After a tour of the
Weat, including visits to several colleges
which had been the objects of his bene-
factions, Dr. D. K. Pearsons returned to
Chicago yesterday and announoed that
he had drawn a line through Chicago and

| had cut off everything and everybody
east of that line from any share in the money
he atill expects to give away. Dr. Pear-
| #ons's statement was drawn out partly
| by the visit of a trustee of Middlebury
|to tin in Vermont. The trustee went
|

 

to Hinsdale yesterday to seck an addition
to his endowment fund, He found Dr
| Pearsons transferring a coop of spring
| chickens to another corner of his back
yard,
| Dr. Pearsons showed the Middlebury
| trustee around his yard and pointed out
his fruit trees. After they had talked
about the chicks and the weather for an
| hour, the Vermont man said he had come
to ask the doctor for a contribution. Then
Dr. Pearsons grew cold.
| “You are a rich college,” he said, “and
I am not going to give another penny to
anything east of Chicago.”
“But Vermont is your

“IT came back from Missouri with my

evening, “If have drawn a chalk line north

line—the Atlas—plying between New York
and the West Indies.

rhe deal was put through in thiscity on
Saturday by Managing Director General
Albert Ballin of the Hamburg-American
Ling and Mr. Fleming, repreeonting the
London firm of Leech, Harrison & Kellock,
owners of the Atlas Line. The Ham-
burg line has bought for not less than a
million dollars, it is said, the fleet of the
Atlas Line, consisting of the steamship
Altai, Adirondack, Alleghany, Alps, Andes,
Athos and Alene, aggregating 18,000 tons.

the Hamburg Iine now has 120 ocean-
going vessela of 630,000 tons. Mr. Emil L.
Boas, the general manager of the line,
confirmed yesterday the report of the
purchase of the Atlas fleet.

He surmised that it might interest Eng-
lishmen more than Americans. He said
the Ine would be continued under its for-
mer agents at this port and that the ships
would dock, as usual, at the foot of Twenty-
fifth street, North River

Under the Gerinan law the commanders,
chief officers and chief engineers of German
veasela must be Cerman citizens, 80 it is
likely that at twenty-one Britons

| Says the Panic Here Was tho Result of a Con-
certed Ratd, Not of the N. P. Fight-—John
W. Gates Plays Golf With J.J. Mitchell, Who
Wont Talk About Chicago Elevated Deal,

 

Everybody is usually long on stock ru-
mors at the Waldorf on Sunday. Yester-
day, however, was a quiet day. The great
army of small traders who are wont to
gather there on Sunday afternoons for
meditation and stock jobbing purposes
went fishing or elsewhere. James J. Hill,
who expected on Saturday to be out
of town over Sunday, dropped in in
the afternoon and dropped right out again
because he said the place was 80 lonesome.
John W. Gates, J. J. Mitchell, President
of the Llinois Trust Company of Chicago,
and some other Chicago men spent the
afternoon on the golf links of the Country
Club at West Chester. James R. Keene
; Was at home in the evening in his suite on
the eleventh floor and received a SUN mag,

“How about the London situation, Mr.
Keene?” was asked. “Is there going to be
' @ panic over there to-morrow like the one
| we had here on Thursday?”

“Panic about what?” asked the great
!apeculator. “Why should there be a panic?”

“Despatches received a New York yester-
day afternoon said that theré was a big short
| interest in Northern Pacifle in London, and
that ua meeting of the Executive Committee
of the London Stock Exchange had been
called for the purpose of devising ways
and means of averting a possible panic.”

“T don't know anything about the London
situation,” replied Mr, Keene. “L know
that there has been a short interest in the
stock of Northern Pacific. I know that
two great financial powers have been con-
tending for the control of that stock. To-
settlement London,
I huve received no information as to the
aituation there, but 1 imagine that some
| arrangement will be made to enable the

from loss. I suppose the other side did

it resulted from the Northern Pacifle situ-

ation. That had nothing to do with it,
| Nothing at all.’
} “What caused the sudden and tremen-
dous fall in the prices in all stocks, then?”

Mr. Keene was asked

“] believe it was a concerted attack made
to drive down the price of stocks, The at-
fack was planned and

It that's the case,
made a lot of money.’

‘IL don't think they did, 1 don’t know of
anybody who made a lot of money.”

Well, who do you think has gained cone

effect that certain interesta Were going to
