CouvumBia, 8. C., April 15.—State Soli@iior

about to bring action against the owners
of cotton mills in the Horse (‘reek Valley,
| where all operatives have been locked out,
| in boch the eriminal and eivil side of the
| court, He explained the situation:
“The lock-out in this State is caused by a
| strike in the John P. King mill, Augusta,
Ga., for a 10 per cent. advance in wages,
It is not due to any acts of the operatives.
| They are anxious to fulfil their contracts.
| The mills are trying to coerce their opera-
| tives to coerce the operatives of the King
rill to return to their work at the fortner
| rate of wages, and for this purpose have
| combined and conspired against the opera-
| tives of their own mills to injure them in
order to benefit the King mill.
| “The employers of Horse Creek Valley
are liable on the criminal side of the court
for criminal conspiracy. They have in-
duced those people to go to their work
ata certain price, the operatives are doing
their duty, yet are turned adrift
; “It has been held repeatedly and it is
| sound law that a conspiracy to deprive
l another of his liberty or property is a
| criminal conspiracy, and it has also been
held and the doctrine is universa!ly adopted,
i that the property includes business call-
| ing, de
| “On the civil side of the court the mills
j in that conspiracy may be enjoined from a

| lature has been very kind to cotton milis
j and has granted them many favors, but

SHOT OLD NEIGHBOR AND SELF.

Groughton, Back From West With a Gan,
Sald His Wife Had Been Insulted,

James Shelby of Kast Newark was stand-
ing in front of the bar in James Murphy's
saloon in North Third street, bast Newark,
at 9 o'clock last night, when Jolin Grough-
ton of 531 North Third street entered. Shel-
by recognized Groughton as a near neigh-
bor who had been away in the West, and
asked him to take @ drink with him

“Not on your life,” said Groughton, * You
insulted my wife while 1 was away.”

Shelby said he had not insulted Mrs,
Groughton, Then Groughton drew a re-
volver and shot Shelby, the bullet enter-
ing the right eve.

Groughton went home, pushed his wife
aside in the hallway, and, going to his bed-
room, shot himself in the head. Both
men were sent to St. Michael's Hospital
in Newark. It is probable that they will
die of their wounds.

FIFTH AVENUE EXCITED.

Three Runaway Accidents In One After-
noon Horse Falls Dead.

A horse driven by Alexander Wagner of
28 Columbia street took freight yesterday
afternoon in Fifth avenue at Thirty-fifth
street. The street was filled with carriages,
and there was a good deal of quick work, |
among the drivers of them to get out of
the way. At Thirty-third street Policeman |
Ryan of the West Thirtieth street station
grabbed the bridle of the horse and stopped
it after being dragged several yardo. No
damage was done. e

The riveting machines at work on the |
“flatiron” building at Fifth avenue and |
Twenty-second street frightened a horse
attached to a coupé driven by Samuel
Fivnn of 431 West Thirty-third street

Before the animal had run a block it |
collided with a delivery wagon, knocked |
it over and broke two of its wheels. James
J. Kane, the driver of the delivery wagon,
was thrown out, but waa not in ured,

The horse was finally stopped ty Police-
man Harrison and a fireman in uniform. |
Both were dragged a quarter of a block |
before the animal was stopped at Twenty-
third street

A team of horses drawing a victoria con-
taining two women started to run away
yesterday afternoon at Fifth avenue and
Forty-third street. They were stopped
at Forty-fourth street by Policeman Glavin
and Detective McLaughlin, but one of the
horses broke away from the harness and
raced on up the avenue, leaving the vic-
toria behind,

The animal ran up to Forty-ninth street,

 

 

narrowly missing several and
then ran to Broadway, where it dropped
dead

COAL CARS PILE INTO

 

Break Away From Train and Dive Through
Open Draw — Fiagman Drowned.

Three coal cars broke away from
a Jersey Central train bound from
Philadelphia to Jersey City at Avenue

A, Bayonne, at 6 o'clock yesterday even-
ing, and running backward went into
Newark Bay on top of one another.
Thomas Long, a young flagman, was on
one of the cars and he tried to set the brakes,
but couldn't. When the cars went through
the draw he tried to jump, but was struck
and carreid down beneath them. His
body has not been recovered

The wreckage,piled up so high that the
drawbridge in the centre of the long trestle
over the bay could not be closed and for
several hours there was a fine mix-up in
the Jersey Central train schedule.

The train had crossed the trestle
and the engine ha@ reached the top of the
high grade on the east shore when the cars
cut loose. The drawbridge was only a few
hundred feet away and had just opened for
a schooner, Those who were watching
the runaway care expected to see them
land on and sink the schooner and the
skipper and his crew did some lively work

to get their craft out of the way. They
succeeded
Wreckers were soon at work fishing

the cars out of the bay, and at a late hour
last night they were still at it. Meanwhile
the Newark division of the road was worked
overtime

RICH IMPORTER A SUICIDE.

 

Kilnkherd( Sald to Have Had an Income
of #139,000 a Year.

Walter Klinkhardt, the senior member
of Klinkhardt & Seifert, importers of dress-
goods at 83 Grand street, committed suicide
yesterday afternvon by shooting himself
in the head with a revolver in his apartment
at 16,/Livingstou place. Klinkhardt's land-
lord, Paul Norris, took the news of the
shooting to the East Twenty-second street
police station.

Klinkhardt was found dead in his bed
partly dressed. Dr. Ballesiey of Bellevue
Hospital said he had been dead for some
time. In his pockets was found $1,080
and none of his letters that the police ob-
tained indicated his reason for suicide.

Klinkhardt was 35 years old and was a
bachelor.

Coroner Brown told the police of the
East Twenty-second street station last
night that he had been told that Klink-
hardt had been ill for some time. The
police also heard that Klinkhardt had an
income of $150,000 a year.

The body was taken to Wagner's under-
taker's shop in Second avenue, between
Eighth and Ninth streets. Mr. Wagner said
he had been hired by some of Mr. Klink-
hardt’s friends, but he didn’t know their
names. One of them, he said, was a rich
German from Paterson

It has not been decided whether to ship
Mr. Klinkhardt's body to Germany or to
bury it in Greenwood Cemetery

FOUR DEAD BY GAS.

Tragio Ending of Engagement
Given for One of the Victims,

Four persons were found dead last night
in a little flat in the rear tenement at 1657
Third avenue, suffocated by gas, which
had apparently been turned on accidentally
at the conclusion of a jollification over the |
engagement of one of the four
Mrs. Esther Kohen, a widow; her two chii- |
dren, Harry and Lena, who were 23 and

7 years old respectively, and Edna Floro,
a young Hungarian girl who boarded with
the Kohens»

The family and a number of their friends
on Monday night celebrated the engage-
ment of Harry Kohen. All retired in ex-
cellent spirits. Nothing was heard of the
family after that until a partner of young
Kohen in the bicycle business, went to
the flat last night to see why Kohen had
not turned up for work The door to the
flat was locked. When it was broken down
all four were discovered dead in bed

Coroner Goldenkrang said that (he women
hall apparently been dead nearly twenty
houre and young Kohen about fifteen
hours. Gas was escaping from two jets
in the Kohen's rooms The Coroner is con

| WARNS RE

HINT AT A PLOT 10 ABDUCT THE
CLENDENIN: CHILDREN.

 

Aneny mous Letter Bids Parents Be Careful
The Rev. Mr. Clendenin's Barn

Once Fired After an Anonymous Warn-

ing ~ His Church Burned Five Years Ago

An anonymous letter received by the
Rev. F. M. Clendenin of West Chester
warning him to guard his children from a
kidnapper, has caused some uneasiness in
the family of the minister and has stirred
the police of the Thirty-eighth precinct
into unusual activity

The Rev. Mr. Clendenin is the rector of
St. Peter's Episcopal Church of West Ches-
ter, which numbers among its members
many wealthy New Yorkers who have
country seats on Long Island Sound. He
married Gabrielle Greeley, daughter of
Horace Greeley and has two beautiful
children, Gabrielle and Muriel, 8 and 38
years old r

The letter received by the clergyman
was written in a feminine hand. It bears
the postmark Station “L,” at 141 East 125th
street, April 12, at 4:15 P. M., and of Station
“J,” 2300 Eighth avenue, April 12, at 6:30
P. M., and was recelved at West Chester
at 6:30 P. M. on the same day. The follow-
ing is @ copy:

April 11
REV. anp Drar Sin: I want to caution you
about your deur children. Do not leave

them alone or leave them to the care of a
servant unless you leave your coachman or
some trustworthy person about your place
when you are not at home. Be very careful
Your FRIEND,

A few years ago an incendiary attempted
to fire the church at which Mr, Clendenin
is rector, and soon after Mr. Clendenin
received letters from some person who
threatened to destroy the barn of his farm
at Chappaqua, which was formerly the
country place of Horace Greely. Shortly
after this last letter came Mr. Clendenin's
coachman found that the barn was on fire
and put out the fire. The incendiary had
poured kercsene around the front and rear
doors of the building and left the empty
bottle lying on the floor.

Mr. Clendenin and Michael E. Devlin,
superintendent of schools, have been attack-
ing each other in the newspapers for some
time. About five years ago Mr. Devlin
wanted to open a street through Unionport
to Long Island Sound. Mr. Clendenin
opposed the scheme and the street has never
been opened

Mr. Clendenin was asked last night if he
connected the attempt to fire the church
and barn with the threat to kidnap the
children

“I cannot say that I do,” pepies he,“ but
it is a significant fact that all of these letters
have been received at times when there
have been agitations and controversies.

Mr. Clendenin said that he had no partiou-
lar person in mind whom he ganposees
of writing the letter or wanted to kidnap
the children. “This letter has probably
come from one of two sources,” said the
clergyman, “EKither it is from some one
whoee mind is wrought up over these con-
troversies or from a person who has real
knowledge of a plot. Mrs. Clendenin and
1 are neither of us inclined to worry much;
still we have thought it well to be on our

guard therefore IL turned the letter
over to police.”
Mr in's he says,

. acquaintance,
embraces all classes of people includin
convicts and it may be that some crimina
whom he has befriended having learned
of a plot formed by kidnappers has sent
him the letter of warning. olice Captain
Walsh of the Thirty-eighth precinct is in-
clined to view the letter seriously and has
offered Mr. Clendenin the services of a de-
tective to accompany the children when

| they are going any distance from home

Mr. Clendenin said to-night that his el-
dest daughter Gabrielle had been too ill

since he received the letter to go away from |

the rectory and that the younger child
Muriel never went out unless accompanied
by a nurse

‘Mr. Clendenin's present coachman is
not the one who discovered the fire in the
barn at Chappaqua. St. Peter's Church
was almost destroyed by fire on Aug. 16,
1890 Mr. Clendenin afterward said that
he suspected that the fire was incendiary

CUBAN BILL WILL PASS
By Republican Votes Alone and Without
Amendment.

WASHINGTON, April 15 At a conference
of Republican leaders to-day a canvass
of the House was submitted which shows
that the Cuban tariff bill will pass the House
without amendment and by Republican
votes alone

The opponents of the measure are en-

deavoring to create the impression that
the bill is in danger of being amended by
propositions from the Democrats or the
beet sugar Republicans.
There is no danger from this direction,
however, as enough Republican votes are
now pledged to put the organization in
complete control of the situation

 

SHE STOLE FOR FATHER'S SAKE.

 

Nine-Year-Old Girt Couldn't Bear to See
Him Without Good shoes.

Nine-year-old Mary Kuhl of 282 Warren
street, Jersey City, was arrested yesterday
for stealing a pair of men's shoes from the
store of Simon Lustig of 382 Henderson
street. She admitted her guilt and said:

“Papa bought me the nice new shoes
I have on when he got paid last Saturday.
His shoes are worn out, but he doesn't
make much money, and he said he couldn't
afford new ones, too. I felt so sorry for
him that I just had to steal him a pair.”

MR. CUMMINGS OPERATED ON.

Tumer Removed From the Congressman
~ His Condition Serious.

Bavrimore, April 15.--Dr. Hugh J. Young
performed an operation this afternoon
on Congressman Amos J. Cummings of
New York. He was assisted by other
surgeons and attending physicians of
the staff of the Church Home Infirmary.
The surgeon removed from the neck of
the bladder a tumor that had formed a
year ago and had attained a large growth.
t was the cause of the kidney and bladder
trouble which undermined his health.
The operation was successful, but several
days must elapse before Dr. Young will
hazard a siatement as to the patient's
recovery. Mr. Cummings, he said to-night,
is a very sick man and even should the
trouble be entirely eradicated it may be
several months before he will be well enough
to leave the hospital.

HOKE BROKE.

Creditors of Samuel W. Hoke, or $am W.
Hoke, as he insists on having it spelled,

He describes himself as “the long-distance
bill poster.” The Federal pahogrean Com-
pany Wants $623, Frederick A. Bristol, sta-
tioner, $26, and Powers & Stein, printers,
$76, and they allege that $am is insolvent
and on Saturday admitted in writing his
inability to pay his debts and willingness
to be adjudged bankrupt on that ground
He began business here in 1805 as a de-

J. P. Morgan & Co. Take Control of L. &

Bankers, to Relleve the Financial Con-
dition Not for Any Railway Co. — There
Will Be No Coutest for Control — Anem-
alous Position Gates Found Himself In

!
~Long as Buyer, Short as Owner.
J. P. Morgan & Co. have agreed to take
the tangled Louisville and Nashville matter
in band, and this Wall Street takes as a
guarantee that no further serious stock
market trouble need be apprehended.

George W. Perkins of the firm of J. P.
Morgan & Co. made this statement shortly
before midnight last night:

“At the request of Messrs. Harris, Gates
& Co., who on their own independent ac-
count have recently made large purchases
of Louisville and Nashville Railroad stock,
Messrs. J. P. Morgan & Co., as bankers,
have consented to take control of the stock
80 purchased and to receive the same on
deposit

“They have so consented solely to relieve
the general financial condition and not for
the benefit of any railway company. The
Southern Railway has no interest, direct
or indirect, present or prospective, in the
stock, or its purchase or deposit.

“Messrs. J. P. Morgan & Co. are acting
with the cordial consent of Messrs. August
Belmont & Co.”

STATEMENT AMPLIFIED SEMI-OFFICIALLY.

This semi-official statement was obtained
from an interest represented at the con-
ferences at J. P. Morgan & Co.'s offices
yesterday.

“The Louisville and Nashville road will
be turned over to J. P. Morgan & Co., as
bankers, for them to operate as they see
fit. As soon as the papers are signed a
majority of the stock will be turned over
to J. P. Morgan & Co. August Belmont,
chairman of the board of directors of the
Louisville and Nashville, is in sympathy,
and he will turn over some stock, too.

“Mr. Gates says there will be no corner,
and that is true. Mr. Belmont has as-
sured J. P. Morgan & Co. that there will
be no contest for control.

“There will be no consolidation, merger
or lease
ville and ’ Southern Railway nor any
closer relations between the two properties
than now exist. The laws of the States
in the South are even more stringent than
they are in the North regarding consolida-
| tions, and no merger will be attempted.
| “Mr. Gates has turned the control over
to Morgan & Co., believing that the road
will be best operated under their manage-
ment as bankers. There may be some
delay in the signing of the papers for the
delivery of the stock and the signing of
| the necessary agreement, but all parties
are agreed to the step and it will be car-
ried out.”

The man who made this statement
would not say for what period of time
the stock is to be held by Morgan & Co.,
or whether there will be a voting trust,

NO CONTEST FOR CONTROL, 84Y8 AUOUST
BELMONT.

August Belmont, after
Perkins's statement, said

“L have been aware of the negotiations
by which Messrs. J. P. Morgan & Co. have
consented to take control and receive
| deposit of the stock of the Louisville and

Nashville Hailroad purchased by Harrie,
‘Gates & Co The statement by J.P. Morgan

ae ist tnade public, has my unqualified

approval and there will be no contest for
ithe eontrol of the Louleville and Nash-

ville Railroad ”
