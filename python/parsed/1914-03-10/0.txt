@. Luke’s Protestant Episcopal Church,
& Clinton avenue between Fulton street;
and Atlantic avenue, Hreoklyn, was de-
@royed by fire last night. j

The parish house adjoining It in Clin- |
ten avenue was also left a ruin, *,
flames leaped across an areaway to t ei
rectory, ruining the two upper floors,

Three alarms were sounded and only
yr dint of great effort wus the Ellen,
Woolsey Memorial, used as @ home for
the sexton and a meeting place for the
women of the church, saved.

The fire was costly. Memorial windows |
of great value melted under the flerce,
heat and the pipe organ, said to have been |
the largest in Brooklyn, was destroyed. It
was built twenty-five years ago by Reu- |
ben Widmer and was installed in the,
church at a cost of $40,000. The organ,
the great marble altar and the parish
house were the gifts Col. Henry aA.

joes wus estimated between $300,000 and

Massachusetts Democrats Fail
Support President.
Boston, March 9.—At a conference to-
night of the Democratic members of the
Legislature President Wilsofi’s stand for |

emption was repudiated. The meeting was
called by Gov. Walsh for the purpose of
unifying the sentiment of the Deinocratic
legislators on matters relating to the|
party platform, but when he finished his
talk the discussion shifted to President
Wilson's attitude on the canal tolls,

Representative Doyle desired the meet-
ing to indorse resolutions he has pre-
sented to the Legislature memoralizing
the President and Congress to uphold
the tolls exemption for Aimerican coast-
wise vessels, After a heated debate last-
ing two hours Doyle withdrew his request
for the adoption of a motion calling for
unanimous Democratic support when his
resolution comes up in the House to-
morrow.

GLANDS TRANSPLANTED |
FOR CURE OF INSANITY:

Operations by Which Live Per-|
sons Get Tissues Taken |
From the Dead.

|

 

 

 

 

CHicaco, March 9.—Operation on two
insane persons suffering from dementia)
precox, in which glands from dead persons |
were transplanted to the patients, took
place to-day at the Dunning State Hospi-

tal for the Insane. The operations were

‘performed by Dr. G. Frank Lydston, as- ,

sisted by Dr. George Leininger, super!n-
tendent of the hospital. The patients were |
a girl 17 years old, who has been suffer- |
ing for two years, and a woman, 26 years,
who has been Insane for five years. |

The Dunning operations followed an an- |
nouncement last week ‘by Dre Lydston |
that he had performed a elialilar operation |
on himself and also on a woman 56 years |
old,

“We are going to wait for results now,” |
said Dr. Leininger to-day, “and If we eee_
that the operations have been 4 success,
we shall go right ahead and cure more
insane patients.”

in the operation on the younger girl
Dr. Lydston implanted « gland which was

ia twin to one he implanted In & woman

59 years old nearly a week ago. This
gland has been kept in “cold storage”
since that time. Both the glands he,

| used last night and the one implanted In

the woman six days @so were reinoved
seven days ago from, the body of
elghteen-year-vil girl who had been K!lled
by a fracture of the skull,

Dr. Lydstun sald thet the glands he
implanted have the function of supplying

an

j certain secretions to the Drain and nerve

cells,
Dr. Lydston taid he had been working
on the {dea of gland implantation for

fourteen years and the discovery of Dr.
Alexis Carrel of the Rockefeller Institute
that some glands live after death showed
him the way. The greater part of recent!
medice! and surgical research, the surgeon
eal, hus been directed to studies of the
varlous glands of the body the functions |
of which heretofore have not been un-,
derstood have been understood

LEAGUE UPHOLDS ZUEBLIN.

 

Voters’ Organtsation Against

Speaker cldrk’s Contention.

WasHINoToN, March 9.—The National |
Voters League has injected itself into the
controversy relative to the vote on the,
MacDonald resolution in the House on
December 9 coneerning a report filed by
the special committee that tnvestigated |
the so-called Mulhall charges.

Prot. Charles Zueblin of Boston had |

| asserted that forty-six members voted for ,

the resolution, whereas the count made by
Speaker Clark showed that only twenty- |
three members supported the measure, |
Speaker Clurk accord!nely made a speech |
in the House on Saturday tn which he

jexpressed resetitment over what he re-|

garded a8 an assault upon his integrity.
Secretary Lynn Haines of the voters’
league said to-day that the league had on

file statements of forty-six members

that they had voted for the MacDonald '

resolution, There was some talk to-night

that there mey be an investigation of
the matter.

“If the National Voters League has
forty-six genuine signetures Lo the claim

as to members arising at that time twen-
ty-three of the statements are based
cither upon misunderstanding of the ques-

tign or deliberate untruth,” said Speaker,

Clark to-day.

Spectal Cable Despatch to Tu Sux. |
GLascow, March 9.—Amid rioting with

Pankhurst was arrested here to-day

This is the seventh |
time that she has been arrested under
the “cat and mouse” act on the con-
splracy charge for which she received a|
sentence of three years at penal servitude. |
She has actually served only three weeks |
of this sentence.

A wild scene followed the arrest of Mrs.
Pankhurst in which revolvers were fired, |
but they apparently contained blank car- |
tridges, and miniature bombs were thrown. |
Many persons were injured in the fight-
ing. Scotland Yard detectives wno came
here to carry out the arrest say it was!
the wildest fight yet between the police |
and the suffragettes.

St. Andrews Hall, the largest In this!
city, had been engaged for the meeting,
which was well advertised and which,

drew thousands from Edinburgh and else- |

where outside Glasgow. Mrs. Pankhurst
appeared on the platform after the others |

inflammatory epeech, She said

“T have kept my promise to be here to-
night despite the Government. The wit)
and ingenuity of a woman has overcome ,
the power of money and the British Gov-
eroment.”

TALLEST JAIL IN THE WORLD.

Skyecraper of 14 Stories Will House
Women Prisoners.

Plans are practically completed for a
skyscraper jail which the city will erect
on the site of the old Tenderloin police
station in Thirtieth street near Sixth
avenue. The bullding will be fourteen
stories tall, and according to Griffin &
Wynkoop, who made the plans, will cost
about $450,000. That sum was appro-
priated for the structure by the Board of
Estimate at the suggestion of former Bor-
ough President McAneny. Some of the
city officials are active now In an effort
to have the Legislature pass a bill limit-
ing the Yheight of bulldings in this city,
but they hope to get the new city jail
under way before such a law goes into
effect.

This jail will be the highest building of
its Kind in the world, It will have a
frontage of 75 feet and a depth of 100
feet. It is planned chiefly for the care
of women prisoners, Several floors will

WASHINGTON, March $.—The lid wae
lifted from the Mexican situation in the

i Senate to-day. Senator Fall of New Mex-

with the galiertes crowded, made a speech
which for the most part was a recital of
outrages against American citizens and
; American property interests that is likely
| to become historic
The Senator from New Mexico, who
has probably kept in closer touch with the
Mexican situation than any other mem-
ber of the Senate, spoke in a dispassionate
manner, He did not the Adminis
tration except by implication. He pointed
out what he believed to be the onl)
leading to a restoration of peace and or

vention with land and naval! forced
