TO OUST WILLIAMS AS LEADER.

In Congress Not Taking Kindly

to Mississippian's Rule,

Washinaton, Jan. 31.—John Sharp Wil-
liauns's days as the leader of the Democrats
in the House of Representatives are be- |
lieved to be numbered. He probably will |
not serve in that place beyond the life of the
present Congress. He is out of touch with
his party associates on the railway rate
question, and to-day he had a sharp passage
of arms with Representative Hay of Vir-
ginia over tho ghost of Jefferson Davis,
emerging from the fray discomfited and
sore at heart,

The decline of Williams as a leader began
at the Democratio convention in St. Louis
last July. His keynote speech aa tem-
porary chairman of the convention, which
was intended as a reply to the address of
Elihu Root delivered at Chicago the week
previous, was a flat failure.

Mr. Williams announced some time ago
that President Roosevelt had stolen Demo-
cratic thunder in his interstate commerce
propaganda and that he was ready to
support the President's policy on the ground
that it was good Democratic policy. Now
he expresses opposition to the Administra-
tion rate méasure reported by the House
Committee on Interstate and Foreign Com-
merce. But he is finding little encourage-
ment.

The Mississippi statesman's troubles as a
jeader began soon after the appearance
in Washington last week of William Jennings
Bryan. At that time it was reported that
Mr. Bryan was instructing the Democrats
on the rate question, and since then Mr.
Williams has found it impossible to do

Road Will Be Tied Up by Afternoon,
and the Elevated Men Will Go Next.
The troubles of the Interborough Rapid

Transit Company in adjusting the difficulties
with its employees in the subway and on

the elevated have not been settled. It be-
came known at five minutes past 1 this
morning when the executive comunittee

representing the three gradea of employees
adjourned after a meeting held at 177 Willis
avenue in The Bronx that the men ob-
ject more to the newest time schedules
than they did to the old. The leaders came
out threatening an immediate strike

The three associations represented were
the local branch of the Brotherhood of
Locomotive Engineers with William L.
Jenks, its chairman, as spokesman; the
Amalgamated Association of Street and
Electric Railway Employees, with George
E. Pepper at its head, and the local union of
the Brotherhood of Locomotive Firemen,
headed by H. H. Penny.

After the meeting these men declared
that unless the officials of the Interborough
company acceded to their demands and
remedied certain changes made after the
company’s promises were given last Thurs-
day a strike would be called to-day.

If the company didn’t yield, sald the
leaders, by 1 o'clock this afternoon the sub-
way would be completely tied up.

According to the men,
changed the schedule of the local and ex-
Peos (a sy more
ing so that the employees were compelled
to make an extra trip. The men say they
were not consulted about this change, and
it was late yesterday afternoon before they
realized what it meant, Chairman Pepper
was immediately notified.

He made an investigution, and says he
found that the company had violated every
promise made last Thursday, when the
men were pacified after threatening to
strike.

According to Pepper and the others, the
fifteen minutes rest which motormen
were to get at the northern terminal after
each trip had been abolished, and the men
are now forced to do more than ten hours
work a day, which is in violation of the
agreement of last autumn.

Pepper says he hurried to the Inter-
borough offloes and saw General Manager
Hedley. Pepper says he told Hedley that

| unless the schedules were changed and the

company returned to the plan agreed upon
last Thursday a strike would be ordered
within an hour. Hedley only laughed at

him, Pepper says.
Pepper hurried uptown, and consulted

with Jenk and Penny. Then last night's
meeting waa called.

The executive committeemen loudly de~ |

nounced the Interborough. They all united
in declariny that mmlees the company
changed its preset attitude the Subway

While the family were at dinner the boy |
was sent to get sumething in the library, |
on the third floor back. He says that when

into an adjoining bedroom. Young Me-
Cook ran into his father’s bedroom, picked
up a big revolver and returning to the |
library began to blaze away in the direo- |
tion of the room into which the burglar |
had fled.

He fired two shots, and they served to
bring the family and the servants up to
the third floor in a hurry. Two big holes |

Appeals to-day decided that Pau! Boso, a |
Rochester bootblack, acted within hia
rights in refusing to shine the shoes of
George Burks, a negro. The appeal
was from an order reversing a judgment

of the defendant.

On Nov. 27, 1901, Burks applied for a |
shine at the stand of the defendant, a
bootblack. Boso, a white man, told the

shoes. Burka sued for $500 damages.

James Hazen Hyde at the Sherry restau-
rant last night, altogether eclipsed in pict-
uresque and entertaining qualities any en-
tertainment, public or private, that New
York has known in several years.

The best measure of the elaborateness
of the decorations and of the programme
arranged for the entertainment of Mr.
Hyde’, guests waa to be found in the general

| opinion among those accustomed to festivi-

ties of such extreme elaboration that noth-
ing heretofore known to the social diversions
of New Yorkers except the ball of the Brad-
ley-Martins in 1897 was worthy to bo men-
tioned in the same breath. Certainly no

| festivity of the present season ‘will approach

Mr. Hyde's party in the chronicles of the

| year's more aristocratic diversions.

There were those who, after a super-
general preparations for
that Mr. Hyde's bills,
would amount to more
$100,000. This guess was entirely

rect 26 Wim -\r. di yde would

by his attitude toward those who sought

MACK VISITS TAGGART.
Hasa Talk With Him and Then Sees a Bryan

gart, and to-night left for French Liok,
where Taggart will meet him later in the |
week. He declined to discuss national |

politics at length with reporters, but said
that he had hoped that Taggart would see
fit to reply to the attacks that had heen made |
upon him jn the newspapers.

Mr. Mack said the difficulty in the last |
election waa that both parties ac
be for the trusta, and there was little for }
the people to choose from. Mr. Mack said
that should Mr. Bryan ba nominated at the
next Democratic convention he believed

Thus it was that, brilliant in every ap-

brilliancy and of freedom from strident
notoriety seeking which was altogether

new to such occasions on this side of the

IT WAS A BACHELOR'S ENTERTAINMENT.

Mr. James H. Hyde,
is a bachelor. He is one of the wealthiest
men in the United States, but hia life so far
has not been spent so much in demonstrat-
ing his wealth as in yarious manifestations
of somewhat more useful activities. He has
devoted himself conspicuously to the pro-
motion of the study of French literature,
and particularly of the French drama here,

He has been described as the most Amer-
icanized Frenchman and the most French

Outside of

these intellectual activities,

Mr. Hyde has shown his material right to

his position in the financial world by at-

than thirty railroads and banks. He is

also a member of some twenty-five or more

clubs. His strictly social activities have
been shown, until last night's festivities,
most by his active support and participa-
tion in the affairs of the New York Coach-
Club. In the midst of the strange
