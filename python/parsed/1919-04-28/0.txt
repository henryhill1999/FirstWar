SAILORS REVISE

1 PROGRAMME AT

VEREIN CONCERT

Teutons Gather to Listen to
Homeland Songs, Hear
U. S. Anthem.

ALL GERMAN DELETED

 

Yeoman Joins Artists on the
Stage as Mates Turn Fete
Into Loan Rally.

 

Yeoman (third class) Lewis White of
the battleship Oklahoma won for himself
yesterday a niche in the musical hall of
fame by appearing on the same stage
with four {llustrious operatic stars.

White's concert debut came about in
a rather unexpected manner. His name
did not appear in the circulars which
brought 2,000 German speaking men and |
women to the Yorkville Casino to hear
the Madrigal Quartet, composed of Jo-
hannes Sembach. Herman Weil, Otto
Goritz and Carl Braun.

He was inserted into the artistic pro-
gtamme forcibly when 500 sailors, re-
enforced by some soldiers and marines,
mobbed the musicale, which they had
heard was to be in the Teutonic tongue,
and insisted that the audience show its
alleged loyalty by standing and listening
to “The Star Spangled Banner.” «~

There was a hitch in the plan because
Benno Loewy, 206 Broadway, who had a
lot to do with the arrangement of the
concert, told the satlors that the German
artist at the piano did not know the
American national anthem. This soft
answer did not in any way tend to turn
away the wrath of the naval intruders.
Some of them declared that it was time
for the artist to learn the well known
selection. As a compromise Mr.’ Loewy
then marched Yeoman White to the
stage and called upon the audience to)
stand while the sailor played and sang!
the piece demanded.

White's @alection: renlly evoked more
vociferous applause than any of the ar-
tistic renditions of the former Metropel-
itan stars, but it may be added that most
of this applause came from the group in
blue and khaki that stood in the rear of
the hall and dominated the entire con-
cert.

German Colors ‘‘Unintentional.”’

That group did everything under the
sun to disrupt the plans of the Bayer-
{sche Volkfest Verein, the society of
Bavarians which was supposed to con-
duct the concert. The sailors practically
took the whole thing out of the Volkfest
Verein's hands, turning it finally into a
Victory Loan rally, in which uniformed
men canvassed the audience and sold
$8,000 worth of notes.

Christian Rebhan of 644 Sixth avenue,
president of the verein, had announced
in hia cireulars that there would be a
Victory Loan plea at the performance,
but the complete success of it exceeded
ail of his expectations. The address in
support of the loan was delivered by
Assistant District Attorney Weil, who
appeared on Mr. Rebhan’s request, but
it was really the uninvited guests who
made the thing a success.

SS

For @ little while yesterday it looked
as if there would be no concert at all.
When the audience began to file into the
hall there were four policemen on hand
to preserve order while the surround-
ing streets swarmed with gobs bent on
trouble.

The sailors had men posted at either
end of the block on East Eighty-sixth
‘Areet where the casino is located, and |
>s rapidly as any uniformed men ap-
neared they were advised by these out-
posts to assemble at certain points in
the neighborhood, The gathering clouds
ef gobs soon made it evident that the
police on hand would be unable to han-
die them and a call
police atation on East Eighty-eighth
street, which brought Capt. Richard
O'Connor and the reserves,

To the police were soon added a squad
of provost guards in olive drab under
Lieuta. J. J. Noonan and P. G. Gan-
non, These brought an army patrol
wagon with them, leaving it in front of
the hall. The tntertor of the auditorium
was guarded by former Police Captain
Bernard Kelleher and a squad of pri-
vate detectives In addition to a large
uniformed force. ,

Gobs Get Reentforcements,

The gobs also obtained heavy reen-
forcements, for four large sightseeing

hall Just who financed this uni-/|
formed attack on the meeting is a]
problem that is causing the police some
peculation. Notices to the effect that
the four famous German singers were
going to sing in their mother tongue
were posted several days ago on the
bulletin boards of several soldiers’ and
satlors’ clubs, and certain citizens had
ealled upon the Mayor to stop the con-
cert, which
propaganda.

Some of the sailors left their coats in
nearby stores with the remark that
they would return for them after the
concert if they were not sent to the
hospital. A Canadian Highlander and
another soldier of the Dominion who
were active in the disturbance were the
first to demand admittance to the hall.

Mr. Loewy, who stood on the sidewall
talking to the police, said the soldiers |

RALLIES AFTER ACCIDENT

 

 

Motorman of Surface Car
Which Crushes Cab Is
Not Arrested.

Samuel Gompers, president of the
American Federation of Labor, was in-
jured seriously yesterday afternoon

when a _ northbound Broadway car

| crashed into and wrecked the taxicab

in which he was riding. The light
motor was demolished. Mr. Gompers
received two fractured ribs, a sprained
right hip and various bruises.
69 years old.

The accident happened at about 2:30
o'clock, when the taxicab, driven by
William Goldberg of 1465 Fifth avenue,
after coming south on Broadway,
turned at Forty-first street toward the
east. The street car, with Motorman
Charles Haryna at the controls, struck

| the rear end of the little taxicab, stov- |
ing in its side and pushing it north- |

ward for a distance of twenty feet.
The driver was hurled to the pave-
ment, but Mr, Gompers was held in the
wreckage.
ried into the Hotel Continental, on the
corner. The hotel is a headquarters
for labor leaders.

Dr. Balensweig of the New York Hos-
pital diagnosed Mr. Gompers's injuries
as fracture of the ninth and tenth ribs,
on the right eide, sprained cight hip and
minor injuries, according the police rec-
ord. Dr. Charles R. Hancock of 17
Fast Thirty-eighth street was called in
later. At first it was feared that the
injuries and the shock of the accident
might result seriously.
Hed quickly, however.

Goldberg, the driver, suffered only
bruises and contusions, No arrests were
made.

Mr. Gompers came to New York
Thursday from Washington to attend to
some business. As usual, he stopped at
the home of John Morrison, advertising
manager of the American Federationist,
at 318 West Fifty-first street. Mr. Mor-
rison and other labor leaders hastened
to the hotel on learning of their leader's
accident. They were assured that he
Was in good condition.

James E. Roach, an associate of Mr
Gompers, said at 10 o'clock last night
that Mr. Gompers was resting quietly.
His.temperature was normal. There
was a slight hesitation in pulse, due
to shock, Mr. Roach said Mr. Gompers
probably would be in bed for severa)
days. He is conscious, and has dc-
termined to remain at the hotel until
he feels fit to resume work.

Some important conferences neces-
sarily were postponed, but Mr. Gompers
hopes to be feeling fit for the meeting
on May 9 of the executive council of
the federation in Washington

NEARING'S CRY
FOR U. 8. REVOLT
HAILED BY REDS

Calls Nation a Robber and
| Favors Soviet Here Like
| Russia’s.

HART OF HARVARD ANGRY

 

Comes to N. Y. to Debate
League of Nations, but Hears
Authority Denounced Only.

 

More than 3,000 Reds, or as Police-
man McGeoghan, who in the last dec-
ade has observed all things ornitho-
logical up Central Park way, called
them “the geese,” scurried out of the
tenements below Fourteenth street
yesterday afternoon and filled every
seat in the Century Theatre, and the
Stage too; and for an hour and a half
they clacked the cry of their leader,
Dr. Scott Nearing: “Revolution!”

The red winged hats, red ties, red
sashes and red minds, blended per-
!fectly with the red plush seats and
| decorations of the theatre, and the big

audience seemed quite at home,

They paid all the way from a quar-
| ter to a dollar to hear a debate between
their favorite prophet and Prof. Alfred
Bushnell Hart of Harvard University
on the League of Nations, Prof. Hart
upholding the league plea and Dr.
Nearing opposing. Of all the argu-
ments heard in public against the
League, Dr. Nearing's was most
astounding, and while he yelled “Revo-
lution!” again and again and called
the United States a robber nation, down
|in the labyrinth stairway that leads
| under the etage to the pit of the thea-
| tre a secret service man carefully noted
every utterance.

Calls Leagae Advantage te Labor.

Prof. Hart spoke for ‘forty-five min-
Lutes on the advantage the league
would be to labor. He spoke calmly
| and in the academic manner of a lec
} turer, But when Dr. Nearing, as war
his privilege of debate, offered the red
Tag of revolution as a substitute for
the league, and spent his entire forty-

five minutes flaying the Government oty

the United States and the other allied
Powers, the Harvard professor rose to
his feet, his big frame shook with emo-
tion and in eloquent words of Amert-
| canism he tried to shame the audience
j and Nearing himself for thetr enthusi-
asm for revolt.

“Revolution, is that the remedy?" he
| Yoared up at the galleries, and the an-
| swering cry was: “Yes, yes," accom-
| panied by a volley of applause. A gir!
| Standing in the fringe of the hundreds
{of parlor Bolshevists on the stage

would I have set foot in this house did
I conceive I would hear my country
called a robber nation, that our system
; of government {s an abominable system
tand ought to be put down by revolu-
tion !""

His long erma pointed at the Reds,
dut they caught the word “revolution,”
and hugged {it with applause, often re-
peating it like something loved.

Prof. Hart stepped farther out on the
stage, and his words came fast.

“Russia” Arouses Galleries.

on the stage in back of the speaker, He
continued

{ “Germany has gone through a revolu- |

tion, Do we want to undergo the ex-
perlence of Germany? I didn’t come
here to discuss revolution, I had aright
to suppose Dr. Nearing would etick to
the subject of a League of Nattons. In
the United States we have all the power
and authority that could be possibly en-
joyed by a social revolution. There never
has been a time when men who work with
thetr hands have had as great power
and influence as at the present moment.
At the head of the labor conference at
the peace convention sat the head of or-
ganized workingmen of this land, Sam-
uel Gompers. [Hisses, catcalls and

‘OF REVISED LEAGUE
OF NATIONS COVENANT

/

 

 

WASHINGTON, April 27.—The State Department to-night made
public the text of the revised covenant of the League of Nations. The
text follows, with parenthetical insertions in black face type showing

changes made in the covenant as originally drafted and made public:

IN ORDER’ TO PROMOTE INTERNA-
TIONAL COOPERATION AND TO ACHIEVE
INTERNATIONAL PEACE AND SECURITY,
BY THE ACCEPTANCE OF OBLIGATIONS
NOT TO RESORT TO WAR, BY THE PRE-
SCRIPTION OF OPEN, JUST AND HON-

TREATY OBLIGATIONS IN THE DEAL-
INGS OF ORGANIZED PEOPLES WITH
ONE ANOTHER, THE HIGH CONTRACT-
ING PARTIES AGREE TO THIS COVE-
NANT OF THE LEAGUE OF NATIONS.

(In the original preamble the
last sentence read, “adopt this

constitution,’ instead of ‘agree
to this covenant."')
ARTICLE ONE.
The original members of , the

League of Nations shall be those of
the signatories which are named fn
the annex to this covenant and
ftlso such of those other States
named in the annex as shall accede
without reservation to this cove-
nant. Such accessions shall be ef-
fected by a declaration deposited
with the secretariat within two
months of the coming tnto force of
the covenant, Notice thereof shall

(This article is new, embodying

No mention of withdrawal was
made in the original document.)

ARTICLE TWO.

The action of the league under
this covenant shall be effective
through the instrumentality of an
assembly and of a council, with a

(This embedies parts .of the

league’ where the term “high

contracting parties" originally was
used, and this change is followed
throughout the revised draft.)

ARTICLE FOUR.

ceil. The paragraphs providing
for increase in the membership of
the council is new.)

By the Associated Press.

Paris, April 27.—The revised cove-
nant of the League of Nations will
go before a plenary session of the
Peace Conference to-morrow for final
action. What fs in store for it there
is not yet clear, as negotiations have
been active in the last few days witb
a view to adjusting the reservations
made by the French, Japanese and
Belgians when the committee adopted
the revised text.

The French amendments were de-
signed to reenforce French military
security, but these may not be pressed

France obtains under the settlement
of the Rhine frontier.

yet indicated whether they will re-
new thelr amendment on racial equal-
ity, as that depends somewhat on the
settlement they are able to secure con-
cerning Kiao-chau. The Belgian
amendment relates to the choice of
Geneva as the seat of the league, and
this also is in the way of adjustment.

Premier Hughes's Attitade,

The Monroe Doctrine amendment ip
not éxpected to encounter opposition
if the question of French securlty ts

} adjusted. Premier Hughes of Austra-
lia previously has indicated his pur-
pose of discussing the covenant as a
whole, and he also will be the chief
opponent of the Japanese amendment
if it is renewed.

A semi-official analysis of the re-
vised covenant says that the redraft
was made after consultation with
thirteen neutral nations, and examina-
tion, the criticisms coming from both
sides of the Atlantic. The resulting
document, it is declared, does not
create a superstate, The league must
depend upon the free consent of its
component states

The word “external” in Article X.,
according to the analysis, shows that
the league cannot be used like the
Holy Alliance to suppress national or
other movements within the boun-
Caries of member states, but only to
Prevent forcible annexation from
without.

Articles 10, 11 and 19 are cited as
making plain that the covenant is not
intended to make the new territorial
settlement in Europe unalterable for
all time, but, on the contrary, to pro-
‘vide the machinery for the progressive
jregulation of international affairs of
ithe future.
