COMMENT ON NOTE VI TAL, WILSON BELIEVES

 

Papers Have Summary, but
Await Full Text of Amer-
ican Warning.

 

REVENTLOW STILL FIERY

 

Special Cadle Deopatch to Tne Sen.

Berutn, via London, July 24.—Not
unti] this afternoon did the Berlin pub-
Mo receive its firat intimation of the
contents of the latest American note.
A brief summary was published by
Berliner Zeitung Am Mittag without
comment. The same attitude of reti-
cence wae adopted by most of the news-
papers, it being regarded that the oon-
tenta of the note cannot adequately be
criticised until the complete text is pub-
Hehed.

Meanwhile it ia understood that all
the high Government officiala were
handed copies of the note this after-
moon and that the text of the note had
been forwarded to the Kaiser. The Bor-
lin newspapers have been informed ‘hat
e@opies of the note probably will be
e@upplied to them for publication Sum
ey morning.

Count Ernst von MNeventiow, in an
article in the Tageszeitung headed “Un-
derground Anxieties,” said this after
noon that no matter what the note
contained Germany would not restrict
her submarine campaign. There can
be no further question of the German
ettitude in this respect, he said.

None of the officials would comment
@m the note to-day.

Editors Comment on Sternness of
Language Addressed to Berlin.

Special Cable Despatch to Tur Sun

Lonpon, July 24.—The English press
fe practically unanimous in its high
praise of President Wilson's lates: note
to Germany. There is no comentator,
however, who fails to realize the un-
compromising sternness of the language
used. The Westminster Garette a semi-
Official paper, says

“These are the strongest worda dipto-
could employ without actually
breaking relations with the Power to
which they are addressed, and if we
apply the usua! standard of interpre-
tation to them, we must call this note
at least a penultimatum. it leaves
eesired in the tirmness
wherewith it reasserts the principles
laid down in the previous notes.”

The Pall Mall Gasette says:

“President Wilson's much = criticised
self-restraint hus enabled him to inter-
wene at last in a fashion which in-
wvokes the national honor and the na-
tlonal conscience of America, both at
their highest intensity. To-day's note

President to Devote His Time at Cornish to Study |

Needs of Army and Navy—To Form
Definite Programme.

Cornnism, N. H., July 24.—President;
Wilson will devote his attention during
the vacation at his summer home here
chiefly to @ study of national defence.
It became known to-day that he re-
gards this problem as the most im-
portant pressing for hia immediate at-
tention and that he expects to place it
before the completion of the note to)
Great Britain regarding interference
with United States commerce. |

The reports as to the condition of the
army and navy which Secretary of
War Garrison and Secretary of the
Navy Daniels are preparing and which
are said most empatically to have been
called for before the German crisis
reached its final stage, will be rushed
to the President as soon as they are
completed, He expects to receive |
Secretary of State Lansing’s draft of
the note to Great Britain some time
next week.

The President brought on his arrival
here this afternoon a despatch bag
filled with important papers, including
data, which are being used in prepara-
tion of the note to Great Britain and re-
cent reports of developments in Mexico.
He regarded the documents he carried
as of such importance that he would
not allow them out of his possession
from the time he left Washington last
night. At Bellows Falls, Vt, 4 short
distance below Cornish, Mr. Wilson told
aman with whom he was shaking hands
over the rear railing of his private car
that his stay at Cornish was not to be
a vacation but “an opportunity for un-
interrupted work.” The man had been
congratulating him on being able to take
@ vacation. .

The President had a good night's rest
and did not start the handshakings from
the rear of his car at the towns along
the railroad until nearly noon, His de-
parture from Washington had been kept
@ secret until last night and few per-
sons in the towns along the route knew
he was to pass through to-day. He
Was met at the station at Windsor, two
miles from Cornish, by his son-in-law,
Francis Bowes Sayre. A small crowd
of townspeople greeted him as he
alighted from his car.

In the party at Harlakenden House
are Mre. Sayre, Miss Helen Woodrow
Bones, Mrs. Norman Gait of Washing-
ton, and Dr. Cary T. Grayson, the White
House physician. Miss Margaret Wilson
will arrive to-morrow from North
Haven, Me., where she has been the
guest of Secretary of the Treasury and
Mrs. McAdoo. The President slept for
a while this afternoon and did not take!
his accustomed motor trip. He received |
no important despatches from Washing-
ton during me ofte rnoon,

President Wilson is giving evidence of
having been won over to the side of

fer of disappointment in their eriti-
Cinms, as aif they had looked forward to
something more hostile They agree,
however, that the note leaves the situa-
tion between America and Germany still
4 serous one,

| The Journal des Debats says:

| “The note ts courteous, perhauns more
courteous than necessary. But the
| United States finds Germany's proposal
| UNMeCE ptable,”

The Debats believes that the passage
about the last two months of warfare
having shown an improvement that
tieets the accepted rules of international
luw will cause surprise, saying that if a
second Lusitania incident has not hap-
pened, no perceptible change has been
noted in submarine practice toward bel-
iigerent or neutral ships. It mentions
the case of the Orduna as showing that
the inclination to transgress interna.
tional laws has existed in the German
submarine policy if it has not been
manifested,

“The note says,”

continues the Debats,

 

{that both the United States and Ger-
[many are struggling for the same high
aim; that is, the liberty of the seas.
These words show a singular optimism
or om truly eXvessive politeness."

' With this reserve, the Debuts says,
the language on the eesential points
shows a firmness and clearness which
were to be expected from Washington
Referring to the use of the word “un.

friendly,” the Debates adds

“The signifleance of this word in the
diplomatic vocabulary is known. Lord
Rosebery interpreted it) in 18U8, When
England used it regarding certain plans |
attributed to France, aS meaning that
ff serious situation exists when applied
between governments. It is certain that
| President Wilson and Secretary Lansiig
used the word according to Lord Rose
bery’s meaning, Before this flnal word,
the criticism to which the remainder of
the note is open assuredly loses much of
j 'te importance,”
| La Liberte, remarking that the diplo
matic history of this war will be marked |

the United States and Germany, says

those who are contending for a sub-
stantial strengthening of the national
defences. This statement was issued at
the White House to-day:

“The President has been considering
every phase of the matter of nationa!
defence and intends !mmediately on his
return to Washington to confer with the
Secretary of War and the Secretary of
the navy, his purpose being to procure
information on which he can formulate
a sane, reasonable and practical pro-
gtamime of national defence.”

This statement was issued after it
had been acknowledged that the Presi-
dent had written letters to the Secretary
of War and the Secretary of the Navy
assuring them of his deep interest in the
plans which they are undertaking for
the improvement of the national de-
fences and pointing out the necessity of
increasing the efficiency of the military
arms of the governmnet.

The issuing of the White House state-
ment is the first tangible evidence that
has appeared that the campaign started
by Representative Gardner of Massa-
chusetts and now countrywide in its
scope has brought the President to ths
point of entering upon a programme of
increased military development. The
change in the President'a attitude has
been very marked,

Secretary Garrison has not yet de-
cided definitely upon his plans, but it
was learned to-day that at present they
contemplate making available a first line
defence of 700,000 or $60,000 men. The
present land forces of the United States,
uy Suag militia, total only about 200,-
0

It is the understanding here that Sec-
retary Garrison's forthcoming recom-
mencations will be the most complete of
their character that have ever been made
by a Secretary of War. It is said that
he will tell the country frankly just what
he and his military advisers are satis-
fled is the minimum land force that
ought to be available for the defence of
the United States. It is understood that
the plans which Secretars ison now
has under consideration probably will in-
volve an expend!

to Berlin, will be forced to act in the |

event of further violation of American
rights.

Ay viewed here, the President's note is
open to two interpretations by the Ger-
man people. They may regurd the Ures:
ident’s severe language in describing the
Lusitania sinking and his forceful warn-
ing againat any further attack upon
American life as overshadowing and ob-
scuring all other features of the note.
If this view of the communication pre-
dominates, it is acknowledged here that
opinion of the German people is likely

to be aroused and that the situation;

will be full of danger.

If, on the other hand, the German |!
people shall emphasize chiefly § the
friendly character of the communica-

tion and the Presisent's willingness to
cooperate with Germany to inaintain
freedom of the seas, together with the
intimation that he will assert the rights
of the United States against Mngland,
the situation will be encouraging.

The President and his advisers are
extremely hopeful that the latter fea-
tures of the note will impress themselves
deeply upon the German mind and will
serve to modify the harsh feeling that
is Ikely to arise because of the firm
stand taken by
the German people
cation in this light) Washington offi-
eclals are hopeful that their gratitude
will be reflected by the military element

any further attacks upon American life,
av least pending further exchanges on
