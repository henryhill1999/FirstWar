then, With a final lurch of the top-
heavy huil, tragedy took a hand in the
picnic.

The music stopped in the middie of

tumbled the musicians, scattered and
mixed among the rolilng, struggling,
panicstricken passeng rs

The Deck Swept Clean,

It was a hill there was no climbing,
a hill that grew steeper and more im-
possible with each instant. There
seemed to be silence for a second as
the deck was swept clean. The water
rose to the port rail. It was the
signal for a chorus of screams, which
the water quickly drowned,

Some of the passengers on the open
upper deck, confident of their ability

to swim--boys and men, for the most
part—-jumped overboard. The rest, the
women and children, were sild into
the river. |

Below, on the boxed in between- |
decks, it was different--worse. At the
last moment, with the Eastland lean-|
ing at an angle of 45 degre s, there |
had been a rush for the companion-
ways. A few reached the upper deck
and comparative safety and then, with;
hundreds of men, women and children
Jammed in a death tangle, the “grand
staircase” gave way. Thus the main
escape from the entrapping lower
decks was blocked

Close to the Eastland’s berth the
river is only «a little more than 20 |
feet in depth. The big excursion
boat, with a beam of more than 40!
feet, went no further when her port
side found the bottom, She lay like |
a toy boat of tin wrecked in a
utter, her starboard half rising clear
of the water.

On to the starboard climbed the hand-

ful, perhaps 200, who had been for-
tunate cnough to be close to the upper |
rail and who had the presence of
mind to cling to it

Two general theories for the listing |

ere advanced in addition to the ques-

tion of overcrowding the boat, which!

Salle. This made her top heavy and
When the listing began there was no

counterweight to prevent a Capsizing,

2. The lines were not cast off and
the tug Was puiling the vessel toward
the river, which destroyed her equi
hbriam,

This second theory is advanced by!

William Flannigan, a lineman on the
boat, who says the tug was pull-
ing at the Mastland, aithough the lines
had not been cast off. This was de-
nied by Arthur McDonald, engineer of
the tug, who says that when the Last-
land turned over the tow line had

The polleeman who was on duty
at the pier says that when the listing

He ut once sent in an emergency call,
Some of the wiinesses say the listing
Was first noticed at least fifteen min-
lites before the capsize and before the

The theory of decreased ballast Is
founded on reports from members of
the crew, who say that in order to
move up part of the ballast was re-
moved, When the passengers crowded
to the river side of the vessel and the
listing began the ballast was not suffi-

then drove them to the overloaded upper

“One squad of the crew went out

It Was shove, shove-anything to get

“Some had sense enough, when they

Last Man Aboard Saved,

One of the most dramatic, complete
ind coherent of the survivors’ sturies
was that told by BE. W. Stadkey, head of
the Western Hleetrie Company's print-
ing department Sladkey, the last to
board the Mastland and the first to es-
cape, Walked over the upper side of the
vess | and jumped onto the deek of
the Kenosha without so much as wetting
his feet Many of those Who were saved
followed his example, he sald

Siadkey, who probably will be an im-
portant wit
vestigating bodies, praised the captain
of the Kenosha for his presenee of mind
in baching the tug against the upset
hastoand But he said the excursion
boat's offivers and crew gave no wart gz
iz disaster until the ves-
sel had hecled beyond an angle of 45
degrees

“It was about 7:80 o'clock when DT ran
along the deck to got aboard the Baste

 

ss before the various in

     

 

land,’ sald Sladkey “They had Just
huuled away and were casting off the
stern Dine TI noticed the boat was list-

ing to port and the thought flashed
into my mind that there might be
trouble, However, a crowd of about
thirty of the boys and girls employed
in my department were waving at me
ind calling to ome from the upper deck,
so T jumped aboard, As Toimade my way
fo the upper deck the list was even more
perceptible My people were up in the
bow abd Eo went toward them, keeping
on the starboard side, which was uppers
mogt and closest to the dock

“T knew a bit about boats and I

   

and 1 could not account for the list.

“The Eastland was leaning at an
angle of about 45 degrees when crew
and passengers became alarmed. After
} that it went over quickly and the shout
' of warning by satlors and officers came
| too late. In an instant passengers who
| were not gripping the starboard rail
or leaning against the siarbeard side of
| the deck house, were slipping down the
| deck. [nh another instant it Was ail over
| with the Eastland

‘I waited until! the post rail was in
the water and then jumped on the up-
per starboard aide, calling to others to
foliow me. A few did, I noticed, but
my ofy was drowned in the chorus of
screams that went up as the bastland
flopped over

“Apparently realizing what was com-
ing the captain of the Kenosha had
backed up until his stern war close to
the Eastland’s bow. The tug was still
a few feet away when I jumped, but I
made its deck and a number of others
came after me. Out of the whole party

from my department T saw only one!

alive afterward and that was one of
| the boys who had followed me.”

Within an hour or two of the disaster
the authorities started about the task

of fixing the responsibility. State's At- |

torney Hoyne took the matter in charge
and sent out Grand Jury subpoenas for
witnesses,

“Was the Eastland crowded beyond
, capacity Is the gravest question into
/ Which inquiry willl be made Kyewit-
hesses assert Uiat the boat wus carrying

the 2.500 for which she was licensed.
Some of the holiday makers who got as
far as the gangplank and decided to
take another boat, fearful of the crowds
on the Bastland, say that between 3,000

the tleket takers kept admitting excur-
sionists up to within a few minutes of
the cutastrophe

This ts denied by the Government tn-
spectors. Robert AI. McCreary, chief of
|} the marine bureau, says an exact check
of the passengers was taken and that as
soon as 2,600 had gone aboard no more
