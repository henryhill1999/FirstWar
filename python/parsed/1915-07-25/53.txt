shall I take?" At 40 it is

“What shall I stop taking?”
By the time he reaches the half cen-
tury, if he is that lucky, it is no longer

is “What

@ question of taking; now he begins
to ask “Where shall I go for my
health?”—and if not closely watched

he is very apt tp break into a sani- |

State money invested tn public !
health education is returning good |
dividends in the shape of reduced in- ,
fant mortality. Cold statistics prove
that an infant’s chances of survival
are so much better than they were
twenty years ago that even a Repre- |
sentative in the Legistature must be
impressed. Typhoid fever is getting
to be in reality the municipal dis-
grace it has long been in theory.
Childbirth is becoming safer year by
year; the disease of
youth, is ri¢htfully looked upon as no
more and no iess a penalty of wrong}
living than insanity; and even the
much too common “cold” is recog-
nized as a contact infection invited by |
crowding and insufficient open air 1

Bimultaneously with all these gains
goes a steady rise in the death rate)
for persons over 40 years of age, The
baffiing mystery of cancer contributes
a share toward this high mortality of
middle age, but the excessive death
rate is nevertheless mainly due to the |
wearing out of arteries. And a man
ean save his arteries if he tries.

Some physicians decry the practice |

tuberculosis,

of making a noise about blood pres- |
sure on the ground that it simply |
causes people unnecessary worry, |
since the mere presence of an ele-
vated blood pressure is in {tself not}
ot much significance as regards ae
general health On similar grounds

the popular fresh air, pure food and |
sanitary living crusades might be de-
cried for unquestionably the writings
and tea of health masters on
these subje serve to alarm and
worry many individuals who might
otherwise remain for a time in bliss-
ful ignorance of the dangers of being

hings

ts

alive, Still practical, unemotional life
insurance companies prefer not to
take a risk when the biood pressure

rises above 150 millimeters, for some
foolish reason or other,

The recent movement {inaugurated
by the Life Extension Society, under-
taking to teach people the value*and
wisdom of undergoing a periodic phys- |
ical examination as a sort of health |
assurance, will lengthen the expecta- |
tion of life for thousands of individ-
uals who imagine themselves sound
at 40 just by calling their attention
to the fact that their arteries are |
withstanding an unusual strain, if in|
no other respect at all.

The remarkable shortening of life
after 40 not merely relative, it is
eetual. Expectation of life, as deter-
mined by averages in large groups of
individuals, is measurably less to-day
than it was thirty years ago for those
of middle age. In other words arteries
are not wearing so well as they used
to before the days of the automobile.

Degeneration or disease of arteries |
is produced by poison, The poison is}
sometimes voluntarily taken into the |
circulation in the form of alcohol,
tobaeco and, in exceptional instances,
even tea, coffee and cocoa, Sometimes
the poison is accidentally absorbed, as |
in chronic lead poisoning in artisans,
or perhaps in girls and women who
use huir dyes containing lead or face
powders (ike Flake White) contain-
ing lead

Sometimes the poison is produced by
specific infection, as in certain consti-
tutional diseases But by far the
greatest factor of arterial disease, ar-
terio-sclerosis, or hardening of the
arteries, is poison which is elaborated |
within the body and retained in the
blood by reason of defective elimina-
tion. As doctors express it, in their
customary English, this means sub-
oxidation, slow metabolism, incom-
plete chemical reduction of the fuel
used to stoke the vital furnace. The
popular term for this kind of poison-
ing is autointoxication—but you can
have it without owning an automobile.

Arterio-sclerosis is the essential
basis of chronic Bright's disease, heart |
failure or degeneration of the heart
muscle, and apoplexy. In one indi-
vidual the heart bears the brunt of the
trouble, in another the kidneys give
out first, in still another the brain
shows the first serious signs of vas-
cular change.

“Now, see here,” said one old fel-
low of 42, when charged with harbor-
ing a high blood pressure and riding
too much in comfortable conveyances,
“as I understand it, I am growing
old.”

“Yes, and fast,” replied the doctor.

“Well, then, what's the use bother-
ing my head about it? Is old age cur-
able?”

“Old age is curable,” the doctor in- |
sisted. “It is curable if taken in|
time.”

You see, it 1s like consumption or
a bunion—you have got to recognize
it early, in its incipiency, if you would

is

 

 

nip it in the bud,

Are there any early symptoms
which would warn a person of 40
or thereabout that he is developing

arterio-sclerosis? In many cases, no; }
frequently the individual feels hate
and hearty, has a whale of an appe-
tite and looks it too, if you do not;
observe him too eritleally; perhaps
the very first hint he has that any-
thing not right is some accident
like cerebral hemorrhage--rupture of,
the sclerosed artery in the brain, a
stroke; or it may be sudden angina
pectoris (heart pang) or a mysterious

insufficiency,

Again, many persons with early
arterio-sclerosis will complain of noth.

ing more definite than a general fall- |

ing off in “pep” and endurance, which
is wrongfully attributed to “general
debility run down condition, spring
fever or “growling old."

A characteristic case is that of n|
younr man of 88, who began to take
on weet, feel drowsy in the day- |
time, f ied in the morning, have
dull, me headache much of the time,
the puin being vaguely located in the
back of the hend and the neek, eold

His smoking was cut down shamefully, ,
he was made to walk to and from bis_

office twice a day, he was
into the Bread and Milk Club (mem-

bers of which live on bread and nulk |

or crackers and milk only one day
a week) and persuaded that meat is a
needless luxury. In less than a month
his pressure fell to 140, but he felt
much more “chipper,” as he ex-
pressed it, that he scarcely minded tie
mercurial descent at all

Another good feeder, of 48, an office
man, took on a= slight pallor,
especially when tired; hig skin became
dry and flabby; his sleep was restless
end unrefreshing; he complained of
much “gas” and fulness after eat-
ing; but most particularly he found
that his wind wasn't as good as it
used to be couldn't walk many
getting all puffed up
about it, and when he tried to run to
cateh a car he nearly gaspad hie head

sound, produced by the rebound of
the blood against the closing sortic

valve, Was very sharp, and the blood
pressure was about thirty millimeters
too high

When the radial artery—the artery
in the wrist where the pulse is usually
feit—can be rolled under the

sues around it, we say it is sclerosed—
an excess of fibrous tissue has been
deposited in the arterial coat, some
of the elasticity
the artery is growing ola. The same
applies to the temporal artery
or in fact any artery where a pulse
can be felt, Persons with well estab-
lished arterio-sclerosig will exhibit a
wavy, tortuous, prominent temporal
artery, particularly when tired or ex-
cited,

Temperance in all things, most em-
phatically temperance in eating, is the
secret which Ponce de Leon failed to
find. Ponce died of poison—arrow pol-

Thousands of men even younger are

This is not the place to preach about
the modern evil of catering to appe-
tite, Knough to say that excessive
protein of animal origin is the chief
cause of carly decay after forty, and
that any man may limit himself to a
non-meat diet and still be capable of
feats of endurance, as Horace Fletcher
demonstrated when at 58 he visited
Yale gymnasium and outdid Yale's
best athletes in testa with the dyna-

insurance examination in his former | Mometer—Fletcher, the man not in

haustion from the effort. Yet a lot
of chaps around 40 imagine they must
have their meat two or three times
a day in order to do hard work!

Prof. Bishop of Fordham medical
school strongly advocates cheese as

 

a substitute for meat tn the diet of,

individuals with a tendency to arterio-

sclerosis, Cheese has an undeserved
evil reputation because it is often
taken as a condiment with a_ too
hearty meal or under circumstances
which certainly invite unrest if not
aotual distress, It is nevertheless
fully as nourishing as meat, being

rich in protein, Moreover, the protein
of cheese {s not so readily putrescible

| by the action of colon bacilli and allied

bacteria of the intestinal flora,
hence {t does not give rise to autoin-
toxication,

Bulgarian bacillus products,
retically, may be helpful if it be true
that the lactic acld germ tends to
crowd out or discourage the mullti-
plication of colon bacilll in the canal,
Rut in practice an intelligent regu-
lation of the diet seema to accomplish
quite as much alone as when the
various lactic Iacilius preparations
are simultaneously employed.

In the Orient rice is meat, and for
horse strength and endurance where
is the laborer that can beat the coolie?
Vegetarian diet 1s more or less a mat-
ter of religion in the Far Daet, Tem-

 

and,

theo- |

| weather,

perance in eating is rather a matter
of poverty in America, and in the
high cost of animal protein at any
rate poverty is fortunate,
meal, oatmeal, cheese, macaroni, po-
tatoes, beans and peas are cheap,
amply sustaining foods which meet
every requirement of brain worker or
muscle worker, as practical experience
has shown,

Still the youngster of 40 whose ar-
teries are growing stiff, the “tired
business man," the successful Ameri-
can hustler, would Hke to know what
he should take.

The answer is plain: Take two
miles of oxygen three times a day.

This is hard medicine to take. Our
nath nal tendency 1s to condense all
medicines into a pleasant pellet, even
at the loss of medicinal value. A
rural school in Indiana takes pride
in the fact that none of {ts pupils

MID all the talk about prepared.
ness everybody seema to forget
that there are probably 75,009
Mving graduates of the State agrici).
tural colleges, most of whom have
had four years training in military
tactics. Two-thirds of these men are
under 45 years of age, and it {s safe to
say that almost forty thousand of
them are physically fit for milttary
service. Not a few of them, indeed,
are already officers of the United
States army. The best of them are
nearer to the West Point standam
than any other body of men in the
United States.

Senator Morrill of Vermont way
back in 1862 conceived the notion that
the proceeds from the sale of pubiig
lands should go to maintaining tn the
several States of the Union colleges
where should be taught agriculture,
the mechanical arts and military
tactics. In some States colleges werg
founded to accept the benefits of tha
Morrill act. In others colleges already
in existence were designated as bene.
ficlaries under the act. The Stato
were a little slow about the matter
and some of the colleges were at fret
rather negligent about the military
side of the business,

Some States held onto their share
of land originally appropriated for the
fouttding of the colleges and sold tt at

 

@ great advance, (thers, being in a
hurry for endowment, immediately
turned their land into cash. For years
