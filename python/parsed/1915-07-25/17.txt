OIL FEVER RAGES IN | xs-v¥

CONNECTICUT TOWN

Mysterious Boring Operations
Stir Cupidity of the
Cheshire Folk.

NO REALTY IS FOR SALE,

 

 

 

Creatine, Conn., July 24.—"For sale”
signs have been stowed away, and own-

@itting tight pending the conclusion of |

the work of a crew of expert oil and | 5

natural gas drillers engaged in sinking |
@ well on the Rich farm, just below the |
Cheshire Inn, opposite the Maple Shade
@tation.

Borings have been made to the depth
of well over 2,500 feet during the past
two months, and it is said the drillers
have been instructed to continue to a
Possible depth of 4,000 feet before they
quit. Sample borings are being sent
daily to New York for metallurgical
tests, and the utmost secrecy is being |
maintained by the workmen as to what |
they are doing and what they expect)
to find. The people of Cheshire, how-
ever, are terribly worked up over the |

goings on, and they are dreaming dreams |
of great wealth as the oil fever grips
them. |

Griller to save your soul.

A Cheshire native who claims to know
what he is talking about, and every-
body just now is willing to believe any: |
thing, declares that the operations are |
being carpied on by a New York financier |
who is interested in railroads and oi! and |
@as properties throughout the country |

 

ua the result of his firm belief in his) |p

gon. The son, it is said, found indica-

tions of hidden wealth down deep in| |
the soil of Cheshire while a student at! |

the Cheshire Academy. He later took |
@ course at Sheffield, Yale, and when he |
got his diploma he was more convinced |
than ever by his investigations here- |
about that gas or oil was to be found. |

The drillers are employed by Flint
& Stroder, oil drillers of Forestburg, W. |
Va., and they are the mummest group in |
Connecticut. W. R. Gage, district man- |
ager of the Standard Oil Company, has |
denied the rumor that the Standard Oil

“Chief among the proposed changes in}
the salary schedules, as recommended |
by the Commiesioner, is a reduction In|
‘his own salary from $7,500 to $5,000.
This reduction is made so that the sal.

EDISON IN A POLICE MIXUP.

Gees to Wrong Place in Effort to
File Auto Complaint,

Oranae, N. J.. July 24.—Going to the
Police station here to-day to make a
complaint against a driver of an auto-
mobile truck, Thomas A. Edison learned |
from the desk lientenant that al- |
though he has lived in the Oranges |
for many years he is not entirely ac-
quainted with the territory protected by
the police of Orange and West Orange.

The inventor should have appeared at
the station house at West Orange, his
home town.

Mr. Edison and a friend were motor-
fng in the neighborhood of the Edison
plant on Lakeside avenue when the
truck came in sight. The driver had the
exhaust valve wide open and as it was
pointing to the ground the air raised
clouds of blinding dust. Mr. Edison
decided to make « complaint and told
his chauffeur to drive to the Orange
police station.

“You must file the complaint with the
West Orange police, Mr. Edison,” said |
Desk Lieutenant Callahan McCarthy, |
“as Lakeside avenue is in that town.” |

The inventor smiled as he said: “This |
fe my first visit to a station house in}
these parts and this accounts for my |
mistake.
enough to know the location of these,
but I must now confess I am not en- |
tirely familiar with police affairs.” |
