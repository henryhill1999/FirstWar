The navy lawn fete for the benefit of the Boston Navy Y. M. C. A., held at Beverly Farms on Wednesday of last week, was one of the most largely attended social events of the season on the New England shore. It attracted members of all the important summer colonies along the
coast. An exhibition drill was given by the sailors from the U. S. S. Georgia and a handsome sum was realized for the purpose for which the fete was held.
