The German Government probably
had a twofold reason in ordering this
boat from the Italian builders. The

engineers of the fatherland have run}

upon more than one snag in building
bigger and bigger Diesel propulsive
units, Grand Admiral von Tirpitz,
therefore, determined to seek
where for big and reliable motors.
At the same time the reputation for
surface speed which the Laurenti
boats had won for themselves from
the very start a'so had its weight with
the chief of the Imperial Admiralty,

These facts concern Americans be-
cause there is good reason to believe
that from this foreign source engines

than those made by
Germany's big U boat can be obtained,
American builders of submarines have
frankly said that the further develop-
ment of their boats was contingent
mainly upon the production of an effi-
clent motor. Without such a motor
the United States navy cannot be pro-
vided with submarines of the
modern capabilities,

“What,” the layman will ask, “are
these up to date possibilities?” The
answer may be found in some of the
performances of the German U boats.

all of the damage done was due to
the use of the torpedo. Even aboard

This latter arrangement got the gun
out of harm's way should a water-
logged timber or the like be encoun-
tered, and at the same time it les-
sened the resistance of the boat, thus
avoiding any reduction in submerged
speed, But in both cases it was need-
ful for the crew to come out upon the
exposed deck, and effective service in
rough weather was well nigh impossi-

The well known British ordnance
firm of Armstrong, Whitworth & Co.

has designed an up to date installation |
for 4 inch rapid fire guns which makes |
it possible to house the weapons within |

the hull, so that they are exposed
neither to the weather nor the sea ex-
cept for the time they are in action.
The guns are mounted upon an ele-
vating, revolvable platform and are
shielded overhead by means of a lightly
armored dome or hood,

This cover seals the barbette within
which the weapon crouches when out
of service. The lower edges of this
hood sink into a heavy gasket, or rim

A 4 inch rapid fire gun can hur! ex-
plosive shells weighing thirty-agd
pounds and it was projectiles of that
sort that ure said to have been used
by the big German U boat that chased

hood {s to shelter the gun crew from

that aircraft must be reckoned with.

sibles are being provided with anti-

of the Navy Department announced
that it has developed a satisfactory
rapid fire gun for just this service.
The experimental work was begun
more than two years ago by Rear
Admiral Twining, when the head of
the bureau. It 1s said that this gun
will be so arranged that it can be
housed below the deck of the super-
| structure,

All of these things indicate the
steady growth of the submarine and
its widening flelds of aggressive ser-
vice, The two seagoing submersibles
for which Congreas provided will in
ull probability be boats of about 1,200
tons submerged displacement. Un-
