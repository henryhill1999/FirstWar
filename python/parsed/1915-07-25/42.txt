By GEORGE BRONSON REA,

SIA Is knocking at our door.
Japan desires her people to |
enter America on the same

plane of equality as the white
races of Europe. She is firing the pa-
triotisin of her people and preparing
to go to war and compel at the point
of the bayonet the recognition of this
equality. Her intense pride is wounded
because of the discrimination against
her subjects, Her national honor 1s
involved.

Uniess the door is opened the pres-
ervation of her honor demands that It
be battered down by force. So Japan
is feverishly arming, laboring night
and day in the ceaseless work of en-
larging, strengthening and polishing
her already ponderous military ma-
chine against the inevitable day of
conflict, And America sleeps.

Japan wishes equal recognition in
America with the people of Europe.
Is it because her national honor com-
pels this recognition from America or
is it merely special pleading to ob-
scure other and more paramount is-
sues?

Japan is a very small country. It is
already overpopuated and congested
and room must be found abroad for
her rapidly increasing people. Ac-
cording to the highest authorities
Japan has nearly doubled her popula-
tion in the last fifty years. It is now
more than 70,000,000, In another fifty
or sixty yeara it will be 140,000,000,
In twenty-flve years—within the Ife-
time of the present generation--Japan
must find homes for 85,000,000,
Where?

In these few words is found the
paramount tssuo that confronus Japan
and keeps her mulers awake of nights
and causes alarm and uneasiness in
China and Russia, This great, over-
whelming fact, so potent to her imme-
diate neighbors, is, however, Invaria-

 

es scsi!

bly obscured or ignored altogether in
the many discussions and arguments
bearing on Japan and her policies
which appear in the American press,

It is time that the facts should be
brought home to the = siumbering
American. There can be no two do-
ductions from a clear and honest pres-
entation and examination of the facts,
Let the facts, then, speak for them-
selves,

The white races duplicate their num-
bers in about four generations, the
Oriental in three or less. Or it may
he expressed that the white races re-
quire about ninety yeara to double
their numbers, while the Oriental ac-
complishes the feat in from fifty to
sixty. In this short paragraph is em-
braced the great problem of the ages,
the vital question that Western civil-
ization, and America in particular, is
called upon to face,

As long as there is land enough In
the East to support the increase the
West will be in no danger, but as the
years of the century pass, the pres-
sure will break through all bonds, and
in the fight for the survival of the fit-
test the weakest will go to the wall.
Japan has arrived at the critical stage
of her history. The pressure from
within cannot be restrained, They
must have their place in the sun. The
same forces which impelled Germany
to seek colonies and empire and
brought on the world war are ac-
tively at work in Japan, only to a
wreater degree, America alone is
blind to the facts,

America has been singled out because
of her weakness and defenceless con-
dition as the great Western nation
who will be challenged and compelled
to open her doors to the hordes of
Asia, ‘The exclusion policy and the
Monroe Doctrine bar the way to the
golden lands of opportunity.

Japan is knocking at our doors.

 

Coolie laborers of the Orient, whose competition with American
labor is one of the reasons for the exclusion acts.

George Bronson Rea Says She Is Arm

Conflict for Race Supremacy

But above the appea} to our national
honor rises the instinct of self-pres-
ervation. This warns us in the most
emphatic manner that equality of the
races wil! within a generation trans-
form the Pacific coast States into a
new centre of Asiatic philosophy.

Racial equality with its concomitant
unrestricted immigration could have
only one result. Within twenty-tive
years fully one-half of Japan's con-
Stantly increasing surplus, or rough!y
17,000,000, would swarm into this prom-
ised land, Once here, firmly rooted in
the soil, their customs, traditions and
philosophy would do the rest,

If in the face of ignorance, poverty,
congestion, epidemics, convulsions of
nature and all the combined economic
drawbacks which make for race dimi-
nution Japan has doubled her populna-
tion in the last fifty years, what would
be the ratio of increase if all these
obstacles to racial expansion were re-
moved? There are now 72,000 Japa
nese inthe United States proper, exclu-
sive of those in our insular possessions
operating farms to the extent of 1)7,-
259 acres, valued at over $81,000,000
If racial equality carries with it un-
restricted immigration and the right
to own land, it Would seem to be only

maintain that !f California persists in |

creating trouble by her stiff necked at-

ish her.

Why should California be permitted
to drag the whole country into a war
over such a small matter, they con-
tend? If war should come as a direct
result of California's discriminations
against the Japanese in violation of
the treaty, why let California take the

All they can see is the treaty,
is right. Let down the bars, The
West needs a few hundred thousand
more Japanese to develop its re-
sources, and Eastern capital {s impa-
tient for the profits, denied by the labor
organizations of the coast, Let the
thrifty, sober, hard working and low
priced Japanese labor enter, and do
away once and for all with the possi-
bility of war with Japan.

There are many otherwise well in-
