| CHARGES HUGE GERMAN AMERICAN PLOT

Frederic William Wile, in Recent Book.

Tells of Propaganda to Upset
Policy of Neutrality

HAT the author terms “the
if amazing ramifications of the
German American plot to
capture the sympathy and

the the of the book “The German-
American Plot’ (C. Arthur Pearson,
Ltd). by Frederic William Wile. Last

winter Mr. Wile spent some months
in us country investigating the Ger-
man American situation here, and he
sums up the results of his search thus:

“No propaganda erusade in history
was eve! organized with such
thoroughness, or carried on with such
effrontery.’

“Stated in broad outline,” he goes
on, “the German American campaign
in Arerica was concentrated on an
attempt to force the United States

Government to abandon its attitude of |

uncompromising neutrality, not = di-
rectly in favor of Germany, but by
action designed directly to embarrass
the Allies The campaign set itself
three cardinal purposes:

“(1) To bring about an embargo on
the exportation of munitions of war.

“(2) To embroil the United States
with England on any possible pre-
text — contraband, ship seizures, flag
‘violations,’ or any other issue which
arises naturally or can be artificially
manufactured.

“(3) To inflame Far Western antip-
athies to Japan and the Japanese, with
a view to a Japanese-American war.

“All the efforts of the vast German
propaganda machine were bent in the
directions indicated. The efforts, of
course, were subtie—as subtle as any-
thing connected with German diplo-
macy can be. Early failure—failure
either to influence public opinion de-
csively or blackmati the Govern-

ment——only incited the Germans to re- |

double their efforts.

| Wired the German Ambassador. ‘Ger-

man Americansm’ had at last come |
into its hyphenated own. |

“Presently Von Holleben turned his |
attention to the centralization of all |
branches of organized German life in,
the United States. Town and city |
branches of this, that or the other |
verein, clubs, veteran unions, church |
societies, rifle associations must be
turned into State organizations and
State organizations again into na-
tional leagues. On April 16, 1899, the
‘German-American Central Alliance of
Pennsylvania’ was founded ‘to give
impulse to the idea of the consolida-
tion of the German-American element.’

“Since then the alliance’s progress
has steadily continued. To-day its

| membership is over 2,000,000, includ-
' ing German born citizens of the United

States and their American born de-
scendants. It is by far the most
powerful, numerically, of all German-
American national organizations—the |!
various organizations of the thousand
and one village, town, city, county and
State organizations which are sleep- |
lessiy promoting Deutschtum under |
the guise of American citizenship and |
patriotism in their respective indi- |
vidual communities. |

“They represent, according to a Ger-

'man-American boast which errs on’

the side of exaggeration, a round one- |
third of the voting strength of the
United States in a Presidential elec- |
tion. Dr. von Holleben, now gathered
to his fathers, might well be proud of

cans on the ground that they had ob-
tained naturalization under false pre-

tences, for, though they own alle-|
giance to the United States, they are)

practising allegiance to the German
Emperor.’

“Thus spoke a distinguished Amer-
{oan politician, who may be the next
President of the United States, when
I sought his opinion of the methods
adopted by Germany to biadkmail the
American people into sympathizing
with ‘Kultur’s’ cause. Six weeks in
the United States, in constant contact
with men of affairs of aJjl sorts
statesmen, bankers, editors, mer-
chante, manufacturers, university
presidents and lawyers—left on my
mind the indelible impression that the
German propaganda has had but one
tangible, definite result. It has, in
consequence of its vehement impu-
dence, outraged the feelings of five-
sixths of the people of the country
who are not of German extraction oF
‘pro-German’ for reasons of selif-in-
terest.

“For six months following the out-
break of the war, roughly up to Feb-
ruary 1, the Germans waged ‘a whirl-
wind campaign’ throughout the coun-
try at an expense believed to have
been not less than £200,000 a month

But the colossal effort to stampede |

American opinion, launched like a

thunderbolt with a view of sharp and |

decisive results, just as the German

General Staff planned to storm Par's |
in six breathless weeks, failed. Their |

“A Fifth avenue hostess who hired

formed that if her next party was

marked by such violently ‘anti-Ger-

create a scene by deserting the dinner

come to the house again unless guar-
