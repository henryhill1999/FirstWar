ATTRACTIVE FEMININE HEADGEAR FOR USE IN THE COUNTR

Charming Addenda to

the Informal Costume

Supplied Dy Season's

Novelties in Weave
and Shape

By ELEANOR HOYT BRAINERD

OUNTRY hats for midsummer
wear are particularly attractive

this season.

By this we do not of necessity mean
6ports hats, though these too are more
than usually varied and interesting,
but merely hats of an informal gort
such as may be worn with simple
country costumes but would look out
of place on city streets.

Bome ‘of these might serve admir-
ably, for some sports uses, but have
not been designed primarily for such
purposes, and others, though gay and
far removed from formal dress asso-
ciations, would be entirely out of
place with sports costumes.

There are, for instance, the open
Wenve straws, as open as a cane chair
eeat, eometimes lined, sometimes lined
only in the crown, sometimes lined
not at all. They are shady brimmed,
though the sunlight sifts through upon
the face and hair, and they are usually
trimmed in garden or field flowers.

Then there are the flopping brimmed
Leghorns with trimmings of the sim-
plest, or a narrow velvet ribbon run-
ning around the crown cnd falling in
two ends in the back, or a simple clus-
ter of flowers, or a ecarf of taffeta.

Applique designs play an important
role among these country and garden
hats and there is scope for consider-
able artistic taste in the choosing and
posing of the applied destgns which
are selected chiefly from gay chintzes
and cretonnes. A soft, rather rakish
wide brimmed shape in peanut straw,
let us say, Will have an effective clus-
ter of cut out flowers applied at the
left front, running sketchily up upon
the crown and out over the brim. Or
the applique design may be confined to
the upper side of the wide brim or
may run around the crown, or may be
repeated on each side of the crown.

This treatment is extended to hats
of plain one tone linen or silk as well
as to those of straw and is often very
successful.

Entire hats of chintz and cretonne
and black print linens are many, and
while some of them come naturally
under the headings of sports hats,
others are fitted for any sort of in-
formal country wear and are charm-
ing with linen and muslin morning
frocks. A facing of fine straw in the
dominant color of the chintz design
is @ feature of some of these hats,
but more of them have brim facings of
plain toned linen or of the floral fabric.

Wide brimmed hats of organdy,

white or tinted and trimmed in scarfs |

and bows of the organdy, are at-
tractive accompaniments to muslin
frocks. Finely dotted swiss {s used
for hats of the same type, while both

organdy and swiss models often have |

taffeta or satin ribbon trimming in

place of the self scarfs and bows.
Muslin and swiss and linen are clev-

erly combined with straw after the

TESTED

N these days of warm weather
frozen dishes prove the most ac-
ceptable sweets for all occasions,

Little trouble attends the serving of
them, and their preparation requires
no more effort or expense than the
usual dessert. There are certain rules,
however, which must be followed if
success is desired, and where a little
care is exercised in the preparation,
the results are so worth while as to
entirely reward the effort expended.

A liquid must always be thorough-
ly cold before it is turned into the
freezer can, and where the recipe calls
for a liquor the mixture to which it
is to be added must be frozen solid be-
fore the liquor is added, or the result
will be soft and mushy.

Mash fruit thoroughly before com-
bining it with a creamy or sherbet
mixture, and if candied fruit is re
quired, soak it in sherry for half an
hour and when the cream is almost
frozen, drop in the marinated fruit.
Where a velvety cream ts desired, turn
the crank slowly at first, and as the
freezing progresses accelerate the
movement.

The following: recipes are unusual
and deserve a trial:

tifully delicate mauve color.

ly. Return to the double boiler and
cook until the custard coats a spoon,
beating it all the while with a wire
whisk. Lift immediately from the fire

TODAY’S BEAUTY AIDS

To clear up and whiten the skin
and secure that charm of pink and
white youthful freshness so much
desired by all women you will find it
far safer to rely upon a good face

lotion rather than powder. To get

rid of that shiny and muddy appear- |

ance in your complexion, dissolve
four ounces of spurmax in one-half
pint hot water, and add two tea-

spoonfuls glycerin. Apply this to.

your face, neck and arms, rubbing
gently until dry. This lotion does not
akow or rub off like powder and is
sanch better. It {s splendid for re-
Moving tan, freckles, pimples and
sallowness,

You can make a delightful sharn-
poo for a very trifling cost if you get
from your druggist a package of
canthrox and dissolve a teaspoonful
in a cup of hot water, Pour a little
at a time on the sealp and rub
briskly. This creates an abundance
of thick, white lather that thor-
oughly dissolves and removes all
dandruff, excess oil and dirt. After
rinsing, the hair dries quickly, with
a fluffiness that makes it seem heav-
ier than it is, and takes on a rich
luster and a softness that makes
arranging it a pleasure.—Ady,
