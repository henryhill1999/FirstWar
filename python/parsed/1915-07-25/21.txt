The figures, so far as they are as-

Am effective presentation of statistics
relating to various phases of the war
is made in the tables and diagrams

The most accurate figures with re-
spect to military losses come from

does not take account of the loss of |
commerce and the tremendous mneuee |

conceal as well as it can the extent of
its losses in men and money. ‘
An examination of tables A and C
will impress one with the enormous
casualties as compared with the num- ;
ber of men assigned to each nation.
The apparent incongruity is easily
explicable. While nominally the war
strength of the different nations is as
given in table A, it should be remem-
bered that these are official figures |
published before actual war. It ia
well known that unparalleled efforts

there are the enormous losses of the
nations, both commercially |
and industrially, besides the great
expense to which each nation has been
