How to Stop a Riot.

When assistance from the National
Guard must be called to the protec:
tion of life and property, those on
whom responsibility rests might study
with advantage the methods adopted
by General Ror in handling the Cro-
ton Dam riots of 1,

Instead of scattering a few come
panies here and there to be insulted,

etoned and rusbed by overw helming |
the

numbers, General Ror invesied
Aisturbed district with a whole army
of borse, foot and artillery, which
from the instant of its arrival held
¢he situation in an iron grip. With-
out firing a shot, without one of his
own wen or of the recent rioters suf-
fering so much asa serateh, and with-
out the destruction of a dollar's worth
of property, he insiantly Imposed a
peace that passed the understanding
of the bewildered demagogues nud
agitators who until then had been the

oracles and inspiration of the out:
break. Law and order in terms of
an adequate armed and uniformed

force was comprehensible even to the
dullest of the confused intellects with
which he bad to contend,

When force must be used the les
gon of General Ror's success is that
it should come not in hesitating, half
hearted driblets, but overwhelming
aud irresistible.

Mr. McAneny Will Not Be Neglected.
Senator Eton R. Brown of Water-
town opened his $25,000 non-partisan
inquiry into the tinancin! affairs of
this city last week, to close it again
wutil August 2. The reason for Sen-
ator Brown's) adjournment lot
officially disclosed, but the coincident
activities of the Thompson commit-
tee, which is wasiing more of the
taxpayers’ money hereabout, furnishes
explanation of his postponement,

While Senator Brows was setting
¢he stage for his publie spirited per-
formances, the Thompson committee,
with greater enterprise than good
taste, had the andacity to anticipate
the Jefferson county philosopher by
¢ntroducing a witness to assail Presi-
dent Geornce McAneny. Thus Senator
Brown's plans were upset, and his
mighty engine of disinterested correc-
tion was obliged to suspend its oper-
ations for a time.

But Mr. ‘McANeny should not de-
epair. The momentary confusion
caused by imperfect functioning of
two mighty organs of reform will
@oon be overcome. The subordinate
ebjects of the Thompson committee
will not long be conceated’ from its
@irectors, and when they are under-
@tood Mr. McANENyY will be estab
shed solidly in the conspicuous post
designed for him in the programme
proposed by the leader of the Senate,

principle of 1912 and a curious dis-
trust not merely of radical or direct
dentocracy, but of democracy itself,
Mr. Davenport notes an inclination
in the minds of many thoughtful per-
@ons in the country toward a “semi-
appointive Juddclary” :

“The Governor, the natural and re-
sponsible head of public opinion, who is
coming to be held more strictly to ac-
count by the people than any other pub-
lic officer in the State, shall first: recom-
mend persons for the higher judgeships.
Their names shall go upon the ballot
with the words after them: ‘Recom-
mended by the Governor” In the 6ame
group ehall be any other names sug-
gested by a sufficiently large number of
petitioners. And on élection day the
people shall choose between them.”

Whether this plan be fantastic, re
actionary or unworkable, and in this
State at least we canuot conceive that
any considerable number of people
would support Ii, we mention it, as

of Mr. Davenport's, as an indication
of how far Progressive ideas have
been modified or supplanted since
1912. In the general tendency, irre-
spective of particular propositions, is
not a Progressive reaction and pos-
sibly a hope of Republican reunion to
be detected?

IMMORTALITY.
Nature and Limitations of God, Soul,
Time and Space.
.o THe Epiron of Tite SUN—Stre In

He Sun of July 18 W. C. Ross gave
us what he called an “apodictic proof”
that an infinite and eternal being can-
not exist. “Apodictic’ ordinarily means
indisputable, above all contradiction,
and the epithet evidently is thus used
by Mr. Ross.
cation for Mr. Rose's proof would be
salva reverentia, leaky. His apodictic
proof is that an infinite being cannot

exist except in infinite space, and an
eternal being cannot exist exeept in
infinite time; but there are no such
things possible as infinite spaee and
time (which is certainly a truism);
therefore there is no infinite, eternal
being. After a manner he proves his

minor proposition, but he assumes the
major as true. Just here is the hole
in that “apodictic’ proof. This major
happens to be so false that it is a cons
tradiction in terms, like a square circle.
The consequence, then, is irrelevant, to
put it mildly, The only proof he could
offer for the major is that all beings,
if they exist at all, must occupy space
and exist in time, therefore infinite,
eternal being if it exists is in space and
time; but space and time to hold an
infinite eternal being must be trfinite
and eternal; which is absurd The
trouble with such an argument is that
its first premise is nonsense

There are several meanings of the
term “space,"” Newton's, Leibnita's, Des-
cartes’s, Kant's, and others similar to
these, which are all erroneous; and the

true signification, Every one of these
men, however, even Kant, makes quan.
titative extension essential to space,
that is, extension by parts; and, of
course, extension by parts is contrary
to the very definition of infinite, eter-
hal being Space formaliv is a ca-

pacity or possibility of receiving within
its comprehension either a# solid exten-
sion oF & motion mensurable through
extension, a8 opposed It
differs from place, which has to do with

SUCCESSION,

(lod are not straw arguments set up to
be kicked to pieces as Mr. Ross's argu-
ment is if there is a God this being
is necessary (as opposed to contingent),
self-existent; its essence always has
een actualized into existence and al-

ways will be, and that from itself alone.
A contingent being is one that happens
to be (Ccontingere); it is of necessity
neither existent nor non-existent; it has
no logical aversion to existence, but tn
itself it has no more than a possibility
of actuality A necessary being, on the
contrary, essentially must be; it cannot
not be; it is absolutely and essentially
its own existence,

infinity beyond infinity for those who
can really comprehend the meaning of

the word “infinity.”

Mr. Rose ie merely jugeling with
termes misapplied, not with facts of
philosophy. The words “space and
“time” are in their essence infinite. The

mind, however, rarely considers
problems than those of lim-
ited spaces within space and limited
times within time.

Specifically there js no such thing as
a “point in infinite apace nor a “mo.

SAFE BRIDGE PA VEMENT.

Resisting Powers of Creosoted Wood
Blocks.

To THE Eorrorn of Tite Sux—Ser; The
letter signed by Walter i. Kruessi call-

 

ing the attention of Commissioner
Kracke to the il effects which might
arise should the Brooklyn Hridge be

paved with creosoted wood blocks gives
an erroneous impression relative to the

inflammnability of such material

In the attempt to draw an analogy
between the burniog of the Belle Isle
Dridgs in Detroit and the possible de-
struction of the Brooklyn Bridge from
the sane cause should ft be floored
With creosoted Wodd blocks the author
should have taken into consideration
the fact that the Belle Isle bridge was
originally designed for an untreated
plark floor, and when finally repaved

with creosoted wood blocks {t Was un-
able to withstand the additional dead
weight of a concrete sub-base, conse
quently it Was necessary to use creo.
soted string.rs and sub-planking.

Had the Helle Isle bridge been paved
with creosoted blocks over a conerete
sub-base {t could not have been de-
stroyed by fire, or had it had a creo-
soted sidewalk Instead of an uncreo-
sidewalk the probabtities are
that the flames would not have gained
tmiuch headway

Contrary to the usual construction of
a moder creosoted wood block bridge
floor, the joists extended lengthwise of
the bridge, and were not of steel but of
creosoted 4 by 14 inch Southern yellow
pine timbers placed edgewise and spaced
18 inches centre to centre.

Above these creosoted joists a sub-
flooring of creosoted 4 inch planks was
placed, and directly upon this sub-
floor ths creosoted wood blocks were

| laid, and every third row of blocks was

tocnailed to the sub-planking and all
interstices between the blocks were filled
with dry sand swept in

The only steel stringers supporting the

'4 by 14 inch ereosoted wood Joists were
placed transversely across the bridge
about every thirty feet; consequently

 
 
 

r the fire secured a good start the
ridge was entirely destroyed, inasmuch
as when the creosoted wood Joists were
burned sufficiently there were no longi-
tudinal steel joists to help support the
dead load of the thoor, and the burning

| joists and planks supporting the wood

ous |

blocks were projected into the river,
and the creosoted joists and sub-plank-
weakened the flames

ing Were so by
that they gave way long before the fire
could reach the creoseted wood block

Wearing surface
| thoroughly interviewed many of the

bridwe tenders and investigated the con-
dition of the few spans remaining in-
tact immediately atter the fire and
found that it had been no uncommon

occurrence for fires to originate on the
‘thoroughly dried, untreated pine side-
walk” the bridge at least a dozen
tines eVery summer

In such cases the fire could be traced

ol

 

  

   

to discarded cigarette or clgar stubs
lodged between the tinder dry planks
of the sidewalk.
| These sidewalks had no foundation
and plenty of air found {ts way up be-
tween the interstices of the sidewalk
planks and supplied the oxygen so es-
sential to any tlame

‘The most generally accepted theory
as to the orl of the Belle Isle bridge
tire is that the strong wind carried
some of the brands or live coals from
a tur wagon passing over the bridge to

yr 200 miles like the top ridge of Orange |
