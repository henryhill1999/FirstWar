Newport, July 24.
. SBTER ROW" is the nickname
Pp that has been given thie week
to that section of Bellevue
avenue in the vicinity of the Casino |
building where most of the summer
stores are located. The cause of the
name is the many posters that are be- |
ing exhibited in the various store win- |
dows calling attention to the coming |
events for charity and otherwise in the
summer colony.

Probably no more elaborate array of
posters has ever been collected in so
small a section of any city, especially |
a summer resort city, as are displayed |
there, There are posters in olls,!
posters in water colors and printed
posters of many hues.

The poster that has attracted the
most attention up to the present time |

> one that was painted by Robert}
lteid for the Fashion's Passing Show, |
‘hich took place at Mrs. O¢elrich’s |
tose Cliff this afternoon and evening. |

s was the portrait of a woman, al
member of the summer colony, but |

¢ identity of the one that posed was
arefully shielded by a mask over al
of the face. Still there were a
good many guessing contests as to the
identity of the woman.

J. Stewart Barney, who ts something

f an artist as well as an author, has |
is) painted a water color poster for|
the dancing contest that {fs to be a|
feature of the suffrage dansant to be}

given at Mrs. Belmont's Marble House
next Saturday. This is a picture of
lancers in the woods. Another water
-o.or poster for the same affair, but in|
particular reference to the children’s|
vontest, is the work of Addison Meizner
f New York, who has been visiting}
here during the week. This depicts a)
boy and girl dancing, and the “Votes)
fu Women” is not forgotten. |

Another of the mystery variety of|
posters is one that has appeared or|

the brush of Mr. Reid, It will be for
Mrs. Beimont's affair next Saturday. |
In this it was announced that Mrs,|
Keimont has selected a name to post
as the handsomest suffragist in New- |
port. The name was not announced,
