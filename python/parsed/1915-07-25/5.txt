VILLA-HUERTA COMBINE.

; Scheme Satd to He ‘Permios for
Union Against Carransa.

Inu. Paso, July 24.--Outlines of a plan
said to have been concetved by Foreign

 

| Minister Miguel IMaz Lombardo of the

Villa ministry and Gen. Felipe An-

|geles, Villa's chief of artillery, with a
; View to the ultimate tranquilligation of

Mexico, appeared to-day. The plan as
revealed involves persuading Villa. to
leave Mexico and turn the command of
his army over to a new leader who
would receive the support of the Huerta
faction and the Villa party combined,
Gen. Villa, who was firet reported to-
day to have turned back to Torreon
from Chihuahua city after having heard
of the plan, was later reported to have
decided to continue his trip to the bor-

jder, The tine of his arrival here is
indefinite

That a coalition of practically all the
Mexican factions, large and small, op-
posed to the Carranga party was planned
by Villa's artillery chief and Mintster of
Foreign Relations was plainly indicated

| by the events of the last week, according

to men intimately acquainted with the
situation. The alleged organizers and
leaders of the new coalition movement,
for which the moral support of the

[American Government was sought by

Gen. Angeles and Senor Lombardo dur-
ing thelr recent visit in Washington, In-
cluded Gen. Jose Isabel Robles, former
Minister of War under Villa; Lie Adrian
Benavides, formerly legal ad-

 

| Vieer to Villa; Gen, Vietorfano Huerta

and several men who have fought under
him; Gen, Juan Cabral, a Villa corm-

| Mander in northwest Mexico; Gov, Jose

Maytorena, Villista Governor of Sonora,
and prominent representatives of the
Mexican Catholle party.

The object of Augeles's and Lombar-
do's visit to Washington, {t is intimated,
was to persuade the Wilson Administra-
tion that a coalition of all the Mexican
factions opposed to Carranza could be
accomplished if the moral support of
the American Government were given.
It ts wal) that Villa was to’ be told on
hie arrival at the border that if he would
relinquish his command temporartly to
some man the American Government
thought strong enough to pacify Mexico
the moral support of the Administration

BRITISH SHIP AFIRE.
AT 23D STREET DOCK

Twenty-four Thousand Bags
of Sugar, Valued at S120,.
000, Destroyed.

ORIGIN NOT ESTABLISHED

 

 

Fire of unknown orla@in started in cha
hold of the British steamship (irags de
at 2:40 o'clock yesterday afterno ny
while she was being loaded alongsiie the
dock at Twenty-third street and the
Hudson River and destroyed twenty-four
thousand bags of refined sugar, value!
at $5 a bag. Damage to the ship \
estimated by Chief “Smoky” Joe Mart»
at $10,000.

While the stevedores, composed ey
tirely of Italians, Poles and negroes
were at work In hateh No 7 in the
forward part of the ship they were sy
denly engulfed by a wall of flames thy
ran along the lint of the bags woh
alarming speed afd many of then how
narrow escapes from serious burns on
attempting to reach the deck There was
no explosion or warning of any kind
before the flames burst upon them

The ship has been carefully guarded
by two men at each gangplank since ite
arrival in New York from the West
Indies a few days ago, and Capt David
Williamson said it would have been tm.
possible for any spy to have come aboard,
Several members of the crew said they
saw a strange man on deck during the
noon hour, but no verification of this
was to be had. A possible explanation
of the fire was made by Capt. John M.-
Grath of the North River Stevedoring
Company.

Capt. MoGrath said the boat was of
5,100 tons cargo displacement and that
a very short time had been allowed to
load her. She was to have 6alled on

Monday for Gibraltar and from there
with sealed orders The sugar was
rushed from the refinery tn Yonkers to
the boat all week and constant orders
were received to hurry the loading. Yes
terday’s shipment of 24,900 bags ma
have come from the refinery still hot,
the captain said, and this combined with
the lint dust in the hold may have
caused spontaneous combustion

The alarm was anewered by two bat-
tallons under Chief Martin. A hurry
