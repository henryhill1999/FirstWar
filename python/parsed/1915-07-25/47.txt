HEREF Is an old chap, a natural-
ized American, decidedly Teu-
tonic in aspect and accent,,
who lives in section number

66 of the Richardson Construction
Company's realty scheme in the Yaqui
Valley In Mexico. His name is Bruss, ,
which conveys to one nothing of his |

ness and his queerness, his originality
of mind and action and_ speech,
which mark him and make of him!

and whose raids strike terror into the

newspapers, One must not

This has been granted in no un-!
certain terms, A marine expedition- |
ary force has been despatched to
Mexico with instructions to land and{
to assist settlers to places of safety, |
provided the settlers so desire. Can!
we ever refrain from joking? Those}
who did not leave Mexico two years

ing to his ranch from which he has
been absent several days, despite raids
and reports of murder and arson in
the Yaqui Valley. Apparently the
idea of leaving his pluce never occurs
Of such stuff were made the
early settlers in the United States.
Bruss has cleared a place round
his ranch and the nearest bush
capable of hiding a Yaqui is five hun-
dred yards away. That was a wise
precaution, since experience has made
of him at twice that
range, whereas the Yaquis, in his
estimation, are most ineffective with
firearms, In fact he tells the story
of two Americans who were surprised

;and attacked by these Indians at a

range of about forty feet. The In-
dians fired at the whites thirty or
forty times, finally hitting one of the

men in the hand.
Bruss has now only three men to
assist him in his horticulture They

all take turns standing watch In the
lookout above the ranch house, where,
glass in hand, the watcher scans the
country for suspicious looking char-
acters.

His house is connected with others
by telephone, though at considerable
distances, This affords the few re-
an opportunity to
prepare for defence. In one instance
a friend of his some miles away,
hearing that Bruss was being at-
tacked, by Yaquis, begged him to
leave the receiver down in order that

he might hear the shooting. A pleas- |

ant commentary on neighborliness
and the isolation of his ranch.

Once last year when large bands
of Yaquis were raiding the valley a
dozen or more Mexican soldiers made
their appearance at his door. They
stayed with him for twenty-four
hours, consuming all his provender
and demanding his remaining hogs.
In the morning the ranch was at-
tacked by Indians,

Upon their appearance the soldiers
fired several times tnto the air and
forthwith began to make excuses
One could see no Yaquis; another
could not load his rifle. The sergeant

he killed seven of the attacking force
and finally drove off the band, num-

then he decided to invent and perfect
a species of automatic Yaqui alarm,
which would advise him of the pres-
ence of these undesirables,

To that end he secreted a gun to

A few members of these marauding
bands speak broken English and show
a previously acquired familiarity with
the valley, its trails, water courses
and the location of its most valuable
crops, But it has only been in recent
parece that these Indians have
ladopted the sundry forms of violence
sanctioned in modern warfare, Some
of it is doubtless due to the presence
of the dauntless Bruss and others of
his ilk, who play no favorites, and
with whom the shooting of suspicious
looking characters, whether “tame”
or “wild” Yaquis, {s an open season
the year round.

the Yaquis are more suspicious and
more inclined, in their turn, to kill
foreigners,

Bruss is {n no way optimistic over
the future of Mexico. The Yaqui
situation, however, is uppermost in
his thoughts. And in it he sees no
improvement.

Time was, during the Diaz regime,
when unruly or turbulent Indians
were expatriated to a penal settlement
{in the province of Yucatan, or were
carefully shipped aboard a schooner
bound for a deserted istand in the
Gulf of Callfornia, During the in-
cumbency of the worthy but visionary
Madero the Yaquis were given axri-
cultura)
farming. Most of these speedily
into money or arms
ammunition,

Now these Indians constitute a not
inconsiderable portion of the inhabi-
tants of the State of Sonora, and have
consequently been aided and abetted

were

whose troops are Yaquis or possess
Indian affillations, It cannot be
pected, therefore, that Maytorena’s re-
cent well intentloned promises to pro-
tect Americans to the best of his
ability w result in real benefit to
the settlers in the valley.

It was only recently that 360 of his
troops went into the valley, engaged
in a battle with the Yaquis and lost
nineteen in killed and wounded, while
twenty-one deserted to the enemy. The
others returned to Guaymas.
Governor can hardly be able to pro-
tect lives and property in the Yaqui
Valley with the aid of troops largely
Yaqui, and at the same time not alien-
ate the men who form such a con-
siderable part of his fighting force. He
must indeed be a man of wondrous
character and persuasion to be able to
impress upon his ignorant soidlery the
rectitude of his endeavors,

Bruss has no confidence in such pro-
tection. He knows too well the temper
of the natives, and their desire to fight
