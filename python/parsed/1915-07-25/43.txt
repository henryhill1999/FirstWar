Man jaws unshrinkingly ;

When Ru a turned Warsaw into
@ great fortress, one of the greatest
in the empire, the city of the Polish
heart wetched the proceeding with
surpicion. From the beginning of the
fortification of the city, when the
@reat citadel of Alexander was built,
the Foles have believed that Russ
Was less concerned in protecting
Warsaw than she wae in protecting
herself against Warsaw

Certainly Russia has had more than
@ single purpose in view in the mighty
works that she has built. The citadel
of Alexander in the suburbs on the
Vistula was built in 1832-35 as a pun-
ishment for the insurrection of 1831.
Although has been remodelled from
time to time, i isefulness under mod-
ern conditions inconsiderable, for its

 

  

  
 

6ix forts are all too near Warsaw
to give the city any protection Its
only usefulness might be in affording

® last protection to the railroad bridge
which here the Vistula di-
rectly under

crosses
its guns.

But this citadel was the beginning
of the works which have made War-
e.w and the nearby stronghold of
Novo-Georgievsky two of the four
rst class fortifications of the nation.
Leyend the summer resort of Novo-
Alexandra and the chateau is another
intehiy fortress at Ivangorod, Nearly
a score of forts have been built to pro-
tect the city from capture, or, as the
Peics believe, to protect Russia from
revolution.

Warsaw is a reflection of the spirit

 

 

   

ct the Polish people. It is brilliant
an melancholy, and its life is a life
of sunshine and shadow. Its streets

are a-rush with industry and pleasure,
it is more like western Europe than
any other city of Russia, Indeed the
traveller coming from the East here
first encounters Europe, but the im-

  

pression it makes on the thought-
ful pers is on the whole mournful.
Too many memories of horrors are

astir and too many evidences of mis-
ery and oppression are about to make
its gayety seem very spontaneous.

In ths last century Warsaw was sec-
one only to Paris in brillianecy. Now
it is merely a Russian provincial city.
Then, owing to the well known fond-
ness of the Polish nobles for display,
it had a character of prodigal gran-

deur, the decay of which is dismally
evident at every turn.
Other cities as important as War-

Baw have been the object of the cire
and pride both of their rulers and of
their people. But the rulers of War-
Baw have had pride in her, and
her people have not been permitted
Pride, Since the revolution of 1863
nothing at all has been undertaken
for the cleanliness or well being of the
town.

The paving stones have fallen away
from each other in ridges and holes,

been erected in all that time. The

whole of the civil and military admin-

Thorwaldsen's statue of Copernicus,
which is so popular that the common
people call a statue a Copernicus, Is

The rule of the Russians in War-
SaW Was SO Severe that not until 1862

and 1863 did the revolutionary spirit
find any means of outward expres-
sion, The insurrections of those years

were followed by such terrific reprisals
in the way of executions, confiscations,
banishments, and every other means
known to a conscientious Russian
official with imagination, that for an-
other fifty years the Varsovians were
compelled to unprotesting ackno /l-

jedgment of Russia's checkmate,

the Poles who informed against their |

fellow countrymen.

Warsaw's history, full of battle and
Dloodshed, of capture and recapture,
is so dismal that it must of necessity
have a reflection in the spirit of the
people. Like most great European
cities, the precise date of its founding
is not known, The Duke of Mazovia
built a castle on the present site on
the Vistula as early as the ninth cen-
tury, but the city i not mentioned
in annals until 1224

The continuation of this boulevard
is the Ujazdowska Aleja, which is the |
Champs Elysees of Warsaw. It is
planted with lime treas «nd lined with
cafes. clubs, concert gardens and the
little tea and cake shops that the
peor’e@ love.

Along these two streets flows the life
of the city. The street traffic is consid-
erable and lively, for the cabbies of
Warsaw always drive at top speed, |
with a@ fine disregard for the condition |
Flower girls crowd the |
streets and orchestras play in every |
corner cafe. |

Here all afternoon and during the
early evening swarm the carriages of |
the aristocracy, a little dingy perhaps, |
if they belong to Poles, but sure to be
occupied by women of unusual beauty.
Gorgeous among the carriages are the
Russian equipages, always occupied by
officers driven by coachmen in the
long, black national costume, with a
blue searf around the waist. |

Along this street too flows the other |
side of the city life. Here is beggar-
dom at its worst. There are few pub-
lic charities and fewer private philan-
thropies in Warsaw, and the streets |
are lined with the lame, the blind, the}
sick and the starving. Kellogg Dur-
land in his book “The Red Reign” tells
of finding a woman lying in the street
in a starving condition, When he and
another passerby picked her up she
dropped from under her shawl a)
bundle of rags that fell apart and re-)
vealed a wretched baby. When she |
raised her head they saw she could not
have been more than 17 years old,

Such pride as the Varsovians feel
for anything is felt for their publhec
