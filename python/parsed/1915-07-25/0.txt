DISCUSSES DEFENCE;
MAY DELAY ACTION

Wasnrscron, July 94 —With Preai-
dent Wilson's note on the submarine ts-
gue row before the German Government
officials in Washington are turning their
attention to the situation that has arisen
through Great Britain's ignoring of the
yights of neutrals in the conduct of her
Hlockade of Ciermany, |

President Wilson, through note
whi just delivered at Ber-
lin, committed now to. protect
ihese rights “at any cost.’ He will be
obliged to fulfil his solemn

the
has heen

stands

Germany to contend for the freedom of
the seas “from whatever quarter vio-
lated.”

While the President, according to the
Washington view, must now take Great
Britain to task as vigorously and as
insistently as he has the German Gov-
ernment, there ix considerable doubt as
to when the President will enter upon
this course of action

There is reason to believe that some
of the President's most competent ad-

Visers urged him from the start to use |

practically the sume language in deal-
ing with both Germany and Great Brite
ain when it came to an assertion of the
rights of the United Staten The Presi-
dent has followed the course of dealing
more vigorously with Germany because
the issue more pressing and in-
volved, net a question of property, but
the safety of American lives,

Was

Slow to Deal With Britain.
Recently the Administration has made
ro secret of the fact that it felt handi-
capped in handling the controversy with
Germany because of the feeling which
to be growing that the United
Siates had not asserted itself with suf-
ent positiveness against tne British
with American trade to

seemed

 

ference
neutral ports.

Toe coupling of the German violations
ol American rights with all other sim-
and the declaration of
Vresidents intention to contend for
toese rights “without compromise and
‘any cost” were intended not only to
the more severe features of the

oe for Germany, but also to allay

\t 11 o'clock to-night 889 bodies had been taken from the steam

Clark street this morning just as she was casting loose from her moorings.
About 1,800 persons perished, it is believed.

Aboard were 2,500 holiday makers on an annual picnic excursion Lo
Michigan City, given by the Western Electric Company to its employees.

Of the passengers, 762 are definitely known to have been rescued.
Dr. Joseph Stringer, the Coroner's physician, issued a bulletin early to-
night, that he personally had seen and counted 1,300 of the dead. He esti-
mated the total dead as high as 2,500, but the Government checkers in-
sist that only 2,500 were on board.

United States customs inspectors base the estimates on 2,500 pas-
sengers and ‘eelirbibe crew, making a total of 2,572 on the boat when she
went down. With 762 accounted for and 889 bodies recovered, there re

main 921 missing. It is considered probable, however, that a majority of

ithe missing are dead. It is known that approximately 200 are buried

under the mud under the capsized steamer and there are many bodies

yet in the hold that cannot be reached for hours.
