HOW GERMAT

Entire Nation Mobilized
in the Work of Con.
servation. Frugality
and Production of
Crops

OME interesting information has
been received in this country!
concerning Germany's methods
of conserving her food supply,

When the imperial authorities realized |
that war would continue probably to |
the end of the current year Herr von
Loebel, Minister of Interior, made this
appeal to the German people:

“Among the problems that confront
us here at home while our troops are
fighting for the integrity of the coun-
try none makes a stronger demand
than the care that must be exercised
in keeping the wolf from the door,
Our foes hope to make famine work |
for them where their weapons fail.
We have to-day abundant food sup-
plies within our gates and by thrifty
housekeeping and the exercise of due
economy we shall be able to hold
hunger at bay, though the war be
much prolonged,

“But we must recognize that the
cutting off of food supplies from
abroad makes some changes in our
dietary imperative. This imposes no
hardships, but it will oblige a measur-
able denial of luxuries, We shall not
need to stint ourselves, but we must
live simply and be frugal. This means
plenty of black bread and potatoes on
the bill of fare, but less meat and little
white bread, fconomy must be the
watchword, and what we have in the
past considered refuse must be made
to serve useful purposes,

“Undoubtedly we have failed here-
tofore to consider seriously the ques-
tion of the nation's food stores, but |
from now on it is imperative that
every household) be in its” sparing

 

June 4 last Dr. Delbrueck, Prussian
Secretary of State, was able to inform
the Diet that according to the latest

kor a time there was much concern

felt about the potato supply, as the

a big percentage of straw flour were
served members of the profession at P|
recent meeting. }
“This flour is partly indigestible, but
in this it is not unlike other nourish-
ing foods. As a matter of fact the
normal functioning of the digestive or- |
gans calls for a certain measure of |

When the first censis was taken

The free persons were further claw

whites as male or female, and the
free white males as 16 or over or under

marshals direct to the President ang

The Government took an important
step when it regulated what should he
done with the various grains in order |
that bread enough for all might be
assured until the harvesting of the new |
crop, To quote from a German source:

“Because of this precaution there
is every reason to warrant our be-
lef that we shall be able to maintain |
ourselves from within. To this end
in the case of rye, 82 per cent, of the|
grain is ground up for use and x0 per
