VOL. LXIX.—NO. 93,

7TH CONGRESS MEETS TO-DAY

CHANGE MADE IN ANNOUNCING
M'KINLEY'S DEATH,

— ———

President Roosevelt Wil Communicate the
Information Formally in His Message
to Congress on Tuesday—Brief Soe
sions of Both Houses To-day.

WasninoTon, Dec, 1.—A general change
has been made in the programme for
the opening day of the Fifty-seventh
Congress to-morrow. The official an-
nouncement of President McKinley's death
wil] be deferred until after the reading
of the President's message to the two
houses on Tuesday. In honor of the
memory of the late President an ad-
journment will at once be taken for
the day, Senator Foraker, the senior
Ohio Senator, offering the resolution in
the Senate and Representative Grosvenor
of Ohio in the House,

The Republican Senators will hold a
caucus to-morrow afternoon tu appoint a
committee to arrange for the reorganiza-
tion of the committees. This work will
be completed at aa early a date as possible
g that the Canal Treaty can be reported
back and acted upon in executive session.
It is the intention of the leaders to begin
at once the work of preparing the appro-
priation bills and other matters of legis-
jation so that it will be possible to make
the session a short one if possible.

“The ist of May,” is what the leaders
all say now when asked for the date of
final adjournment, but that is the way
they all talk at this stage of the Congres-
siona! game and there is no reason to think
that the session will end before July 4.

The programme with regard to announc-
ing Mr. McKinley's death was not agreed
upon without serious consideration and
long discussion, The Ohio delegation
had hoped that the two houses would ad-
journ on the announcement of the death
of the President, and it was proposed that
Senator Foraker, the senior Senator from
Ohio, and Representative Grosvenor, the
oldest member of the Ohio delegation in
the House, should notify their resi
houses after which they should journ.
Careful consideration led to the rejection
of this plan, however, as it was thought
incompatible with the customs of Congress
for the death of a non-member to be an-
nounced by a member of Congress. Mr.
Mckinley ‘having served in the House,
it would have been proper for Mr. Grosvenor
to have announced his death, but as he
was never in the Senate this would have
pemshed in the adjournment of only one
youy

President Roosevelt has dwelt on the
death of President MeKinley at some length

 

in his message and it has been agreed that |

after the appointment of a committer to

the Senate is in session and ready to receive
any communication he may care to make.

The session of the House will be much | Heavy Ironwerk on Flat Car Caught and

to the House. Representative Dalzell will
then move the adoption of the old rules
with the changes agreed upon in the Repub-
lican caucus on etarday There may
be some debate over the rules which will
be limited to an hour on each side at the
most. Seats will be drawn, and after
the House members of the joint committee

QUEEN LIL DEPARTS IN HASTE

To Washington, Regretting That There
Was No Stop at Princeten.
Queen Liliuokalani, with the imperial
retinue and the seventeen pieces of imperial
baggage, left New York yesterday for
Washington. Her departure was some-
what unexpected, as it had been given
out that she was to remain in this city
for several days. Her Majesty was very
much disappointed, however, at the way
New York had treated her. She was will-
ing to forgive the fact that several hotels
were too full to accomodate her, for she
appreciated that they did not realize that
royalty was knocking at the door. But
nobody came to pay her homage, not even
Mayor Van Wyck, or Squire Croker, or
the daughters of the Crown. The feel-
ings of her Majesty were hurt by this neglect
and late on Saturday night she called her
royal secretary, Joshua Rea, into the royal
presence and had a talk with him.
“Joshua,” said the Queen, “the people
of this city don't seem to appreciate the

fact that royalty is here to be entertained.
What are we going to do about it?”

CROKER AS AGENT FOR VIRTUE

ncn

TURNS HIS MIND TO POLICE IN-
VESTIGATION UNDER LOW,

 

 

Idea Is, Don't You See, to Show That
Tammany Couldn't Help Vice or, in a
Parttanio Mask, to Force the New Ad-
ministration Into Unpopular Stringency.

The friends of the Hon. Richard Croker
said jast evening that he had devised a
plan for the discomfiture of the fusion
administration. It was declared that soon
after the new administration went into
power there would be a movement, inspired
by Tammany Hall and carried out by men
thoroughly trusted by it, which would
be the cause of the appointment of an in-
vestigating committee, ostensibly non-
partisan, but in reality entirely in the hands
of Tammany, which would do to the city
under the new police administration what
was done to the Police Department this
year by the Committee of 15, for the purpose
of elther discrediting the administration
or making it unpopular.

Mr. Croker believes that with the special
souroes of information which are at the
control of Tammany Hall there will never
be a time when it will not be easy to find
violators of the law, and that by doing
this he can create the impression that the
administration of the Department of Police
has not changed through the change of
the Chief and Commissioner; or else that by

ted assaults on the department he

 

“[ don't know, mma'am—l mean your | Will be able to compel the new adminis-
Majesty—-” said Rea, “1 guess they haven't | tration to such an extreme enforcement
the right idea about queens in this town. | of the laws that it will become unpopular
Suppose we go to Washington—I mean | with the percean liberty men and drive
I would suggest that your Majesty journey | them into Tammany Hall two years hence,

Mr. Croker has told his friends that when
the administration of the town's affairs
is in the hands of the men elected by the
anti-Tammany forces they will find that
it is impossible to stop all of the abuses
that have grown up in the Police Depart-
ment, and that there will be a vast jot of
material of the same kind that was used
against Tammany to be used in the future
against the fusionists. He thinks it will
be well to begin the gathering of this ma-
terial at once and try to show that it is the
rank and file and not the heads of the force
that do evil. In this opinion he takes di-
rect issue with the men who ran the fusion
campaign, who hold that the majority
of the men in the police force are honest
and decent citizens, or would be if they
were allowed to be.

_Mr. Croker thinks that he will be able
either to make it appear that the abuses
complained of in the last campaign have
been impossible to be cured by Tammany
or any other party, or else to make the
fusion administration distasteful to the
voters because of the severity of the man-
ner in which he will reek to compel it to

to Washington, where she should be re-
ceived with more regard to her high sta-

The party left the Hotel Roland at eight
o'clock yesterday morning and was driven
to the station. There there was another
consultation.

“Joshua, when you get the tickets will
you find out whether we can stop at Prince-
ton for a few hours? I would like to see

sible,” said the Queen

BALD EAGLE SHOT IN THE CITY,

 

A Patr of Them Had Come Back for More
of McCrain's Chickens.

Dr. John Dodd, a veterinary surgeon of
Tremont, shot and killed a small bald eagle
yesterday morning on the estate of Joseph
McCrain in East Chester.

The McCrain estate is near the Country
Club and fronts on Pelham Bay. Mr
McCrain ana several of the neighbors have,
since the storm of a week ago, been missing
chickens and couldn't imagine who was
stealing them.

Yesterday morning Mr. McCrain and
Dr. Dodd were walking through the barn-
yard, when Dodd saw two big birds high
up in the air, coming directly toward
them. Dodd said they were chicken hawks
and they were the thieves. The birds
drew near, circled overhead and then made
& swoop upon the chicken coop.

“They're eagles,” cried Dr. id. “Get
a rifle if you've got one.”

MecCrain brought out a shotgun which
only had one barrel loaded he eagles
hac ot a chicken each in their talons,
and they had risen with their prey, when
the veterinary fired and killed one of them.

The other eagle circled in the air scream-
ing and then flew down to its dead com-
panion. McCrain went into the house to

ot rnore ammunition, but could find none.

he living eagle tried to carry off its dead
companion, but the veterinary beat it off
with the butt of his gun. It grabbed the
chicken it had let drop, and flew off toward
the Sound. The dead eagle is of a brown-
ish color, about 5% feet in spread of wing.
It may have come down here with last
week's northeaster.

STAMPEDED BY UNION MINERS.

Three Hundred Riotous Men Close Three
Indiana Plaats.

INDIANAPOLIS, Dec, 1—-The settled pur-
pose of the union miners of this State to
force all the mines where non-union men
are employed to suspend business and
thus prevent competition in wages and
work for that grade of operatives was
further emphasized late yesterday after-
noon when 300 union miners from Wash-
ington, Cannellburg and Montgomery,
marched a distance of twelve miles and
forced the employees in the Soy, Winkle-
peck and Overton mines near Eaglesville
Guards were then
thrown around the mines and the nan-
union employees were notified that any

 

attempt to return to the mines, even to
get their tools, would be met with violence,

The 300 union men marched boldly along

the highways and made no pretence of
concealing their mission, and the people of

FATAL HOTEL EXPLOSION.

Hotel Filled With Ammonia Fumes From
Wrecked Refrigerator Plant, Which
He Had Been Examining —Conkin't
Tell What Had Caused the Accident.

The people in the Hotel Belvidere were
thrown into a panic about 8 o'clock yester-
day morning by the explosion of one of
the retorta of the refrigerating plant,
which was charged with ammonia, The
engineer, Augustus Miller of 223 East
Eighty-ninth street, was so badly injured
by the explosion that he died last night
at his home. The explosion shattered sev-
eral wineows in the hotel and was heard
several blocks away.

Just what caused the explosion is not
apparent. The engineer said that he
was examining the refrigerating apparatus
when the explosion occurred. He couldn't
explain how it happened. One of the
retorts—there were two-blew out and
Miller was caught between the wall and
a coil of pipe. He was carried upstairs
unconscious.

Dr. H. N. Lewis of the Hotel Florence,who
had been attracted by the noise of the explo-
sion, revived the engineer. Several of his riba
were broken, but he refused to go to a
hospital. He was taken home in @ cab.
At 10 o'clock last night he died.

The explosion not only awakened the
goog in the hotel, but also the neighbors.

olicemen Dolloff and Connolly of the
Tenderloin heard it at Sixteenth street
and Fourth avenue. When they reached
the hotel the halls were filled with guests

 

in scanty attire, who were being assured
that there was no danger to anybody.
Windows in the hotel were smashed

as far up as the third floor. The cooks
in the kitchen adjoining the room where
the explosion occurred were tossed about.
George Smith, a nephew of the owner
of the hotel, Mrs. Celestine 8S. Wehrle,
was checking up accounts in the storeroom
and he received a few slight cuts from
broken glass.

On the Fourth avenue side of the hotel
A. Glascell has a tailor’s shop. The front
window of his store was smashed, a mirror
in the store was broken, and several suits
were spoiled

The fumes of ammonia epread through
the hotel and for a time were almost over-
powering

BOERS TO ASK ARMISTICE?

 

Brussels Rumor That Negotiations Are

About to Be Opened.
Special Cable Despatch to TH® SUN.

Lonpon, Dec. 2--A despatch to the
Morning Post from Brussels says it is ru-
mored there that negotiatiqns are about
to be opened between the belligerents in
South Africa for either peace or armistice.

It appears to be certain that the Boers
are tired of the war, and the latest news
from South Africa received by Mr. Krager
is said to show an increasing want of ammu-
nition, arms and provisions on the part of
the burghers.

It is not impossible, according to the
Poat'a correspondent, that negotiations
will be seriously entered upon before the
end of the year.

KAISER WOULDN'T PERMIT IT.

Coen and Crefeid Wanted to Spcil Their
Names With a K.
Special Cable Despatch to THE SUN.

BeRrLIN, Dec. 1.--The municipal authori-
ties of Coeln and Crefeld recently decided
that henceforth the names of those towns
should be spelled with a K instead of C,
The Government readily sanctioned the
change, as the names are generally written
with a K. Emperor William, however,
vetoed the change, decreeing that the
nares must officially be spelled with a C,

The municipal authorities appealed to
the Supreme Court, which has now de-
cided that alterations in the names of towns
must be left to the decision of the monarch.

 

 

 

PENITENTIARY SET AFIRE.

Convicts Terrified in Richmond, Va. — Militia
Called Out to Restrain Them

Ricrwonp, Va., Dec, 1.—Fire started
shortly after 6 o'clock this afternoon in the
seclusion cell of the Virginia Penitentiary.
There was a quantity of straw in the place,
and the cell was lined with pine wood. Ina
short time it was aroaring furnace. About
1,200 convicts are confined in the peniten-
tiarvy and for a time there was a_panic.
Only five guards were on duty. Fearing
that the whole place was about to be de-
stroved they ran around and unlocked the
doors of the cells,

In some cases-the terrified convicts bat-
tered down the doors before the guards
could reach them and like a drove of wild
cattle they poured down into the yard in
the centre of the prison

President W. D. Chesterman of the Board
of Visitors, who happened to be present,
sent out calls for the police and military.
Both promptly responde!d and succeeded
in preserving order. The flames were
confined to the place of their origin. The
fire is thought to have been started by one
of the convicta.

FIGHTING 23D HOME AGAIN,
TOOK PART IN OVER 50 BATTLES

 

 

Only Regiment of Regulars That Ever
Made the Circuit of the Globe—RBoyal
Reception by British Treops at Malta
—A Fine Record of Active Service.

The Twenty-third Regiment, United
States Infantry, got home yesterday on the
transport Buford, after three years in the
Philippines, where it engaged in some fifty
or sixty fights on almost every island of
the archipelago which has been penetrated
by United States troops. It went away in
1898 with as fine a record for good service
in times of peace as any regiment in the
army and it came back yesterday with a
reputation for fighting in the field and
endurance on the march unequalled by any
other regiment in the service. Besides
that it has the distinguished honor of being
the only regiment of United States Regulars
that has ever made the circuit of the globe
and the only regiment in existence at this
time that has that honor, the Volunteer
regiments which performed the same feat
having been mustered out long ago. i

In addition to the Twenty-third Infantry
the Buford brought back about two-hundred
men of the Seventeenth Infantry, who have
also been in the Philippines for upward of
three years, and a nuinber of officers of
other regiments who are home on leave
or who have been assigned to regiments
now in this country. In all there were 1,250
persons on the Buford, including ten women,
the wives of officers, and four little children.

The trip from Manila here consumed
sixty-five days, which is thirteen more tham
the schedule, the delay being due to seven
days spent on a coral reef, three more in

| untangling a mass of hawsers from the pro-

peller and three more in fighting the giant
seas which the ship encountered in the last
two weeks of the trip.

Besides this there was other excitement on
the long journey. After leaving Malta, the
fourth assistant engineer, Murphy by
name, imbibed too freely of rurm and went
around gunning for the chief engineer and
any one else who desired to interfere with
him. He was put in irons and then the
butcher, who was his friend, endeavored
to release him and was put in irons too.
Both will be turned over to the Federal
authorities in this city to-day

There was one death on the Buford. Cor-
poral Beck, who was coming home on sick
leave, died while the transport was in the
Red Sea and his body was embalmed and
brought here °

The officers and men of the Twenty-
third come back in prime shape, most of
them bearded and brown and looking
fine in their new uniforms, which were given
to them before they left Manila in place of
the ragged khaki they used in their cam-
paigning. They hadn't @ complaint to
make of their treatment during these hard
three years, save of that accorded to them
on the Buford. The ration served on the
transport didn't suit them at all.

Col. J. Milton Thompson, a veteran of the
Civil War and commander of the Twenty-
third, was very proud of
he brought back with him yesterday. He
said that it had made a record for itself
which any regiment in the service might be

| proud of, and he talked freely of its deeds

in the field, although he has only been its
Colonel for a comparatively short time.
The Twenty-third Infantry was spread
along the Mexican border with headquarters
at Fort Clark, Tex., when war was declared
It was mobilized at New

the Civil War the regiment was all
together in one piace Many of its offi-
cers who had been with it for years
met on this oceason for the first time.

| Before the regunent could be despatched to

ist) squadron become so strong that it was
sent to the mouth of the Mississppi River
