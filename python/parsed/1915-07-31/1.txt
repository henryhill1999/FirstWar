BERLIN NONCOMMITAL.
Warsaw News May Be Meld Back
for Anniversary Celebration,

Special Cable Despatch to Tun Sux.

Beruin (via Amsterdam), July 30.—
'The officlal announcement which all
Germany is waiting to hear did not
come to-night in the statement issued
by the General Staff. Many believe it
will come as an anniversary celebra-
}. tion The statement was most non-
‘wcommittal. It is as follows:

There is no change on the eastern

front.

In the southeastern section early
Wednesday morning the troops of
Gen. von Woyrseh forced the passage
of the Vistula in several places be-
tween the mouth of the Pilitza and
Kozienice. There was fighting on the
eastern bank and &00 men with five
machine guns were captured

The allied (Teuton) troops under
- Gen. von Mackensen resumed the of-
Sfensive on Thursday west of the
Wieprz. The Germans broke through
the Russian positions, reaching the

line of Piaski and Bisoufice and the

. failway east. Three thousand pris-

Oners and three machine guns fell
«into our hands on the Piaski line
* This success, like the attacks of the

, Austro-Hungarian and Cierman
troops east of the Vistula, the attack
of the Prussian Guards near Krupe
and northeast of Krasnotay and
Other German attacks in the region
of Vojsevice, produced a wavering of
the Russian front between the Vis-
‘tula and the Bug.

The Russians evacuated their post-
tions on the whole line early on Fri-
day and are now maintaining their
Positions only north of Grubleszow.

Lonpon, July 30.—The Hritish Ambas-|

eador at Petrograd, in the course of a
message on the anniversary of the out-
break of the war, refers to the assertion
of German newspapers that Giermany's
@riginal objective was the destruction of
the Russian army

‘That army is still intact,” saya the
British diplomat “Like Charles the
Twelfth at Poltava and Napoleon at

unable to continue the pressure which

troops off the back of Russia, Germany
hae lately drawn forward all her new
troops and staked her maximum. Our
duty is to fight on resolutely and coolly.
We count on Russia and Russia can
count on us. We look confidently to the
end.”

The Times says editorially:

“It would be foolish to belittle the
gravity of the threatened loss of War-
saw and the Vistula. It is full of warn-
ing to the western Allies and means that
for a long time to come Russia may be
unable to resume a vigorous offensive;
that when Russia moves forward again
she must first reconquer her own lost
province, and that she is further off than
ever from an invasion of Germany. Yet
we may well draw fresh courage, con-
templating the calm and spirited resolu-
tion of the Russian people. They are
unmoved by the menace to Warsaw, just
as a century ago thelr ancestors were
unmoved by the loss of Moscow. They
know, as we know, that the Allies can
hold out longer than their adversaries.
The withdrawal to them is only a post-
ponement. They yield to conquer.

the burden of destroying the German.

never yet been heartened.

“If the British Government would at
once adopt the declaration making every
man of military age on these islands
Hable to military service, as the Qov-
ernment might direct, the moral effect of
the German successes in Russia would
be gone. Such a step would resolve the
last lingering doubts In the minds of
our allies and would strike alike @ Knell

} It would cheer our gallant troops at

the front and make them feel that the
period of hesitation is at an end.”

BECKER INFORMER

 

Squad Descend on Jacob
Luban’‘s Place.

 

THREE PRISONERS TAKEN

 

Less than twelve hours after Charles |

Becker paid with his life for the Rosen-
thal murder Lieut. Honest Dan Costi-
gan and his gambling squad—the so-
called successors to Becker's strong arm
men—raided the Flower and Feather So-
| cial Benefit Club, Inc., at 174 Sixth ave-
nus, and arrested, among others, Jacob
Luban, the president, whose brother,
Morris, was an important witness for the
State against Becker.

The “club” was raided with axes, lad-
| ders and crowbars yesterday afternoon
{as a gambling house. Dollar John
| Langer, once the close friend of Rosen-
‘thal in the Tenderloin gambling fra-
'ternity, was said to be the club's

financial backer.

 

More than the ordinary significance of |
|4 spectacular daylight raid attaches to)
| the incident, because only on Thuraday |
| Luban complained to District Attorney |
Perkins of police “persecution” and |

sought protection for his place as a
straight social club.

Furthermore, it is believed that the
police refrained from raiding the place
so long, although its character was
wn to every policeman on post, be-
‘cause of Luban’s alleged protection from

believing himeelf the State as a Becker figure and the |
fear that {If the “club” was attacked
