Five deaths were traceable to the heat
fhere yesterday.
@uicide after complaining about the
warm weather, a woman and a child fell |
from buildings while trying to find cool |

@ir and two others, weakened by the
heat, collapsed and died.
The highest temperature in the}

breezy tower of the Whitehall Building
‘was S88 at 4 P. M., which does not rep-
fesent by several degrees the actual heat
of the sweltering town. Some drug store |
thermometers recorded close to 100 tn
the sun, which might be considered an,
Anvitation to come in and drink fizz.

It was hot, measured by human endur-
ence, which, after all, is the true method |
of telling temperatures in valleys of
wtone and steel that have a habit of
pending forth the accumulated heat of
other days. Tho 98 degrees of Virginia
were fanned up this way by a zephyr.

As is usual in latter July days, there
was much humidity and that made heat |
hard to bear. Mundreds slept last night

JUDGE'S CHARGE SCORED

pages of typowritten |

in some twoscore
matter served on Mr. Cropsey, together
| With the order to show cause, soon after
| Justice Kelly had signed it. It is expected
| that a hiteh will occur on the return of
the order as Justice Scudder was one
of those involved in the “handpicked

Judges" controversy—the only one who
| accepted the invitation to testify before

the special investigating committee of
the Brooklyn Bar Association. When
this phase of the matter was brought to
| the District Attorney's attention, he
said;

“L have nothing to say about that row,”
leaving the {mpression that he would
have much to say when the matter comes
up on Monday Many believe, however,
that Justice Scudder will send the order
to some other Justice for argument. It
comes to him in the course of routine,
he being scheduled to sit in Special Term
next week,

Justice Scudder came into the Grout
case on application for an order to in-
spect the minutes of the Grand Jury
Which returned the perjury indictment.

 

 

Mr. Cropsey took offence, not only at
the granting of the order, which he
claimed Was unusual, but also at the

words of praise delivered from the bench
in which Justice Scudder complimented
Mr. Grout on his record as a public
official and citizen.

In the application for the order coun-
sel for Grout cites thirty-five alleged
| grounds for reversal. These include
; portions of Judge Lewis's charge to the
jury, the admission of certain evidence
and the action of Judge Lewis in over-
ruling more than 1,000 objections offered
by Stephen C, Baldwin, chief of counsel
for Grout.

Strong exception is taken to that por-
tion of the Judge's charge in which the
items of the indictment are reviewed
in detail, In this particular the charge
is described as “incomplete and partial,”
and this was notably true as it related
to appellant's own testimony on the
stand, SO appellant asserts

A minor exception to the Judge's
charge has to do with the personal con-
Vietion of each individual juror, One
juror hung the jury for about forty
hours and then voted for conviction only
after the duty of the individual juror
had been reoutlined by the Judge. Judge
Lewis charged that the jurors should
consider the opinions of their fellows,
but that each must be convinced of the
defendant's guilt beyond a reasonable
doubt before voting for conviction. ‘The
appellant holds that amplification of the
charge when the jury returned for [n-
structions on that point was prejudicial
to his case.
