Trading was on an active scale in the
outside market yesterday, and some
large gaing were scored by war stocks
in the early dealings. A general re-
action developed toward the close, how-
ever, and left final prices well under
the best of the day, though generally
above Thursday's final level.

The new, when issued, Electric Boat
shares were very active between 36 and
39", reflecting a net gain of 3% points.
The old shares moved up 28 points to
358, Car Light and Power, Cramp Ship-
building and Standard Motors were ac-
tive and strong spots, though final quo-
tations showed slight changes.

Oil shares showed a little more activ-
ity than of late. Prairie Oil and Gas
was prominent, with an advance of 26
points to 341.

has been pretty thoroughly liquidated,

The strength of this iss.e yesterday
tended to corroborate these rumors. On

fests whose operations were instrumental
in forcing the final flareup and also on
the part of the trading element which,
while willing to carry the “war brides’)

A Speculative Switch,
According to speculative gossip, tie

big plungers in Crucible have swit' hed

their play to Allis-Chalrers comn on

the other hand, these people have by we
so successful lately that they nm
attract a following, and the shgi
suggestion that they were giving their

 

SS

two competitors in its line of heavy

machinery manufacture. These are the

Midvale and the Bethlehem. The Mid
vale has all it can do, and the Bettle-
hem is so crowded with orders that it
is passing some of its business on to the
Allis-Chalmers, °

 

‘
One Cause of Trouble.

The complaint is made that certain
brokerage houses contributed to the
building up of an unhealthy speculative

|
|
|

position in Crucible by permitting their

customers to buy stock on a 5 point
margin. These houses are said to heve

| lost heavily for their lapse from = the

rules of ordinary cautior Stop loss

orders were, of course, ‘nsisted upon

Stop loss orders of this type are de-
signed to protect the breker rather than
the customer, As a mpiter of fact in 4
break like that which occurred in Cru-

cible they are entirely useless for either

purpose. Both broker and customer are
gambling, and they both deserve to

lose

 

A Queer Situation. }
Amalgamated stock is now in process!
of exchange imo Anaconda stock
There was no market for the former
yesterday. Holders of Amalgamated |
have exchanged their stock for interim]
certificates of deposit, against which
they will receive new Anaconda stock |
as soon as the new certificates are
issued This, it is expected, will take
place in a couple of weeks In the
meantime, if the holder of Amalgamated
wishes to get out he may sell Anaconda
short, borrowing against the delivery of
his own. stock, Anaconda was strong
yesterday, Some observers are wonder-| ,
ing what would happen in case the|
stock had a decided spurt, Presumably
quite a number of holders of the old
amalgamated stock would wish to Iqui-
date In this way, a large artificial
short interest might be created, Con-
ceivably it might be large enough to
cause a premium to be demanded for)
the borrowing of stock and thus produce
a sort of mechanical corner, In the old)
days such an opportunity to run in

Congested Shorts,

Reek Island had an extreme rise of | re
% points, a large percentage advance) 3
particular mystery {s made of the.
cause for the rise in this quarter, 1t
was ascribed generally to the presence | }
of a congested short position, The,
stock has loaned at a small premium for)
some time and there has been much talk
of its obstinacy tn refusing to go down. |
Apparently speculators who were suc-|
eessful in anticipating liquidation in
Missouri Pacific, M. K. & T. and Texas!
and Pacific have been trying their hand |
on Rock Island,

Executions In Odd Lota, |

These are busy days for the odd lot
traders, The participation of the public
in odd lots is large. Houses with private |
wires as usual have a great many clients |
who invest in fractional lots, and owing | ‘
to the activity in the “war stocks” a
large number of New York speculators
are trading in odd lots A prominent |
odd lot dealer explained that clients of |
commission houges were often eritieal ,
of executions and said that it should be |
appreciated that a condition often ex- |
isted over which the dealer had no
control, In a big market the messenger
boys on the floor of the exchange are
so crowded in delivering orders around
the exchange that orders frequently are
delayed in reaching the different stocks

 

 

During the present market the fluetua- | °°

tions in many of the stocks are so rapid |
as to cause customers to criticise the
execution of orders Another reason |
why customers are so often dissatistied
is the fact that they are unwilling to
make allowance for two or three and
sometimes six or eight minutes delay in Be
the recording of sales on the tape. It
is a fact that nev.rv before in the history |
of the Stoek Exchange has one been

able to trade in factional lots on so ad- | very
The summary

Vantageous a basis as at present. The |
odd lot dealers are always ready to buy |
and sell odd lots on the bid and offer or
14 from sales if the customer desires
and it is this service which ts responsi-
ble for the large increase in the last
few years of orders in fractional lots,
