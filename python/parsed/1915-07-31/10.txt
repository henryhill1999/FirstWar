Miss Gi les placed the condition at 76.7,
agai: 9.5 last month. Miss Giles
paid “In many sections where fertiliz-
ers have been used its quality has been
so inferior because of the lack of suffi-
clent potash that the plant is beginning
te show deterior: tion.’

Considerable comment was heard on
the floor as a result of the disc ussion |
by Richard H. Edmunde, editor of the
Manufacturers Record of Baltimore, who
criticised Senator Hoke Smith and other |
politicians who ignore facts in their de-
mand that the British blockade be
raised. Mr. Edmunds contended that it
was wild agitation and excessive cotton
production instead of war which was
hurting the South. He concluded his
statement with the following comment:

“So long as there are so-called po-
Utical leaders who use such situation as
the present to make the world believe
that the South has cotton strings for its
backbone and cotton bolls for its brains
@o long will it be injured in the world’s
estimation by their work.”

The week end figures were without in-
fluence. The into sight for the week was
placed at 89,816 bales, against 23,066 story apartment house.
