MR. HERTWIG’S PARABLE.

Further Remarks on the Case of Uncle
Sam vs. John Bull.

To tHe Evitor or Tis Sun—Sir; In
his parable Mr. Hertwig establishes
himself ag Germany, casts ‘Mr, Jones"
as England and completes the company
with a judge between them which he
entitles “President Wilson.” Curtously
enough, if one is to have any respect
for Mr, Hertwia's sincerity, he exactly
reverses the plain facts of the case be-
tween the actual Germany and the
actual Frngland and for the purpose of
his parable sets up the statement that
he (Germany) had been attacked by
Mr. Jones (England). At this point,
therefore, Mr. Hertwig and his parable
would be thrown out of any court as
untruthful,

Lut, really, Mr. Hertwigts fiction as
to the origin of the war, which he could
hardly expect any one outside of Ger-
many to swallow, “cuta no ice” in con-
necting his parable with any issue be-
tween America and Germany.

It is a purely gratuitous fileht of
fancy on Mr. Hertwig’a part to Install
President Wilson as a judge between
Hertwig (Germany) and Jones (Eng-
land). President Wilson has no euch
function. The President of the United
States ts calling Hertwig (Germany) to

out the aslichtest justiffoation elther
under international law or the common
dictates of humanity. Hertwig has al-
ready admitted the unlawfulness of
these murders by the plea that they
were done in retallation for some offence
committed by Jones (England) on Hert-
wig, which {s a matter purely between
these parties and does not concern
America or President Wilson.

If Mr. Hertwig cannot see his way
clear to take his complaints aga!net Mr.
Jones to the proper tribunal he might at

least confine hia statement of them to
German publications where he may be
sure they will be welcomed In any

American newspaper such remarks, par-
ticularly when they are accompanied by

suggestions to “tose the Declaration of |

Independence to the flames,” “apologize

{for George Washington as a traitor,”

M'CALL FAILS TO

HEED LEGISLATORS

Neglects Thompson Commit-
tee’s Invitation to Attend
Elevated Road Hearing.

 

 

OTHERS STAY AWAY TOO.

 

Chairman Edward F. MeCall and
three other members of the Public Ser-
vice Commission of the First district |
who were wanted failed to appear yes- |
terday In response to the invitation of
Senator Thompson's legisiative com-|
mittee which {8 making an investigation |
of various matters related to the draw- |
ing of a new law by which the Public,
Service Commissions are to be governed

It was this committee which tried very |
hard last January to get enough tn-
formation of dereliction of duty to make
it possible for Gov. Whitman to remove
the Democratic members of the New
York city commission

Disregard of the request of the corm- |
mittee by Chairman McCall and Com. |
missioners Cram, Wood and Willams |
agitated the legislators considerably
Speeches pertinent to the situation were
made. Secretary Travis Fl. Whitney
tried to make the Senators understand
that he was entirely capable of giving
the committee all of the information it
desired. The committee would have none
of him

Mr, Whitney sald right out in meeting
that the committee showed plainiy Its,
desire to create a situation reflecting on
Judge McCall. Senator Burr thought tt
necessary to Warn the newspaper men
present that no disrespect for Judge
McCall was Intended by those who hid
spoken, which prompted Senator Lewis,
counsel for the committee, to remark
that he stated facts and ar wy could

Back of the speeches and the discus.
sion which followed was the fact that
the legisiatora had tntended to pack their

 

  

grips yesterday afternoon and seek
respite in the country Or In their home
towns until September. When the sr-
geant at arms reported that he could
find no one except Commissior Hay-
ward and Secretary Whitney tt was evt-
dent that the committee must either

forego its questioning of Chairman M

Call and the others or remain In the
city until next week
Senator Thompson inaugur

 
 
 

executive session to discuss this
The result was that the committe
cided to stay over and Secretary t
ney was informed that at 11 o'clock
Monday morning Public Service
Commissioners may ¢ legisia-
tors in the hearing room of the commis-
sion. Mr, Whitney said he thougnt all
the Commissioners would be there |

The matter on which the Commis-
sioners were called ts that of the re-
conatruction of an elevated railroad
through Fulton street, Brooklyn. |

Deputy Commissioner Delos F. Wilcox
of the Department of Water Supply, Gas
and Electricity gave to the committee
his views on public utillty corporations
and thelr management.
