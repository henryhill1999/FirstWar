MONDAY MORNING:
WIDOW STRICKEN

cRrOoWD AT DOOR KEPT
BACK BY POLICEMEN

 

Mire Helen Lynch Becker, Charles
Riecker's widow, was almost frantic with
grief yesterday when all that was
earthiy of the man she

brought back to her from

loved was
the death
house at Sing Sing
When first the coffin was carried into
her little parlor she said not a word. Her
lips quivered, that was all. Then, sup-
ported by her brother, John Lynch, she
moved forward as the black cloth cover-
ig was drawn away. Still she did not
speak, but all the bright color left her

cheeks. She took two more steps for-
ward

“Poor Charley!
whispered.

Then suddenly all her pent up anguish
seemed to rush over her uncontrollably,
as (f notwithstanding that she had heard
from Gov. Whitman himself a little leas
than twenty-four hours before the words
that removed her husband's last chance,
her own last hope, ehe had mot quite
realized what {t meant.

“Charley, Charley,” she cried, throw-
ing her arms about the body, still cov-
ered with a gray, shroudlike cloth. “Oh,
Charley.” She kissed the dead lps
again and again, her arms clinging yet
more tightly

For a moment nobody moved nor
spoke while the stricken woman's voice
went on, speaking to her dead. Then!
her brother stepped forward and gently |
led her away, both sobbing. |

Innocent, She Saya.
“E don't care what they say, I say |

Poor Charley!" she

he’s innocent.” Mrs. Becker cried as she
entered her bedroom in the rear of the}
apartment, where she sat silently in her)
black dress while the undertakers went!
about what they had come to do. |

Tt was a few minutes after 4 o'clock |
when the automobile hearse of Willlam |
F. Struwe, whose undertaking establish- |
ment is at 2 West Fordham road, The!
Bronx, a few blocks from the Becker |
apartment at 2291 University avenue,
drew up before the door, Mrs, Becker)
had awaited its coming anxiously, won-
Gering at the delay.

A little after noon, however, came a
message saying that the hearse, which
started from New York shortly after 5
o'clock in the morning, had just reached
Ossining. Mr Struwe, who went with the
hearse, said he had to stop five times
because of tire trouble, but expected to
be in New York again by 2:30 P. M. On |
the return trip, however, the engine went)
wrong in front of Lyndhurst, Mrs. Fin-
ley J. Shepard's home, and delayed him
again. Mrs. Becker was very nervous
when finally the hearse stopped before
the apartment house, more than an hour
late.

Already her brother and her aister,
Susan Lynch, were worried about her, !
fearing lest the strain and the fitful sleep |
that was all she had after her return)
from Ossining might cause her to break |
down. She refused all day to see any
callers except close friends.

A crowd of perhaps 100 persons gath-
ered about the door as the _ hearse
stopped, and would have pushed forward
had not a mounted sergeant and two
patrolmen kept them far from the en-}
trance. After a moment's delay the |
plain box with its black cloth covering |
was lifted out. |

The crowd pressed forward, looking |
from the load the undertaker’s men were
lifting to the shaded windows of Mrs.
Hecker’s apartment on the third floor.
They could just hear a woman's muffiea
gobs from behind them, blotted out imme-
Giately as some one in another apart-
ment struck the first notes of a song
on a piano, Suddenly the piano
stopped; the sobs went on.

“Slowly the black box was carried
through the door and up the stairs, the
four bearers stooping a little, The
leader of the strong arm squad was a
powerful man, one remembered. For a
moment, as the body was taken into the
apartment the front window shade was
raised—then quickly lowered.

While he was at Sing Sing Mr. Struwe
prepared the body, doing his best to
make invisible the burns on the fore-
head made by the electrodes. So well
did he succeed that Mrs. Becker was
paved the pain of seeing the brands,

The coffin was placed in the parlor, at
ts head a nine branched brass candle-
stick supported on a heavy brass stand-
ard, Already some flowers had arrived,
and soon after the hearse came a@ greal
floral cross was brought in, None of the
family would say from whom the flow-
ers came. Instead of the usual black
crape there was hung on the door a gar-
land of palm leaves, white lilies and
white and purple asters.

It was not until evening that any of
the family consented to see reporters,
John Lynch, Mrs. Becker’a brother,
finally stood in the doorway of her
apartment and said that she was in far
(oo serious a condition to talk or make
& statement.

 

 

 

Very Brave, Says Brother,

“She has been very brave,” he said,
“a wonderful woman, but this has been
more than even she could stand. Thank
heaven she didn't see the burns on his
forehead,”

Mr Lynch was told of statements in
evening papers that Mrs, Becker had
paid just before her husband was execu-
ted that she would never rest until she
had exposed the methods used by Gov.
Whitman and some others when he was
District Attorney in prosecuting Becker,
methods she considered unjust, and that
rhe had asserted at a family conference
that 6he wanted Mr. Whitman and these
same aids sued for $100,000.

“Will Mrs, Becker say !f that {s true,
or can you tell us whether it is or not?”
he was asked.

“I do not want to discuss it myself,”
he answered, “and Mrs. Becker cannot
tee any one.”

‘Thus far the funeral plans are not
tomplete. Mrs. Becker is in no con.
fition to discuss them much. We have
fecided, however, to have the funeral
tervice at 10 o'clock Monday morning.
The Rey, Father Nicholas’ J. Murphy
Will preside at a solemn high requiem
mass at the Church of St, Nicholas of
Yolentine, Andrews avenue and Fordham
road, Burial will be in Woodlawn Ceme-
tary, where their Mttle baby, who died
when he was one day old, is buried.

“No, we have not yet decided on pall-
bearers. To-morrow evening a few
friends will come in, and the funeral will
be private. Now, you must not ask me
kny more, I cannot talk much now,”
bid he closed the door. .

A little crowd hovered about the
Apartment house until well into the
evening, watching those who left or en-
tered, Among them were two of Mrs.
Keck’s girl pupils of the graduating class
&t Public School 90, 228 West 148th
treet, The Bronx.

“She was awfully good to us,” one of
them said, “I never had a nicer teacher.

BECKER'S LAST STATEMENT MADE
BEFORE HE WENT TO HIS DEATH

My Dying Declaration.

GENTLEMEN: I stand before

you in my full senses knowing that

no power on earth can save me from the grave that is to receive me. In
the face of that, in the teeth of those who condemned me and in the

presence of my God and your God,

I proclaim my absolute innocence

of the foul crime for which I must die.
You are now about to witness my destruction by the State, which

is organized to protect the lives of

the innocent. May Almighty God

pardon every one who has contributed in any degree to my untimely
death. And now, on the brink of my grave, I declare to the world that
I am proud to have been the husband of the purest, noblest woman that

ever lived—Helen Becker.

This acknowledgment is the only legacy I leave her.

good-by. Father, I am ready to go.

thought she was thinking about him. She
told one of the girls once that having
the graduating class was the only thing
that made her keep on teaching when
things got so bad. She said she was
afraid if she left us maybe we wouldn't
all graduate.”

A few minutes before 6 o'clock Capt. |
John T. Reith of the Highbridge station, |
in which precinct Mrs. Becker's home is |
situated, went in for a few moments. |

“I just went In to pay my respects,” |
he said. “I know Mrs. Becker, and I}
knew Charley.” There was a catch In|
the captain's voice.

The only other caller who was ad-
mitted was Lieut. Patrick Shea, who
came with his wife. Lieut. Shea gesti-
fled that he and Mrs. Shea were with
Lieut. and Mrs. Becker on the night, ;
several nights after Rosenthal was shot,
when it was asserted that Becker was
aiding the gunmen to get out of the
way. Lieut. Shea would say onthing}
when he left.

The Rev. Father Murphy, who is to
conduct the requiem mass for the dead
man, is now tn Philadelphia, but it was
said at the rectory that he would return
to-morrow afternoon to consult with the
family in regard to final plans for the
funeral. Until then it is not likely Mrs.
Becker will go any further with them.

Badly Injured im Auto Accident,

Beacon, N. Y., July 80.—Returning
from Ossining, where he was one of the
witnesses of the execution of Charles
Becker, Charles H. Willioughby, editor of
the Pittsfield, Mass., Daily Eagle, was
badly injured to-day at Wappingers
Falls, seven miles north of here, when
the auto in which he was riding crashed
into the side of a runabout.

Both cars were overturned and the
four occupanta were buried beneath.
Willoughby {ts the worst hurt. Several

SING SING LOWBROWS WIN.

Welfare League Election May Un-
seat Prison Judge Willett,

Ossinina, N. Y., July 30.—The eleg-
tions of the Mutual Welfare League, the
self-government organization of the State
prison, were held to-day, and the low-
brows won decisively, electing 43 out
of 565 delegates to the central govern-
ing body. Among the highbrows’ candl-
dates who were defeated were Burton
W. Gibson, former New York lawyer,
and Hoffman Brown, also a former
lawyer.

The lowbrows in the larger committee
then proceeded to elect from their num-
ber all the nine members of the executive
committee. Among the lowbrows who
received this honor are Tough Tony Ma-
reno, Phil Abbe, O. K. Bill Myers and
Kid Dropper Kaplan. As this committee
rules the prison court it 1s likely that
Chief Justice William Willett of the
prison court will lose his job.

Mrs. Becker late last night received a
letter written by the in
death house at Sing Sing to her hus-

prisoners

band just before his death, asserting
confidence in his innocence and

testing against present penal methods

in this State, particularly capital pun-
ishment.

The letter, written on official Sing |

“Mr. Charles Becker, Ossining,
Was composed by

Hans Schmidt, mur-
derer of Anna Aumuller, in collaboration
with Carol Dranowitz, who con-

victed of a Mast Side murder, The
document was signed by all the inmates
of the death house, It follows:

“Please accept these few lines of fare-
well from the companions in misery
whom you will leave’ behind, and who
will sooner or later follow you.

‘We who have lived with you through
these days in the human stockyards of
Sing Sing express to you our heartfelt
sympathy.

“Surely some day your case will be
cited, cited by historians of human prog-
ress, as one of the best arguments
against antiquated legal conceptions—
chambers of horrors, death houses, con-
denmed cells, &c., as conducted by the
State of New York—as a remnant of
ages gone by

“We ail who know you from your
actions in the human slaughter house of

course of time further developments
will prove to all that the State hag
killed you as an innocent victim of cir-
cumstances,

“The State claims that the sacredness
of human life must be impressed upon
the people, while at the same time the
State itself gives the worst example,
forcing its employees for a paltry sum
to help and assist in taking lives with
cruel deliberation and premeditation at

“Thereby the State itself more than
any other agency lowers the standard of
public morals; it has a brutalizing ef-
fect upon the public mind, cultivating
and strengthening the lower instincts
of man, the spirit of vengeance and

lines of farewell are unfortunate our-
selves. We are all at a loss to offer
you any consolation except the example

last words were:

BIDDING FOR BECKER'S CELL.

 

Slayers in Death House Annex
Want Vacant Quarters.

Osstnina, July 30.—-Five murderers in
Sing Sing prison'e deathhouse annex be-
gan bidding to-day for the two cells va-
cated in the deathhouse by Charles
Becker and Sam Haynes, despite the
gloom cast over the prison by the exe-
cution of the two men.

Gaeto Montimagno, slayer of Michael
Gaimeri, the politician, was’ one of the
men who pleaded for Becker's cell, Those
in the Annex occupy the cells once used
for solitary confinement, which are more
stuffy than those vacated by Becker and
Haynes. Warden Thomas Mott Osborne
will probably move the two successful
bidders from the annex to the death-
house on Sunday after the empty celle
have been cleaned.

Hans Schmidt, who was in the cel
next to Becker, bemoaned his absence
yesterday. “Poor fellow,” said Schmidt

Haynes Stronger of Two,

At Becker's own request, made a few
|days ago, he was permitted to die in
| the chair ahead of the mulatto Sam
| Haynes, who was put to death less than
[ten minutes after Becker’s Imp body
had been carried out to the autopsy
room.

It so happened, howe
mitting Becker to sit in chair first
there was no violation o general
‘rule of the death chamber, which is that
the stronger of two men condemned to
die the same day must go through the
greater strain of waiting for his turn

Haynes, who had a spotiess record

John Harrison of Patterson, Putnam
county, had not received certain privi-

such as the unprecedented one of taking
Becker from the death house early on
the evening preceding his death and per-
mitting him to remain in one of the
prison offices to receive relatives and
counsel until half an hour after midnight

Haynes, back tn the death house, had

ness.

sistant Warden Johnston had announced,
would be mailed immediately to Mrs.
Becker.

Becker made a last request, however,
that he be permitted to wear the photo-
graph pinned to his shirt when he went
to the chair and that the picture be
buried with him. It was finally sug-
gested that he pin the photograph to
his undershirt beneath the soft shirt
of Nght material which he wore when
he died.

He pinned the picture beneath his
outer shirt therefore soon after Warden
Usborne had said goodby to him. It
was sald later at the prison that the
photograph rested on his breast be-
neath his shirt when he died and that
{it would go Into the coffin with him.

There was a faint hint of day tn

His very Iast message, which he de-

ran:

“IT am Innocent. I am not guilty by

way of the death of Herman Rosentha)
1 am sacrificed for my friends.”

Netther Sleeps Nor Eate,

From the time Father Curry and
Father William E, Cashin, the Catholic
chaplain, went to Father Cashin's house
in Ossining to get a few hours sleep
before the trying ordeal in the death
chamber, Becker spent hig last seven or
eight hours on earth without sleep or
food, After Mrs, Becker had said her
last farewell to him fn one of the prison
offices at 12:30 A. M. Becker was con-
Stantly oecupled in conferences with
prison officials, {tn prayer or in look-
ing after the release for publication of
his final messages to the public,

Becker had left an inner office and
was back tn the death house before 1
o'clock, where he remained until a small
red door leading to the electrie chair
room was opened for him at 5:42 {n the
morning, or two minutes before the first
shock was administered which blotted
consciousness from him forever.

All of the seventeen condemned men
in the death house proper—an over-
flow of eight men is housed in the old
but remodelled punishment cells while
twenty-five new cells are nearing com-
pletion—were awake and waiting for
Becker as be returned to his own death
house cell,

The condemned men had remained
awake so they themselves might con-
duct a last religious service for Becker
and Sam Haynes and also to say their
good-bys. Their services, led by varl-
ous prisoners in the death cells, in-
cluded readings from the Scripture, the
Lord's Prayer and other prayers which
altogether lasted an hour.

At 2:30 o'clock, or an hour after the
death house inmates had finished their
service, Becker regelved a most un-
usual visit, considering the hour, the
length of the visit and the visitor,

Becker’s caller was Warden Osborne,
who tries to avoid death house visits
unless euch calls concern the prison
management in general. Warden Os-
borne remained in conference with
Becker unt!l 4 o'clock. Even a general
notion of what was discussed between
Mr. Osborne and Becker during the hour
and a half they talked together in low
tones could not be learned.

When Mr. Osborne had left the death
house Becker made a_ request that
showed the affection in which he held
his wife. A photograph of Mrs. Becker
which had decorated the wall of his
cell had been removed, together with
everything else except his cot and

Prayers for the Dying.

The priests began to say the prayers
for the dying then and Beeker joined
in where he could

“My Lord and my God," Becker and
the priests said In unison as ghey be-
gan the prayer which brings with it

an indulgence granted by Pope lus X,,
“even now and willingly and cheerfully
I accept whatever form of death Thou
wilt be pleased to send me, with all its
anguish, sorrow and pain,”

Jim O'Toole, a blueclad guard,
tween whom and Becker an especially
strong friendship had grown up because
of O’Toole’s kindnesses to the condemned
man and especially to Mrs. Becker, came
to the cell door hesitatingly and entered.
Becker, who wore his soft shirt with
soft collar of grayish white, black trous-
ers and black silk socks, advanced his
right leg without being told.

O'Toole, without a word, slit the right
leg of the black trousers quickly up to
the knee. He carefully cut a slit in the
leg of Becker's underclothing at the
right knee also, Then he rolled up the
slashed trouser leg and bared the knee.
Following this he shook hands with
Becker and left the cell silently. This
was at 5:15 o'clock.

A few seconds before 5:41 o'clock Act-
ing Principal Keeper Fred Dorner for
the first time in his life came to a con-
demned man's door to tell him to walk
out to the electric chair. Becker, ashen
pale now, arose and made a movement
forward without further signal than
merely a glance of the eye from Dorner.

Father Curry was about to see his
first electrical execution and, as he said
later, he feared he would weaken, espe-
clally as the man about to die had been
his friend for so many years, He stopped
Becker, who with the terror of death
now gripping him had begun mechan-
ically to walk out of his cell.

Mr. Manton refused to say yesterday
