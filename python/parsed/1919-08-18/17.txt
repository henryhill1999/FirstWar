. First of the transatlantic giants to re-
turn to a pre-war status, the France of
the French line, arrived yesterday with
more than a thousand passengers, most
of whom, las well as the big crowd on
the pier, were in a very bad humor
when the ship finally docked at 1
e'clock, more than sever’ hours after her

There was a long wait for the health
@fficers to make the examination at
Quarantine and the vessel took an un-
usually long time to come up the river
and dock. The big crowd on the pier
Durst through the barrier and filled a
part of the space allotted to the cus-
toms authorities.

Then some one connected with the cus-
toms service made an impromptu ruling
that no passengers would be allowed to
leave the pier until the examination of
their luggage had been completed, and
@@ no passes were issued to friends and
relatives of-the voyagers to enter the
‘eustoms lines, in accordance with a re-

t order from the Collector of the
Port, considerable inconvenience re-
sulted

Among the passengers were the Coun-
teas of Granard, formerly Miss Beatrice
Mills, and the Duchess of Roxburghe,
Who was Miss May Goelet. They were
met at the pier by Mr. and Mrs. Ogden

Most of the returning Americans gave
y pictures of present conditions in
ites. Albert W. Grant of Sewickley,
Pa., who returned from a business trip
fn the course of which he visited
France, Germany, Belgium and Sweden
and spent several days in Essen, the
geat of the Krupp works, said that trav-
elling in neutral and belligerent coun-
tries alike was attended with incon-
Venience and even positive hardship. He
thought the food situation in Germany,
hewever, no worse than in the other
countries and on the whole better than
in France.

Charles Kondazian and John Byazian,
Jewellers who went abroad to pick up
some of the reported bargains, were also
inclined to think that European travel
Was to be avoided at pregent. They said
the reports of extensive jewelry sales in
Burope were greatly exaggerated, a
statement which was confirmed by
Hovannes Khan Kelekian, Imperial Per-
alan Consul in this city, who character-
ized the reports as nonsense.

hemp and sugar produced dense fumes,
which made the work of the firemen
hazardous. The ship docked at 2:30
A. M. and it was not until 3 P. M. that
the fire was under control. .

Two physicians were on duty during

that he was responsible for the child's

their turn, but M. Arnaud was firm.
“Either we stay with Helene or she

COP’S BREAD, CAST ON
WATERS, COMES BACK

Caddell Gets Offer From Man
to Whom He Gave Lift.

Patrolman Francis E. Caddell, for
ten years Brooklyn Bridge information
officer, may leave that routine and not
always agreeable work and go out to
the Northwest to engage in the profit-
able salmon canning industry.

He heard a voice from the past yes-
terday above the din of the traffic tur-
moil at his post in the shadow of the
elevated structure. A big, presumptuous
motor car halted at the Park Row
curb and a tall man, dressed in keep-
ing with the immaculateness of the car,
jumped out to ask directions to Coney
Island.

Patrolman Caddell drew from his vast
fund of information the exact road turn-
ings that the stranger wanted. The lat-
ter then started to go, and Caddell, as
has been his cheerful custom for years,
spoke his old time formula:

“I hope you will enjoy
Good-by. I wish you luck.”

Then he started back to his stall un-
der the elevated stairs. But as Caddell
told it, the stranger did not leave di-
rectly. The words and their intonation
stirred a memory of a godspeed that
had made a deep impression on him
many years ago.

He wanted to know if Patrolman Cad-
dell had ever been assigned to the Dliza-
beth street station in Chinatown, and
when the officer admitted he was there
in 1902 the stranger recalled a for-
gotten bit of the officer's philanthropy.
The m@forist said he was down and out

money to get a new start. He had gone
West, was welcomed home, and had be-
come wealthy as successor to his father
in the canning business.

The end to the good fairy story, whic!
quite overwhelmed the veteran patrol-
Tan, was an invitation to “come out
West” and accept a position which
would keep him in comfort the rest of

ENRIGHT ASKED TO
RAISE PAY OF COPS

Civil Service Forum Urges In-
crease of $150 to $250 Yearly.

 

 

The Civil Service Forum, on behalf
of the Patrolmen’s Benevolent Associa- |
tion, has lald (before Comfhissioner En-
right a schedule for salary increases for
all policemen, which he is asked to in-
eorporate in his departmental budget.
No action formulating the’ demands has
yet been taken by the association, but
it is announced the fight will be carried
on energetically by the Civil Service
Forum. The schedule provides for’ in-
creases ranging from $150 to $250 a
year, and fixes g minimum salary of
$1,500, instead of $1,250 now obtaining.

It is estimated the proposed demands
will add $1,800,000 to the budget. In
the report to Commissioner Enright the
$300 required of new policemen for the
purchase of uniforms and equipment is
named as one of the causes of the de-
mand. Most of the patrolmen have had
to borrow money during the year, it
was stated, to meet the increased cost
of living.

Six Sing Sing convicts brought a lot

because they couldn't withstand the urge
to shoot craps. The half dozen, together
with several others who ran too fast for
the keepers to catch them, were having
a nice, quiet little game in one of the
prison buildings when Principal Keeper
Martin Dooley raided it. All but six
fled, and the unlucky six were fined
several “marks” each, which means that
‘hey have to stay in prison just that
many more days when their terms ex-
pire. ;

The crap shooters, when they fied, left
behind them $25, which was turned over
to Warden Brophy. The warden hasn't
the slightest idea what to do with it, be-
cause it is against the rules for con-
victs to have money, and if he turned
the cash back to its owners he would
be alding in a violation of the rule.

has made into the effect of prohibition on
the railroads. The association declares
that the annual loss in earnings to the
railroads of the United States due to
prohibition will amount to approxi-

that the officials of the roads predict
freight rate increases totalling $500,000,-

up for the loss of this business and to

One Sweet Potato

became the center of attraction
in a store window at Daytona,
Fla., because it weighed 18%

Everywhere in the South
there is something growing of
which they may well be proud,
whether it be grapefruit, or-

derful trainloads of celery and
vegetables that are being loaded
in the cars in Florida, labeled
for New York.

It is not the size of this store
of which we are proud,

It is the things we do and the
things we are able to do which
please us most.

That we are growing daily in
many directions and beneficially
to the public is an encourage-

THAT REFLECTS THE GOOD TASTE OF NEW YORE

The Oriental Rug Sale _
Is a Vista of Mellow Color

A Personal Tour Reveals Its Beauties and Opportunities

“For the Rug Store get off at
the Third Floor, turn to the right,
and cross the Bridge was the
brief, concise and direct informe-
tion thet the elevator operetor

ave to an out of town visitor.

here is the distinguishing mark
even in this brief statement. New
Yorkers and most visitors to New
York instantly recognize that
the Bridge of Progress is at
Wanamakar’:.

Arriving at the “Bridge,” there
opened in wonderful perspective a
picture thet compelled instant
attention. Looking down the vista
was a glory of rose and gold and

yellow meade up of Chinese rugs
anging everywhere. It was a
scene that would have been a ioy
to those master painters of the
early nineteenth century who
revelled in the radiance of color-
ing which Oriental rugs offer.

Facing the Bridge a promenade
is hung on either = a a ani
rugs, forming another baickgroun
superlatively beautiful. Upon the

floor at angles of repose rugs are
piled one upon another. Others
are spread helf open. While

others are pushed back to make
way for One that is being shown in
its full extent.

There is yet another promenade
of a hundred feet or more, where
still more Persian rugs are shown
—whispering of = Persian gerden
of multi-colored beds of flowers,
and trellised vines in bloom, foun-
tains that rise from a mosaic-
bound pool, which reflect the clear
crystal-like blue of a Persian sky.

The Selection Is
Wonderfully Complete

The selection of rugs fills every
requisite of the ideal stock of
Orientals. And—as we found out
-——the prices are lower here, when
values are compzred, than prices
elsewhere.

 

There could not be conceived
® more practical method of de-
veloping and cultivating the love
of the beautiful and broedening
the art instincts of a people than
this sale, which makes it possibie
for people of even most moderate
means to surround themselves
with beautiful examples of an art
yuon is far reaching in its bene-
its.

There is nothing that can be
bought for the home which will
bring 2s much atmosphere or as
much expression as an Oriental
rug, and when such rugs 2s these
are offered at these prices their
sale is a great step in the wide
extension of art.

Some Examples

There are some rarely beautiful
ieces in this collection, pieces so
individual that they could never
be reproduced. A gorgeous Kir-
man, 18 ft. x 25.7 ft., the ideal

ece for a living room or library.
ts soft rich tones are so soothing,
so satisfyi that it should be
placed in that large room where
One spends most of one s time.

Another Kirman has more than
a dozen tones of a single color,
producing 2» lovely mauve effect
in high lights to derkest mulberry |
tones in the shadows. Oneecsnt |
imagine s more beautiful carpet |
for a music room than_ this
wondrous piece 15 ft. x 25 ft.,
exquisite proportions.

 

 

 

 

On a field of blue, such a foyous
blue, were the medeéllions in rich
dark shades, now wine, now red,
now purple, which went to make
up a mervelous Sarouk, @ rug thet
$3,250 seemed a small price for
when one considered its exquisite
beauty, and examined the quality.
The wool wes fire and silky, the
werve close and hard, but one did
not need to examine thig es an
expert might, and count the knots
to the square inch, to determine
its worth, for its loveliness had
determined its status; such ex-
quisite effect as this can be at-
tained only by quality, :

Wonderful pieces bound. One
wants to mention this Kirman
10.9 ft. x 15.9 ft. in which birds
and fruit abound. Or to sey a
word of praise for this 14.6 ft. x
22.6 ft. Kirman which makes the
Tree of Life its supreme motif;
$1,450 @nd $1,250 are the prices
which mean wonderfully good
fortune for someone who purchases
the rugs.

And then a m arvelous hall rug
7.8 ft. x 19.8 ft., one of the antique
rugs. One cannot fail to pay
homege to this Fereghan (zome-
times known as Iren) which hes
the most exquisite tones mellowed
by age. It is 2 wonderful example
of the weavers ert.

A Hemaden in brown. end blue,
pink and green with‘its medallion
in floral design 12 ft. x 17.10 ft., 2

splendid room size, and this beauty
is $975.

The Smaller Rugs

The market is swept clean of the
usual medium or average size
rugs. Today, you of all the re-
tailers, hold the only broad stock
from which to choose, 10 ft. x 14
ft., 9ft. x 12 ft., 8 ft. x 10 ft., and
the lesser sized rugs, and your
prices have utterly disregarded the
usu®l rule of supply end demand,
which regulate price.

A Kermanshah of 11 ft. x 10 ft.
at 9524 is as characteristic and
beautiful as eny of the large,
gorgeous Persian rugs. A 10 ft.
x 8 ft. Meshed has all the beautiful
coloring of the antique Meshed,
in its soft shades of blue, green,
pink, fawn and ivory, and this
plece is only $350.

_ Sarouks in these smaller room
sizes at around $675 are the same
lovely Sfrouks that we see in the
large pieces, only these are scaled
to smaller sizes 2nd small prices.

There are small rugs here 2s low
as $8.50, in fair proportions,
3 ft. x 6 ft. at $39.50 and $49.50,
and others of little larger sizes
at $69.50 and $69.50.

The Chinese Rugs

Your collection of Chinese rugs
so far outclass any others to be
found in New York that they must
be mentioned apart and distinct.

These distinctive rugs are most
superior and the best authorities
on accord Chinese rugs a
high place, although it is 9 in
recent years thet Chinese rugs
have come into America and their
artistic merits are only becoming
fully appreciated

At the rete that Chinese rugs
are advancing in favor, these rugs
will be worth twice whet you are
asking for them even before other
Chinese rugs can be brought in
to take their places

There are so many of these
Chinese rugs in colorings which
are exclusive to your collection.
The exquisite apricot rugs, in the
riche fu 5 ee are not seen r
where in anything approaching
the delicacy and yet fullness of
tone that these choice pieces of
yours have. The orchid shades
which are in these splendid tones
that are so often employed in
Chinese pottery are shown here
in a magnificence of result that
no other collection attains. A

. peach blow which takes up where

the orchid tdnes leave off, end
effecting a bit more rose, develops
another exquisite effect, is the
color of some.

Yellow Chinese rugs can be
found, but no such yellow rugs
as these of yours which are rich
in an unusual effulgenct color.

This collection of Chinese rugs
is more to be appreciated when
one has seen and compared it with
all the others, and when the prices
of these rugs are considered ‘‘the
wonder grows.”

It is astonishing to know that
a Chinese like this exquisite
one in orchid tones with rose
relief in a 9 ft. x 12 ft. can be
sold for $600, the piece is so ex-
quisite, the coloring so extremely
beautiful, workmanship the best,
and quality of the wool so fine
and lustrous.

An exquisite peech blow with
the design of butterflies end flow-
ers intermingled is another 9 it.
x 12 ft. Chinese rug which $475
seems only a song for.

A lovely yellow in a typically
Mongoli#n pattern with its cir-
cles of happiness, and e 9 ft. x 12
ft. size at $875 is one of the as-
tounding pieces not to be du-
plicated in quality or workmanship
to say nothing of color at anything
like this price. A 9 ft. x 12 ft.
lovely tan with Chinese border in

blues is $350.
