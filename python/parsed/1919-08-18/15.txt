: - Play in National Champion-

ship at Oakmont Links,

 

: By INNIS BROWN.
“Pirrenurc, Aug. 17.—Play for the
‘American golf trophy in connection with
the national amateur championship at
the Oakmont Country Club to-day re-

sulted in a tie, with a best ball of 72

‘turned in by two teams. Richard Haight
of Massapequa and J. Simpson Dean of
Atianta returned that figure, as did
Grant A. Peacock and Davidson Herron
of Oakmont.

Had the big field been tinged a wit
More with a collegiate air the day would
have netted a clean sweep for Princeton.
All of the above quartet are Prince-
tonians. This accounts for the fact that
Haight from Massapequa and Dean from
Georgia were teamed. Both were mem-
bérs of the Princeton team during the
past college seazon' and hooked up for
the test to-day.

. Pecullarly enough. the teams not only
fifished in a tie for the eighteen holes,

“fut also tied for each nine. Both

equalled par for 87 on the first eide

and then came home in 35, one below
par, for the half.. However, the advan-
tage lingered with Haight and Dean as
they started for the eighteenth hole.
Both of this pair found trouble on their
seconds, each landing a trap guarding
the green. Both were over on their outs,
but both chipped up close to the cup and
got down their putts for 5s.

‘On the other hand, Herron bagged a
fine 4 to pull up to a tie with the other
pair. He followed a) fine drive with a
Magnificent secund to the green, laid an
@pproach, putt dead and had no trouble
in gefting his 4.

an garnered a bit the better of the
credit due his pair. He was shooting
magnificent golf. He had a round of 75
himself, though the course again was
slowed up late in the afternoon before
the pair finished by a storm, not so vio-
lent, however, as that of Saturday. Dean
sank a six foot putt for a 2 on the thir-
teenth, and also holed a bird 4 on the

4 yard tenth. Altogether he won six
holes. Haight captured three and .the
remaining nine were halved by the pair.

Herron was slightly better than his
team mate, Peacock. He too had a 75
for his round. Six of the eighteen holes
went to him, while Peacock, who was
shooting excellent golf, captured 4. In
eight cases they finished with the same
Score. Among Herron’s accomplishments
was a bird 3 at the 330 yard fourteenth

Tewkesbury-Platt Second.

Paul Tewkesbury and J, Wood Platt
followed but one stroke behind the tying
yairs. This duo entered from the Gobb
Creek public links of Philadelphia. The
farmer appears as an individual entry in
the tournament from Aronimink, where-
mg Platt is registered from North Hills.
‘They came home in the same figures
hung up by the leaders, but encountered
a. bit more trouble in their outward
fourney, taking 38.

James PD. Standish, Jr, and C. G.
Waldo, Jr. Detroit Country Club,
éropped in behind Tewkesbury and Platt
with a 74. Waldo bagged the only three
of the afternoon's play on the difficult
second hole. His approach from fully
150 yards away ran to within eight feet
cf the cup, and he dropped’ his putt
nicely. But after turning the first nine
with a 36, they ran to 38 coming home.

R. E. Hanson and B. Warren Cochran
of Baltimore had'the very fine record of
84 for.the first nine holes. They looked
very much like winners up to that point.
However, they found no end of trouble
coming back and were unable to
Straighten their play out in good team
work. The two wabbled at the same
time. Their total for the second nine
holes was 41, giving them a 75, which
tied with Robert A. Gardner and W. L.
Clow, Jr., Onwentsia, and Max Marston
end C. E. Van Vieck, Jr., playing from
tine Valley.

Gardner Gets Only 3 at 18th,

In holding the total ta that figure for
his team, Gardner ran down a bird 3 on
the eighteenth. It was the only three of
the day at that hole. He had two fine
shots to the green, and got down a
twelve foot putt. This pair played with

and Van Vieck, who came
along with a two stroke margin, but
each took a 5.

Seventeen teams returned scores, but
there were many others who started
and fatled to record their scores. Bobby
Jones and Perry Adair counted a 76 for
their round, with Jones having that
egunt for his individual score.” This,
however, allowed for two putts of about
three feet each, where Adair already
had holed out and Jones had nothing
better than a half with his partner pos-
sthler 4

The four entriés from St. Louis, all of
whom are representatives of the Forest
Park public course of the Mound City,
teamed up in two pairs, but neither
team was able to crowd the leaders.
Walter Kossman and E. A. Limberg
scored a 76. Richard Bockencamp and
James 8. Manton, the St. Louts city
ehampion, ran up an 81 for their round.

he is able to get around at all. This
despite the doctor's advice to withdraw.

Ouimet’s trouble is an afternfath of
throat trouble from which he suffered
a few days ago at New London, when
he drop off there en route to Pitts-
burg and'‘played a round on the Shene-
cossett Country Club links. He followed
this with an automobile trip through
to the Smoky City. He stated last night
that before he had finished his round
on Saturday he knew that he had a
fever. However, he decided to stick to
his guns and play his string out.

If Ouimet is forced to withdraw from
the tournament his loss will cut interest
in the tournament considerably. There
fs a keen desire on the part of enthusiasts
here go see him and Champion “Chick”
Evans meet, since Oulmet was not in
the field when Evans won the title in
1916. There is a presentiment that if
both start on their games, they may
eventually fight the battle out for, the
championship in the final rounds.

Evans is playing well, and if Ouimet
regains his strength sufficiently to play,
their meeting should prove a sensational
affair.

Pairings Are Announced,

Pairings for the play in to-morrow’'s
qualifying round of thirty-six holes were
announced this afternoon. Play starts
at 9 o'clock and will continue through-
out the day, with the last pair finish-
ing around 7 o'clock. ‘

Max Marston is one of the first of the
metropolitan entries to get away. To-
gether with W. J. Thompson, runner up
in the Canadian amateur championship
several weeks ago, he will get away at
9:10 for hia first round.

Champion Chick Evans is another one
to draw a place in the early set. He will
tee off with C. G. Waldo, Jr., the pair
leaving at 9:45. Jesse W. Sweetzer, the
Ardsley youngster, will get going ten
minutes later with Freddy W. Wright,
one of the youthful stars of the Boston
district, This will doubtiess be the
youngest team in the field, and their
playing will attract considerable atten-
tion. Already the sharps are beginning
to watch the high pitch shots by
Sweetzer, who was hardiy known here
at all when he arrived.

Provided Ouimet is able to play, he
will get away at 10:05, paired with Wal-
ter Kessman of St. Louls. John G. An-
derson and Louis Jacoby, who led the
field in the elimination round Saturday,
start at 10:50. Jerry Travers is, paired
with John Grakam of Stanton Height,
and will tee off at 11 o'clock.

White Paired With Kirkby.

The draw threw Gardiner White of
Nassau and Oswald Kirkby, metropoli-
tan champion from Englewood, together.
They begin their first round at 11:40.
Bobby Jones will be one of the late
starters. He and Lester Corley of Si-
wanoy tee off at 11:45,

Rains of the past two days have lefi
the course fairly heavy, meaning that
extra distance from a roll is well nigh
hopeless. On the other hand, a drying
out will hardly help any. The greens
are very fast as it is, If the ground
dries out to any considerable extent be-
fore the end of the week, the greens will
be almost like a billiard table. It is dif-
ficult enough to hold the ball down now,
and it will be next to an impossibility on
a shot of any distance when the greens
dry out.

 

TO HELP HUNTS MEET.

 

Prominent Tarfmen Will Support
Belmont Terminal Events.

Sportsmen and turfmen of national
standing who have recognized the value
of the United Hunts Racing Association
work in its relation to the presént firm
footing which racing enjoys have flocked
to the standard of the organization and
aided in liberal financial fashion the as-
sociation in anticlpation of its autumnal
session, which will take the form of a
two days’ meeting at Belmont Park Ter-
minal August 30 and September 6.

Arrangements are we)] under way for
what promises to be quite the most suc-

1

sive organization, which is concededly at
the forefront among the turf bodies that
cater to the best phases of flat racing
land timbét topping sport. The fact that
|many stables were unable to get quar-
ters at the Spa has warranted the train-
ers in making preparations for the meget;
the one on the last weekday of
month being one which will give local
devotees of the sport an opportunity to
witness good racing on the flat and over
the steeplechase course, which is ad-
mittedly the most difficult in the coun-

That all the leading lights of the run-
ning horse game will not be at Saratoga
is evidenced by the nomination of the
officials who will manage the Hunts
meet, these including some of the best
known of American racing men and

Challenge Round of Doubles
May Not Be Played To-day
on Longwood Courts.

 

By EUGENE R, 0’CONNELI,

Boston, Aug. 17.—Devotees of tennis
up in this section of the country are
none too optimistic to-night that the
challenge round of the national cham-
pionship tennis doubles will be played
to-morrow afternoon at the Longwood
Cricket Club courts as scheduled. Rain
has been threatening all day and those
who profess to know anything about
New England weather feel quite certain
that {f it comes at all, it will come in
sufficient quantities to flood the courts.

In spite of the remarkable work of
Gerald Patterson and Norman £.

Brookes, the Australian challengers,
there are many who believe that the
American title holders, William T. Tilden
24 and Vincent Richards, have more
than an outside chance of successfully
defending the champianship. With those
who feel that way, however, the wish
| probably fs father to the thought.

When Brookes and Patterson made
= eir first appearance as a doubles team
at Newport last week onlookers were
not greatly impressed in spite of the fact
that the Anzac combination played well
enough to win the tournament. Their
tennis was not exceptional in the Casino
tourney and the teams which the visitors
had to face were for the most part
makeshift affairs. The fact remains,
however, that Brookes and Patterson
have improved wonderfully since their
errival in this country both in their in-
cividual and team play.

While both Tilden and Richards have
speed and strength galore and each is
brilllant in individual play, their team
Brookes and Patterson or, for that mat-
ter, to the team work of at least a
couple of American teams th ‘ailed in
the preliminary rounds of the champion-
ship tourney here. They are both young-
sters, and although each is remarkabl
eampaigning in tournaments necessary
to develop court craft and team work.
left for Southampton, L. I., where they
will compete in the annual invitation
tourney on the Meadow Club courts.
This event will give the players their
last chance to get tuned tp for the na-
tional championship, which begins one
week from to-morrow at the West Side
Club in Forest Hills, L. I
~As a result the draw will comprise
practically all of the players who will
compete in the all comers. If by any
chance the challenge round of the dou-
bles can be played to-morrow Brookes,
Patterson,

If not they will leave for the Meadow
Club as foon as possible, and even if it
is too late to cpmpete in the singles they
will manage to get some practice In ex-
hibition and friendly matches.

Joint supervision of the Woodmere Coun-
try Club and New York Women's Swim-
ming Association yesterday.

Following her triumph over Fanny
Durock, the Australian, on Saturday,
Miss Ethelda Bleibtrey yesterday low-
ered the 50 yard open water backstroke
standard from 38 4-5 to 381-5 seconds.
Miss Charlotte Boyle brought down the
50 yard free style figures from 29 4-5
to 293-5 seconds, and Miss Ruth Smith
cHpped the 60 yard breast stroke mark
from 42 to 892-5 seconds. All three
are members of the New York Women's
Swimming Association, but Miss Smith,
formerly of Columbus, \has only been in
the district a few weeks, and is com-
peting unattached until eligible to rep-
resent the New York club.

The races took place over a course
measuring one foot more than fifty
yards and all A. A. U. requirements
} were complied with. There is no doubt
{that the new records will be officially
accepted. It may be added that all
three actually represent world's stan-
dards, but can be listed only as Amer-
fean records because the Internationa’
Federation does not consider perform-
ances at less than 100 yards.

All Day Carnival.

The meet was run off in two sections,
morning and afternoon. It was in the
morning that the marks dropped. In the
afternoon other attacks were made, but
the favorable

water was so rough that fast times were
out of the question.

Miss Bleibtrey disposed of the back
stroke figures in a handicap race in
which she concedgd 3 seconds to Miss
Alice Lord and beat her by a short mar-
gin.

Miss Boyle accounted for the free style
mark in a handicap match against Miss
Leslie Bunyan, the fifteen-year-old star,
who received 3 seconds also,’
covered the course in the remarkable
time of 31 2-5 seconds and won the ¢ace,

But Miss Boyle was given a fair start Cul

and three watches caught her perfor-
mance, so there is no questioning its
| authenticity.

The breast stroke standard was beaten
by Miss Smith in a contest with her
twin sister, Eleanor, national cham-
pion at this style of swimming. Eleanor

neck and neck battle.

into a sea of rolling whitecaps
at various hours yesterday, nine small

1 yachts had a glorious brush in the an-

vided into three classes, and with the
exception of W. H. Farrell's Senora of
the handicap division the entire fleet
finished the overnight race.

MAN 0’ WAR WILL
GBT SBVERE TES

Will Oppose High Command in
the Grand Union on Satar-
day at Spa.

 

 

Special Despatch to Tue Sv.
Sanatooa, Aug. 17.—Another big week

of racing is on the card at the Saratoga
track. To-morrow the Bolton Handicap
will bring out several horses in which
great interest is manifest and which
have not been to the races in some time.
They are , Billy Kelly, Star Hampton,
Penrose, Motor Cop and War God.
Naturalist is top weight with gi?

pounds. °
The first of the big features of the
week, the Grab Bag, a six furlong
event for two-yeor-olds, will be run on
Tuesday, The Schuylerville, a five and
a half furlong handicap for juventies, is
down for decision on Thursday.| Satur-
day very likely will be another record
breaker, with the Grand Union for two-
year-olds; the Merchants and Citizens
and the Beverwyck Steeplechase as the
major events.

The Grab Bag is an event of the
sportsmanlike character of the Saratoga
Special in that the nominators go in it
blind and race practically for thelr own
money. The Grab Bag became a Sara-
toga fixture in 1914.

Man o' War, which has known defeat
but once this season—he was beaten
here last week in the Sanford Memorial
through the abominable riding of Loftus
—will start in the Grand Union. The
Grand Union will be a race of three-
quarters of a mile in which the purden
of Man o’ War will not be greater than
180 pounds. Samuel D, Riddle an-
nounced some time back that be in-
tended to start Man o’ War in the Grand
Union and after that in the Hopeful
and the Futurity and then put him by
for the year.

The Grand Union candidacy of Man
o’ War invests the impending renewal
of that special with keen interest. The
sharps of the East are rating Man o’
War up with Colin, the unbeaten; Ham-
burg, Campfire, Novelty and Regret.
There is a strong probability that in the
Grand Union Man o’ War will have a
chance to meet the colt the Western fra-
ternity have elected champion amniong
the smart colts and fillies of the Blue
Grass. High Command, a son of The
Manager and Elien-a-Dale, ie the West-
ern crack Man o’ War may meet in the
Grand Union.

High Command has started twice in
the West. He finished third on a slow
track to Marjorie Hynes and Lord Ham-
flton at Latonia on June 7 and he de-
feated the $12,400 Westwood, Inspector
Hughes and Lord Hamilton on a fast
track on June 11, running five-eights of
a mile around a turn in better than 1:00
flat and winning by ¢ight or ten lengths.
High Commad’s shins were bucking in
this race and it was because he was still
sore when he got to Saratoga late in July
that Major Thomas Clay McDowell has
not started him up here.

N.Y. A.C, ATHLETES
| WIN POINT TROPH

Geri Off Honors in Eeccen-

tric Firemen’s Games at Cel-
tic Park With 15 Points.

 

 

 

With only eight athletes making up

the team the New York Athletic Club
yesterday won the point trophy at the
annual games of local union No. 6 of the
Eccentric Firemen at Celtic Park.
Winged Foot members won two of the
eight events and finished third in two
other events, rolling up winning
score of 15 points. It was the first open
meet won by the New York ciub since
its return to team competition. The
representatives of the St. Christopher
Club, who won only one first place, fin-
ished second with 11 points. A triple
tie resulted for third place with the
Kings County A. A., Morningside A. C.
and Brooklyn A. A. Each scored 8
points each. The Loughlin Lyceum was
next in Iine with 6 and the Jersey Har-
riers and Paulist A. C. deadlocked for
fifth place with 5 each.

Joe Pearman of the New York A. C.
accounted for one of\his team’s victor-
fes when he came home first from
scratch in the two mile handicap walk.
Pearman, who recently returned from
France with the 105th Infantry, de-
feated a select field. With Pearman
on the scratch marif were William Plant
of the Morningside A. C., William J.
Rolker of the New York A. C. and
Eddie Renz, another New York A. C.
member.

Plant made a desperate attempt to
catch Pearman in the final quarter but
to no avail. Renz finished third about
fifteen yards behind Plant. Rolker, the
other scratch man, quit on the last lap.
It was Pearman’s third consecutive vic-
tory since his return from the war.
In the five races he has competed in
since returning Pearman has won three
and finished second in the other two,

the

Brennan Wins Novice Race.

Frank J. Brennan, who won the 880
yard novice run, was responsible for the
New York A. C.'s other victory. Bren-
nan ran a good race taking the lead on
the second lap and winning by three
yards over L. Bennett of the St. Anselm's
A. C. W. Gegan, an unattached run-
ner, finished third two yards in the rear
of Bennett. Bennett's time of 2 minutes
121-5 seconds was considered fair for
a novice.

Loren Murchison, unattached, national
60 and 100 yard title holder and 220
yard record holder, finished third from
scratch in the 220. yard handicap run.
Despite the fact that his opponents were
allotted Iiberal handicaps, Murchison
ran a corking race. He finished almost
in a dead heat with V. T. Levy of the
St. Christopher Club for second place.
The event was won by L, Buxbaum of
the Brooklyn A. A.. who started from
the eight yard mark

Through the fine running of John J.
O'Brien, who ran the last leg for his
team, the Loughlin Lyceum quartet
won the 1,200 yard handicap relay race.
O'Brien on the final leg pulled his team
up from second place and won by a
yard over B. Weiseger, who ran the
final leg for the St. Christopher team.
The Brooklyn team was in receipt of 86
yards, while the St. Christopher team
started from the 46 yard mark. The

Clever Featherweights to Box
in Jersey City Early in
September.

 

By CHARLES F.. MATHISON,

Jimmy Hill, who claims the Austria}.
fan featherweight championship, after
repeated efforts, at last has obtained a
mecht with a worthy opponent. Benny
Valger the French featherweight has
consented to meet the Australian, and
John Jennings las undertaken to stage

the contest at the Armory A A. Jersey
City early in September.

‘As Valger is the leading challenger of
Kilbane, and is a classy boxer, the
contest should furnish a clear idea of
the ability of the boxer from the
antipodes.

While the work of Hill is not «o
well known to Americans as that of the
late Les Darcy, yet the featherweight is
said by those who have seen him in the
ring to be quite as good in his division
as was Darcy in the middleweight class,
If this view of the case is sustained by

 

succeeding events’ in the ring. there
I should be some violent surprises for
| the feather and lightweight divisions

lin this country.

As Kilbane has refused an offer of a
$10,000 guarantee to meet Valger it can
readily be seen that Hill is apt to have
his troubles when he gets into the ring
with the Frenchman.

Ell ~will be compelled in preparing
for this match to train for speed rather
than endurance. The Australian {s ac-
customed to boxing 20 round bouts,
which naturally encourage slow starting.
The eight and ten round contests
prevalent in this country require speed
from the first gong to the last.

 

Filipino a Foul Boxer.

Kid Denclo, the Filipino featherweight
champion, who recently got a decision
over Vince Blackburn of Australia, may
be a good fighter, but he evidently is a
foul performer. According to ringside
reports of the battle Dencio butted
Blackburn. opening a cut over his left
eye, causing blood to flow throughout
the rest of the bout, and forcing the
Australian boy to battle the rest of tls
way with the sight of only one eyo,
After the bell had rung for the finish
of the fourth round Blackburn droppe:l
his hands and started to return to his
corner, but Dencio landed three or “ou”
heavy swings on Vince's face before
Referee Sammy Gross parted them.
Many thought this an accident cuused
by Dencio’s failure to hear the bell, but
this was repeated at the end of the fifth
and sixth round.

In the ninth round Dencio grabbed
Blackburn round the neck and threw
him to the floor twice.

Yet the referee saw nothing out of the
ordinary, permitted the bout to continue
and calmly gave the decision to Dencio.

 

McGoorty Neglecting Work.

It may be inadvisable for any one te
wager on the chances of Hddie Mé-
Goorty against Joe Beckett in London
on September 2, as advices from the
training camps are to - effect that Mc-
Goorty is neglecting his work, while
Deckett is training like a major. Mo-
Goorty a few days ago became so bois-
terous in a public house that he was
haled to court and fined §2.50.

McGoorty in good physical condition
would have a chance against Beckett.

 

Kilbane is a diplomatist {n the matter
of warding off the attentions of disa-
greeable challengers. He declined a
match with Valger unless the challenge:
made 122 pounds ringside, knowing that
Valger never could make that weight
Kilbane himself could not make less
than 128.

Having thus neatly disposed of one
challenger Kilbane was approached by
another in the person of Joe Lynch, who

gladly assented to the 122 pound ring-
| side condition.

Mr. Kilbane ewas equal to the oocca-
sion. He said he would be pleased to
meet Lynch, but that as a condition
Lynch first must defeat Valger at 122
pounds!

If Kilbane retires from boxing and
enters the political ring, as is reported,
he should make his mark as a member
of the Board of Aldermen or even the
Legislature,

 

 

Fulton Still Idle.

Few tears will be shed over the fafl-
ure of Fred Fulton to get any matches
in England. According to a man who
was in Great Britain while Fulton was
there, the plasterer earned but $100 al
the time he was in that countrs

Any man who thinks he car scandalixe
his own profession and then make
mong at it is quite apt to discover he
is mistaken.

 

 

AMERICAN GIANTS WIN.

Beat Treat ‘Em Roughs, 2 te 1
and ® to 7-—Perritt in Debut.

The American Giants of Chicago
champions of the middle West, started
their Eastern invasion yesterday with
a double victory over the Treat ‘Bm
Roughs yesterday at Dyckman Oval.
In the first game the Chicagoans car-
ried off the honors in a due! between
