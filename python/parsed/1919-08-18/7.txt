have their beginning back at the
source of our food, the fountainhead
of our very existence?

Let us not deceive ourselves. We
must try to check the profiteering, the
hoarding, the gambling, if possible the
slacking. But if we succeed—if we
wipe every eingle bit of every one of
those odious practices out of our na-
tional life, can we dodge the stern
fact, can we blink the cold truth, of
those billions on billions of increased
living costs, slapped upon ue at the
very start of the long road our food
ever journeys from first producer to
last consumer? Shall we go on fud-

lucination that piling on more and
more wage and rate and price and
tax coste all along the line will make
that road easy when it*cannot fail to
make it, foot by foot, the harder?

The Supreme Interest in the Trac-
tion Steike Is the Public Interest.

The first obligation and duty of the
city administration Ja to preserve pub-
lic order. The first obligation and
duty of the Interborough is to operate
the railroads under its control. The
Interborough cannot fulfil its. obliga-
tion or do its duty if the city fails
to fulfil its obligation and neglects to
do its duty.

The transportation «ystem on which
a majority of the people of a city
of 5,500,000 or 6,000,000 inhabitants
rely to carry them to thelr work and
play must not be allowed to lle idle
because the men who have been em-
ployed on them are dissatisfied with
their pay.

The paramount interest in the
transportation system is the public
interest, and the system must be
restored to operation with the least
possible delay to serve the necessities
of the public.

 

Kentucky Reports Its Americanism.

The analysis of political conditions
in Kentucky which Tuer Sun prints
elsewhere to<lay is of particular in-
terest and importance, as !t reveals
the reaction of sound Americanism to
President W1Lson’s programme of in-
ternationalism,. The opposition in
Kentucky to his scheme for a super-
sovereignty designed to deprive the
United States of its independence cuts
all partisan ties. The demand for
the continued freedom for the United
States in foreign affairs in that State
rises superior to the traditional preju-
dices of domestic politics.

This manifestation of undeceived
patriotism in Kentucky 1s peculiarly
significant because it confirms the im-
pression which has been produced
wherever the electors have had an op-
portunity to pass on President Wu-
S50N’s proposals at the polls. The
record of elections since 1916 has
been one of general and unrelleved
defeat for the Democratic party, in
which President Wrison is the sole
outstanding figure. No major politi-
cal party in America has ever been
more completely dominated by one in-
afvidual than the Democratic party
has been by Wooprow Wizson, and
its defeats have been defeats for him
and his projects.

Sentiment in Kentucky is not dif-
ferent from sentiment in other States.
The sweep of mounting Americanism
is nationwide, and disaster will surely
overtake those who endeavor to go
counter to ite irresistible force.

 

How Banks Took Care of Their
Returned Employees.

If there was a qucstion ag to what
action the banks aud financial insti-
tutions of the country would take re-
garding the reinstatement of the re-
turned soldier or sailor in his former
position it is a question no longer;
for the American bankers through
their association have made a sys-
tematic and thorough inquiry of the
officers of each institution which is
a member of the organization to find
out what fits action and experience in
the matter were. The questions asked
were if the institutions had taken
back their old men, what was the
men’s attitude toward the work and
what was the course regarding the
emergency force employed during the
war.
In the Journal of the American
Bankers Agsociation Mr. E. D. Hut-
Bert, chairman of the executive com-
mittee of the trust section of the as-
sociation, gives the result of these in-
quiries, a result which he says “rep-
resents the views of all classes of
banking institutions.” The replies in-
dicated definite policies to meet the
situation. One institution said that
the men left with the definite under-
standing that “they should walk into
the bank, hang up their hats and re-
sume thele former postions.” --A
other said that it not only promised
to give the men their former positions
but also paid them “in addition half
of the salary they were getting at the
time of leaving,” and another that it
was taking back the returned soldiers
and sailors “at such an increase in
salary as they would have received
had they remained during the war.”
A North Carolina company reported
that at the news of the armistice it
wrote to each former employee that
on his return he would find his old
job or a better job open for him, and
an Indiana company said that in every
instance it had installed its returned
employees in better positions in the
organization. ,
The replies indicated that a great
majority of the men returned to their
former positions. There was, however,
a difference of opinion as to their at-
titude toward thelr work. A Penn-
sylvania institution reports that the
most noticeable change is that the
men “would prefer outdoor empioy-
ment if it was possible to’ obtain
something to their liking.” A Wash-

 

 

larger salaries than when they went
away.” A Now York institution :
that some of its clerks in their early
twenties “seem to have: acquired
& manner which may be correctly
termed ‘a swelled head.” And a
California institution says that “the
returned soldier or sailor is not long
satisfied with his old position.” But
in opposition to these reports ie one
from Rhode Island that “we note a
most worthy confidence to do higher
grade work"; another from Pennsyl-
vania that the returned employee
“seems to be in a good deal better
spirit, better health and, in our judg-
ment, decidedly more efficient’; and
another from Iowa that the men have
developed mentally and physically and
are showing more enthusiasm and a
greater appreciation of their oppor-
tunities than ever before.

The inclination is to retain the em-
ployees who filled vacancies made by
the entrance of men into the military
or naval service, Mr, Hvunpert says
that the sentiment of all the replies
on this point might be summed up by
the statement that it has not been
necessary to dispense with the ser-
vices of substitute or temporary em-
ployees except in the cases where the
services have not been altogether sat-
isfactory. A New Jersey company re-
ports that “our experience with wom-
en as a class is not satisfactory”;
a Massachusetts firm says it made a
readjustment by creating new posi-
tions for some of the women em-
ployees. An Indiana company did not
find it necessary to dismiss women
employees, “as we employed the wives
of men in the service where it was
practicable, and expect that they will
resign 4 soon as their husbands have

return

The result of this nationwide in-
quiry, which is reported with com-
mendable succinctness and impartial-
ity, Is a clear exposition of the re-
lations between the largest American
banks and trust companies and their
employees during and after the war.
Viewed as a whole the financial in-
stitutions have shown a strong desire
to handle the situation with entire
fairness, and their former employees
have enthusiastically returned to their
duties better equipped physically and
mentally by their national service for
their peace time work.

The Cobblestones of Nantucket.

Nantucket !s a cosmopolitan island,
the vacation resort of visitors from
all parts of the world, and the wel-
fare of the quaint little town In-
terests people in every State of the
Union, Somebody noticed the other
day on one of the principal streets
an automobile from California going
one way and an automobile from
Florida going the other, showing how
widespread is-the attraction exerted
by the island which the province of
New York gave away more than 200
years ago to Massachusetts in igno-
rance of its future desirability as a
possessfon of the Empire State.

Since the decline, of the whaling in-
dustry the prosperity of Nantucket
has been largely dependent on sum-
mer visitors from the mainland; and
the permanent inhabitants, charged
with the responsibility of administer-
ing insular affairs, have wisely sought
to make and keep their island as at-
tractive as possible. To this end,
about a year ago, they removed the
ban against automobilés which had
previously existed on Nantucket.
There are now no less than 203 motor
cars registered on the island.

Now that the long standing automo-
bile controversy is settled, however,
& new question has arisen to stir the
souls of the islanders—a question of
sentiment, according to some people,
a question of common sense in the
opinion of others. Are the ancient
cobblestones with which Main street
and the adjacent Square are paved a
public nuisance which ought to be
abated by covering them with a coat-
ing of concrete, or do they constitute
an object of antiquarian interest the
obliteration of which would materi-
ally detract from the attractiveness
of Nantucket to strangers and sum-
mer visitors whose patronage is es-
sential to the continued prosperity
of the island? ;

Like many other sem!-rural commu-
nities, the people of Nantucket are
favored with the presence of a Civic
League whose purpose is to advise
their rulers how to govern the town
wisely. The league has just consid-
ered the cobblestone question at Its
annual meeting, and has registered
“Ite unqualified approval of keeping
Main street and the Square paved
with cobblestones in their present con-
dition,” ..This action is declared to be
in accordance with the present policy
of the league to preserve the charac-
teristics of the town of Nantucket.

Of course the advantages of perpetu-
ating the cobblestones are purely sen-
timental ; but there are cases In which
convenience may properly be asked
to give way to considerations of sen-
timent. We should not like to see all
traces of the Applian Way removed
near Rome, although the substitution
of asphalt pavement might make the
road smoother for traffic. So, in
Nantucket, although the cobblestones
are admittedly objectionable to auto-
mobiles, baby carriages and other ve-
hicles, it may nevertheless be exped!-
ent to retain them in all their naked-
ness if they constitute a magnet of
antiquarian interest the removal of
which would lessen the number of
visitors to the island. The ‘Civic
League regards them as “a veritable
antique” which ought to be preserved
@s a quaint and curious memorial of
old Nantucket. Other .more hard
headed islanders declare in the ex-
cellent local newspaper, the Inquirer

 

But when all is said and done, how | ington report is that “some of the|and Mirror, that the Square will ul-

over some year—when the time ar-
rives that common sense takes prece-
dence over sentiment.”

With regard to this ¢otbldstone con-
troversy ‘we have had recourse to our
teference library, in which we find

Nantucket,” published in 1914. On
page 169 of that work occurs the foi-
lowing statement:

“Main street or the Square. as it
was, then called, from the Bank to
Rotch's Market, was firet paved with
cobblestones about seventy-five years
ago (18377)."

We respectfully refer this statement
to the consideration of our friends in
Nantucket. A cobblestone pavement
only seventy-five years old is hardly
an antiquity worthy of preservation
solely on account of its age.

Femininity in the New Fashions.

Paris has been showing its new
fashions in clothes for women, and in
them “there is not the slightest
suggestion of masculine, tailor made
effects,” On the contrary, ‘soft ma-
terials are used generally, and
flounces and panniers give the de-
signs a strictly feminine appearance.”
The fears entertained by some timid
souls that women’s war time un!-
forms, built for convenience and hgrd
wear, would leave a legacy of man-
nish modes are not fulfilled. Woman
will decorate herself, as she has for
ages, in what seems to her most at-
tractive and best adapted to display
her charms,

it would not be surprising if the
reaction against severely plain gar-
ments for women were even more
pronounced than the revived Paris
fashion show records. All over the
world which takes its fashions di-
rectly or indirectly from Paris women
have been leading practical lives,
wearing practical clothing and doing
practical things for four years. They
are now entitled to the luxury of
dress designed for beauty first. .

The news from Paris is that Ameri-
can buyers are not adopting the edicts
of French designers slavishly, but
show a determination not observable
before the war to have their: ideas
heard and their suggestions treated
with respect. For four years they
have had to get along with little
help from Paris, and they have done
very well. In «pite of this we may
expect that Paris gowns will not lose
their distinction in the opinion of
American women,

Philosophers will make a virtue of
necessity and begin to-day to walk
to their offices for the sake of their
health,

 

Some mathematical geniug should
figure out what the hog which has
been in cold storage in Detroit for
twenty-five years has cost his owners
in interest, refrigeration, rent and In-
spection. It may be found that even
at the present pork prices the deten-
tion of this’ fellow for a quarter of a
century has cost a good deal more
than he is worth on the market.

The attention of somebody capable
of giving satisfactory expression to
public opinion—we suggest HERMIONE
—should be called to the preciousness
of precedents. There is something
about them which the rugged profan-
ity of man does not quite reach. That
has been much employed, but has al-
ways failed. Consider, for example, the
clerks for Congressional committees
which never hold meetings. A Rep-
resentative brought into the House
the other day a resolution to hire
clerks for a number of committees
which had been overlooked on a pre-
vious day. One was the Committee
on Railways and Canale. It does no
business; its jurisdiction ‘haa been
taken over by other committees; it
has, as a member quaintly remarked,
“falten into innocuous desuetude.”
There were faint stirrings as of oppo-
sition until some one reminded the
House that there was a precedent; the
wicked Democrats gave that same
committee a clerk last Congress. What
would you? Naturally the clerk was
authorized,

With the army transforming mili-
tary posts into colleges in khaki what
refuge is there for the youngsters
who have longed to enlist in the hope
of avoiding further attendance at
school?

While reason holds her sway with
some and romance sways many more
Senator PHELAN will make slow head-
way in his effort to secure Federal
action to bar from the port of San
Francisco Japanese picture brides.
Since this country and Japan shook
hands on a gentlemen's agreement that
if we would make no laws’ against
Japanese immigration Japan would
give no passports tc Japanese laborers
those of the latter class already here
have been marrying Japanese girls yet
in Japan by some sort of transpacific
ceremony a conspicuous detail of
which consists in an exchange of pic-
tures. The Japanese Government rec-
ognizes these marriages a#tav®ul, gives
passports to the brides and they are
coming over in astonishing numbers,
160 arriving recently in one day, Brides
though they be, the Senator insists
that soon after they reach their hus-
bands in some fruitful foothill valley
they can be found in husband's or-
chard or vineyard laboring diligently.
All of which must be true, as the
Senator says so, but there's no use
talking about it. A bride's a bride,
end a picture bride cannot be made
into an immigration problem.

PEDLERS IN UNIFORM.

 

Attention Again Called to a Violation

of the Proprieties.

To THe Epiton or Tur SuN—Sir; Com-
ing down Fifth avenue this morning I
noticed men in uniform who stopped
Pedestrians and endeavored to sell them
copies of a booklet. I purchased a copy
for myself, and while I have not had
time as yet to examine it carefully I
have no doubt that there is nothing
about the book itself which is objection-
able. @ desire to call your attention,
however, and through you the attention
of the public and of our ex-service men
to the great wrong that is being done
to the American uniform by encourag-
ing its wearers to use it as a means for
increasing street sales for any object, no
matter how worthy.

This is a matter to which we have
called the attention of the public and
of the service men on another occasion,
and we found that everybody concerned
responded splendidly to our point of
view, appreciating the importance of
safeguarding the American’ uniform,
worn with such distinction here and
abroad by our brave fighting men, from
commercial exploitation for any pur-
pose whatever. With new parades com-
ing up, however, and with the influx of
rew men in the city the incidents ob-
jected to appear to be occurring again
on a considerable scale, and every good
American would appreciate it if you
would publish this appeal in your col-
umns to the men themselves not to al-
low themselves to be employed for the
exploitation of their uniforms, and to
the public strictly to refrain from buy-
ing any article sold to them by persons
wearing our Government's insignia of
service, C. BE. Kitpourns,

Major, C. A. C., U. 8. A.

YET MEAT COSTS MORE.

Packers Kxpiain the Superiority of
Modern Methods,

To TH® Epiror or THe Sun—Sir; In
Tue Sun of August 5 appears a letter
over the name of F. L. Hitchcock of
Scranton, Pa., in which he brings out
the point that meats are high to-day
because the slaughtering methods of
twenty years ago are abandoned.

Mr. Hitchcock fs evidently not famil-
ier with the economic reasons for the
change from small scale local slaughter-
ing to the present system of slaughter-
ing in large centralized establishments,

Years ago cattle were slaughtered only
for the beef and hide; practically all
the rest of the materiale went to waste.
To-day every possible part of the ani-
mal is utilized in the production of-vart-
ous by-products, so that the retail meat
Gealer of to-day buys the carcass of beef
for less money than the packer paid for
the Iive animal.

As the country grew the trend of
reat production was naturally toward
the territories where corn could be
abundantly and cheaply raised, and the
result is that the so-called corn belt
proauces about three-quarters of the
country's total meat requirements.

Eastern farmers have found it more
profitable to devote their lands to dairy
farming. If meat production in the
Eastern States were as profitable more
farmers would be engaged in it, for the
East contains numerous live stocw mar-
keto and slaughtering plants.

Mr. Hitchcock is wrong in assuming
that meat production in this country is
ne greater than it is because of any
activity on the part of the packers.
Tlere is no way the packers can pre-
vent any one’ from engaging in either
the live stock or the slaughtering busi-
ness, and there is no reason why they
should want to, One thing is certain,
that as soon as it is evident to the
lccal butcher that he can dress cattle
to better advantage himself than he can
buy his dressed meat from the packer he
will not hesitate to make the change.

But the retail dealer knows better
than any one else that local slaughter-
ing methods cannot compete with large
scale operations. The small slaughterer
hac no facilities for handling the by-
poducts the saving of which enables
the large slaughterer to reduce the spread
between the Ive stock and meat prices.

The statement of the United States
Food Administration covering the year
ended November 2, 1918, shows ‘that
the five large packers who were under
{ts control operated the meat and ani-
mal by-product seetions of their busi-
ness at a profit of only 1.6 cents for
each dollar of sales, which is equivalent
to less than one-half a cent a pound
of product.

We contend that so small a profit has
no effect on prices, and therefore it can-
net be held ‘that the packers are re-
sponsible for prices. Swirt & Co.

(It was on August 18 in the year 1587
that was born virginle Dare, the first off-
+ i of the English race in what is now
the United States.)

On an island, rough, rock bound and lashed
by the sea,
From whose ridge through the mist could
be seen the dim shore
That stretched behind shoals whose break-
ers forbid, '
Was planted the seed that bloomed ever-
more,

And the ships that set sall toward the
rising sun,
To an island once peopled by Angle and
Dane,
Left behind but a handful to the mercy of
God
And the Redman, the winter, the wind
and the rain. ;

Ah, Virginia, do spare us the thought of
Ahose days,

Of the long starving times and the raids
of the foe,

upon to select a site for a hospital in| What left the tomahawk's swing and the

pitiless blast
But you, death!ess maid, and the crim-
soned snow?

And the ships that set sail toward the
setting sun,
Found the isle where every charred boul-
der and bone
Recorded Garing and death; but the sav-
age had stolen
The God given seed from which empire
has grown,
Moatimer J. Apes.

“I WILL c YOUR JUDG.
MENT WITHOUT CAVIL.”
President Wilson's Pre-Election Pledge

of Last October Recalled—Has He
Kept Itl—Is He Keeping It Now?
To TH® Eprror or Tue SUN—Sir: On
the eve of the Congress elections last

autumn, while the armies of the Unit
States were doing their hardest and

 

  

best fighting, Mr. Wilson put forth an}

appeal to voters as follows:

Mr Feiiow CounTarmen: +. 8
you have approved of my leadership
and wish me to continue to be your
unembarrassed spokesman in affairs at
home and abroad, I earnestly beg that
you will express yourself unmistakably
to that effect by returning a Democratic
Majority to both the Senate and the
House of Representatives. I am your
servant and will acwhs your judgment
without cavil,

Those elections resulted on November
6, 1918, in the return of Republican
majorities in both houses of Congress.
The World Almanac, 1919, at page
189, in a table entitled “The Sixty-
sixth Congress, Begins March 4, 1919,
and £Znds March:4, 1921," gives a list
of the Senators from each of the forty-
eight States, showing that seventeen
of them are; represented by two Re-
publicans, ffteen by one Republican
and one Democrat, and sixteen by two
Democrats. That almanac also shows
forty-nine Republican and forty-seven
Democratic members of the Senate.

In view of Mr. Wilson's pre-election
appeal to all voters, let us see how each
of these three numerically nearly equal
groups of States standing as to votes cast
in the last Presidential election, in 1916,
when the total for all candidates
amounted to 18,538,248. I enclose three
tables of details as to each group and
each State in it, as shown in the
World Almanac, which are too long
for a letter of this sort. But to state
the matter briefly:

At the last Presidential election, in
1916, ‘in the seventeen States of Con-
necticut, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kan-
sas, Maine, Michigan, Minnesota, New
Hampshire, New Jersey, New York,
North Dakota, Pennsvivania, Vermont,
Washington, West Virginia and Wis
eonsin, each of which is represented by
two Republican Senators, there were
cast 10,329,719 votes, being 55.72 per
cent, of the total in al) States.

In the fifteen States of California,
Colorado, Delaware, Idaho, Maryland,
Massachusetts, Missouri, Nebraska,
New Mexico, Ohlo, Oregon, Rhode
Island, South Dakota, Utah and
Wyoming, each of which {s represented
by one Republican and one Democratic
Senator, there were cast 5,253,783
votes, being 28.34 per cent. of the total
in all States.

And in the sixteen States of Alabama,
Arizona, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia,
Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Mon-
tana, Nevada, North Carolina, Okla-
homa, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas
and Virginia, each of which is repre-
sented by two Democratic Senators,
there were cast 2,954,746 votes, being
15.94 per cent. of the total in all
States.

That is to say, more than one-half
of all the votes cast in 1916—to be
exact, 65.72 per cent.—were cast in
States represented by two Republican
Senators; more than « quarter of all
the votes—to be exact, 28.34 per cent.—
were cast in States represented by one
Republican and one Democratic Sena-
tor, and less than one-sixth of all the
votes—to be exact, 15.94 per cent.—
were cast in States represented by two
Democratic Senators.

Is it not full time that Mr. Wilson
should now, as promised nearly ter
months ago, accept the judgment of his
fellow countrymen to whom he vainly
appealed for a Democratic Congress?

MR. LODGE’S GREAT SPEECH.

A Woman Thanks God for Such
Splendid Americanism.

To tHE EnpiTor oF THe Sun—Sir: I
thank God we have such men in our
Senate as Mr. Lodge and others of his
stamp. I have heard most of the strong
and splendid speecheS made in the Sen-
atc opposing the League of Nations, but
on reading here in New York the mas-
terly address of Mr. Lodge I was thrilled
with its eloquence, its patriotism and
ardent Americanism. It cannot help but
appeal to the hearts and intellects of all
veal and loving Americans.

I believe this loved land is still safe,
in spite of the secretive doings of its
omef working against her, bartering
away her independence in the Paris con-
ference.

As long as we have our earnest, pa-
triotic Senators fighting and battling to
held fast to our blessed standards that
have made us great I believe all will
be well. God grant it!

Mrs, JaMes Kennepy.

New Yor«, August 16.

 

Mr. Schwab on Mr. Carnegh’s Career.

To Tugs Eprror or Tue Sun—Sir: On
the same day that you published Sen-
ator Lodge's great speech on the League
of Nations there appeared in another
column of your paper the report of a
brief interview with Charles M. Schwab
in which he was asked to make some
statement in connection with the death
o? Andrew Carnegie.

Your reporter apparently had some
difficulty at first in getting a reply until
he said to Mr. Schwab that he should
be better able than almost any one else
to say something of interest to the pub-
Ne about Mr. Carnegie because he had
fought so many years at his side. This
remark apparently brought a quick reply
from Mr. Schwab, who told his inter-
viewer that he had an entirely wrong
idea, that Mr. Carnegie never fought,
ner did those associated with him; that
he was the kindest and gentlest of men
with his employees and all others with
whom he came in contact, that he never
tried to gain advantage by fighting his
cenipetitors, but that the secret of his
great success was his tireless and un-
ceasing efforts to perfect his own organ-
jgation from within.

Now if such a policy leads to such
success in the case of an tfndividual,
why should it not in the case of a na-
tlon achieve like results? It is exactly
in ine with the spirit of Senator Lodge's
argument. Let us keep out of entangle-
ments with our competitors and devote
our great energies to perfecting our own
organization from within. Then we
need fear nothing and we shall go far
indeed, for our house will be founded
on a rock and the tides and the winds
may come, nevertheless it will stand
forever. AMADIO.

TO FINANCE WORLD

,U. 8. May Permit Banks to Is-
' gue Notes Against Foreign
Governments’ Paper.

DEFLATION BIG NECESSITY

  

 

 

Senator Declares Profiteering
an Evil That Can Be
Dealt With.

 

Special Despatch to Tax Bux,
WaAsHINGTON, Aug. 17.—It may be de-
termined to permit American banks of
the Federal Reserve system to issue cur-
rency against the approved Government
obligations of certain foreign Govern-
ments, Senator Smoot (Utah), one of
the most conservative and best Informed
public men regarding financial and eco-
nomic affairs, said to-day.
There has been something of a move-
ment, the Senator said, looking to per-
mitting foreign commercial bills to be
used {n this way just as American busi-
ness paper is used. He @
opinion that it would be considered un-
wise, but was not so certain that the
employment of foreign Government
paper in limited amounts would finally
be barred.

“It coud be permitted only
case of countries whose
strength is beyond question,” explained
the Senator, “and must not be permitted
to become a basia for inflation.

“The country is pretty thoroughly con-
vinced there must be measures looking
to deflation of our circulation and that
is true, but it must be undertaken with
the greatest caution and executed in
such manner as to cause the least finan-
cial difficulty, The whole world faces

‘in the
financial

the necessity of gradual deflation. Just
consider there ie to-day in the compara-
tively stable countries of the world $56,-
000,000,000 of paper money in circula-
tion, against $8,000,000,000 before the
war. The debts of these countries
amount to $220,000,000,000, as against
$40,000,000,000 before the war. The in-
terest charge of these has risen from
$2,000,000,000 to $11,000,000,000.

Cannot Carry Burden.

“The truth is that the world’s produc-
tion cannot carry this burden and leave
opportunity for absolutely necessary de-
velopment. That fact must be faced.
It is beginning to be faced in Europe
and when the peace is finally obtained
we shall hear more of the efforts to deal
with the inevitable, England, France and
Italy will have ta resort to some form
of the so-called ‘levy on wealth,’ which
means nothing less than repudiation un-
der a milder name; taking through the
taxing power a part of the wealth of the
country to pay off the debts. The pesi-
tion of Germany and Russia is utterly
hopeless. Russia's debt outside the
country, so nearly as I have been able to
get figures on it, is about $5,000,000,000,
on all of which I think there has now
been default. There is probably $100,-
000,000,000 of paper money in Russia
aside from the amount I have mentioned
as being afloat in the more stable coun-
tries. Germany is likewise not included
in that calculation and its inflation is
tremendous, though exact figures are un-
obtainable.

“The programme of a levy on wealth
would impose burdens on France and
Italy so great jt is doubtful if those
countries could bear them./ Great Brit-
ain is in better posture to maintain its
credit.

“Tt is constantly asked how the United
States can help these countries and to
what extent it will be safe for us to ex-
tend aid. It must be done through bus!-
ness loans only, not through any more
loans to Governments such as were
made during the war.

“Our exports have gone up enor-
mously since the armistice and I think
we must expect that this will continue
for another year at least, while Europe
reestablishes stocks of the immediate
necessaries of life and of raw materials
for her manufactures. The pressure in
this early period after peace will be for
foods, clothing and materiale with which
to rebuild and reestablish industry.

Good Crops Promised.

“One very favorable feature of the
situation is that in considerable parts of
the Old World at least there {s now as-
surance of excellent crops this year.
This is true especially of Serbia, France
and Rumania and of considerable sec-
tions In Russia. I believe from the best
information I can get there is still a
good deal of cereals in Russia and there
may be some exports in the coming year
through the Black Sea ports.

“The upward tendency of prices fn
this country appears on a close study to
be a normal condition considering the
economic stress that the last four years
have imposed on us. I have a table
showing the movement of prices of
ninety commodities commonly used for
the four years of the clvil war period
and also for the four years from Janu-
ary 1, 1915, to January 1, 1919. They
show experience of the more recent war
period is almost precisely parallel to
that of the earlier one; about the same
articles have advanced and the index
figure shows the advances to have been
just about the same.

“That might cause a presumption that
the process of deflation would in the
present instance also pretty closely
parallel that of the period after the civil
war; but this cannot be taken too
readily for granted because there are
such wide divergencies in the conditions
At that time the United States had to
depend on the rest of the world to sup-
port and steady its progress toward nor-
mal conditions. In the present case
there is no such support for the world,
which is all in the same boat.”

Says Remedy Is Thrift.

Senator Smoot prescribes thrift, re-
sumption of production and close re-
striction of expenditures by governments
and individuals as the remedies that
alone can improve the condition of the
patient, which is the world.* As to
profiteering he is sure It is one of the
great evils that can be dealt with to ad-
vantage and gave this illustration;

“During the tariff discussion of 1909 I
declared on the floor that retailers made
all of 50 per cent. on their turnover on
ordinary imported women’s kid gloves.
My statement was questioned by a large
concern which wrote demanding that I
retract. IL sent to that establishment
and bought over the counter in the or-
ainary trade pairs of all the different
kinds of kid gloves they sold. Then T
learned the prices at which they were
imported—-which I had the facilities to
co—and waited.

“A member of the indignant firm
called on me and demanded to know
whether I was going to make the
apology. I said [ would not, but 1
might have a_ further statement to
make. Thereupon Tf produced the box of
gloves | had bought and the bill I had
paid for them and along with this a
statement showing just what the firm
had paid for those gloves.

“I am now willing, I sald, to revise my
statement, for I find that. instead of
making 50 per cent. on these gloves
your house made just 114 per cent, on
the lot. q

“But the matter was not pressed fur-
ther.”

MONDELL OPPOSES
SOLDIERS LAND BILL

Too Few Would Benefit, and if
Passed It Should Provide
for City Veterans.

 

Special Despatch to Tus 8c».
WASHINGTON, Aug. 17.—Only a smal!
number of the nation’s fighting men wi!
be benefited by the Mondell soldiers

land bill, Representative Ferris (Okla

ranking Democrat on the House Publ
Lands Committee, which has reported
favorably on the measure, stated t-
night in announcing his opposit 0
the plan despite the fact it has been
fostered by the Wilson Administration

“The bill is not feasible,” Mr. Ferr's
said, “and the soldier will grow hear
sick over the fact that relief is being
granted to a few and denied to tr
many.”

He predicted that the bill woul! met!
signal defeat in the House when it *
taken up for consideration within (ht
next fortnight, or will be radically
amended, #o that the benefits wil!
more universal, Mr. Ferris suggeste’
that in case the measure is not beaten
it he amended so that loans may be ex
tended to service men in the cities or
fertile agricultural districts who do ne
desire to buy the arid and swamp) lan:
the Government plans to sell to them
der the measure for reclamativ
poses. He indicated that oppositic
the plan had grown since it was
reported out of the committee will on
four Kepublican members protest

“As I converse with soldiers o
subject and study the plan more 4!
more I feel perfectly sure that the Mor
dell bill as it stands will not
ceptable to the soldiers, because it
fits a few and leaves the great
of the fighters without any
without any recognition of their
vices," Mr. Ferris said.

“My fear is that it will not take
of a sufficiently large numer of sor
to make it a soldier's bill
also it is not suffictently wi
scope to do justice to all of the §
in all of the States.

“The bill should contain a |
that all money appropriated ‘
for soldiers should be equitab))
tioned among the States, according

does not do this.

“In States that are we!!
