airplanes and hydroplanes at Cristobal

steps will soon be the carriage of the

Cristobal to Balboa and from Cristobal

Aerial transportation is especially
adapted to certain industries which rank
high in northern South America—gold,

The present means of transportation
involves at least ten days—often more,
when rivers aré low-—-to get the output
to the sea. The quantity of metal to be
carried annually, were the “mines adé-
quately developed, would be about a
hundred tons.per annum, A hydroatr-

Tt will eventually pay to transport
rubber by dirigible, if not by the heavier

on the Putumayo on a sunny morning
would put the fear of the Lord in the
hearts of the rubber agents oppressing
the Indians as no other expedient ‘short
~of a railway could, It would not only
expedite commerce; it would be a big
step upward for humanity.. A_ plane
could fly from Buenaventura, on the Pa-

have daylight in which to land on the

Of course the lack of safe landing
places is the big handicap at present,
but a hydroairplane could. follow the
course of the Magdalena or the Cauca

on the rivers with a good chance of
safety in a pinch. I look for this feat
to be performed before many moons.

this place required <an:expedition of

dense jungles, experiencing fevers,
hunger, perils from wild beats arid wild
men, to find a delectable short grass
region on the.interior plateau, on which
a machine might land. reconots-

Noted With Envy by Argentina and Chile—

Fresh Alignment Probable.

By 8, OSGOOD HARDY, M. A.

Written especially for the’ Lat Amer-
foan Section of TH® BuN,

very one has watched with interest
the effect the war on the two great
international rapprochemiénts, the Triple
Alliance and the Triple Entente, but thus
far little attention has been given to
its. influence upon the erstwhile entente
cordiale amotig the A. B. GC. Powers
of South America,

‘Before>the wat there was a. very
marked. trend in Argentina, Brasil and
Chile toward a mutual understanding
in: regard to foreign policy, especially
on the part of tina and Chile
After the settlement of their boundary
troubles these two countries became very
friendly and by many who feared the
dominating influence of the “Colossus
of thé North,” as the United States was
often called, it was felt that if they
could combine with Brazil a powerful
offset could be secured. ©

In spite of its frankly anti-Unt
States motif this movement was: wel-
comed by many in this country, who felt
that thereby the enforcement of the Mon-
roe Doctrine would be made easier and
when the diplomatic representatives of
the A. B. C. Powers were asked to assist
us in our attempt to settle our troubles
with Mexico it was felt that a decided
step had been taken toward bringing
it about.

At present, however, it seems that the
A. B. C. movement is further from ac-
complishment than ever, due largely to
the position Brasil now holds. By \its
active entrance into the war Brazti has
acquired an international position which
is recognized with envy by. the other
two large Powers and in addition a new
friendship has grown up between it and
the United States which makes it ini-
probable that Brazil will join with Ar-
gentina and Chile in any understanding
whose main raison d'etre is a hostility
toward and fear of us. ‘ ‘

A. B. ©, am Unnatural Alliance.

Furthermore the A: B. C. was in actual
fact an unnatural alliance. Since colo-
nial times Argentina and Brazii have
been rivals both politically. and eco-
nomically, and altho there is little
danger of politica] disputes now that the
boundaries of the different countries
haye been satisfactorily determined the
economig rivalry iss bound to ftncrease
with the development of Brazil's cereal
and meat industries During the. last
century relations between Brazil and
Chile were” very cordia}....A, negative
cause for this, lay. in the. fact- that as
Brazil and Chile were not contiguous
there was no. occasion for any boundary
dispute to arise between them.

A positive impulse came from the
Argentirg-Chilean ‘boundary. dispute
which caused Chile to seek the aid of
Brazil, an aid which the latter, with her
natural rivalry for Argentina, was quite
willing to grant. When’ Chile and
Argentina settled their differences
Chile’s motif no longer exieted and ‘af-
ter the first Pan-American Sctentific
Congress in 1907 Brazil's amity ‘for
Chile ‘was somewhat chilled.

The occasion for this Is rather tn-
teresting. At one of the most important
sessions of this congress a ledding Bra-
zillan delegate gave a discourse,
scholarly, but unfortunately in “Portu-
guese. Consequently it was understood

' MEXICAN OIL FOR SPAIN.

Commission Will Study Fields
North of Vera Crus.

Mexico Crry, Aug. 17.—The Spanish
Government is entering negotiations with
Mexico for the purchase of petroleum
for its Industries. With this aim in view
a Spanish commission of geological en-
gineers headed by Horacio Echeverrieta,
well kn@ewn Spanish business men will

Mr. Echeverrieta will negotiate for the
purchase of large quantities of petroleum
for interests he represents in Spain as
well as to make preliminary arrange-
ments for the leasing of oil lands in the
vicinity of Tampico.

It is. believed that the syndicate that
Mr. Echeverrieta represents is prepared

GERMANS RESUME IN BRAZIL.

Restrictions Against Big Concerns
< Removed.

Rio p& JANEIRO, Aug. 17.—The Bra-
silian Government has withdrawn all
its restrictions against German banks,
insurance companies, factories and simi-
lar businesses. The daily newpapers of
this city in commenting on the Govern-
ment’s action cite the recent reports
from the United States to the effect that
commercial relations with Germany were
to be; instituted as soon as practicable.

On the heels of the Government's an-
nouncement comes the action of the
German banks in opening their doors for
business, These banks have remained
closed since Brazil went into the war
against the Kaiser.

Plan to Reduce Meat Prices.

MonTEvIDEO, Aug. 17.--A reduction of
the price of meats by at least 38 1-3 per
cent. is proposed by the packing com-
panies operating cold storage plants in
the Government's effort to cut the high
cost of living. The packing companies
believe they can cut the price and still
make a profit on the average sale on
account of the better prices obtainable
in export. trade. The Government is
contemplating fixing prices on the actual
necessities as well.

Fatare Alignments.

As to what the diplomatic alignments

and Uruguay, will
em closer together.
Paraguay’s outlet to the Atlantic de-
pends on the Parana River, both banks
of which in its lower course are in
Argentina, and on the railroad com-
munications with Argentina and Uru-
Suay. The latter acte as a sort
buffer State between Argentina and
Bragzil.
At times in its history it has faced
toward the north and at other times
toward the south, but it is to be ex-
pore aa a eg wane his«

Peru is of course possessed of an
undying dislike for Chile. Her relations
with @ United States are equalled
only by those between Brazil and the
United Gtates tn mutual esteem and
cordiality. In addition Peru was from
the beginning of the war strongly pro-
Ally and can feel fairly eafe in predict-
ing that a strong friendship will in all
probability grow up between it and
Brazil. Their boundary troubles have
been settled and the common interests
between the montana of Peru and its
natural outlet, the Amazon basin of
Brazil, wif surely increage it.
As to Ecuador and Colombia, it seems
likely that their relations will in the
future be friendly with Chile. “The for-
mer, because somewhat hostile toward
us a decade ago, has still a tendency to
lean toward Chile tn its diplomatic rela-
tions. Since the independence of Panama
Colombia has of course felt aggrieved
toward thé United States. This feeling
has lessened greatly in recent years, and
{f the treaty now before the Senate is
passed the Panama wounds undoubtedly
will be heal In the meantime Chile
is making hi while the sun shires.
A delegation of her leading citizens is
now visiting Colombia with the definite
object’ in view of bringing about a
commercial understanding with that
country. Chile needs many of Colom-
bia’s products for her desert nitrate re-
gions, and it would seem that consider-
able commercial intercourse could well
spring up between the two countries.
And gommercial, reciprocity always
breeds political coydiale.

 

Venezuela and Bolivia remain to be con-
sidered. The former is almost as un-
known, ‘politically, as darkest Africa was

exercises such a tight censorship that
pclitical news from that country !s very
scarce and we know practically nothing
ot what ifs taking place.

Bolivia is the Switzerland of the Now
World. With no sea coast and a navy
confined to a few launches on Lake
Titicaca, she has little to fear from in-
vasion and in times past has often
snapped her fingers in the face of
foreign Powers who have threatened
ferce. Her relations with all the nelgh-
boring countries are very friendly and
although unquestionably she would like
te recover her lost nitrate provinces
from Chile, she has evidently resigned

STRIKE AND POLITICS
CAUSE FATAL RIOTS

Grave Situation Is Reported
From Pernambuco.

 

 

By the Associated Preee.
PERNAMBUCO, Aug. 15 (delayed).—
The strike of the street car men of

Pernambuco and a@ heated political cam-
paign have caused much disorder here. ;
which culminated Thursday in the kill-
ing of, four persons and the wounding
of twenty in a suburb of the city.
Business is at a standstill on account
of the strike and the political differ-
ences. ;

The election for Governor of the State
is to be held August 18 and there is
much fear of grave disturbances be-
fore that time and Aluring the election.
The casualties in the suburb of En-
crusilhada were caused during a clash
between persons attending a political
meeting and the police.

The street car men attacked : the
power house of the Pernambuco Tram-
way Company and destroyed important
machinery. The strikers were said to
have filled the boilers and turbines with
sand and to have set fire to three cars.
The electric wires were cut in several
parts of the town and street car service
is at a standstill.

Strikers also attacked the gas plant
and permitted a large quantity of gas
to escape. Conditions in the city and
the suburbs at night are serious, as
there are no lights in the suburbs and |
a smaller gumber than usual in the |
city. |
There are three candidates for the!
Governorship of the Prevince of Per-
nambuco. They are Gen. Dantas Bar-
reto, retired, of the Democratic party;
Barao Suassuna, non-partisan candi-
date. and Dr, Jose Bezerra, canaidate
of the Dissident Democrats. Dr. Be-
zerra is a former Secretary of Agricul-
ture in the national Cabinet and is a
Federal Senator for Pernambuco.

Gen. Barreto is carrying on an active!
campaign and is strongly opposed by
the Dissident Democrats, who are led
by Gov. Manuel Borda. The Democrats

Senor Tavares de Lyra, the Minister of
Public Railways of Brasil, proposes to
combine the facilities of the Sao Paulo,
Sorockbana and the. Itapura-Corumba
railways, thus creating a railway system
extending. from the port of Santos via
Sao Paulo through the rich coffee
country, onward across the northwest
of Brazil and traversing the vast cattle
country of southern Matto Grosso, A
new railway is also in contemplation
across the coastal range of Brazil from
Angra dos Reis, midway between Rio
and Santos, yia Barra Mansa into the
heart of the State of Goyas.
The Peruvian Government is at pres-
ent considering the construction of a
railroad which ts to reach the region of
navigable rivers in the north, affluents
of the great Amazon. This will make
possible the shipment of goods from Cal-
lao on the Pacific to ports dn the Ama-
zon, to be transferred thence to steam-
ers bound for Atlantic ports. The new
line, starting at a point on the Cerro de
Pasco Railroad (which runs from Lima
to the Cerro de Pasco eopper mines),
will tap extensive virgin forests of valu-
able timber.

In Argentina a considerable number
of the important railway extensions and
improvements have been postponed, but
it is hoped to proceed with some of them
during the present year. Direct railway
communication between Argentina and
Chile—from Buenos Ayres to Arica via
La Paz, Bolivia, a distance of 1,913
miles—has now been opened.

In Chile plans and specifications have
been completed for a new line between
Valparaiso and Santiago via Casablan-
ca, A Hne from Pua to Traiguen has
been commenced and construction is pro-
ceeding on, the line from Iquique to Pin-
