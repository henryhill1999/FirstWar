BODIE GETS FOUR HITS

 

New York Lineup Receives
Shakeup—22,000 Fans See |
Indians Beaten, 6 to 2,

 

Special Despatch toe Tam Sux.

Cisvetanp, Aug. 17.—While 22,000
fans rooted for Cleveland as only West-
ern fans can cheer, the Yankees rose out
of the depths of the second division and
established themselves in sole possession
of fourth place in the American League
pennant race by defeating the Indians in
a game replete with action.

e Yankes hit when hits were needed
and played with rare skill when stabil-
ity of defence was essential to success.
They were favored by those incidents of
pageball that rooters call breaks and
won by a soore of 6 to 2.

Without casting discredit ypon the
achievements of the Indians, it may be
eaid in fairness to George Mogrid
that had it not been for the pardonable
strategic error of Frank Baker the in-
diane would have ‘een besmeared

 

with Whitewash. However, in the
seventh inning, with two out and
two on, Baker cut in front of

Chick Fewster and tried to field Chap-
man's tap to shortstop, The blow went
ag a hit and scored Steve O'Nelll, and
then Tris Speaker followed with a
double, scoring Nunamaker, who was on
base at the time,

Mogridge in Fine Form,

Those two runs were all that the In-
dians could coax or jimmy from
Mogridge. It was the old George Mo-
gridge who stepped out on the mound to
face the Indians. Tris Speaker sent
Stanley Coveleskie into the pastime to
repel the invaders.

Mogridge held the slugging Indians
down to six blows, and, as related pre-
vionsly, might well have pitched a aay |
out had it not been for the over anxiety
of Baker in fielding a play.

Mogridge had two bad innings, one of
which threatened dire consequences for
a ell, the other in which runs actu-
ally resulted, In the second George lost
control and filled the bases, passing
Wamby and Wood and hitting O'Neill.
Two hands were down, however, and
Guy Morton was easy.

The grand Cleveland offensive was
started in the lucky seventh, but it fell far
short of its objective. started the
inning by drawing a base on balls, and
Steve O'Neill got a double into the
crowd in left field. Leslie Nunamaker
was thrown into the lists as a pinch hit-
ter and rapped smartly to Baker, whose
throw to Hannah resulted in a runup |
on Wood and Wood's death, O'Neill
took third and Nunamaker second on tne
play. Graney was thrown out, Mogridge
to Pipp, with no result.

At this juncture Chapman hit to short-
stop, but Baker got off with the ball
and tried for the: play.
O'Nelll scored. Then Speaker followed
with a double, scoring Nunamaker.
Harris was purposely passed and the
port sided batter, Larry Gardner, was
easy.

 

Like a World’s Series.

While the Indians were dancing their
war dance the scene on League Park
was reminiscent of a Boston world’s
séties mob. Citizens cheered until their
necks turned a delicate shade of laven-
der and they ran around in Circles.

Hats were tossed in the air and warlike | was October gray.

By GERORGE B, UNDERWOOD.

Flashing forth in all his pristiné
Glory, the glory that was his in the
fall of 1916, when he capped the season
with a magterly—though fate ordained
ft to be a losing—fourteen inning
world’s series game against the Red
Sox, Sherrod Smith dropped the raging
Reds in their tracks at Ebbets Field
yesterday.

With speed galore, a sharp breaking
curve, baffling change of pace and su-
Pperb control, the sinewy Brooklyn
Southpaw, backed by a defence that re-
fused to crack or crumble, allowed only
four Cineinnatians to reach first base—
three on base hits and one on a pass—
and blanked the Reds, 3 to 0.

rere mowing the Reds downAnnigg after
inning the Dodgers, led by Jimmy
Johnston, who blasted out two singles
and a double in three times up, drove
in one run, scored himself and helped
still another marker along with a per-
fect sacrifice, were bombarding Slim
Sdilee with a hot barrage of base’ hits.
The tall, willowy Cincinnati southpaw,
who held the Giants to three -hits on
the Polo Grounds last Wednesday, was
jolted for ten ringing bingles, ineluding
a flock of four roaring doubles.

Doubles Help Do It.

Two of the doubles, one by the ram-
pant ‘Johnston and another off the bat
of Zachariah Wheat, followed Sherrod
Smith's own single in the fifth and
bagged a brace of runs. A double by
Olson in the seventh, with a neat eacri-
fice by the Sallee slaughtering John-
ston, and a sacrifice My by Tommy
Griffith coming on the heels of it,
receueee oe third Brooklyn tally.
| Bracing into a stonewall support be-
hind Smith the Dodgers accorded their
southpaw something of the same i{m-
Penetrable cordon of defence the Reds
threw up around Ruether in Saturday's
game.

Ward's corral of Groh's liner in the
seventh was a classic. Chuck generally
is a bit weak on balls hit to his star-
board. Groh drove a terrific liner that
ordinarily would have gone safely over
third. Ward lurched over to his right,
kurled himself at the ball and snared it
safely about two feet above the bag.
His own lunge and the impetus of the
ball sent him to the ground, but he kept
& safe clutch on the “apple.”

In the same inning Zach Wheat made
two beautiful catches of long fly balls
carried far out of their regular course
by the high wind. Myers robbed Magee
of an apparent extra base blow with a
running, leaping catch in the fifth
frame. With Rath on first and two
down fn the sixth Olson made a nifty
stop of Daubert’s bounder, but almost |
gummed the works With a hurried high
throw that/ Konetchy barely corraled by

right hand and played the hero's part
that day so did Jimmy Johnston ride to
the occasior yesterday.

Jimmy started proceedings in the first
by beating out a beautiful bunt and
stealing second, only to be left on the
outs by Griffith and Wheat. Jimmy sin-
gled to left in the third, stole second as
Griffith fanned, but again was left when
Rath threw out Wheat. In the ‘fifth
Jimmy got a chance to show what he
himself could do in the pinch.

Smith Launches Rally.

Smith paved the way for the win-
ning of His-own game with a sharp: sin-
gle to centre and was sacrificed to sec-
ond ‘by Olson. Johnston then
through with a two base thump to ieft
that registered Sherry. Griffith filed to
Neale, but Wheat brought Johnston
home with a two base blow to right.
Groh threw out Myers.

Johnston's last chance to do his bit
came in the seventh, when Olson led off
with a double to right. Jimmy came to
scratch with a sacrifice that planted
Ivy on third, in position to score on
Griffith's sacrifice fly to Magee.

Only four Reds reached first base on
Smith. Daubert singled with one down
in. the first, only to havé Groh smash
into a double play, Konetechy to Olson.
Rath bunted safely in the fourth, took
second on Daubert’s sacrifice and third
when Ward threw otir Groh. He was
left when Myers raced in and caught
Roush’s high fly back of second. With
two down in the sixth Rath singled past
third, but was left when Olson threw
out Daubert. Neale walked with two
down in the seventh, to be left by Kopf.
The score:

Hawley and Llewellyn Also
Graduates From the West,
Named Football Aids,

 

Clarence W. Spears has been reap-
pointed head football coach at Darte
mouth, and Jess Hawley and F. A,
Llewellyn, like Spears graduates who
earned fame on the gridiron for the
Green, have been named his assistanta.
This announcement wae made last night
|for the Dartmouth Athletic Council by
Joseph W. Gannon, {ts president. Liew-
| ellyn Was an aviator in France and got
j the Croix de Guerre and the Distin-
| Bulshed Service Cross, He served as a
fiight commander over the lines.
| Hawley will cooperate with Spears in;
;an advisory capacity, spending the |
major part of the season at Hanover,
and Llewellyn will act as assistant
coach. Hawley is established in busi-
| ness in Chicago, but has heen persuaded
,}to make a sacrifice to give his alma |
mater the benefit of his exceptional |
coaching ability. |

As Hawley, Spears and Liewellyn are
all residents of Illinois and originally
from the West, where they began their,
football careers, Dartmouth may be said
to have an all Western coaching staff
and its work will be watched with pe-
cullar interest, not only by Dartmouth
alumni but by all football adherents.

Hawley was graduated in 1909 and
played as halfback in the seasons of
1907 and 1908. In 1907 he was one of
the factors in the game in which Har-
| vard was defeated, 22 to 0, Other mem-
| bers of the famous Dartmouth back

 

 

Marks, Larry Bankhart and Johnny
Glaze. The brilliant work of Hawley
will be.remembered in 1908 in the game
in which Dartmouth defeated Princeton
at the Polo Grounds. The backs at that
time were Hawley, Ingersoll and Marks,
directed by “Spuddy” Pishon, who was
killed last year while an aviator in
France. After graduation Hawley
coached at Andover, and later was for
five years head coach at the University
of Iowa, where he was very sticcessful.

Spears a Star Guard,

Spears was graduated in 1917. His
Position was guard, which he played
with conspicuous success in 1914 and
11915, but was barred during his senior
year because of one year at Knox Col-
lege before entering Dartrnouth. In 1914
Dartmouth secured 3859 pofnts to op-
ponents’ 25, Princeton getting 16 against
12 for the Hanoverians. . Tufts was de-
feated 68 to 0 the week after they had
defeated Harvard; Penn was beaten 41
to 0, and Syracuse 40 to 0.

During his senior year in college Spears
coached the freshman team, which easily
won all its games, defeating Andover,
Exeter and Worcester Academy, and was

 

Andover. Spears coached the varsity
eleven in 1917 and in 1918 volunteered as
|eoach of the 8S. A. T. C. team at Dart-
| mouth.

Llewellyn was grad@uated tn 1914 an4
played on the Dartmouth varsity team
as quarterback during the seasons of
1911, 1912 and 1913. He played in
the historic game with Princeton in

of 3 to 0, when the hall béunded over
the bar. Dartmouth won all the eight
and Harvard, barely won in. the final
game by the close score of 6 to 3.
In his second year on the varsity, 1912,
Liewellyn played on the artmouth

0, and Cornell, 24 to 0.

| In 1918 Llewellyn carried over the
| ball In the Princeton game, which Dart-
, mouth won, 6 to 0, and he also figured
|Im Dartmouth’s victory over Penn that
| year, In all the games during Liewel-
| lyn's period, a feature was his forward
passes to Hogsett and Louden, the
Dartmouth ends.

All three of the Dartmouth coaches
were mentioned as all America players

mythical eleven was unanimously given
to Spears. :

A GREAT REVIVAL

Attendance Records Are Being
Smashed All Over Cireuit—
Giant-Cub Game Postponed.

 

 

bE FREDERICK G. LIEB.

Last winter some optimistic persons
predicted a great return of sport after
the war. A few looked forward to a
bright baseball season, but usually with
the reservation that “it might take the
game a year or so to get back to nor-
mal.” With many persons who talked
optimistically about baseball, the wish
was father to the thought.

While here and there a club owner or
manager would predict a great revival
in the sport, in legislative action the
magnate’ acted as though they feared
the worse, The major league club own-
ers had so little faith in the 1919 season
that they adopted the 140 game ached-
ule, the shortest season played in the
majors in fifteen years, Only a few
clubs, the Giants, White Sox and Cubs
put up a fight for the old six months
season of 154 game

There were confdrences looking to a
greater economy, smaller rosters, shorter
training trips and all that. The Na-
tional League did adopt a salary limit
of such humble dimensions that the
popular outory forced the league to re-
Peal it two days later. As to the twenty-
one player limits, they were swept aside
early in the season when the magnates
observed how the fans were pouring
through their gates.

Best Season Ever.

Without exaggeration, this season is
by far the best that professional base-
ball ever has known. There are a few
weak spots, the two Philadelphia clubs,
the Cardinais, Braves and Washington,
but even these clubs will be able to
show profits by reason of big crowds
they have played to in other towns. The
lone club that is Hable to lose money
is the St. Louis National. The Cardinals
have drawn little at home and only fig-
ured in a few big pots on the road.

The Giants always have been a good
drawing card, but they never drew as
well as this year, either at home or
abroad. The Yankeés have drawn far
better than at any time in past seasons.
The club already has been able to pay
off all this season's expenses, and all
the rest will be profit, a unique experi-
ence for the Yanks.

Sunday ball of course helped bring up
the attendance figures. Sunday ball
has had no appreciable effect on week-
day or Saturday attendance. Where
the New York clube formerly had one
big day at the end of the week, now
they have two. But the weekday at-
tendance also has been far above what
it was in past years.

Those two double headers with the
Reds last week, when the gates were
locked each day, set a new record for
weekday attendance. The Yankees also
set a new weekly attendarfee record
for their club a few weeks ago, when
23,900 saw a double header with the
White Sox.

Profitable tn Brooklyn,

, Sunday ball also is «giving Charley
Ebbets his first profitable year since
1916, the year of the Dodger champion-
ship. Brooklyn attendance fell as the
team slipped in the race, but the
Dodgers picked up a lot of pennies for
& rainy day in the spring when the
club was in the race.

Cincinnati, @ loser for years, is coin-
ing money, and all attendance records
in Redland have been smashed. It is
the same in Detroit, where the spurt of
the Tiger® has the whole town aroused.
Eighteen thousand were out to see the
Yanks play the Tigers last Thursday,
and yesterday the Detroit attendance
record was broken when more than
31,000 saw the team lose to Washing-
ton.

When the Yanks played a Sunday
game in Chicago on their second West-
ern trip the crowd was said to be the
areatest that ever packed in Comiskey’s
park. A week ago last Sunday the
Giants played to the biggest crowd that
ever jammed into the North Side*Park
in Chicago. Even the sixth place Red
Sox played to nearly 32,000 on a Satur-
day several weeks ago, the White Sox
being the attraction in a double header.

Rven the Browns are drawing as never
before. During the club’s spurt last
month about 28,000 saw a double header
with the lowly Athletics, the best St.
Louis crowd in four years,

Baseball never got such a play before.
It looks as though the public has money
for baseball despite the high cost of
living.

 

Giant-Cub Game Of.
The Giant-Cub game scheduled for

the Polo Grounds yesterday was called |

off on account of rain and wet grounds.
It was the second Sunday the Cubs have
lost on the Polo Grounds this season.
The Giant management explained last
night that the I. R. T. strike had noth-
ing to do with the club playing, and
that the schedule will be played regard-
less of transit conditions.

A double header with the Cubs is on
for to-day and one game for to-morrow.
It will be the last opportunity the Cubs
will have to win a game on the Polo
Grounds this year,

IN ALL SPHERES OF SPORT WITH BINGHAMTON:

 

By DANIEL,
Copyright, 1919, by the Sun Printing and Publishing Association.

HILE the Reds showed superiority over the Giants in. their series

W here last week Pat Moran's hopefuls were fortunate in coming
here im first class physical condition, every man jack of them

fit, and all keyed up to the highest pitch. The Giants got going with an
injury to Larry Doyle, who had not yet recovered fully from the sprung
charley horse which put him on.the bench in the West. Frank Frisch
played a great game at Doyle's place at second base, but Doyle's power at
the bat was missed very much. Frisch is a remarkable fielder, but he
still has a lot to learn at the bat. For one thing he will have to develop
confidence and get rid of the slight hitch. Fletcher sprang a charley
horse on Thursday, but said nothing about it until Saturday. Phil Douglas

was suffering from a bad cold on Thursday, but when Benton was chased
from the game Douglas went to McGraw and volunteered to pitch the

tilt the day before. Hal Chase played through Friday's games with a
sprained wrist and on Saturday was compelled to remain out of the game.
This casualty list is presented with no aim to take one iota of credit away
from the Reds, but it was unfortunate that the Giants should have suf-
fered a pltysical let down at a time when they needed their best condition.
Chase’s play previous to the series with the Reds was excellent, but
against the Cincinnatis his legs were very bad and his work fell down
most perceptibly, Chase no doubt will improve just as soon as he gets
back into the game, but he will not be without a rival. On Saturday Mike
Gonzalea, the Cuban whose regular assignment is catching, went to Chase's
place at first and put up an exhibition which demonstrated even to the most
untutored fan that Gonzales is a strong possibility for first base next
season. Gonzales's work showed why McGraw had declined several good
trades for the Cuban. Gonzales is fast, a quick thinker and a good hitter.
The Reds are enjoying a fine lead, but the Giants are not ready to

Ruth Should Set New Records for Home Runs.

Babe Ruth’s endeavor to excel Buck Freeman's major league record
for home runs in one season, which stands at twenty-five, is being watched
with great interest. Ruth has made nineteen homers and already has bet-
tered the American League mark of sixteen, set by Socks Seybold of the
Athletics. With about six weeks more in which to get the seven home runs
needed to outdo Freeman it seems quite safe to say that Ruth will have
the proud satisfaction of setting the new mark. On August 15, 1899,
Freeman had only fifteen home runs to his credit. He finished the season
with a rush and added ten more, most of them on the home grounds in
Washington, which had a very short right field. Ruth would hit about
fifty homers on the grounds on which Freeman set his mark. Seybold’s
{record was made with the assistance of another short right field, on the
aw Columbia grounds on which the Athletics used to play before they built
'Shibe Park. In so far as arithmetic is concerned Ruth fs three ahead of
| Seybold and only six behind Freeman, but for real class in hitting Ruth's

work already overshadows that of Freeman.

O'Dowd Will Have to Improve a Lot to Beat Britton.

Last week did not develop any momentous happenings in the fistic
world. Henny Leonard whipped Patsy Cline in six rounds in Philadelphia,
but that was a foregone conclusion. Had Leonard tried he would have
knocked out Cline.

}a margin against a boxer whom he had no business to permit to last the
jlirait of ten rounds. O'Dowd is reported to be boxing more cleverly than
of yore, but this addition of science appears to have taken its toll from
the power of his punch. In the matter of boxing O'Dowd cannot be con-
eeded a chance against Britton, who is too clever and too good a ring
general tq.lose.q decision merely on points. In the matter of punching
power Britton does not class with O'Dowd. If the middleweight champion
can get his batteries into action and is able to find Britton he will win,
perhaps by a knockout. But he will have to improve greatly over recent
performances. Leonard holds thet Britton will win on points and does
not think that O’Dowd will find the welterweight often enough to slow him up.

 

National Tennis Doubles Title May Leave the Country.

{face with the serious possibility oh soning the national doubles champion-
|ship leave the country. In the challenge round for the title at Longwood
this afternoop, against William T. Tilden 2d and Vincent Richards, Norman
E. Brookes and Gerald L. Patterson will have an opportunity to emulate
;the Doherty brother$ of England, who won the doubles in 1902 and
repeated the following year.
Singles, making a clean sweep for Engiand. Merrie iEXngiand itself does
not figure in our tennis this season, but its colonial representatives from
Australia are far more formidable than any of the Britons from home could
be. If Brookes and Patterson win the doubles they will have to be regarded
as mighty strong contenders for the singles honors, play for which will
be started on August 25 at Forest Hills.

Just how serious the Australians’ fight for the doubles will be depends
a@ great deal on the showing of Richards. Tilden, we believe, will stand
over both Brookes and Patterson, with some to spare. Richards should
come through too, but he is erratio in his doubles Play. In the final of
| the Newport doubles Brookes and Patterson defeated Richards and Wallace
F, Johnson, but the Antipodeans had to go four sets, all of which were
close and hard fought. Richards played a remarkable game, but Johnson
j failed him and threw the match away. If Richards plays the kind of tennis

 

jhe showed in the final at Newport Brookes and Patterson will be beaten. |

; We make this prediction in full recognition of the fact that the Australians
ire playing far better tennis than they were able to show at Newport
{where they went onto the courts fresh from their transatlantic journey, :
