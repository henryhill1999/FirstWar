From a Staff Correspondent:

Lovisviite, Ky., Aug. i17.—Eivery so
often something happens to make Ken-
tucky forsake the Democratic party;
rip a hole in the erstwhile adamantine
dikes that protect the Solid South from
Republican inundations from the
North and drive deeper into our na-
tional consciousness the realization
that Kentucky politics is a cantanker-
ous animal that is just as Jiable to bolt
and upset the band wagon as not.

Under normal circumstances, in the
calm serenity of the seasons preced-
ing the outbreak of the, great war,
Kentucky could not justly be termed
fickle. She was a Democratic State.
And there’s nothing to warrant any
claim that she is not still a Demo-
cratic State, The chances are that
she’s due for one of those political
convulgions for which: she is noted be-
cause of thelr infrequency. But on
those infrequent occasions she goes the

Many Repudiate @tanicy.

® The open repudiation of Senator
Stanley, his machine and all its works
by reputable Democrats such as Charles
Kerr of Lexington, Circuit Court Judge,
who in speech and print vigorously is
lamenting the demise of the Jeffersonian
Democracy of Watterson, the elder
Breckinridge and like statesmen of
earlier dgcades when there was no doubt
about Kentucky.

10. The natural recent growth of the
Republican population of the State, due
to the development of the coal mines in
eastern Kentucky. with the tmporta-
tion of Republican miners from West
Virginia and Pennsylvania.

sition of the Republican State ticket

of hard working, ambitious, practical

eikinetion, Platt, a Taggart, a Hanna or a Hiram

Johnson.

12, The possession by the Republican
machine in Kentucky of more money
than all preceding Republican organiza-
tions in the State's history could muster
in combination.

Young Democrats Admit It.

But there must be no jumping at
conclusions now. There is no desire to
make predictions with anything ap-
proximating certitude. The chances
are that Kentucky is going to elect a
Republican Governor and Government
in November.

Young Democrats concede the possi-
bility; some go so far as to call it a
probability. The old school Democrats
—the sort with whom Democracy is as
much a part of their family traditions
as their grandfathers are—are till
Democrats, and one has to talk to one
of these “old school Democrats to ap-
preciate the length, breadth and depth’
of such Democracy. They are going to
vote the Democratic ticket; not for
James D. Black for Governor so much
as for the Democratic nominee, despite
the fact that the two are synonymous.

As for the Republicans, they jubi-
lantry are predicting a victory for their
candidate for Governor, Edwin Porch
Morrow, of whom much of interest is
to be said, and at once produce facts,
figures and signs of the times to jiend
substance to their sanguine temper.

It is a matter simple enough to go
about Kentucky talking to factionists
and pitting prediction against prediction,
hope against hope and tirade against
tirade. It is not necessary to publish
Mr. Morrow to the affect that he will
win by such and such a majority or
plurality, And it would be quite as ab-
surd to quote Mr. Biack saying:

“1 shall carry the State by ——— thou-
sand votes, and the entire Democratic
ticket with me.”

The startling announcement would be
that either Mr. Morrow or Mr. Black
edited his opponent with anything
nore than a chance—a chance born
cf the most improbable of reversals of
current feeling. To settle, therefore, this
avestion for all time be it understood
that | have talked to both candidates
and both assure me that they will win.
As a matter of fact it would be neces-
fury only to substitute in Mr. Black's
interview the word Republican for the
word Democrat and there also would
be Mr. Morrow's forecast,

But it takes a very definite political
explosive to blast Kentucky loose from
the roots of her Democratic consanguin-
‘ty. As eminent an authority as Presi-
dnt Wilson can attest to Kentucky's
exceedingly narrow interpretation of
minding one’s own business. President
Wilson did not come to Kentucky and
Stump for Augustus O. Stanley four years
ag. when Mr. Stanley, now in the Uni-
ted States Senate, ran for Governor. In
th light of what happened it is quite
as well for Mr. Staniey that he didn't.
Instead, Mr. Wilson wrote one of his
eristles of appeal calling upon Kentucky
to support him by electingy the entire
Democratic State ticket.

Mr, Stanley won the election by 431
Votes and he managed to accumulate
those political life saving ballots in
Louisville, a city normally Republican.
More about that later.

Until the President's letter arrived it
looked like a walkaway for the Stanley
Machine. And just by way of a mo-
ment’s digression the celerity with which
Judge Charles A. Hardin refused Wash-
ington’s proffer of oratorical assistance

Sent to Congress on the Democratic

the Palatines of Kentucky Democracy,

Captain King Swope, a youth of 25, beat

presaging of victory.
ers are tangent upon these and are, for

county problems.

There can be no debate concerning the
disrepute into which certain elements of
the Stanley machine have fallen. Prob-
ably there is no more astute student of
Kentucky politics than Judge Charles
Kerr of Lexington. Hig defection from
the Democrats has caused much gnashing
of teeth on that side of the ditch. His
afMfiliation with Mr. Morrow was hailed
with jubilation by the Republicans. He
is a brilliant writer on political science
and economics and his record on the
bench is enviable.

“The saloons of the eleven wet coun-
ties of Kentucky,” the Judge told me,
“were the listening posts of the Stanley
machine. Ninety-five per cent. of them
were conducted by Democrats and were
the rendezvous of Senagor Stanley's
scouts, The closing of these saloons
means more to the Stanley machine
than any Democrat will admit.”

With a genuine regret the Judge ad-
mitted his defection from the ranks of
the Democratic party.

“The so-called Democracy of Kentucky
and the Wilsonlan Democracy of Wash-
ington are not to be tolerated,” he said.

The Democrats assert that Swope’s
election in a distritt that normally gave
a Democratic majority of 20,000, and

not mustered enough Republican votes
to wad a shotgun, was due to overcon-
fidence. The, Republicans agree with
them. The Democrats say that Swope's

warning of such overconfidence and that
it has awakened them. Again the Re-
publicans agree but with a rueful laugh.

“While I look at Swope's election as
a sign of the election of the entire Re-
publican ticket; as a sign of a solid Re-
publicanism and a disgusted Democ-
racy,” declared Mr. Morrow to me, “I
also realize that it is going to stir the
Democrats to great activity. They are
wide awake now.”

Morrow is a congenial politician. In
his speeches, his mannerisms and his at-
titude toward his opponents he is more
than a suggestion of the days of elec-
tion night parades, bonfires, cardboard
stovepipe hats and silver tongued ora-
tory. He is 42 years old, vigorous,
forceful, not too academic and possessed
of a vocabulary and an ability to me-
tawhorize that is nothing short of start-
ling. He ia a product of a farm near
Somerset, Ky., and of a breed that was
bound to be active in politics always.

‘ Morrow a Likable Sort.

Not to be absurdly nor fatuously en-
thusiastic, but merely to define this prob-
able next Governor of Kentucky, one
might characterize this most puissant of
all Kentucky's Republicane as a chap
who would just as like as not announce
his candidacy for the Presidency. He
would not do so because of any over-
whelming conceit, but rather because of
the superb confidence he has in Edwin
P. Morrow. Apparently he is one of the
most wholesome of men; frank, engag-
ing, candid and shrewd,

Until he sought the Governorship three
years ago and was beaten by Stanley
by only 431 votes he had never held
elective office. President Taft appoint-
ed him United States District Attorney
for the Eastern District of Kentucky
and he served in that capacity forr
years. Cumberland Academy, St. Mary's
College and the University of Cincin-
nati are responsible for his education
and a straight line of active political an-
cestry accounts for his acumen in his
present pursuit. -

Black, his opponent. became
entucky’s chief executive when Gov.

State Voted for McKinley.

But to return to the statement that a
very positive reason must exist for Ken-
tucky's defection from Democracy, it
Must be cited that only once has this
Rtate forsaken the politics of its fathers

& national election. Mr, Bryan ac-
complished this desertion and Kentucky
instructed eleven of her electoral - votes
for Mr. McKinley.

In State elections there have been
just two real repudiations of the Demo-
fratic party, William Bradley, uncle of
the present Republican nominee for the
Governorship, was elected chief execu-
live of Kentuokymon the Republican
tcket in 1895, He was the State's firat

‘publican Governor. Mr, Bryan's mone-
tary visions were responsible for that
flso. The second Republican to win the
Governorzhip was Augustus E. Wilson,
Who served from 1907 until 1911. The
Nquor quéstion is eredited with that. ,

And now, to summarize the whys and
the wherefores of a score or more of
»ucky politicians who hold forth in
ay section of ‘the State but who are
eetu 'y buzzing around the two party

4dquarters in Loulsville, this State is

the vacancy created by
the death of Ollie James. Mr. Black,
then Lietutenant-Governor, was vigor-
ously opposed for the nomination to suc-
ceed himself, but won out by a ma-
jority approximating 18,000. Physically
he is the antithesis of Morrow. He is
quiet to the verge of reticence. He is
not a speaker of any considerable note,
but there are none so foolish as to dis-
count his political sagacity.

Not a few of his adherents bemoan
his lack of directness and abrupt posi-
tiveness. He is credited with avolding
all committing statements.

To consider the second of the Repub-
‘ican reasons for predicting victory in
November it must be admitted that never
has any community evinced less inter-
est in any subject than Kentucky has
in Mr. Wilson's covenant.

Several are the reasons ascribed.

fence against future war. But such
scholars as Judge Kerr, stamping such
quackery as pernicious and panderings
to ignorance, have come out in Kentucky
newerpapers to call attention to Article
X., pointing out that the United States
8 therein pledged to preserve the in-
tegrity of members of the covenant and
showing the vagueness of the stipulated
means of such preservation. To clinch
that they have called the perplexed
Ppopulace’s attention to the lack of con-
fidence in the covenant manifested by
France's insistence upon a French-
Anglo-American treaty and England's
contention that the retention of Ireland
as a colony is necessary to the protéc-
tion of Engjand's west coast.

Dodge National Issues,

As a matter of fact, both sides are
eschéwing national politics so far as
Dorsible. The Democrats are fighting
on a@ straight Wilson platform without
being too specific. The Republicans are
making a straight State issue of it and
are thereby drawing down Democratic
insinuations of cowardice.

To predict a rejection of Wilson in
Kentucky, even if Morrow is ‘elected and
the entire Republican ticket with him,
would be outrageously presumptuous.
But were the national elections to take
Place to-day or this month or even next
it would be entirely pertinent to venture
the defeat of Mr. Wilson, And he polled
245,000 votes in Kentucky in 1916
against 220,000 for Mr. Hughes.

And to signify further the futility of
gauging what Kentucky will do by stand-
ards of what Kentucky has done, it is
shcwn that while Senator Stanley's pred-
ecessor in the Governor's chair defeated
his Republican rival, Judge O’Rear, by
33,000 votes, and while Stanley became
Governor in 1915 by the grace of only
431 votes over Morrow—a stupendous
Democratic decline or Republican prog-
ress, as you will—Mr. Wilson found that
puny Democratic majority swelled to
25,000 when he came to Kentucky for
Presidential votes in 1916.

So you get nowhere at all predicting
Kentucky political futures. You merely
can accept it as probable that, unless
Public opinion undergoes a radical re-
versal before the elections in November,
Edwin Porch Morrow, Republican, will
be Kentucky’s next Governor.

And on general lines you may accept
it as positive that at this writing the
vagaries of Article X. of the covenant
of the League of Nations have repelled
the soldier vote, which is seeing therein
the possibilities of another trip across
the seas to fight an alien Power.

Finally the notorious inexactitudes
of the covenant seriously have impaired
the merited cordiality that otherwise
would have been the heritage of the
preposed universal military training bill.
I do not know yet what the sentiment
is in other Southern States, but I have
heard trainmen and porters, bakers and
butchers, hotel men and merchants say
this:

“A trained army and a trained re-
serve, yes! But not to act as a stop
gap for laws in a covenant that makes
it an imperative necessity that we cre-
ate and maintain such an armed force

become

If that sort of talk is indicative of

the great part, local and the fruit of; what Kentucky will do when the Dem-

ocratic party in 1920 seeks national vin-
dication for Mr. Wilson's Administration,
s0 be it.

Hardin’s Defeat No Joke Now.

At first the deteat of Circuit Judge
Hardin, Democratic State Committee-
man, by Capt. Bwope, Eighth Con-
gressional district, was considered a
huge joke. Swope won a seat in Con-
gress over the veteran Judge. Many and
varied were the reasons offered by Judge
Hardin and the Stanley machine as an
organization.

“ Inasmuch as Swope never had been
heard of before announcing his can-

| didacy and that just once before had

the Eighth Congressional district failed
to return an overwhelming Democratic
plurality—and that back in 1896 when
Kentucky Democrats deserted William
Jennings Bryan almost unanimously,
Hardin's election was conceded to be a
foregone conclusion and the necessary
balloting a great waste of time.

Just at present the victorious Swope

“made it very plain to them that the
league was not something to pin great
hopes upon and therefore called for

all international sicknesses.” ;

The Democrats sat up, rubbed their
eyes, began to snigger at Judge Har-
din’s tremendous discomfiture and then
began looking around them for facts.
Wat they have learned wiped the
smile from their faces and has caused
Judge Hardin to embark upon a cam-
paign of letter writing {n which -e
seeks to inform.the people through the

newspapers how he was “tricked.” The
veteran Democrat. in a letter to the
Loultgville Courier-Journal, avers that

“a microbe is more dangerous than a
lion” and that the Republicans duped
him and his adherents by holding the
special Congressional election on a pri-
mary day. The Judge does not say
why he and his campaign managers
did not tell Democratic voters that the
Congressional election and the Demo-
cratio primaries were to be held the
same day. But he admits that his
opponent saw to ft that all Republicans
and a great many anti-machine Demo-
crats were apprised of the fact.

“But it 1s comforting to me to be-
lieve,”” writes the Judge, “that my race
has been of great importance to both
the State and nation in revealing the
state of mind existing in this district
and in Kentucky to-day.”

Real Republican Victory.

And right here it may be said that
the Republican victory in the Eighth
Congressional district does signify the
general bent of the voter mind in Ken-
tucky to-day. It is better to call it a
Republican victory than a Swope vic-
tory, inasmuch as investigation shows
that the anti-Democratic vote might
have been garnered by any one who had
the ambition to go out after it. It
was just that—an _  anti-Democratic
vote; an anti-Stanley machine yote, and
the Democrats have found that it
flourishes in every county in the State.

Directly after his election Swope be-
The Republican leaders at
once declared that they'd fight the State
campaign through on straight State
issues and leave national issues to the
Democrats, Having taken the political
temperature of the voters in all parts
of the State and finding the populace
very, very tired of the present Demo-
cratic administration—State and na-
tional—and all the contemporaneous
economic ills, the Republicans wisely
decided to let the Democrats answer
the questions of Democrats; and the
questions the erstwhile Democratic
faithful are propounding require a lot
of answering. The Republicans figure
that both questions and answers will
result in but one thing—new RKepubli-
cans. And they probably are right.

Thus while the Democrats claimed, as
Judge Hardin does now, that the Swope
victory served to arouse an opathette
Democracy
ahead, they have awakened to find that
not only are there shoals dead ahead,
but rocks on either side and astern. In
other words, the Swope victory, which
might, have been a pureiy tocal thing in
other and less turbulent days, is found
to be the product of @ typical situation

to the political shoals dead |

And the same unrest, the same fretting,
the same longing for a “change” ob-
tains in almost every one of Kentucky's
120 counties. _The Democrats have
ee to be sure, but to a realiza-

   

tion that to win in November they will
have to overcome the most virile anti-
administration sentiment that Kentucky
has ever fostered.

Then, too, the Republicans have made
| capital of the possibilities that the Ken-

tucky Board of Elections law offers,

The State Board of Elections is or-
ganized thus:

The Governor appoints one Repubfican
and one Democrat, and they name one
Republican and one Democrat in each
county. In each county the Sheriff be-
comes the umpire between the two ap-
pointees ex-officio.

And it happens that right now 76 per
cent. of the Sheriffs of Kentucky are
Republicans.

Therefore, even discounting the ma-
chine Republicans who are of that po-

litical persuasion in name only—and
there are very few of that type—the
Kentucky State Board of Elections is
overwhelmingly Republican, and natur-
ally, the nucleus of a most powerful
Republican organization.

To induce any Democratic leader to
admit it is expecting too much, but the
fact remains that these old party lead-
ers are not looking forward to President
Wilson's tour with any vast enthusiasm.
If the President does tour the country
talking about the League of Nations and
the high cost of living, local Democrats
fervently hope he will reach Kentucky
after the November elections. The Dem-
ocrats are advertising their coming cam-
paign in this State as a fight on “straight
Democratic party lines.” But it is just
as easy to get Democratic leaders to
hold forth about personal family skele-
tonsa ag {it {s to get them on record re-
garding any one of President Wilson's

policies,

were, as everybody is, arguing politics.
I here record the opinions of Kentuck-
ians only.

A Democrat No Longer.

A Loulsville stationer said:

“Iam a Democrat, My father and his
father were Democrats. My every in-
clination is to vote the straight Demo-
cratic ticket as usual. I have never
scratched a candidate on my ballot, But
sentiment is not going to get us any-
where under these ccnditions. I da not
know whether the Wilson administra-
tion is to blame for all this chaos or
not, but I'm not willing to give it the
benefit of the doubt. I shall vote for the
Republican State ticket. There's time
enough to talk about national affairs.

A Paducah horse trainer said:

“I'm going to vote for Ed Morrow.
I'm going to vote for the Republican
neminee for President. I was born, bred
and have raised a family in Paducah
and I've been a Democrat all my life.
Guess I'll try a new political shop this
time, League of Nations? Sure! Great
stuff if organized along real »rother-
hood-of-man lines. But I am coming
around to the idea that William Howard
Taft's World League idea was better
than President Wilson's covenant.”

A motorman said:

“I swear by Sam Gompers,
says {s good enough for me. He said
Wilson and we voted Wilson. But say,
what do you know about Gompers now?
I'm darned if I know where we stand.
And tell me; who's this guy Glenn
Plumb? Why don’t they let everybody
in on this highbrow stuff. Hell, man,
I don't know how I'll vote. I'm a
Democrat.”

A farmer:

“I'm a Democrat and I'm going to
vote for the Democratic ticket. Why?
None of your business. I've always been
a Democrat.”

His son, recently demobilized:

“We come from Jeffersontown, which
is in this county ar.d not far from the
city. We've always been farmers. If
you'd come out our way before the war
you couldn't have found more than one
or two white Republicans in a year in
spite of the county being Republican.
But come cut now and you'll find all the
young fellows Republicans. Pop's old
fashioned. Ask any of the soldiers how
they'll vote.”

A soldier who lives in Frankfort:

“Me? I'm just waiting to get a
chance to ask questions; not to answer
them. I'm looking for some one to ex-
Plain Articles V.. X. and XI. of the
League of Nations. The more I read
the less I know about them. Me? Oh,
I'm a Democrat all right. So's my old
man."

A Louisville lawyer:

“The ignorance of the vital facts
underlying all our political fabric to-day
{s appalling. Almost anything is Hable
to happen. [| think that the Republicans
will win not only this State election but
likewise the national election, if for no
other reason than that the public is tired
to death of the eternal bickering and
pulley hauling that is going on in Wasb-
ington, Folks want a change. They
reay not know where they are going,

but they haow from what they are
running.”
A barber:

“I expect that the only man on earth
who doesn't care what happens next is
the Kaiser. He knows where he got off.”
Therefore he should worry. He's put.”

Other opinions followed the same
groove as those cited above. The only
thing lacking in the general chaos of
thought was singing by the entire com-
ruunity of:

“Where do we go from here, boys?
Where do we go from here?”

MRS. LILLY’S RECORD
ATTACKED BY UNION

Letter Expresses Regret That
She Did Not Justify Hopes:

The Citizens Union, which has
aroused the ire of Mrs. Mary M. Lilly,
Assemblyman from the Seventh District,
by its criticism of her legislative record,
adopted the attitude of kindly instructor
in a letter which was sent to her yester.
day and given out for publication at the
fame time. The Union “greatly regretted

that Mrs, Lilly hadn't justified its hopes
as the first woman legislator in the
State,” and pointed ‘out that she fell
down heavily on the nine bills on which
her record was tested.

“You voted against only one of these
obnoxious bills,” the organization in-
formed her. “That was the Peck bill,
which would have tied the hands of the
city in dealing with the water supply
of Queens county. On the others you
were unrecorded, On another list of bills
which we had either opposed or ap-
proved, but Which we could not use as
tests because they did not clearly involve
a principle or because they became party
measures, you voted eight times in a way
we considered in the public interest and
eight times against it.

“You were not recorded as against a
single vicious bill on short roll calls, al-
thought many of your colleagues of both
parties regularly so recorded themselves.
Of the fifteen bi'ls introduced by you

we opposed four, only one of which, in
| its Senate form, passed and became a
law.”

The Union chides Mrs. Lilly for not
giving out the full exchange of corre-

RADICALS’ MAJORITY

HITS WILSON POLICY)

 

Replies to Questionnaire Sent
Out by Committee of 48
Show Need for Change.

 

; LABOR PARTY IS INDORSED;

Complete Retarns Will Form
Basis of Programme for
Chicago Conference.

 

 

The Committees of Forty-eight, which
{s engaged in a movement to bring the
radicals of the country together on &
programme of “fundamental reconstruc-
tion,” made public yesterday a report on
the answers received to a questionnaire
sent td independent voters in various
parts of the country.

No statement was made as to the
number of questionnaires sent out or

the number of replies received, but it is
understood that 100,000 pleces of mail
matter were issued from the offices at
15 East Fortieth street, this, city, last
month. When the complete returns have
been recorded they will form the basis
for @ programme which will be sub-
mitted to a conference of liberal voters
that will be held in Chicago, probably

in December.

J. A. H. Hopkins, who was associated
with Everett Colby in the Progressive
party in New Jersey, is chairman of the
extcutive committee of the Committee
of Forty-eight, which refers to the num-
ber of States in the Union and not to the
size of the committee. The other mem-
bers are William F. Cochran, Lincoln
Colcord, McAlister Coleman, William
Paine Everts, the Rev. Percy 8. Grant,
H. B. Hoffman, Martyn Johnson, Horace
M. Kallen, J. W. McConaghy, Allen Me-
Curdy, Dudley Field Malone, Frank A.

‘attison, Gilbert E. Roe, formerly asso-
elated with Senator La Follette in Wis-
consin; Mary K. Simikovitch, George—P.
West, Major Samuel P. Wetherill, Jr.
Bishop Charles D. Williams of Detroit
and Oswald W. Knauth.

The Aims of the Committee,

The aims of this committee, as given
in its literature, are:

1. Organizing a conference of Ameri-
cans interested in a thoroughgoing pro-
gramme of fundamental reconstruction.

2. Presenting to such conference a
tentative platform dealing with political,
social, industrial and international re-
construction.

3. Discussing at the conference: (a)
forming a political party, (b) forming a
coalition with other political parties, (c)
creating an organization to translate
liberal conviction into political action,
(d) accepting such other analogous sug-
gestions as are presented by delegates
to the conference.

There were twenty-three questions in
the questionnaire, including these:

“Do you favor the Plumb plan for the
operation of railroads?”

“Do you favor supertaxes on profits?’

“Do you favor compulsory military
training?”

“Are you in favor of organizing a
new political party?”

At the end a space was left for the
voter to suggest additional planks for
the tentative platform, the first sketch
of which already has been drawn up.
Nearly every reply, it is stated, con-
tained one or more suggestions.

“We have made an experiment in
democracy and it has succeeded,” de-
clared Allen McCurdy of the executive
committee last night. ‘When we started
to organize this conference we were
told it would be impossible to get Amer-
ican liberals to agree on anything.
Furthermore, we were assured there
was no general interest in many of the
subjects mentioned in the questionnaire.
The results disprove both assertions.

 

Shows the People Are Thinking.

“The American peopie are doing their
own thinking to-day and liberals are in

eral agreement from coast to coast.
N&t only are we receiving 100 per cent.
returns, but in many instances the ques-
tionnaire has been sent back, with
lengthy marginal notes, or the views of
the voter has been expounded in letters
of several pages.

“No one can look over these answers
and fail to be impressed with the de-
mand of men and women who take
democracy seriously that something
definite be done.”

From the questionnaires already re-
turned 40 per cent. favor the Plumb
plan for railroad operation, 42 per cent.
favor general Government ownership
and 18 per cent. are for private owner-
ship. Ninety per cent. voted to take
absolute control of foreign relations out
of the hands of the President, 10 per
cent. favored its retention.

The programme of the American La-
bor party received’ the indorsement of 94
per cent., as against 6 per cent. opposed.
For the initiative and referendum 95 per
cent. of the returns were cast. For the
executive budget and a responsible cab-
inet there were 9744 per cent. answers.
Ninety-four per cent. declared there
should be some limitation on the power
of the courts to declare laws uncon-
stitutional.

For the programme of the Non-Par-
tisan League of North Dakota there
Were 96 per cent., and for the aboll-
tion of the espionage law 90 per cent.,
with 10 per cent. opposed. There were
67 per cent. in. favor of free trade, 21
per cent. for a protective tariff and 12
per cent. for a tariff for revenue only.
The granting of equal legal and eco-
nomic rights to women was favored by
98% per cent.

The greatest inferest was displayed
in the formation of a new political
party. Eighty per cent. voted to form
an independent party, either alone or in
federation with the labor and farmer
movements, Twenty per cent. urged
a non-partisan organization.

Compulsory military training was
voted down by 85 per cent., and secret
diplomacy was defeated by a vote of 97
to 3 per cent. Supertaxes on profits
receivell the indorsement of 83 per cent.
of the answers.

Members of the executive committee
{will meet with representatives of the
American Labor party in Chicago to-
day to discuss possible cooperation,

Special Deapatch to Tux Sux.
TReENTon, Aug. .17.—The prominence
which prohibition has assumed in the
fight for the Governorship in New Jer-
sey presenta an interesting situation In

the light of past political history in the
State. For several decades it has fol-
lowed almost inevitably that any at-
tempt on the part of the Republicans to
regulate the liquor traffic has been fol-
lowed by disaster. This fact, admitted
by all leaders who have followed the
fortunes of the party for any consider-
able period, is largely responsible for
the Republican stand, first for local op-
tion and later for prohibition.

When the agitation for countrywide
prohibtion had assumed something of Its
present strength a few years ago Re-
publicans in this State faced a peculiar
problem. Although it was generally true
that prohibtion had a larger percentage
of followers among the Republicans than
the Democrats, it was equally true that
sentiment varied in different commu-
nities.

In the more populous centres adjacent
tu New York and Philadelphia and at
many of the summer resorts for which
New Jersey is noted there was pro-
nounced opposition not only to prohibi-
tion but to any curtailment of the liquor
traffic. In rural communities, on the
other hand, the prohibition movement
gained grodind rapidly, and it soon be-
came evident that no candidate could
be elected to the Senate or Assembly
from some of the smaller counties unless
he declared unequivocally against the
liquor traffic.

Edge Tries Local Option.

Fearing disruption of the party on
the liquor question, United States Sen-
ator Edge, then Governor, and party
leaders associated with him hit upon the
pian of local option as a means of re-
moving the excise question as a State
issue. The purpose was twofold. It
was thought party unity could be pre-
served by letting the communities de-
termine for themselves whether the
liquor traffic should be tolerated and
that this would relieve the party from
taking a positive stand on the question
of national prohibition.

With these ends in view the Repub-
lican State convention adopted a local
option plan in its platform which ulti-
mately resulted in the passage of the
local option law of 1917. The measure
failed to have the desired effect. The
sentiment for prohibition then sweeping
the country reyived the issue in New
Jersey, despite all arguments that the
home rule policy embraced in the local
option law had committed the party
against national prohibition.

In a final effort to remove the liquor
question from politics the ensuing Re-
publican State platform declared un-
equivocally for prohibition, subject to
the reservation that members of the
Legislature elected on platforms op-
posed to prohibition should be free to
redeem their campaign pledges.

The result of thig declaration was al-
most identieal with that following the
passage of the so-called Bishops lawe in
1906. In that year the Republicans, who
had controlled both branches of the Leg-
islature by large majorities, lost the
House, which in 1907 stood thirty-one
Democrats to twenty-nine Republicans.
Election of a Democratic delegation in
Easex was mainly responsible for this
result, as {t was last year, when the
election of twelve Democrats from Essex
made the House stand thirty to thirty.

Republicans Worried.

With these and similar, expertences in
mind it is not surprieing that Repub-

la special train for Ottawa.

licans are worried over the possible ef-
fect of the liquor question in the coming
election. Although publicly contending

land and hence settled beyond the pos-
sibility of being made a political issue,
Republican leaders are fearful that this
view will not be accepted by the rank
and file of the party.

Democratic eandidates are making the
moat of their opportunity to revive pro-
hibition as an issue by promising to
ralse the question of State rights as a
means of contesting the Eighteenth
Amendment by giving assurances that
they will not favor enforcement legiela-
tlon and by making it understood that if |
there is to be enforcement in New Jer- |
sey it must be by Federal rather than
by State authorities if they are elected,

The suffrage question is again being
brought to the front by the demand
made upon Gov. Runyon this week in
tehalf of the National Woman's party
for a special session of the Legislature
to ratify the suffrage amendment. Gov.
Runyon has not given his answer, but
there is little doubt of his refusal to call
a session. Notwithatanding assertions
by the suffragists that they have assur-
ances of sufficient votes in the Legisla-
ture to ratify, it is difficult to believe this
could be done with an equally divided
House.

WRIT OBTAINED FOR
RELEASE OF STUDENT

Fether’s Relatives Hastening
to Ithaca From West.

Special Despatch to Tum Sex.
IrHAca, N. Y., Aug. 17.—A writ of
habeas corpus in the case of Donald W.
Fether, the Cornell student held here on
the charge of murdering Hazel Crance,
was granted this morning at Cazenovia
by Supreme Court Justice Michael H.
Kiley, and Sheriff Charles Green of
Tompkins county must produce Fether in
court before Judge Kiley at 1 o'clock
on August 19.

At that time Judge Kiley will decide
if the evidence against Fether, brought
out at yestarday’s hearing when Justice
Henry Williams held him for the Sep-
tember Grand Jury, is sufficient, or
whether the young man is being illegally
deprived of his liberty and should be re-
leased from custody at once.

The writ was obtained this morning
by Attorney A. W. Fineberg, who left
Ith in an automobile last night.

Fether, who broke down last evening
when Justice Williams held him for the
Grand Jury, was more cheerful to-day
after a conference with counsel. He
also was cheered by the arrival of John
R, Sourwein of Paulding, Ohio, an uncle,
and the news that his parents would be
here on Tuesday. Fether is comfortably
quartered in his cell.

The search for the gitl’s body was
halted to-day, wind and rain making
grappling out of the question. The search
will be resumed to-morrow and may be
expedited by a reward which Sheriff
Charles Green may make to-morrow.
