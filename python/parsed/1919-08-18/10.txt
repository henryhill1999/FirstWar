Much of the steel involves more labor
in the consumption than in the produc-
tion, therefore labor troubles are just as
serious in the long run among the steel
industry's customers as labor difficulties
within. the industry itself, In fact, it is
known that there is a decided disposi-
tion to postpone the undertaking of
projects that involve the consumption of
steel, because the aspect as to labor has
become less favorable,

spirit of the times,

As to the immediate future of pig iron,
divergent views are expressed both as to
demand and as to prices. As a rule, the
furnaces in operation are comfortably
well filled up. With few exceptions
they have enough business on books to
absorb their entire output if their cus-
tomers specify up to the limit, but a
furnace generally prefers to be oversold
on paper, so as to be fully sold in
actuality.

The divergence in views on pig iron
arises from the fact that those who
have virtually no iron to sell find @
situation they regard as strong, while
those who are really trying to sell find
that the market has little absorbing
power. One thing is clear, and that is
that there is no such demand for. pig
iron in this general territory ag would
