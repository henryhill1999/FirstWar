Plans for obtaining relief from high
food prices and putting a curb on the
activities of persons suspected of hoard-
ing various food products for still higher
prices will crystallise following a meet-
ing at the Hote] Biltmore, this evening
of A. Mitchell Palmer, United States
Attorney-General; Arthur Williams,
Federal Food Administrators for New
york, and members of the Fair Price

Committee,

Mr. Palmer ts coming here to get in
touch with what is going on 4 to
give his New York aids his point of
view as to what should be done, and
fone speedily, to stop apeculation in
foodstuffs and tq prevent unfair prac-

tices.

The activities of Mr. Williams and
the various agencies associated with
him in the present campaign al-
ready have scared a number of

men who now are quietly releasing
stocks of beans, canned goods, butter,
eggs and other foodstuffs which they
had bought at comparatively low prices
tu hold for a rising “market.

Reports to Mr. Williams by investi-
gators indicate that large quantities of
these commodities, as well as sugar, are
in the possession of men who are not
professional dealers in food. As a gen-
eial proposition, Mr. Willlams says, the
reguiar food dealers are not the men
who are guilty of these practices.

Fur Dealer Trades in Food,

“When you find a man in the fur
business who has large stocks of butter
and eggs,”’ Mr. Williams said, “KR can
safely be taken for granted that he
has not been buying and selling food-
stuffs in legitimate trading. His only
object can be that of speculation. And
we have found the fur dealer who has
been doing just this sort of thing.”

Mr. Williams said he is much encour-
aged over the results of publishing
“fair food prices,” the better class of
retailers showing a pronounced disposi-
tion to cooperate in the campaign to
prevent an unfair margin of profits be-
ing taken and to keep prices down to
the consumer.

“We expect to accomplish a great deal
efter the Fair Price Committee gets to-
gether with Attorney-General Palmer at
the Hote! Biltmore meeting,” Mr. Will-
iams said. “Mr.Paimer is tremendousiy
interested in this thing. We wish to get
his point of view and to see if he ap-
proves of the plan we have here in New
York.

“There isn’t any doubt that the real
food speculator is getting nervous over
the course of events. If we can
him we are going to do it.

“New York is a big city and its food
requirements are tremendous The city
ought to have at least ten days supply of
food here at all times. Then there is
the food that through the vari-
ous legitimate hands in ‘this city for
distribution elsewhere. In view of all this
it isn't always easy to determine whether

hoarded for the purpose of speculation.

Women Can Help Cause

“So far as we discovered last week
there are vast quantities of fish, beans,
butter, eggs, sugar and canned goods
stored here. It is a question whether
the fish is being held for speculative pur-
poses.”

Mr. Williams is of the opinion women
can cooperate in the campaign of fight-
ing the high cost of foodstuffs and
everything else Sy refraining from buy-
ing beyond the actual needs of her fam-
ily and by “shopping around.”’

“A woman should shop around for
her meats, for Instance,” he explained.
“She also should shop for different kinds
cf meats, She shouldn’t go Into a butcher
hop with a predetermination to buy a
certain cut of meat. There is always a
chance of getting something else just as
good and perhaps much cheaper. A man
told me yesterday that he ‘shopped
around’ and bought a cut of fine roast
beef at only $2 cents a pound. The gen-
eral run of prices for that cut is 40
cents a pound, and in some high class
stores which make deliveries the same
thing costs 55 to 60 cents a pound.

“There is a big tendency to be ex-
travagant in marketing these days and
the people who do the buying for the
famliy table should learn the art of
buying cheaper cuts of meat.”

The Rev. Dr. Jonathan C. Day, Com-
missioner of Public Markets, said last
night that as fast as forty-three trucks
can be loaded with army surplus food-
stuffs this morning the goods will be
delivered ag forty-six public school
buildings first Nsted by his department
as “school stores.”

Army Store Sales Te-morrow.

“Bales will begin as rapidly as we
can get the canned goods, bacon, &c.,
into the schools,” Dr. Day said. “In
all probability we will be able to sell

BABY SHOW IS, HELD

ON ARMY TRANSPORT) COM

113 Brides, 24 Infants and
2,153 Troops Arrive by
Cap Finisterre.

DANCE HELD EVERY DAY

 

 

Calamares and President Grant
Also Bring Soldiers
From France.

 

In addition to staging the only baby
show ever held on the high seas, the
officers’ of the transport Cap Finisterre,
which arrived at Hoboken yesterday,
organized a cabaret and orchestra which
performed every evening for the benefit
of the army and navy brides aboard.
Besides 2,153 officers and men of she;
American Expeditionary Forces and 100;
welfare workers, the Cap Finisterre
brought ninety-five sailors’ wives, cigh-
teen soldiers’ wives and twenty - one
babies. Twenty other brides were sched-
uled to sail on the vessel but had to be
left behind on account of the limited
first class accommodations.

Commander F. R. MeCrery, the trans
port's skipper, arranged the baby show
and had the contest decided by vote of
all the first class passengers, a master
stroke of ingenuity which distributed
we responsibility and avoided casual-

es,

Prizes of $5 for first an@ $3 for nec: |
ond places were awarded in each of the
classes into which the entries were
divided. The classification was based
on age exclusively—over and under two
years—and prizes were awarded for the
most beautiful and best behaved babies.

Comsal’s Baby Wins Prize.

Helen Cox, daughter of Mrs. Phyllis
Cox and Oral Edward Cox,
whose home port is Iola, Kan. was a
double winner in the younger class,
while the most beautiful child over 2
years was adjudged to be Eldridge
Hathaway, son of Vice-Consul Charles
Hathaway, Jr. of Cleveland, Ohio, on
leave from his post at Queenstown, Ire-
land. Three-year-old Nancy Pickering,
daughter of Lieut.-Commander and Mra.
Nelson W. Pickering, won first prize in
the other event In this class.

The cabaret was organized the day
after the transport left Brest, on the
petition of the assembled brides. R. C.
Greene, pharmacist's mate, was as-
signed to the duty of organising an or-
chestra, and he found two violinists, a
‘cellist, a pianist and a banjo-ukelele
player among the army and navy per-
sonnel. A _ plece of hardwood board
served as a drum and two German shells
pounded out flat made an excellent pair
of cymbals, while a six centimeter shel!
did duty as a cowbell.

The centre of the main saloon was
used for dancing. The entertainments
ended with a speciai programme the last
night out, which began at 3 in the after-!
noon and lasted until after midnight.

Lieutenant-Commander L. W. John-
son, the ship's surgeon, had a busy time
on the voyage. He performed five op-
erations, including two for appendicitis,
and only one patient was unable to walk
down the gangpiank when the ship
docked. He was Cal E. Patterson of
Phillipsburg, N. J., one of the appendicitis
cases.

Charles Ray Sows Hew to

‘LAUGH WEEK’ AT STRAND

Mabel Normand Appears in
“Upstairs”—Elsic Fergu-
sou in New Play.

 

While the managers and the legiti-
mate actors ‘are drawing long faces the
cimema Actors at the Rialto and the
Strand | this week are likely to draw
large houses through presenting the
mirthful or strikeless side of life. Not
even a combination of producers or a
union of players could keep one frem
being amused by Charles Ray in “Bill

Henry.”

This scenario transfusion by Julien
Josephson of a story by Lois Zelmer,
causes Ray once more to appear amid
bucotic surroundings as af innocent
seeming youth who always manages in
some way to triumph over sophisticated
knavery in the end. Having made a
failure of canvassing for an electric vi-
beator—which gives scope for some di-
verting scenes—-he becomes clerk im a
country hotel, and its thereby enabled
to sit In a poker game and win enough
to buy the heroine's farm and rescue
her from villamy, after performing an
operation on the villamn’s jaw with his
fist. :

There is a Mack Sennett comedy with
plenty of motion to the humor, agreeabie
scenic pictures and the usual interludes
in which the soloistis make themsetvea
heard and the orchestra wraps itself up
In Saint-Saens’s “The Spinning Wheel
of Omphale” and sips from “Madame
Sherry.” .

At the Strand Mabel Normand bobs
into view after quite an absence in
“Upstairs,” in which she plays one of
those vey Oarts in which she appears
to be specializing lately—only this time
she's moved her p'gtails from the coun-
try to the city. She portrays, with her
usual impish humor, a servant “down-
staira’” in a great hotel who is always
yearning to be transported to the heaven
“upstairs.” She ie raised to thia pin-
acle ultimately by a bellhop who turns
out to have a millionaire’s bankroll un-
derneath his buttons—in which the pie-
ture may be said to appreach the realis-
tic.

Other features of the programme
which fully bears out its aim to estab-
lish “laugh week’’ at this house are a
new photodramatization of an O. Henry
story, an “analysis of motion,” taken
at the police games, which reveals for |
the first time tn history what a cop!
really looks like when he's in a hurry;
voeal solos, and a trial of strength by
the orchestra with selections from “Cav- |
alleria Rusticana” and “The Jewels of
the Madonna.”

Elsie Ferguson in “A Society Exile,’
a screen version of Henry Arthur Jones's
play “We Can't Be as Bad as All That.”
plays at the Rivoli once more the role
of a much put upon and misunderstood
heroine, with which Miss Ferguson’s ap-
pealing eyes seem to go so well.
does emotional work of a high order
as @ young novelist who is driven to
find refuge and ultimate happiness in
Venice through ‘the jealousy of a wife
over her entirely innocent collaboration
with a nobleman on a play. To sus-
tain the Venetian atmosphere Director |
Huewo Riesenfeld has added a scenic of |
Venice, the barcarolie from “The Tales
of Hoffmann,” and a Mutt and Jeff car-
toon.

Lowper, Aug. 17.—The sudden death
of Mrs. S. B. Joe’. wife of am African
millionaire, depriv ; Loudon of a most
eccentric personnlicy. Born at Man-
chester of Jewish parents, she was fa-
mous for her hospitality. She enter-
tained on the most lavish scale, often in-
viting a number of guests to her house
at Eastbourne or in Upper Brook street
without appearing herself, but leaving
them every means of securing excellent
entertainment.

On peace night she imvited a large
party to a dinner and dance in a well
known London restaurant. The guests
arrived in cars and taxicabs, but the

hostess could not be found. After wait-
ing for some time the guests decided to
entertain themselves. They finished
dinner and commenced to dance, but still
Mra. Joel could not be found. The dance
was finished and the guests went home
in the early hours without having seen
their hostess, It was afterward discov-
ered that she had completely forgotten
the party and had been celebrating peace

the utmost contempt for conventions,
with the result that she shocked the sus-
ceptibilities of many of the more formal
persons in society.

Her dinners were remarkable for their
novelty. She was very fond of fish and,
forgetting that her taste was not every-
body's, she often would have placed in
succession before her guests half a
dozen courses of different fish prepared
in different ways with the result that
her diners had no appetite for other
courses, At a dinner given just before
her death four courses of fish, including
lobster, were followed by duck. A com-
plete duckling was placed before each
guest.

She sometimes would invite lawyers
and busivess men to her house to dis-
cuss business, then deciine to hear a
word of heavy stuff and Insist on their
staying to luncheon or dinner and dance.
She had a passion for dancing. Mrs.
Joel leaves an estate worth well over
$1,000,000. Of this sum $400,000 con-
sists of pearis, of which she possessed
one of the finest collections in the
country.
