Marriage Safeguarded.
Under the heading “Community of

Life” the Constitution declares that mar-|-

riage constitutes the basis of family life
and the salvation of the nation, and it is
therefore under the special protection of
the Constitution on the basie of equality
of the sexes. It is pointed out that it
is the duty of the State to keep pure and
healthy the family life and that families
with several children have the right to
necessary caré. Motherhood, it is de-
clared, has a prior claim to the protec-
tion of the State. Illegitimate children
shall be placed under the same bodily,
6piritual and social conditions as legiti-
mate ones, and youth must be protected
from moral, spiritual or physical neglect.

A long list of thegrights of German
citizens, which seem obvious outside of
Germany, comes next’ The list includes
the right to hold gatherings, to bélong
to societies and organizations or social,
political and religious grouper It is de-
clared that petty officials appointed for
life may not be discharged unless_the

mplaints against them are first sub-
mitted to them.

Under religion ‘the Constitution de-
clares that all citizens of Germany ehall
enjoy complete freedom of belief and
conscience. No State church exists and
religion plays no part in citizenship. It
is provided that there must be universal
attendance at school for a period of
eight years and that pupils must attend
advariced echools until 18 years old. It
will not be necessary to pay intuition,
and State aid will be given needy pupils
and their families. Private schools can
be run only with Government permis-
sion. All schools, {t is provided, must
make an effort to educate their students
fn the spirit of the German people and
in the spirit of reconciliation with the
peoples of the world. Instruction in
constitutional Government and manual
labor is obligatory in all schools.

The Constitution lays down basic rules
for the economic future, guaranteeing
the rights of spiritual work and inven-
tion and protects art. A eystem of
councils is created for industries, by
which employees will have a voice in
the decisions reached by the employers,

EBERT TO TAKE NEW

By the Associated Prese.

Wermar, Aug. 16 (delayed).—Presi-
dent Ebert will take the oath under the
new Constitution before the National
Assembly on August 20. He has with-
drawn the decree which designates the
Assembly as the “Reichstag’’ in defer-
ence to protest from the Assembly.

The me s of the German Demo-
eratic party in the National Assembly
Ve,.taken the lead in attempting. to
feach a decision on the moot question
of the abolition of control of foodstuffs
by the Government. jeep question has
been argued fiercely in the press for
several months,

The Democrats to-day introduced. a
resolution demanding that the Govern-
ment control of grain shall. be limited
to wheat for use in making bread and
that meat and milk shall be controlled
only in so far as the needs of the sick
and children are concerned. It is de-
manded also the compulsory restriction
on the use of potatoes shall be lifted
in the event of a good harvest, which is
in prospect.

The resolution urges that all peasants
with potato flelds of less than two hec-
tars riall be relieved of the compulsory
delivery of their potatoes, It is further
demin;led that control of all other agri-
cultura! pro@ucts be limited immediately

nigs, or the same as the international
rate, The cost of sending telegrams will
be increased by more than 50 per cent.

The new bill is one of the many ways
by which the Government proposes to
raise the indemnity payable to the allied
Powers.

Paris, Aug. 17.—Complete harmony

By the Assoolated Presa,

Hovarest, Aug. 14 (delayed).—“The
Rumanians had nothing to do with the
assumption of power by Archduke Jo-
seph,” said Constantine Diamandy, the
Rumanian High Commissioner, to-day.
“We merely. disarmed the local police,
as any army of occupation would do.
It would appear that our military au-
thorities did not know in advance any-
thing concerning Archduke Joseph's
coup d'etat.

“Anyway it ts to our interest to have
a Socialist Government in Hungary,
which will ocoupy itself with the coun-
try’s interna] and economic welfare,
rather than e King, who would be mak-
ing war on us to extend his national
domain.

“Regarding the occupation of Buda-
pest we expect to leave soon, certainly
inside of a month, It would be ridicu-
lous to put the Rumanian Crown Prince
on the Hungarian throne. We have
nothing to do with the internal affairs
here.

“The American press has heen unjust
to us. It is true there have been too
many requisitions, but this is being
stopped. However, the world did not alt
up in horror a few weeks ago when the
Serbs crossed the Banat lime and carried
off in canal and river boats planos,
merchandise, utensils, farm implements,
horses and cattle. We were able to
tinder them somewhat by diverting water
from the Labega Canal so that boats
destined for Belgrade stuck in the mud.

“We destroyed communism as ft was
a menace to us, but we did something
no one else was willing to undertake.
It is natural we should have occupied
Budapest and taken away the arms of
the Reds, and also that our army, which
is a long way from home, should require
food,

One difficulty of the Government has
been the demand of ‘the workinen for

ARCHDUKE EVADES
_ MONARCHY ISSUE

Asked if He Would Accept
Throne, He Sidesteps.

By MAXWELL H. M’CARTNEY.

Special Cable Despatch to Tam Sun from the
London Times Service.
Copyright, 1919, all rights reserved. .

Bupapest, Aug. 17.—"I. return as a
Hungarian, not as a Hapsburg; the fact
that I bear the name I do is not my
fault.”

In these words Archduke Joseph
summed up to me again his motives in
setting himself at the head of the State
and sought to prove that the alarm and
anxiety felt abroad and in Hungary ‘nt
the return of a Hapsburg was unjusti-
fled by the reasons which had prompted
and continue to prompt his actions.

The Archduke further emphasized his
position by declaring “as soon as the
Cabinet is definitely formed and its po-
sition established I shall retire without
awaiting the coming together of the
National Assembly.”

Exactly how soon the Arohduke’s de-
cree of retirement will be granted is
somewhat hard to say. He expected
that the new Cabinet would be formed
in a day or two and he stated emphat-
ically he would not accept any Cabinet
which did not contain Socialists.

Wants Wide Representation,

Hig intention was to have a Cabinet
wherein peasant workers and as far as
possible a’ elements of the State are
represented. It seems unlikely that Ste-
phen Frederich will remain Premier and
there is good hope that Garami, the
Strongest Socialist leader, may consent
to join the Cabinet.

Replying to the criticism that the up-
setting of the Peldil Government was a
coup d'etat prearranged with the Ru-
manians, the Archduke stated unequiv-
ocally that the plan was not mentioned
to them and could in no way be regarded
as a military or reactionary pfot.

“Five officera came to my house at
Alcsuth and stated that the country was
in danger and asked me to take charge,”
he said. “I accordingly came up to
Budapest.”

Hig main object was the saving of
the country and the suppression of Bol-
shevism and he was utterly opposed to
anything aproaching a white terror.
He did not mean that political opponents
as Buch should be arrested, but only
murderers and robbers. This latter re-
mark its interesting in that the police
yesterday posted notices saying Bela
Kun was “wanted” on charges of mur-
der and robbery, It therefore can be
assumed that a formal demand will
soon be made to the Austrian Govern-
ment for his extradition.

The last question I put to the Arch-
duke was whether he would accept the
crown if it were offered him by the
National Assembly. His reply was
evasive: ‘He said he had no time as
yet to consider so serious a step, and
that until.and unless such an actual
situation arose any such epeculation
was inopportune. His sole aim at pres-
ent is to help his country.

That the Archduke's party is  begin-
ning to fear lest the transition from
Bela Kun to Hapsburg was too sudden
is further proved by the manner in
which the Archduke received. yesterday
a deputation of German speaking Hun-
garians. ‘

Anxious to Retire,

He emphasized his desire to retire and
declared that his tenure of power would
be only of short duration, and he laid
stress on his personal determination that
minorities should be guaranteed the right
of speech in the mother tongue, freedom
of elections and other political privi-
leges.

Meanwhile, the situation in Hungary
and Budapest remains deplorably bad.
Food prices are rising daily as the sup-
plies dwindle, and the promises made to
the Entente Generals by Gen. Maderesco
and M. Diamand haye not yet had time
to produce any effect. Capt. Gregory,
head of the American administration for
the States of the old Austrian Empire,
told the Entente commission that he had
made large stores available for Buda-
pest, but not one ounce would be brought
in as long as the Rumanians were tak-
ing food out. In reply to this threat
the Rumanians agreed to not take fur-
ther food from Budapest or from desig-
nated zones near the city.

The first immediate relief will prob-
ably come from Admiral Troubridge who
has row sufficiently cleared the Danube
of mines to enable barges to pass
through and hopes to land 100 tons of
foodstuffs in Budapest within thirty-six
hours.

“Viscount Grey’s refusal of the Em-

“As a matter of fact Viscount Grey's

convinced that the success or failure of
an Ambassador in America depends upon
the settlement of the Irish question. Had
the Government been able to say now
that they have an Irish policy it is prob-
able that Vis@ount Grey would have
gone as Ambassador. As they have not

Lonvon, Aug. 17.—The war after the

“The Germans are delighted at our
labor troubles. ‘They could not beat us
at war but they are making plans to

This is the first of a stirring call to

the industrial centres. The latest strike
fever has extended among the postal
employees of London, Who in a public
demonstration in Trafalgar Squaré on
Sunday, passed resolutions against the
Government recommendation offering
less money than before on the grounds
of their receiving pensions and being

Agitators claimed that this economy
measure of the Government was a mon-
