Whatever may have been the real cause
of the doctor's attitude which led him to
resign finally and determine to stay in)
the cold regions through the winter, he |
was too firmly set in that determination

to be shaken by yonqening He told Dr
Cook, when Dr. Cook t him that the

that he would not be guilty of deserting

that he was going over to Anaritok,
miles away, where there is a large

settlement. The country is one

a knife in his bootleg. When a suggestion
was made that it might be necessary to
take the doctor back to the ship by foree,

E

he lied: “Gentlemen, if you use force,
I 1. That's all.”
It ia said that a request was made to

Dr. Cook to declare Dr. Dedrick insane,
so that force might be justified, but that
Dr, Cook declined to assume the responsi-
bility, as it seemed clear that Dr. Dedrick
was sane, but excessively obstinate Dr
Cook also said that perhaps if Dr Dedrick
was left there to have his way he would
be all right at the end of the season, while
violence might bring about serious results
The object of the Erik's people in refrain-
ing from publishing the facts on their re-
turn here, it is announced, was to save
the doctor's wife and friends from worry
ahout him, and to prevent the spread of
eee, poeeenee his Arctic experi-
ences w might cause him to face and
live down engleanant condidons on his
returh home
The Erik brought letters from Dr. Ded-
rick to his wife, who lives in Washington,
N. J; Mrs Dedrick saw Mr. Bridgman
and Dr. Cook. Beyond her husband's state-
ment that be was going to remain in the
North, she dec! , it in said, that she
was unable to understand much of what
he had written toher The club has in-
formed Mre. Dedrick that in so far as its
obligations to her husband or herself are
concerned, it will put the most liberal con-
struction upon the whole unfortunate
development and bear in mind Dr. Ded-
rick's services prior to his resignation
Dr. ‘s plight recalls to many
who have followed the history of Arctic
exploration the fate of another of Lieut
Peary'’s comrades in the Arctic ‘atitudes,
the yo ee t, John Verhoeff, who
eossiapanhe: the Peary expedition of 1892
and vanished in the frozen North. Lieut
Peary was censured for having abandoned
Verhoeff, but it was shown by an official
report that Verhoeff had taken hia life
in his own hands and pushed off alone
to seek, as it was concluded, fresh fleids
of exploration where he might achieve

personal glory

Verhe ike Dr. Dedrick, developed
& personal resentment toward the head
of the expedition.who refused to permit

the young geologist to do things on his
own hook, insted of having to shine in the

Dedriok, Verhoeff quit his companions
in August and expressed his determination
to remain in the North He was last seen
alive on Aug. 13, 1882, at the head of MeCor-

CONFEREES CONSIDER BOROUGH
AND COUNTY OFFICES.

 

Justice Jerome the Favorite for District
Atterney--Oscar Siraus te Be Presi-
Gent of the Aldermen— Mr. Lew
Returns, put Wen't Discuss Situation.

Seth Low, the choice of the anti-Tam-

many conferees for the fusion nomina-

tion for Mayor this fall, came back to his
home in this city yesterday from his eum-
mer home in North East Harbor, Me. He
arrived at 8 o'clock and went at once to
his home at Madison avenue and Siaty-
fourth street. Mr. Low has not
any sign of his intentions in regard to the
action of the conference vet, and his friends
say that he will not make any statement
until he has seen what the action is of the
nominating conventions to be held neat
week

As soon as Mr. Low arrived in town he
sent word to reporters who were waiting
to see him that he had no statement to
make further than that he expected to eee
some of his friends during the day and
to-day and that he was absolutely un-
acquainted with the present political situ-
ation in the city and therefore unable to
say anyt hing about it. Mr. Low spent
the day in his home and a number of his
friends called on him and told him what
their opinions of the situation were. It
was generally understood that he would
have no statement to make until the middle
of next week a

According to Mr. Low's friends he does
not want to accept the nomination if there
isn to be anv question about the support
he is to receive from the important parties
to the conference, and before he makes
promises he is anxious to learn what there
is in the threats of the friends of Comp-
troller Colerto stampede the convention
for Coler

The developmente of yesterday went
far to assure the supporters of the fusion
movement that there was no danger that
the Citizens’ Union convention would
be stampeded for Color. The fact had
come to be known generally that Coler
had been making overtures to the Tammany
organization and this damped the ardor
of the men who had been working for him
in the belief that they were doing something
for the good of the city. It waa also re-
ported that the whole scheme of the Coler
boomers, who had been under the impree-
sion that Coler wae anxious to lead against
Tammany, had been knocked in the head
by the receipt of aut hentic information that
in case he was nominated by any body
other than Tammany he would decline
in a most theatrical way. announcing thet
he was an organization Democrat and that
he wanted no outside nomination

There was another session of the city
ticket conferees at the headquarters of
the Citizens Union yesterday to take action

of the United States to Turkey. Another
whose name is under consideration is C. V
Fornes, who was on the list of the Greater
New York Democracy as a possibility for
Mayor Arthur von Briesen, one of the
German-Americans who took a leading
art in the work of the German-American
McKinley and Roosevelt League last fall,
is also spoken of He is a Democrat and @
sound money man, and has a large follow-
ing among the rmans. Casimir Tag,
President of the Germania Savings Bank,
was another man corsidered, but the mat-
ter was considered to be of such great im-
portance that it was decided to take it up
at another meeting of the committee that
will be held on Monday morning
This decision was reached when it be-
came necessary to adjourn the
of the committee to hold the conf
on the New York county and the Map:
and Bronx borough offices,
this meeting of the committee all the mem-
bers were present exoept Herman Ridder
and ex-Sheriff James O'Brien Mr Ridder
was a red-hot candidate for the nomina-
tion for Mayor, and wasn't at all pleased
when he was dropped from the list. Now
he is sitting back and waiting for develop-
ments, anc amusing himself by discover-
ing plots in the deliberations of the other
me nbers of the committee who are trving

The strongest candidate for the office
of President of the borough of Manhattan
who developed at the meeting of the con-
ference was former Senator Jacob A. Can-
tor of the Greater New York Democracy,
whose name was mentioned up to the last
in the discussion of the possibilities for

ing of the conference, had the nomination
for the office in his hand and he could do

For the office of President of the borough
of the Bronx it was said that former Tax
Commissioner James UL. Welles of the Thir-
ty-fifth district was selected and the opin-
ion was expressed that he would have a
most excellent chance of election, for the
Tammany men in control of the machine
have about made up their minds that they
will not renominate President Haffen and
if they do not there will be a great many

of his friends whe will not support his |

successor as a candidate.

it was found that the officers of the Citi-

to be a candidate for ter nominated,
and there was a little ¢ 7 they
hustied around and found t man they
“wanted to have on their list. In the make-
up of the county ticket the members of

Admin-

Wasurroton, Sept. 21 —By being simply
himeelf and assuming none of the merely

' superficial manners that might be sup-
‘posed to appertain to the Presidential
| office, Theodore Roosevelt has made a
| novel impression in Washington during
| the two days he has occupied the White
| House. Despite the fact that he evidently
| intends to follow the same independent
| and fearless mode of life that he did while
ocoupying offices of lesser importance,
things are con-

| istration.

| a0 far as non-essential
| cerned, it is, however, significant that all
| who have called on him or seen him thie
| week unite in predicting a safe and cig-
| nifled Administration

Yesterday he walked twice, unattended,
| in the public streets, and to-day he did
{the same and more. He went out for a
horaebeck ride, and did it as if he were a
plain country squire, instead of President
of the United Bates
now living in Washington a hundred yeare
old, Mr. Roosevelt's appearance must
have reminded them of the democratic
days of Thomas Jefferson
day, after breakfasting at the Cowles resi-
dance, by walking alene to the White House.
He reached his office at half-past 9, or be-
fore the thousands of clerks in the Fa-
ecutive departments had fairly settled

down to their day's labor, and he continued |

hard at work until half-past |. He re-
ceived a large number of callers and had
one important conference

Nearly all his callers came merely to
pay their reapecta to the new President
and among them were Senators Eikins
and Seott of West Virginia, Senator Bur-
ton of Kansas, and at least ten or fifteen
members of the House. Kepresentative

Livingstone, a Democratic member from |

Georgia, called with several ladies, and
he remarked with great pride after leav-
ing the Cabinet room, where they were
received, that these were the first lacies
who had had the honor of being presented
to President Roosevelt in the White House

Governor General Leonard Wood, Col
Roosevelt's comrade in arms in the
Cuban campaign of 1805, arrived at the
Executive Mansion before noon, and the
two had a conference of about two hours
on Cuban matters, particularily the new
election law which now awaits the approval
of the President of the United States. Gen
Wood expecta to start on hi» return to
Cuba to-morrow night and an early an-
npouncement in regard to the election law
matter may follow his arrival at Havana

At about half-past | President Roosevelt

walked to the home of (Commander
Cowles for luncheon, accompanied by
Gen. Wood, and returned to the White

House two hours later
At about half past 4 two saddied horses
were led under the port cochere at the
north front of the mansion and the Presi-
dent and Gen. Wood came out and rode
away President Roosevelt wore the same
brogd-brimmed black felt bat, black cuta-
wey ead striped trousers that he
wore ex. Sapé those who could have
wished to see him don a rough rider cos-
ume for bis afternoon cuting were dis-
ited. He rode a bay horse
was brought to the White House stables
thie morning from Fort Myer It is a
rooper's horse from the pewly organized
venth Cavalry at that post Gen
food wore a sack coat and his trousers were
incased from knee to ankle in amart-looking
leggins of tan-colored leather
little group of persons, among whorn
was Commander Cowles, standing on the
porch to see the riders off, noticed the
‘

inly bulged appearance of one of Gen
Wood « hip pockets below his short coat
and one o

the bystanders remarked that
he the President would be protected
quite as well as if he were attended by a
Hecret Service officer The riders dashed
off at a brisk gait, the President waving
hie hand as he called “So long” to his broth-
er-in-law, Commander Cowles, and
into Pennsylvania avenue through the

northwest gate
They took a long ride out the avenue

te Georgetown and through the outskirts |

northwest Washington. The President

not return to the White mouse us
half past 6, and it was nearly dark when
he wa Gen Weed started on foot for the
Cowles residence, where they dined and
where Mr Roceevelt spent the night

Despite the large number of callers and |

the long conference with Gen. Wood, the
President found time to-day to sign a
number of commissions of Federal officers
and to transact a large amount of routine
business
Senator Pritchard one of his callers,
quoted the President as caving: “I
| going to be President of the United States
| and not of any section. I don't care that

| (anapping his fingers) for sections or sec- |

tione! lines. When | was Governor of New
York I was told I could make four appoint-
ments in the army
“When I sent in the names three of the
four men were from the South and the
, other was from New York. They were
| brave men who deserved recognition for
| services in the Spanish War and it didn't
matter to me what States they were from.”

DEVERW'S INTEREST IN A GIRL,

Alarm Over His Useful Private Wire, but
Ne Name Mentioned.

A general alarm for a missing girl was
sent out yesterday on Deputy Commissioner
Devery's private offices telephone to all
the precincts. The order was signed by
Devery himself. In addition to the fact
that the alarm was sent out by Devery
personally and not through the Bureau
«f Information, there were two other un-
usual features of the case. The name
and address of the girl were not given and
the description of her personal appear-
ance and what she wore was given wit
much more detail than is customary. Here
| is the alarm

wr, blue eves and gees teeth; two moles

Chief Devery was found last night in the
barber's chair with his face covered with
soap and a razor across his throat, not-
withetandi which he jumped when a
reporter ed him about the missing
girl. The barber lifted the razor just én
time and exclaimed, “Steady, Chief, steady.”
Devery tipped his beck again to

Lonpow, Sept. 21 —Now that America's
great tragedy is finished it will be profitable
| to refer again to ita effect upon the public
|} mind of Europe, and especially of Great
Britain. The extraordinary
tiom® of popular grief and sympathy wit-
| neawed during the past week in England
constitute an event
portance. It was no mere reciprocation
, of America’s tribute to the memory of
Queen Victoria last winter It was not
even personal in its chief motive
English masses knew little about President
McKinley as aman. Neither could they point
| out any one act of his that was conspicuously
| friendly to this country
| The spontaneous demonstration of aym-
pathy was rather the first great expres-
| sion of a change in sentiment in this
| country toward America and the
Americans-a change, which in ita full
development extends over the past five
years and which had its inception, curi-
ously enough, in ex-President Cleveland's
stern Venezuela message Lnglishmen
| are to-day beginning to take serious ac-
count of McKinley's death in its effect
on the future relations of the two countries
It is alwaye true that any change which
affects international politics is re-
garded with apprehension and uneasi-
ness. These feelings in the present in-
stance are based chiefly on ignorance
Even well-informed Englishmen know
little of President Roosevelt politically
| They know of him as a man of versatile
tastes and pursuits and tremendous en-
lergy. They recognize in him independ-
| ence, courage and a strong initiative. The
| latter qualities, not to put too fine a point
upon it, inspire fear instead of confidence
in the mind of the average Englishinan
| He ia, to be sure, lamenting the absence
of each of these three characteristics in
the Government of his own country at
the present moment, but it is his firm be-
lief that they should be kept carefully
in the background in times of peace and
prosperity
| Two representative opinions, one friendly,
j the other hostile, will give a fair idea of
| the new President, from the English point
lof view. The first, is from the Spectator,
| which save
|
'
|

“Save for Lincoln the modern Presidenta
have not been men of mark They have
been sound, excellent constitutional mon-
archs, but not leaders or ruler@ of men
| Roosevelt ie far more like the men of the
first three decades of the Republic than the
convention-made Presidents of modern
times. He is essentially one of those men
who know exactly what they want and mean
to get it; but together with this intensit¥ and
keenriess, the new President is a man of
moderation In truth there is a great
deal of the old Whig me ion—we ure
the term in the English rather than the
American sense--about Roosevelt. That
| is the spirit which dislikes extreme, which
is against pushing even a good principle
or good policy too far and is in favor of
keeping ail these things within the bounds
of common sense. But this spirit is a very
different one from that of the opportunist
or the man of perennial compromise

“What most men are interested in here
are Roosevelt's views in regard to a foreign
policy, especially hie attitude toward
thia country We believe that attitude
ean rightly be described in the sentence
that Roosevelt ia neither for nor againat
England, but merely for his own country,
He does not wish this country any harm,
| but would not dream of sacrificing the ine
teresta of America, even in the smallest
degree, to help England. His sole desire
is to help America. He is, of course, an
imperialist, but to say that is not to sey
all An essential thing to remember in
regard to President Roosevelt's position
on foreign affairs is that he is an upholder
of the Monroe Doctrine in ite fullest and
most complete form *

On the other hand, the Speaker makes
these observations

“There is a peculiar danger in the acci-
dental power which he (President Roose-
velt) may now exercise. He is not of the
pale or laborious cast commonly associated
| with the Vice-Presidency He will act
| Upon definite conviction and will attempt
to lead rather than to follow. This a man
of twenty times his calibre, Cleveland,

could do; but Cleveland represented a
great party. He came into power with a
defiaite mandate; he held the pulse of

the American people. Roosevelt's theory
is imported from Europe, and not from
liberal Europe, but from the Europe that
talks of law and order The position is
not only anomalous, it is perilous. In a
word, Koosevelt may quite conceivably pro-
voke a strong reaction against the forces
which put his predecesser into power,
or he may create new party feeling opposed
to the whole tradition of his nation. A
crisis in foreign affairs, a great strike or
a question involving the limits of Federal
authority would tempt Roosevelt to act and
his act might provoke a storm. It is that
