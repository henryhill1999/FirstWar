After the upper part of the house had

They found «@ door leading to the cellar

of the ataws lag the beely of the servant
wir! The autopay showed that the girl
hed been hit on the jaw and her bedy had
eon thrown down the stairs, after which
had heen robhed and the fire
started) The police were called into the
ase. and Inapector Met afferty assigned
Detectives Cary, Flehey, Butts and MeMul
len to the oa

Cary fret cot « let of all those who knew
the dead girl and also of pegsons familiar
with the interior of the house Among
these names waa that of Lizzie Mollom,
who had formerly been a washerwomen for
lazzie Molom said that
aa she was entering the Mack house a few
dave after the family left for Maine Sophie
hed gone out to a nearby grocery store

When Sophie returned she was met by a
man who asked her if she remembered
Sophie said that she did mot, but
the man recalled himself to the
having worked with her in @ bakery shop
Mrs. Mollom said that the man called again
ier and that Sophie contided to her that
the man wanted ber to marry him, but

the lhonee

| that she had refused him

Cary also learned that on the Saturday
preceding the murder one
driver for the American Bottling Com-
pany, had seen a man looking at him from
the parlor window of the house, although
the driver himself had failed to raise any-
body when he knocked. Schaeffer de-
sombed this man asa German in appearance

The detectives then set to work to look
up Sophie's history. They found that
she had come to this country from Rotter-
dam in May, 1908, and that on the follow-
ing June she had gone to work for a baker
by the name of Wilhelm on Amsterdam
avenue near Eighty-fourth street,  Al-
though Wilhelm had sold the business the
detectives found a former employee who
said that he remembered a man by the
name of Henry Hoffman who had worked
there for a short time and who had been
fired for whipping another man.

The detectives set to work then to locate
Hoffman ana two daya later they found a
Hoffman who had worked in the bakery
and who lived in Staten Isiand. He estab-
lished an alibi, but he gave one important
piece of information. The man with whom
he had had the fight was also named Hoff-
man, 80 the detectives immediately atarted
out again to locate the other Hoffman.

The police found Mre. Hoffman at her
house, at 302 East Fighty-fourth street,
but she said that she and her husband had
quarrelled and that she had not seen him
since the day following the murder of the
servant girl, when he had returned home
for sore clothes. The detectives did not
put much faith in Mrs. Hoffman's atory
and shadowed her home

Mra, Hoffman was not long in going out
and waa followed to a house at 234 Third
avenue, which turned out to be a furnished
room house kept by a Mra. Gunther, From
Mra. Gunther the detectives learned that a
few days back a man had come to her,
aaid that he was a foreman baker and
taken a room under the name of Henry
Heinemann, ‘The detectives went to his

, room and there they found a auit case, [nit

they found a twenty blade penknife, a pair
of agate cuff buttons and a diamond pin,
all of which were identified by Mr, Mack as
having been taken from his home on
A ugust 3,

The detectives took a room next to Heine-
mann’, but although they waited for a week
he failed toshow up = This carries the hunt
up to last Saturday, when the burglar was
shot by Verrall,

As no one could identify the dead man
his body waa removed to the Morgue,where
it lay yesterday, Cary came to the conclu-
sion yesterday that possibly something
had happened to Heinemann and per-
suaded Mra. Gunther to accompany him
to the Morgue. She was shown the body
of the Verrall burglar and immediately
said that it was her boarder, Heinemann.

The detectives then took Mrs. Hoffman
to the Morgue. She identified the man as
her husband and also admitted that he had
onee been imprisoned for burglary after he
had left the German Army, in which he had

Lieutenant. Mra. Mollom = and
former employees of the bakery

been
Levert
| also identified the body as that of Hoffman.

saw that he was reading the burial service.
The bride began weeping and the bride-
groom expostulated with the vicar

The clergyman insisted on resuming the
service and this time he began with

baptize these people with water.” The

,wedding party then made him desist and

the vicar saat down, while some of the mem-
bers of the party secured bicycles and
searched the countryside for a minister.
They eventually got Archdeacon Chard,

who solemnized the marriage after two |

hours delay, during which the friends of
the bride tried to console her

Vicar Taylor, who had gone outside the
ehurch and thrown down his surplice,
then returned and sat through the service.
The bridegroom has since received a letter

regret at “the vicar’s disgraceful con-

MAN CRAZED BY TAKING GAS,

Attacks the Dentist, Whe Strikes Patient
With a Hammer Fracturing His Skull.
WASHINGTON, Sept. 1.— George W. Bowers,

an engineer, went to the Washington Dental

Parlors this afternoon to have an aching

tooth extracted, and a few minutes later

was carried to the Emergency Hospital
with a fractured skull and the affected
molar still fam in hia mouth = In the mean-
time he had wrecked the dental parlor
and caused a commotion which required

a squad of policemen to quell
Bowers insisted upon taking gas against

the advice of Dr R. B. Leonard, When
it was administered Bowers etarted in to
break up the furniture and to attack the
dentist. Two asasisianta and a colored
porter came to his rescue, but Bowers had
them all down and out in quicker time
than it would have required to extract the
tooth.

Finally, in defence of his life, Dr. William
H. Winter seized a hammer and atruck
Bowers on the head with it, fracturing hia
akull. This floored the man, and strangely
enough brought him back to consciousnena.
He explained that in his delirium he thought
the doctors were attacking hia wife, When
he reached the hospital he had forgotten
all about hia toothache, He will recover
from the fractured skull.

Dr, Wirter was held in $1,000 bail to await
the result of Rowers's injuries.

4 HMOUSELESS COUNTY

Officials of New California County Do Busi-
ness and Live in Tents,

Los Anas as, Cal., Sept. 1.—The new
county of Imperial, which was revently
carved out of the eusiern end of Santiago,
has e'ected officers, and those officers are
camping in tents and shacks at El Centro,

| when telling of the plight
| sey men

of hia unfamiliarity with the lighta about
the Hook and the South Channel. In the
darkness the cutter got off ite course and
wae caught in (he grip of outgoing currents
which soon had the boat beyond Sandy
Hook and well out to sea

Capt. Gibbs of the Kimpland was taking
hie tug down from Scotland lightship with
two barges in tow when abwut three and a
Lalf miles outside of the Hook he saw a
light very low down near the water. The
captain thought it unusual that auch a light
should be flickering to th» westward of the
South Channel and looked again for ir,
but it had disappeared. He was going
by the spot when he heard a faint hail

“For God's sake, take us on board your |

boat.” came a erv out of the darknens
Then there were quavering hulloas and
faint shouts

The captain put bis tug over in the diree
tion and soon he could make out the cutter
with all the sixteen men standing up and
waving at him. The tug ran alongside
and her crew helped the naval reservists
aboard with lines and boathooks

“It was the sickest looking lot of met
lever saw,” said Capt. Gibbs yesterday
of the New Jer-
“Some of them were not
than 14 years old and the oldest couldn't
have heen more than 24 and they were all
so tired they could hardly stand. We
offered them coffee and something to eat,
but some of them were too sick to take it.”

The tug captain took the cutter in tow
to Clifton and from that point the rescued
reaervista made their way to Sandy Hook
by daylight yosterday.

The men remaining on the Portamouth
did not know last night of the adventure
that had befallen their comrades until told of
it by the reporters. They showed great
concern until Lieut. Lozier returned from
Sandy Hook and reported that none was
the worse for his adventure. Lieut, Logier
at hia home at 19 Cottage etreet, Newark,

an additional charge of larceny against |

him, saying that Quinn had tried to steal!
a watch from a tellow prisoner.

Quinn was arrested Saturday by Police-

houses in the town for them.

The unique situation has atarted a build-
ing boom, but it takes time to gét material
across the desert and convert it into resi-
dences, and meantime the officials, who are
all doing business in a temporary court
house, spend their nights wherever they
ean find a good place to lie down, Portable
houges are expected to relieve the situation
within ten days.

This ia not the only trouble of the officials. |

Only one or wwo have held such positions
before and they find it no easy task to set
the machinery of the new county into
motion, partioularly when there has been
a bitter fight of many months to decide
where the hub of the wheel ahould be. The

was locked in a cell with Emer Norger-
When Norgerstreng
wanted to look at his watch he found it
gone. He accused Quinn. The policeman
told Quinn he had better give up the watch,
and presently it was found on the floor of
the cell. Magistrate Doelger held Quinn
in $1,000 bail on each charge.

10 ATTACK WARSH WILL AGAIN.

Stewart, Whe Thought He'd Be the Heir, Is
Living in Poverty.

Douglas A. Stewart, who failed two years

ago in an attempt to have set aside the will

of Luther R. Marsh, the law partner of

Daniel Webster, who in his old age fell vie- |
tim to the spook paintings of Anna O'Delia |

Dies De Bar and the trance revelations of
Mra. John J. Huyler, announced yesterday
that he would try to have his case reheard.

Stewart, a relative by marriage of Marsh,
lived with Marsh for twenty years as a
ward, and he says that the old lawyer
repeatedly promised to make him his heir.
But soon after Mrs. Huyler appeared Stew-
art had to leave because, he says, of the
medium's plotting. Mrs. Huyler died be-
fore Marsh, but in a will which Stewart
alleges was forged all of Marsh's property
waa left to her husband, John J. Huyler of
Middletown.

Stewart « row 58 years old. People tell
him he looka very much like John D. Rocke-
feller, but he lives in a hal! bedroe:n on
East Pifty-seventh street and ia very poor.

FAST TO SEF A

Might Have Been Longer for U p-State Swede
€ Discerning Policeman Hadn't Obliged.

| Policeman Harry Smith o* the Brooklyn
| Bridge aquad got a vari ion from the
| familiar request for anich i or a dime for
i carfare yesterday afterno: 1 when Richard
| Reynolds of Watertown N Y., in his beat
|

|

Sunday clothes came along. Reynolds
| is a Swede and he had come to see Prince

Wilhelm. At home he isa blackamith and
' worka in Ed Hankin's shop at % Willow
| street
| Three days ago his money gave out and
‘he wrote home for more. The folks sent
him an order on the poat office for $10.60,
; which reached Reynolds yesterday. It
‘ didn’t do him much good though, for yea-
terday was Sunday and to-day was going
to be a holiday. He hadn't had a meal for
three days and he told Policeman Harry
he gueased by the time he could get the
$10.60 he wouldn't need it.

As Reynolds was able to prove the truth
of bia story Policeman Harry eavorted
him to Boh Herring's food house on Park
row and had him filled up. Then he sent
him down to the Scandinavian Emigrant
Labor Bureau, at 12 State street.

Reynolds went on his way looking a little
leas peaked, but he saya he hasn't seen the
Prince yet

the

mission into the matter, and for which
Mr. Harriman and men associated w'th him
are supposed to be responsible, is yet to
he made. This point will be settled early
in the fall.

There is good reason to believe that the
President will discuss the Harriman case
in hie first message to the Sixtieth Congress,
using it as an example in support of eup-
plemental railroad legislation which he
will recommend, and which he has already
outlined in public addresges, notably at
Indianapolis on Memorial Day.

It ie now known for a certainty that if
the Administration makes an effort to
“amash” Harriman, the Union Pacific
Southern Pacific consolidation will be the
first point of attack. According to the
Interstate Commerce Commission, compe-
tition between these two systems has been
eliminated under the Harriman manage-
ment. Whether the merger is beneficent
or otherwise in its effects upon interstate
trade must be decided by the legal advisers
of the Administration. If it should be held
that the consolidation is wholesome in its
| influences upon interstate trade and inter-
| tate shippers the Administration will

not go inte the courts probably, as the
United Staées Supreme Court, in ite decree
pee crete yeep porns
an intimation that a merger of competing
railroads that was helpful instead of hurt-
ful to interstate commerce was in all prob-
ability a legal combination The Inter-
state Commerce Commission, severe in ite
denunciation of some of the methods of
Mr. Harriman in acquiring and manipulate
ing railroad property, commended the
| management of roads under his control
\ as follows:
|

“It has been no part of the Harriman policy
| to permit the properties which werafbrought
under the Union Pacific control to degen-
erate and decline; as railroads they are
better properties to-lay, with lower grades,
| straighter tracks and more ample equip-
ment, thanthey were when they came under
| that control, Large sums have been gen-
| erousty expended in the carrying on of
engineering works and betterments which
make for the improvement of the service
and the permanent value of the property”
In the conference on the Harriman case
to be held here by the President and his
advisers next month thie question qill
hav» careful consideration’ “Whether a
prosecution of the Harriman roads should
| be instituted in view of the fact that the
| President intends to recommend to the
| next Congress the passage of a law which
| in effect would except railroads from the
| application of the provisions of the Sher-
man anti-trust act?”
| In his Memorial Day apeech at Indianap-
| olia the President, discussing the railroad
situation generally, made this statement:
“Subject to first giving to the Govern-
ment the power of supervision and control,
which I have advocated, the law should be
amended #o that the railroads may be per-
mitted and encouraged to make traffic
agreements when these are in the interest
of the general public as well as of the rail-
road corporations making them. These
agreements should, of course, be made
public in the minutest detail, and should
be subject to securing the previous nasent
| of the Interstate Commerce Commission.”
The President thus urged the legalizing
of pooling agreements, a plan long advo-
cated by Martin A. Knapp, chairman of
the Interstate Commerce Commission, With
pooling legalized the anti-trust act, @ far
as it applies to railroads, would be nullified
in the opinion of Chairman Knapp. By
| providing that traffic agreements between
| railroads should be supervised by the Inter-
state Commerce jon Opportunity
to abuse it would be removed.
Inquiry develops that during his summer
vacation Attorney-General Bonaparte hae
, Carefully studied the evidence adduced in
the Harriman case, and it is understood
that he will make a report to the President
in October. Just what conclusions he has
reached are not known here.
