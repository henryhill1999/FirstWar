!

More “peace” balloons were floated
out of Berlin yesterday, and reaching
London by way of Washington
promptly were punctured by Lloyd
George, who in discussing Great Brit-
ain’s war aims in the House of Com-
mons said that “complete restoration
of territory seized by Germany and

compensation for havoc caused would '

be the price of peace.”

A league of nations, in which Ger-
many is represented by triumphant
militarism, he declared, would be a
“hollow farce.”

The outline of the Kaiser's ‘Christ-
mas Peace Terms,” as received in
Washington yesterday, were not re-
garded as sincere and were not such
as could receive consideration by the
Allies.

The next few months, said Mr. Lioyd
George, would be most trying ones, as
one great Power had gone out and an-
other had not fully come !n. The ad-
vent of America into the world's poli
ties was an event which would loom
large in the future. This was true also
of the establishment of the Internationa!
Council at Versailles,

“If we could project ourselves into
the year 2000, what would be the opin-
fon of many of the events of to-day?"
asked the Premier. “No doubt the Rus
sian revolution would hold a conspicuous
place. Another feature would be the
advent of America for the first time, not

‘into the war, but into world politics——a
| Sigantio event of itself. The next event
would be the conquest of Mesopotamia
and Palestine and the release of Arabia
from the dominion of Turkey. Another
event would be the setting up of the
Interallied Council.”

NEW OFFER OF PEACE.

 

\ All the Allfes.

Prrroarap, Dec. 19.—(Delayed)—Ac-
cording to press reports Russia has been
informed by the Central Powers that
they intend to make peace proposals to
the Allies. : ,

This report is published in the Rvening

Post, which says the representatives of
the Central Powers, at the first prelim-
inary peace conference with the Rus-
sians, held yesterday, announced that
their Governments intended on principle
to put the question of peace hefore all
the Powers, and that they Nad asked
| thelr alllés to do Itkewise. Russia was
| requested to take similar. steps It !s
atated the Russians are endeavoring by
all means to sound the Allies.

The Evening Post says the Germans
have officially informed the Bolshevik

  
 

on international relations than any one
could imagine, So far it hud been a

to remove friction. The various coun-
tries have found that it means the re-
moval of friction in discussing and in-
terchanging yrs and he had no doubt
it would havé a great influence in the
direction of the economic policy of the
four Governments represented. The mna-
chinery established at Versailles would
have a potent Influence in unifying the
war and economic strategy of the Allies.

The necessity of sending troops to
Italy and the Russian armistice had !n-
creased the anxieties of the Allies and
cast further obligations on them

“It is therefore absolutely necessary,”
eald the Premier, “for the security of
our armies and our country and for the
defence of our allies that this country
whould make greater sacrifices in order
to strengthen the armies in the fleld dur-
ing the coming year."
