Move Up Town Decided On!
Unanimously by 400
Members.

 

Tammany will move uptown
Yourteenth street a® soon as the mem- |
bers find a site that they like and de-
cide as to the kind of building they |
want They may put up a big new!
home of their own or they may buy a
clubhouse if a suitable offer is made.

The decision to quit Fourteenth street
and the Bowery associations was
reached by unanimous vote of 400 mem-
bers of the Society of Tammany, or
Columbian Order, tn its annual meeting
at the wigwam last night. Grand
Sachem John R. Voorhis offered this
resolution and it was passed without
dissent:

“Resolved, That it is the sense of the
meeting that a change should be made
to another location at the earliest oppor-
tunity that may present itself.”

Somebody moved that the selection of
a new site and form of building be en-
trusted to a committee of five, but he
was reminded that the thirteen sachems
themselves constitute the building

mittee, So the matter is now
hands of the sachems. They will meet
regulafly on the third Monday in May,
but may have a special conference be-
fore then. The Tammany society is to
meet again on May 8.

Most of the speakere last night
favored the region south of Central
Park and north of Forty-second street
and Fifty-ninth street as the best dis-
triet for new Tammany headquarters.
As to the general type of building there
were various suggestions.

Charles B. Meyers, a member of Tam-
many and architect of the New York
State building at the San Francisco ex-
position, submitted plans for a build-
ing of Colonial type, which he thought

because it was not ratsed at the tirst
motion for new trial, although the facts
