8600,000 IN ST. REGIS

 

Values Are Higher by Many
Millions Than the City
Assessments.

On the basis of the payment of

the Col. John Jacob Astor estate
| tax to the State Comptroller yes-
terday the features of the pre-
liminary appraisal of the estate are
as follows:

Net value of estate, $77,826,000.

Real estate, exclusive of Rhine-
beck property, $62,850,000.

Art objects, statuary, bronzes,
&c., $460,000.

Other personal property.$887,965.

Personal property in St. Regis
Hotel, $600,000.

Stocks, bonds, mortgages and all
other property, $13,028,035.

Residuary estate, all to William
Vincent Astor, $67,826,000.

The total estate of Col. John Jacob
Astor will appralse at many millions
less than has been supposed.

This was indicated yesterday when
a messenger from the office of Carter,
Ledyard & Milburn, attorneys for the
executors, went to the State Comptrol-
ler's office at Albany with a check for
$5,150,000, representing the transfer tax
as computed on the present estimate of
the value of the estate by the execu-
tors,

This amount of tax indicates that the
executors have computed the net value
of the estate, after all debts, commis-
sions of executors and other deductions
have been eliminated, at $77,826,000.
l'revious estimates of the value of the
ate have ranged from $75,000,000 to
150,000,000, with the Astor real estate
equently appraised at $100,000,000,

REGISTRATION 18 LIGHT. !

City Shows Falling Off in Spite of
Popalation Increase,

The registration for yesterday, the
first day of this year, was lighter vy
far than it has been for several years,
It showed a noticeable falling off from
1908, the last Presidential year, regard-
less of the increase tn population, which
experts figure should amount to about
8 per cent. in voters.

The total for the five boroughs was
190,151. Of this Manhattan and The
Bronx registered 106,095 voters, as com-
pared to 124,852 in 1908. Richmond had
4,188, nearly one thousand lighter than
in 1908, while Queens had 16,266, 2s
compared to 14,520 In 1908. The total
for Brooklyn yesterday was 74,009; the
first day in 1908 was 84,326,

THREAT 10 KILL

Defence Witness Swears Lieu-
tenant Said He’d “Croak”
Rosenthal.

 

 

WAS TALKING TO ROSE

 

Luban Tells of Overhearing
Four Gamblers Plotting

Murder.

 

LEWIS AGAIN IDENTIFIED

 

Austrian Says He Saw Whitey
Pump Lead Into Gambler
From Automatic.

 

Ideut. Becker and his lawyers were
struck with amazement and their plans
were disordered late yesterday after-
noon when Morris Luban, a witness on
whom they had depended for testimony
that he overheard Rose, Webber, Val-
lon and Schepps plotting the murder
of Herman Rosenthal and threatening
to kill Becker if he interfered, swore
that he heard Becker, in the steam
room of the Lafayette Baths two or
three weeks before the murder, up-
braiding Rose and threatening to kill
Rosenthal with his own hands,

“I know it’s the last of me,” whis-
pered Luban to a court attendant who
had observed his trembling and his
fright, but there was no tremor in hjs
voice when he looked steadily at Becker
a few minutes later and testified:

“Mr, Becker said, ‘If that
—— Rosenthal jis not croaked I will
croak him myself.”

It was the most telling feature of a
day that had gone steadily against the
defence.

The first witness, Thomas Ryan, a
chauffeur, had blanched under the vi-
cious looks shot at him by the gunmen
at the bar and had said in a voice
barely audible that he couldn't identify
them. Glovanni Stanich, an Austrian
of good birth, cultivated manners and
keen intelligence, had not been terri-

 

| filed by the black looks of the gunmen.

He had looked full in the face of Whitey
Lewis (Frank Muller) and named
Waitey as one of the four whom he saw
shoot Rosenthal to death. And then
came Luban, fearful and shrinking at
first, but gaining courage as he went
along, and not only identified all four of
the gunmen and Shapiro, their chauf-
feur, but delivered against Becker the
first testimony connecting Becker with
the murder.

Gunmen Rall at Witness,

When he walked to the bar of the
court and stretched out als hand toward
the gunmen their voices suddenly shat-
They” railed = against him. They
Lefty Loule Rosenberg rose to a
screech, He was protesting against the
method of identification. And when

old acquaintances he had seen at the
murder—all save Dago Frank Cirofici,
whose name Le didn't know but whose
appearance gave him no doubts—the re-
tainers of the late Jack Zelig had lost a
measure of the defiance and contempt-
vousness that have marked them. As
for Becker, the sweat was streaming
down his face. He seemed to have aged.

Recovering from the shock of Luban's
direct acd wheiiy unexpected testimouy
against becker, John F. McIntyre, his
lawyer, tolled for hours to destroy its
effect. He tabcred to discredit the wit-
ness. He sought to bring out that
Luban was a forger, a gambler, a
ne’er-do-well, who had bargained with
the defence before turning to the Dis-

 

TO HARRIMAN

TELLS OF T. R. AID

Attorney Declares Merger
Were Called Off in 1905,

Los ANGELES, Oct. 11,—Attorney
Joseph H, Call of this city, formerly
special counsel for the United States in
the so-called “Harriman merger sults,”
to-day gave out a statement in which
he declared that Judge Robert 8S, Lov-
ett'’s testimony before the Senate In-
vestigating committee Wednesday re-
garding the dismissal of the suits was
“wholly unwarranted by the facts and
untrue.”

Call makes public for the first time
letters sent from the United States At-
torney-General's office at Washington
ordering the dismissal of the Govern-
ment suits to dissolve the merger of
the Southern Pacific Railroad and the
Central Pacific Railroad in 1905 follow-
ing the raising in October,, 1904, of the
$250,000 Republican campaign fund by
E. H. Harriman when Roosevelt was a
candidate.

The Government's failure to have the
merger dissolved, Attorney Call asserts,
meant millions of dollars to Harriman
and his associates. Thursday's papers
quoted Judge Lovett as testifying that
the merger suits were dismissed in 1890.
Call says they were dismissed July 10,
1905.

UNIONISM IN THE CHURCHES.

Problems of Labor Presented Under
Religions Aespicen,

Labor unions have been asked for
some time by the churches to cooper-
ate. For the first time unions have re-
sponded this fall and have begun a se-
ries of educational meetings intended
to make Christian people better in-
formed on workingmen and their prob-
lems.

Moving pictures and lectures are the

features. The American Federation of
Labor, the Federation of Churches and
the National Child Labor Commission
are joining in the work. The lecturers
are provided by the unions. The series
began last week in three Catholic
churches in Brooklyn and last night In
the Catholic Church of Our Lady of
Good Counsel, in East Ninety-first
street, Manhattan. Next Monday night
there will be a lecture at St. John's
Catholic Club, in Fiftieth street, fol-
| lowed by lectures at All Souls’ Episco-
}pal Chureh, Harlem, October 16; at
Christ Congregational Church, Bronx,
October 18; at the Union Methodist
Church, in Forty-elghth street, October
26, and at St. Stephen's Catholic Church,
in East Twenty-elghth street, Octo-
ber 31.

Secretary Brady of the Central Coun-
cil of Labor said after the lecture last
nicht:

“Why do we go Into the churches and
thelr parish houses? Because for years
the churches have been inviting us to
do so. We want to see whether the
churches will rise to the occasion.”

of ten days he weighed 208 pounds. At
the end of his fast he tipped the scales

MAN AND AVIATOR
LOST WITH HYDRO-AERO

Marshall Reid and Lieutenant-
Commander Mustin Are
Missing.

 

 

 

WIRELESS SEARCH FAILS |

 

Warship Unable to Find Clue
in Delaware Bay or
River.

 

PHILADELPHIA, Oct. 11.—Aviator Mar-
shall Earl Reld and a passenger, Lieu- |
tenant-Commander Henry C. Mustin,
who started in a flight from Cape May
Point at 1:42 o'clock to-day, are miss-
ing and are believed to have been swept |
out to sea.

The men started In a hydroaeroplane |
for League Island Navy Yard, but were
never sighted after the siart. A search
of Delaware River and failed to]
show any trace of the men or machine.

The air craft should have been re-
ported nearing the city less than two
hours after the start, but as no word
was received Lieutenant-Commandé:r |
Mustin’s brother, Harry Mustin, started
the Government wireless to searching
for the missing airmen.

The torpedo boat destroyer Beale, the
fastest ship in the navy, was reached
by radio for‘; miles below Wilmington
on her way to the naval review in New
York. She erdered halted and
started a search of the river and bay.

She also got in touch by wireless with
several amateur stations along the
shore, but was unable to pick up any |
word of the men for whom she was
searching. |

Later in the evening the Beale com-
municated with the navy yard again |
and announced that Reid and his pas- |
senger were apparently not on bay}
or river and that no word could be se-
cured of their having put to shore on
either side. Mrs, Mustin and the Lieu- |
tenant-Commander's brother thereupon |
started preparations to have other naval |
boats sent down the river, and the wire-
less was put upon the scent again.

Search among all the pilot stations
along the Delaware Bay and river failed |
to give any clue to the missing men |
and It is feared that with the northeast |
wind they may have been carried out to
sea. The navy yard here has used the}
powerful wireless apparatus at its dis-
posal and everywhere the answer is,
“No news.”

At 9 o'clock the Navy
ordered out its boarding boat to go
down the river and meet a tramp
steamer that was coming up the river
at the time the men left Cape May
Point, but after they had met the steam- |
ship at Quarantine they flashed back
word via wireless that nothing had been |
seen of the hydroaeroplane.

Even if they survived, the men must
be enduring terrible hardships, for the
river is twenty-six miles wide at this
point. If any trouble occurred with |
the mechanism they would be compelled
to swim thirteen miles to shore.

If they should have mastered this!
feat they would be marooned upon some |
of the marshes all night and must stay
there until daybreak or until some ves-
sel comes along to take them off.

It is reasonably certain at this hour
that no steamer has picked them up, for
the wireless has been in range of every-
thing in the bay as far down as the
breakwater, and every ship has reported
that they saw nothing of Reld or Lieut.
Mustin,

Shortly after 6 o'clock Reid's mech-

PRINCE MAY GET A DIVORCE.

George of Bavaria Can't Have Mar-
riage Annuled Is Report,
Special Cable Despatch to Tur Secs.

Mvnicn, Oct. 11.—The notorious rup-
ture between Prince George of Bavaria
and his wife, the Princess Isabella, is
now the subject of an announcement by
the Chamberlain to the Regent. This de-
nies emphatically that grounds exist
for nullifying the marriage and adds
that if the marriage is dissolved it can
only be done by divorce. The announce-
ment says:

“It is true that there has been from
the beginning a profound incompati-
bility between the couple due to the differ=
ence in their characters and marital rela-
tions have been utterly destroyed.” The
couple were married in February, 1912.

 

 

The Princess was formerly  Arch-
duchess Isabella of Austria. She left
her husband soon after their marriage
and returned to her father in Vienna.
It was said recently that the father of the
Princess had applied to have the marriage
declared void. She is 23 and her husband
32 years of age.

The fourth call to arms in the gruel-
ling world's series of ball games be-
tween the Glants and Red Sox at the
Polo Grounds yesterday turned into a
battle which was only a degree less
stubborn and trying than the three
others, The Bostons were the winners
by a score of 3 to 1—the first game in
which the victor has had a margin of
over one run—and success has now
perched twice on their crimson ban-
ners,

Two games to one In favor of the Red
Sox and one eleven inning tle is how
the milling stands, and, behind though
they are, the Giants are as combative
as at the outset or when they were one
game behind just after they had lost the
first game. Whoever wins, whoever
loses, every game is a fight to a finish
with them, and moreover they know
well that only that sort of fighting will
overcome the handicap in a series
against a club which itself never lets
go. The Bostons are ahead, but their
heads are no higher than those of the
Giants,

A gray, moist laden day was no
deterrent whatsoever in the rampant In-
terest in the games, and no heavy field
could slacken the pace of or thick, deep
atmosphere sap the ardor of the com-
batants. With the Boston star always
in the ascendency yesterday—the Red
Sox were ahead all the way—it never
was so far so as to permit them to feel
safe or relax for a single moment. They,
knew the mettle of their opponents and
played as hard to maintain their lead
as the Giants did to wipe it out. ;

Fast playing took place on a surface
not fast. Skilful manicuring of the
field had prevented it from being slow,
but the rain had left it less lively than
before. The strife, however, went on
with undiminished energy and with all
of its now accustomed closeness and
doubtfulness of issue,

The Bostons got the jump and won,
There were unaccepted chances for
double plays on both sides which were
no fault of the players and which, had
the ground permitted the ball to come
to the flelders a trifle sharper, might
have improved New York's chances but
which would not have kept Boston from
winning. The Red Sox did well at
making the most of their scoring oppore
tunities, and, though bunching base hita
not as often as New York, dovetailed
hits with battery slips of home pro-
duction sufficiently to win. With a
watchful eye to openings they had the
wherewith in the way of hits and a

| stolen base to make the most of them,

The Giants gave stern chase. Held
back for five Innings by the Joe Wood
formula of smoke and curves, all the
more effective on the dark day, they
never lost heart and in the sixth and
seventh Innings they threatened a suc.
cessful climbing of the Red hope'a

| frame. The Giants grouped five of ning

hits in the sixth and seventh innings,
but the Boston genius of the knoll,
backed by sharp support, was too ef-
fective for the unceasing New York
efforts to reach the desired consumma-

tlon, Don't overlook that sharp supe.
port. Wood, wizard though he was,
would have had a thornier path to

travel without it,
The Giants did just what they did the
first time they encountered Wood, They

made more hits than the Bostons gath--

ered off the New York pitching. Never-
theless the Missouri magician tried
them sorely. He altered his system
somewhat from the first game. He did
more curving, he crooked the ball over
the pentagon oftener than he applicd
