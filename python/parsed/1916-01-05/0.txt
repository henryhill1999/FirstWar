MAYOR’S SECRETARY
RISES FAST AS SOLDIER

Rousseau Needs Only Three
Weeks to Go From Civil
Life to Staff Job.

 

 

 

Theodore Rousseau, secretary to Mayor
Mitchel, admitted modestly yesterday
that he has taken up the profession of
arms and is already a member of the
staff of Brig.-Gen. George R. Dyer, First
Brigade, N.G.N. Y. Major Allan Regan
of division headquarters says that there
is as yet on file no record of this ad-
vancement of the Mayor's secretary, but
Mr. Rousseau himself admits it.

Gen, Dyer, for some reason, would not
discuss the naming of Lieut. Rousseau
to his staff, but the young Lieutenant
talked it over with his friends yester-
day. It appears from his account that
he tried an examination conducted by
the division board. Mr. Rousseau wasn't

| sure whether he competed with anybody

or not, but he was sure that Col. Louts
D. Conley plucked him right out of ctv!l!
life and made him a soldier, and so
First Lieut. Theodore Rousseau was as-
signed to Company J, Sixty-ninth Regt-
ment.

Accounts differ as to just how long
he was a First Lieutenant of Company
J. The Lieutenant himself says that he
hasn't any uniform yet, so it couldn't
From other sources
it was learned that on December 2
of his approval as having passed the
eXaminations was filed and that on De-
cember 9 he was assigned to Company
J. The understanding around City Hall
is that one day after being assigned to
Company J the young Lieutenant was
elevated to Gen. Dyer's staff.

That was about all that Senator Gore

was more communicative. And when
asked concerning the attitude of his

always ready with replies.

The Senator arrived at the Waldorf

entered Senator Gore's rooms yesterday
at dusk the Senator was sitting alone
in the centre of a big, brilliantly lighted
sitting room of the sucte, his unseeing
jeyes seeming to stare into the-—-for him—

the distance is about fifty miles, Only
if the Teutons were positively assured

at a later stage of the new Russian of-
fensive could they afford to retain their
lines on the Rumanian border.

In view of the uncertainty of Ru-

sertions that “a strong military show-
ing’ on the part of the Russians might

it is not believed that Field Marshal von
Mackensen will risk being pushed
against King Ferdinand's frontier, for
the Russians with their apparently re-
enforced and well equipped army could
easily drive southward the Carpa-
thians and thus bottle up the Teutons

Tn that event the Austrian and German
forces would be in the same position as
the Allies were in Macedonia; they would
have to accept what might be a decisive
battle or retreat into the neutral terri-
tory of Rumanim That kingdom, how-
ever, Is not in the same position toward

Wasninoton, Jan. 4.—-Two  uncer-
tainties appear to stand In the way of
an immediate climax in the situation
caused by the latest submarine active
ity. These uncertainties are:

First—Whether the Ujited States
Government can prove on evidence ef
fact that the British lir Dersia was
6unk by a submarine and can tix the
nationality of the undersea boat

Second-—Whether this Government
on the basis of international liw can
contend that the passenger liner,
armed for defence, is ithed to ime
murty from attack without warning.
