The advance of the Bolsheviki and

about a diplomatic state of war with

Russia, and a military state of war
almost has intervened. Germany

‘Burial Will Be in Old Cemetery Near His

Home — Arrangements Are Made in

Accordance With His Wishes.

 

Theodore Roosevelt died in his home at Oyster Bay at
4:15 o’clock yesterday morning. He passed away in his sleep,
without suffering pain.

His death, stunningly unexpected despite his illnesses of
recent years, was caused by’a pulmonary embolism, which
yas carried through an artery to
where it stopped the circulation. Weakening of
the blood vessels which caused the embolism accompanied the
attack of inflammatory rheumatism for which Col. Roose-
velt was treated at Roosevelt Hospital from November 11 te
Christmas Day. The original cause of both manifestations
was the infection of a tooth dating back twenty years.

All his life the former President had drawn unmercifully
upon his marvellous store of energy. Nevertheless up to a
comparatively recent period one would have guessed that he

had many years yet to live. But the man who lived the
!strenuous life as well as preached it sprvived his sixtieth
birthday by only seventy days.
