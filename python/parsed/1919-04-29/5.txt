69TH HAS FAREWELL
MEETING AT DINNER

If Sons Are Like You God Will
Save U. S., Father Duffy's
Parting Benediction.

TRUSTEES’ AID CHEERED

Gen. Lenihan and Col. Dono-
van Acclaimed by 3,000 of
Famous Command.

 

“Breed you the sons your fathers
bred and God will save America.”

This was the farewell message of
Father Francis P. Duffy, chaplain of the
old Sixty-ninth (now 165th), to officers
and men of the unit at its farewell meet-
ing last night in the Hotel Commodore,
where 3,000 of the personnel Joined in a
banquet and love feast.

Although it was a Victory dinner
fiven to them by the steadfast auxiliary

of the regiment, the trustees, there was
a tone of ess underlying the ap-
parent gayety, which was stimulated by
go0d music and a cabaret of high clase
vaudeville talent. After the speaking
Started the tone came to the surface and
shortly dominated the meeting until the
cabaret suspended with several excel.
lent numbers yet to be rendered.

The most béloved of these men were
Father Duffy, Col. William Donovan and
Brig.-Gen, Michael,J. Lenihan, who com-
manded at one time the Eighty-third
Brigade, of which the Sixty-ninth was
part. Neither éould rise without a storm
of cheerf&ig. Gen, Lenihan spent “fidst
of the time that he was not speaking
autographing ndsome menu souvenirs
for the officers and men.

Representatives of the officers and
men addressing these three leaders .per-
sonally told in no mistakatle terms
their depth of affection and regard for
themall. All were so deeply affected that
they considered a response futile.

After an eight course dinner and
the men were puffing on cigars and
cigarettes Morgan J. O’Brien, chairman
of the trustees’ benefit of the 165th
United States Infantry, formally wel-
comed the regtment, saying: “We have
pride in your regiment. But I would
speak of those who did not return. The
voice of your dead speaks forever of
a nobility that shall live. You of the
living have brought home a feeltng that
will never die, a feeling of love, inspYfa-
tion apd strength to us all. I will say
in a word what all of our words could
not say better, ‘Welcome.’”

He was greeted with a hearty cheer,
swelling from the composite throat of
the regiment; for, as was afterward
said, “no auxiliary ever attended to a
unit better and more fa!lthfully than did
the Trustees,” \

Welcome Given by City.

Mayor Hylan followed with an official
welcome for the city of New York. He
said that he indorsed Mr. O'Brien's
speech in every particular and that he
wotild make it his speech. And then he
told several humorous stories. In con-
cluding, however, he said that the city
of New York'will aid every man when
he is discharged, and every soldier who
will give it the opportunity. He thankéd
them personally for voting for him.

Gen. Lenihan, epeaking of the regi-
ment, said in tones that were breaking
now and then: “I led them in Dattle
and they never failed. I knew the men
with me as I know them now, and they
are the superfor men of men in the
world because of their extraction. °

“Our for bears left Europe because
they wouldn't tolerate the tyrannical rule
of Governments and they came here and
built an empire. And we are the ruling
nation of to-day because of this. The
strong came here; the weak remained.
That's why we bred men who domi-
nated all others; that’s why we broke
the Prussian Guard.

“We forced the passage of the Ourcq
River at the head of the allied units,”
he continued, reviewing the operations
in which the Sixty-ninth was engaged
ae part of the Elghty-third Brigade. He
lauded the achievements of the regi-
ment, the Fourth Ohio Infantry and a
Wisconsin machine gun battalion, of
which it was composed. He spoke ot
the death of Joyce Kilmer and said that
he afterwards visited his grave, where
he sleeps in hallowed memory. Cheer
after cheer resounded throughout the
grand ballroom as he talked—-and heei-
tated to gather his breaking voice again.

“LT am glad to see you here again,”
he continued. ‘And I congratulate you,
Mr. Mayor, because the billets are 80
good, the rations so bountiful, and men,
I welcome you once again.” It was min-
utes before he could be seated as the
cheering began to subside. Gen. Lenihan
is now with the returning Seventy-sev-
enth Division as a brigade commander.

A call for Col. Donovan, who brought
his regiment back, rolled out from under
the balcony and grew into full cry all
over the room.

He arose and said that he could not
speak but that he wished to remind the |

trustees that “the regiment will always |
keep them in grateful remembrance and
will remember what they have done for

its memberé

They are crowning their |
hospitality and

faithful care of us to- |
night with this dinner. They have been |
the most practical friends, the most |
faithful that any organization in the}
A. E. F. has had.” From the cheers!
and shouted compliments, the trustees |
haven't a chance to ever be forgotten,

Father Duffy was next introduced,
He surveyed the field of olive drab for
@ moment in silence.

Tribute'Paid to Dead.

“IT am not in a mood to feel humor-
ous. There is something of sadness
here for us all to-night. It is our fare-
well. We are at the end of the chapter, |
but not the end of the book. We have |
Written history in our chapter. I wish
to pay honor to the dead.

“This regiment is composed for the

most part of Irish descendants. Yours
were the fathers who left Ireland rather
than submit to the yoke of tyranny.

And you now manifest their spirit and
character in their honor and tradition. '

“We carried a color standard into this
war that contained fifty silver furls on

its staff. These were won in the civil
and the Spanish: American wars. These!
emblems of courage won by your fathers
of the old Sixty-ninth helped us in the
fields of France,

“And as an example of that courage,
and {ts inspiration fostered in the tradi-

tions of the regiment, I point to Col.
Charles D, Hine, once the commander of

ur regiment. It was Col. Hine who
crept into the line one terrible night
in the drive of St. Mihiel and fought

throughout the night as a private in the
ranks, for the sake of being again with

applause that resounded heartily from
the officers’ tables scattered in among
those of the men, for all were dining
together.

“Our best men, though, are not here.
They are in the fields of France. And
if I ever have anything to do with
the erection of a memorial to them it
shall contain also the figure of a woman,
for her. part though behind the lines
Was no less a part of the heroic self-
sacrifice necessary to win this war.

“Col. Donovan and the regiment are
Synonomous, And we come back a
united and happy regiment because we
come back under the command of Will
Donovan. Donovan won his rank from
Major to Colonel by courage and ef-
ficiency, Good men died because of
him; they died because they saw Dono-
van ahead of them in the field. He
stimulated them to further effort, to
courageous sacrifice by the example he
was setting.

“But now you are to leave him. You
are to return to your new life. And in
your new life try to write as brilliant a
record in the future as you did in the
past.

“Breed you the sons your fathers bred
and God will save America.”

A silence fell oyer the throng as he
concluded. But not for long. A faint
cheer started somewhere and ran like
fire in a powder train until the whole

place was thundering until one could
not hear one’s own voice swelling the
acclaim.

Lieut. Henry Kelley, who was

wounded early in the regiment's fight-
ing, spoke on behalf of the officers. He
declared that the men loved Col, Dono-
van and spoke of him affectionately as
“Wild Bul'—behind his back. “And,
Father Duffy, we love you! You are
one of the noblest men who ever served
in the United States Army,’ he con-
cluded.

Sergeant Thomas Fitzsimmons spoke
for the enlisted men. Aftes~ declaring
that they are with their officers, start-
ing from the bottom up, he said that
each and every one had the love, ad-
miration and respect of every man in
the regiment, *

Corporal Edward Gradbury presented
to Mayor Hylan a ring he had taken
from the ‘finger of » German soldier who
happened to get in the way of his rifie
when he was firing it.

Following the speeches the men seemed
to be in no.mood for cabaret entertain-
ment and the last meeting of the regi-
ment @s a regiment was broken by firm
handclasps and subdued good bys as the
men made their way back to their homes
for the night before returning to camp
for demobilisation, which will be this
morning.

O’RYAN TO SHOW
THE SWISS SYSTEM

Military Training Will Have
Tryout at Plattsburg.

 

 

The Swi® system of military training
is to be demonstrated at the Junior
Plattsburg camp during July and Au-
gust under the direction of Maj-Gen.
John F. O'Ryan, commander of the
Twenty-seventh Division, according to
an announcement by the board of dl-

rectors yesterday which says:

“The first principle of this system
is physical and moral preparedness
through wholesome athletic exercises and
discipline before undertaking the seri-
ous military training. The 1919 camp
will thérefore be limited practically to
phygical preparedness of the boy.”

The Swiss system was advocated for
the United States by Col. Roosevelt and
is now being urged by Charles W. Eliot,
president emeritus of Harvard Many
military men and educators see in It
the solution of the problem of military
preparedness in accordance with Ameri-
can traditions of individual liberty and
decentralization.

Prof, George E. Russell of the Repart-
ment of Civil and Sanitary Engineering
at the Massachusetts Institute of Tech-
nology, is president of the Junior Platts-
burg. For several years he has been
at the head of the institute's summer
surveying camp at East Machias, Me.
The academic training is to be directed
by Oscar Gallagher, head master of the
West Roxbury, Mass., high school. Be-
fore the camp closes members of the
Senate and House committees of mili-
tary affairs will be invited to Inspect
the results of two months’ training
under the Swiss system.

LIEUT. KRINSKY DIED
' IN ARGONNE BATTLE

Letter From Comrade Filed
With His Will.

Simultaneous with the filing of the
will of Lieut. Samuel E, Krinsky in the
Surrogate’s Court, Brooklyn, yesterday,
came a letter from France describing
his death in the Argonne Forest on Sep-
tember 28, 1918. The letter was written
by Lieut. H. O. Benton, who fought with
him in Company A, 137th Infantry.

“We met a very strong counter attack
from a fresh division of the famous
Prussian Guard," read the letter. ‘1
called to Lieut. Krinsky and asked him
how things were going. We didn’t have
many men left, but Lieut. Krinsky re-
plied that I gould count on him to the
last and he crawled along the front #n-
couraging the men. He got on the right
end of the tompany and I on the left.

“After some time we got orders to
advance and I passed the word on down
to him and heard him @ncouraging the
men and giving them orders for the ad-
vance. At last time came for the jump

heavy, and as he leaped out of his fox
hole a German machine bullet. pierced
his head, killing him."

officers of the regiment. Among them
was Mrs. Donovan, wife of the Colonel,
,hardly daring «to cheer lest the other
emotions she must have felt overcome
her. Beside her sat Mrs. William M.
Haskell, wife of the Colonel who took
the regiment to the Mexican border.

It was In this stand that Gen. Alexan-
der wag sitting modestly when, upon the
arrival of the official reviewing party,
Major-Gen, Shanks spotted him. Gen.
Shanks promptly crossed the street with
his ald, saluted briskly in front of the
, Seventy-seventh's commander and. in-
salsted that he join the official party. As
the two Major-Generals recrossed the
space of open pavement they were
greeted+ with ae rousing a cheer as any
of the day, presaging the welcome that
awaits the Seventy-seventh when its turn
comes to march up the. triumphant way.
| Nor was the welcome home confined to
| Fifth avenue yesterday. At 116th street
the column turned east and boarded spe-
clal trains on the Third avenue elevated.
Down Third avenue every pair of lace
curtains was pushed back on the second
story, almost every window flew, the
green flag, and every mother and child
and pretty girl and old man home from
work leaned out and chigered,

They went down to their old armory,
which hasn't heard the measured tread
of this regiment !n almost two years,
where another crowd cheered them
through the Armenian settlement on
Lexington avenue between sean cee
and Twenty-seventh streets, and into the
old drill shed, where they stacked rifles,
piled packs and tin hats and again
marched forth to attend the big dinner
at the Hotel Commodore last night.

 

No Escort for Regiment.

The" regiment had no escort. The
present National Guard Sixty-ninth was
drawn up as a guard of honor in front
of the reviewing stand. But in the line
of march were only the men who have
been overseas. Those who have just
come back were followed by another
“regiment,” or almost one, 1,186 men
who served with the 165th abroad and
weré sent home early on account of
wounds or sickness or transfer. They
marched with a military precision no
less than that of their comrades, though
several swung empty sleeves, though
many showed in their pale cheeks the
long weeks and months of hospital which
has intervened between yesterday and
the days of the fields of France and
though many wore the red discharge
chevron on their sleeves.

The meeting between these men and
the 165th in the armory was one of the
affecting things of the day. There old
comrades clasped hands, sure for the
first time that the one who had fallen
in the busy chargé or been carried back
bleeding on a_ stretcher had come
through after all. There the full stories
of incidents clouded in the haze of bat-
tle were cleared up. There old scores
were settled as well as words can settle
the scores of sentiment between soldiers,
That went something like this:

“Well, Mike, you old thief, so they
didn't get you after all.”

“No, Jerry, you and the boys got me
‘back in time, I guess. How’s it goin'?”

“Aw, rotten’, say, you, you were
too woozy to talk to last time I saw
you. Now, whathehell did you do with
them blankets of mine I left you with
up by Septsarges. They was cooties in
‘em for two weeks after you had 'em.”

The regiment got all cleaned up at
Camp Mills last night. Every man had
to have a trim haircut and every bit
of equipment was carefully inspected.
They left there in four special trains
before 10 this morning and about noon
two harbor boats put them ashore at
the Mallory Line pler at the foot of
West Tenth street. Thence they marched
through West street and Charles street
to Washington Square. e

Behind the regimental staff marched
the battalions in command of Major
“Dynamite Mike’ Kelly, Major Martin
Meany, Major Van S. Merle-Smith and
Major Henry A. Boots. In their midst
flew the tattered battle flag of the
Sixty-ninth, its shell torn remnants
carefully stitched together that the Man-
hattan breezes might damage it no more
and beside it the blue.silk regimental
ensign.
| That tattered flag told the story of the
! Sixty-ninth, as well as did the third
| standard, the red and white silk service
flag with its 639 gold stars, each repre-
senting a man who fell. The national
ensign, supposed to fly before regimental
‘headquarters, safe from fire, had led the
{men over the top, and, as its guard said,
many a shell fragment went through it
at regimental headquarters too, for the
regimental commanders of the Sixty-
ninth all had a habit of pushing their
; headquarters as far toward the front as
they could go.

There was one familiar figure missing
from the parade. That. was the famous
dog of Father Duffy, Dis Donc, heroofa
half dozen chances himself. Father Duffy
was against making Dis Donc march the
long, hard asphalt route, and it was only
when the cathedral was :eached that the
regiment discovered he had not been left
out of the programme entirely. Far
from it, he occupied a place of honor in
the Archbishop's grand etand.

Through Charles street the regiment
got an enthusiastic welcome from the
Charles street police station and from
{the men of Hook and Ladder No, 2, who
jhad roliéd their truck Into the street and
}manned the siren and the gongs as the
'ban@ blared by with “Killarney.”

Dr. Joseph A.’ Blake and Mrs. Blake,
formerly Mra. Clarence H, Mackay, who
were married in Paris !n 1914, and who,

according to a report current then, had
determined to make thelr home in
France permanently, returned to the
United States yesterday. They were
accompanied by thelr three children, all
of whom were born in Paris. Dr, Blake
and his wife will rest for a month or
80, and then will establish their per-
manent home here and the physician
will resume practice as a surgeon.

“There is no secret about what I in-
tend to do,” Dr. Blake sald yesterday.
“Mrs, Blake and I have come back after
more than four years of steady work
abroad to make our home here. We
have rented a house at Newnort and as
Soon a8 we are able to engage the ne-
cessary servants we will go there and
rest for a while. I have had only two
weeks of Vacation in four years.

“In about a month from now I expect
to make definite arrangements for going
back into active ‘practice. I don’t ex-
pect to associate myself with other sur-
geons or with an institution. I will
either become an active operating sur-
geop again or a consultant. The choice
will depend entirely on whether or not,
after I have rested up, I find that I
have the energy for operative work.”

The Blakes passed most of their time
abroad at Neuillly and Paris. Dr. Blake,

signed after multitudinous conferences

country and France, and with so much

Mackays Get Divorces in France.

The French court granted a mutual
divorce to the Mackays, awarding each
a decree after allegations of abandon-
ment on each side. Within twenty-four
hours of the signing of the decree Dr.
Blake and Mrs. Mackay were married.
They interrupted the course of their war
work only for a few hours on the day
of their marriage. She was engaged in

was open to doubt in a number of minds

people who know him best in New York,

AVERAGE WAGE U
13 CENTS IN MONTH

Factory Worker in N. Y. State
Averages $22.20.

ALBANY, April 28.—The decline in
wage volume, which began in New York
State in December, came to’a halt in
March, when the aggregate amount of

wages paid factory workers increased
slightly over the amount reported. for
February, so it was announced by the
Stato Industrial Commission to-day. -

Six of the eleven groups into which
the manufacturers of the State are clas-
sified reported increased payments for
wages. The most conspicuous advances
were 7 percent. each in the stone, clay,
glass and clothing industries. The lat-
ter has shown a continuous Increase in
its pay rolls for the last four tnonths.
Contrary to the usual trend at this sea-
son the volume of business in women's
underwear showed a decline in March,
thus bringing about a reduction in wage
volume.

The average weekly earning of New
York State factory employees in March
was $22.20, an increase of 13 cents over
the average of February but 98 cents
less than the record wage of December,
1918. The average weekly earnings
show a considerable range in various In-
dustries. At the bottom of the scale
are textiles and clothing, with averages
of $15.86 and $19.02 respectively. In
the metals Industries—-the dominant in-
dustrial division of the State—the
weekly average for March was $25.43.

TAMMANY SEEKING
MORE JOBS IN CITY

Inroads on the Civil Service
List Contemplated.

 

 

 

 

Vigorous opposition is to be made to
an attempt on the part of the Municipal
Civil Service Commission of Mayor Hy-
lan to wring some more patronage out of
the city’s departments by placing in the
exempt class places that are under the
protection of the Civil Service.

A start has been made by the exemp-
tion of six places and the State Civil
Service Commission has been asked to
approve the action of the city commis-
sion, without which {t will be of no effect.
Representatives of the Civil Service Re-
form Association, of which Samuel H.
Ordway is president, and others will op-
pose the application at a public hearing
to be held by the State Commission in
the rooms of the local commission in the
Municipal Bullding at 2 o'clock to-mor-
row. afternoon.

The positions in question are those of
confidential inspector in the Department
of Charities, cashier in the Department
of Pubfke Works, office of the Borough
President of Manhattan; confidential in-
spector in the Department of Public
Markets, supervisor of female employees
{n the Department of Education, secre-
tary to the advisory board in the De-
partment of Education and especial ex-
am.per in the Finance Department.

It is felt by the advocates of clvil
service reform that the attion taken on
these_six positions is simply a “feeler”
to try out the atttude of the State Com-
mission. If these places are exempted,
others will be taken out of the civil
service, {t 1s feared. There are some|
fortv places In the Finance Department, |
whieh were put under the protection of
the civil service in the Mitchel admini- |
stration and on which Tammany has
had envious eyes since it came back into
power. For weeks there has been a re-
port that a drive was to be made to
get these jobs for the faithful.

 

English Wire Service Affected. |

The British. Administration reported
yesterday to the Commercial Cable
Company that all wires between Eng-
land and the continent were interrupted.
Traffic was circulating by post.

PRIVATE OWNERS TO
GET ALL WIRE LINES

Continued from First Page.

 

‘Government control, @eclined, however,
to suggest exactly what sort of legisla-
tion would be necessary. Republicans in
Congress have made no secret of their
intention at the forthcoming extra ses-
sion to press for the immediate return of
the service to private management,
Leaders in this movement have asserted
that in so doling they would endeavor to
protect the companies’ interests.

By proclamation of the President
the entire wire service, with the ex-
ception of cable lines, was taken over
by the Government on July 31, 1918,
and placed under the direction of the
Post Office Department. The proclama-
tion as to cable control, as shown by
Post Office Department files, was
signed by the President on November
2, but no annoyncement as to this ac-
tion was made” until after the signing
of the armistice on November 11.

Taking over of the cable systems
was followed by a controversy between
the Postmaster-General and Clarence
H. Mackay, president of the Commercial
Cable Company, which resulted in the
dismissal of Mr. Mackay by Mr. Burle-
son,

Further controversy involved the
Postal Telegraph Company, when offi-
clals of that company objected to the
Postmaster-General's plan to amalga-
mate the Postal Company with the
Western Union, As a result of the
controversy Mr. Burleson diemissed
from Government service Edward Rey-
nolds, vice-president and general man-
ager of the Postal Company, and A. B.
Richards, general superintendent of the
Postal Company's Pacific coast division.

Many Controversies Caused.

Orders issued by the Postmaster
Genera! providing for a nation wide in-
crease in telephone and telegraph rates
resulted in additional controversies and
legal action in a number of States,
from some of which suits have been
appealed to the United States Supreme
Court. The Postoffice Department was
called upon recently to settle a strike
of telephone operators In New England,
and members of the Commercial
Telegraphers’ Union of America com-
pleted yesterday the canvass of a strike
vote.

The land wire systems under Govern-
ment control were under the direction
of the Wire Control Board with First
Assistant Postmaster General Koons in
charge of organization and administra-
tion, The cable lines have been under
the direct control of Newcomb Carlton,
president of the Western Union Com-
pany.

Proceedings involving the right of the
Postmaster General to take over control
of both the cable and land line systems
are now pending in the Supreme Court.
The effect of the turning back of the
systems upon pending cases was a sub-
ject upon which officials refused to com-
ment to-night, although it is believed
that the proposed prompt return of the
cable systems will render a decision by
the court unnecessary. Arguments in
the cable cases were heard early this
year.

Arguments in cases arising from the
Postmaster General's order increasing
rates are to be heard by the court next
Monday The cases resulted in appeals
from South Dakota and Massachusetts
court decrees, although similar actions
have been begun in about twenty-one
States,

 

ASKS POSTAL’S RETURN NOW.

Mackay Can See No Reason Why
Burleson Should Delay.

Clarence H. Mackay, president of the
Cable-Postal Telegraph

| system, gave out the following statement

last night:

“The Supreme Court of the United
State has not yet decided the appeal
taken by the Commercial Cable Com-
pany against Postmaster-Genera!l Burle-
son, in which that company questioned
the legality of taking over these cables
five days after the armistice wag signed.
As a matter of fact Mr. Burleson can-
not turn anything back in the way of
cables. He hae never really had pos-
session of the cable.and has not oper

 

 

ated them nor even controlied then.
The British Government forbade his ev;
trolling them so far as the British end
were concerned and that meant abort
four-fifths of the distance covered
the cables,

“Why doesn't Mr. Burleson turn ba

the Postal Telegraph, lines?) That
what the public want, and there is
earthly reason why he should hold «
to those lines. He needs no additions
legislation as far as we are concer!

We are willing to take what our |
earned during the period of Governn
contral. If he wants to hold on to +
Western Union lines and the tele;
lines until he secure. legislation to help
them out, let him do so, but that is no
reason why he should hold on to our
lines.

“We want our lines back to give good
service to the public and preserve our
organization and do a few other inter-
esting things. Such a flasco as has re-
sulted from Mr. Burleson's control of
the cables, telegraphs and telephones ‘s
without parallel in the history of this
country.”

 

WIill Resist Burleson Rates.

Lovisvitug, Ky., April 28.—Mavyor
George Welssinger Smith to-day an-
nounced the city would resist ost-
master-General Burleson's order increas-
ing local rates for the Home Telephone
Company and that the right of the city
to remove its poles and wires from the
streets wae being investigated.

PERSHING JUST LIKE
ORDINARY FATHER

Sailor Gave Him Tip That Son
Was Aboard.

 

M. J. Walsh, an overseas secretary of
the Knights of Columbus, returned to
the United States yesterday with the
story of the meeting between Gen. John

J. Pershing and his son, Warren, who

went across with Secretary Baker of the
War Department, which Mr, Walsh wit-
nessed when the General boarded the
Leviathan at Brest.

Gen. Pershing did not know that his
son was coming to France, and it had
been intended to surprise him with the
boy when he came aboard the ship to
greet Secretary Baker. But a sailor
managed to say to the General as he
came aboard:

“Your eon is aboard, waiting for you.”

“Gen. Pershing forgot all about being
a soldier,” said Mr. Walsh. “He only
remembered thet he was a father. He
rushed hurriedly into the Captain's cabin
and grabbed the boy in his arms, while
Warren chattered about the ocean and
his epochmaking trip.”
