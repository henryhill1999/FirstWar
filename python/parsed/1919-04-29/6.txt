HE Victory Liberty Loan

is one of the most attrac-
tive investments ever offered
by the United States Gov-
ernment.

No other investment af-
fords the man of moderate
means such unequaled se-
curity with so high a rate of
interest as the 434% Victory
Notes.

You cannot afford not to
invest—just as largely as your
circumstances warrant.

Go to your bank to-day—
and borrow to the full extent

of your ability to meet the
obligation.
There are 355 banks and
branches conveniently located in

all sections of the city. They are

all open to you for Victory Loan,

purposes.

Many banks have pledged
themselves to make loans to
subscribers on United States
Government Victory Notes
for 90 days, with one renewal
for a similar period, at 434%,
which is the same rate of in-
terest as that paid by the Gov-
ernment. ‘Such loans will not
interfere with any borrower's
regular line of credit.
