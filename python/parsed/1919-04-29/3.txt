Franklin Assures Them of
Full Allotment—Rainbow

A gain of $13,394,450 in subscriptions
for the Victory Liberty Loan was offi-
elally recorded yesterday for New York
City. This brings the total as an-
nounced by the Federal Reserve Bank
up to $156,242,050 or 15.6 per cent. of
the city’s quota of $1,000,561,600.

The quota for the New York district
=the Second Federal Reserve—includ-
ing with New York State part of New
Jersey and Fairfield County, Connecti-
cut, is $1,350,000,000. Of this total only
$201,369,850 or what amounts to 149
per cent. had been subscribed when the
official figures were announced yester-
day. The day’s gain for the district
Was $21,341,700,

The figure of $156,242,050 announced
for Greater New York to date is against
the estimated total of $333,520,550 that
should have been subscribed if the loan
drive were making average headway.
The country wide subscriptions an-
nounced officially last night stood at
$839,479,900 or 18.65 per cent. of the
$4,500,000,000 sought. At the present
rate approximately $100,000,000 a day
Will Wave to be subscribed for the re-
maining days of the drive if the objec-
tive is to be reached.

Several Millions Are Too Late.

Two subscriptions of $1,000,000 each,
three of $500,000 and one of $475,000,
together with several hundred smaller
contributions, can be added to yester-
day’s total, but the exact amount will
not be available until tabulations are
completed. In addition to these a total
of $4,000,000 in round numbers was re-
Ported as the result of yesterday’s
Work by the Rainbow Division, composed
of the committees of the advisory
trades which are conducting their own
canvass among members of their respec-
tive businesses.

An indication of the way the progress
of the drive is regarded by the authori-
ties in Washington may be seen in an
announcement last night by Lewis B.
Franklin, director of the Government
loan organization. The statement, al-
though issued ag an assurance to small
subscribers that they would receive Vic-
tory notes to the amount of their paid
up subscriptions, even if it was found
necessary to increase the amount of the
loan issue, also carried the suggestion
that the Treasury Department was
aware that it might be difficult for many
communities to achieve the proportion
of subscriptions they had turned in dur-
ing the four previous drives,

present drive will exceed a third of that
number. In other words, the smal) in-
vestor is not taking enthusiastically to
the Victory Notes, and the suggestion is

heard on every side that the banks and |?

industrial corporations, from whom large
subscriptions were expected to boom the
loan at the outset, are holding off. Two
reasons, the one divergently opposed to
the other, are given. The fret is that
banks are holding off to encourage popu-
lar support of the loan so that their own
credit for legitimate business extension
may be the more elastic, assuming the
banks will be asked ultimately to take up
the shortage. The other is that if pop-
ular support continues to lag each bank
may on application get a larger allot-
ment of a security that every banker
and financier admits may be carried for
four or five years to advantage.

Franklin’s Statement,

In his statement yesterday Director
Franklin said:

“The Secretary of the Troasury has
announced that the Victory LAberty
Loan will be Hmited to $4,500,000,000,
except as it may be necessary to in-
crease the amount of the issue in order
to make allotment in full on applica-
tions from subscribers for aggregate
amcunts of notes not in excess of $10,000
anw except as it may be necesgary to in-
crease or decrease the amount of the is-
sue in order to facilitate allotment

“While the Treasury Department ex-
pects every community to meet its
quota, some very decided changes in in-
dustrial conditions and even in popula-
tion have taken place since the end of
the last campaign, but it has not been
practical to recognize these changes in
the quotas assigned. It is therefore of
the utmost importance that every com-
munity make a determined effort to ob-
tain every available subscription and to
roll up a large oversubscription in order
that the loan in the entire country may
be an assured success. While it is cred-
itable for any community or district to
meet its quota, it is still more creditable
{fg that community or district can not
only do its share, but can he!p its less
fortunate neighbor.

“Remember this is the last Liberty
Loan. There is no reason for holding
back this time. The keynote of the cam-
paign should be distribution, in order
that the Victory notes may be purchased
and paid for by the people at large out
of their present or future savings and
the resources of the banks left clear to
provide credit for the operation of our
| Industries, to the end that labor may
jbe fully employed and prosperity in-
sured.”

Admiral Mayo Is Speaker.

Admiral Henry T., Mayo, commanding

the Atlantic fleet, using the sound ampli-
flers, but speaking from the platform,
eaid:
“We were on the job. Now the ques-
tion with us in the navy is: Are we going
to be on the job in relation to the Vic-
tory Loan? I believe we are. We have
a motto down tn Washington which says:
‘Match the Navy.’ Match up to the en.
deavors of the navy in this Victory
Loan.”

Rear Admiral Hugh Rodman delivered
this message:

“They have asked me to practise what
I preach. I don't like to go into my
Drivate affairs, but I will very gladly
subscribe $1,000.”

The subscription was written imme-
diately,

Rear Admiral C. P. Plunkett told the
crowd he had every dollar he owned ex-
cept his last month's pay in Victory
notes,

the organization if we are to accom-
plish our task within the time limita,

“From trustees and larger investors

j Who are familiar with the privileges of
| tax exemption, many inquiries are de-
veloping which unquestionably must re-
sult very soon in subscriptions to large
amounts.”

The Federal Reserve Bank yesterday
delivered $20,150,000 in 4% per cent.
coupon Victory notes to banks in various
parts of the Second Federal Reserve Dis-
trict for sale “over the counter.”

It was announced yesterday that ar-
Trangements had been made with the
War Department whereby every officer
and enlisted man may receive, on applica-
tion, a $50 Victory Note not as part of the
$60 bonus each gets on being discharged
from the army. The War Department
also will deliver notes to men who were
discharged before the bonus plan was
adopted. The remaining $10 will be paid
by check.

Demonstrations of the loud speaking
telephones and long distance radio tele-
phone service were given under the di-
rection of the American Telephone and
Telegraph Company, the Western Flec-
tris Company and the New York Tele-
phone Company at Victory Way yester-
day afternoon.

From the standpoint of the telephone
and telegraph engineers the demonstra-
tion was a complete success. But there
were many in the crowd who thought
that it only served to demonstrate just
how bad New York city’s telephone ser-
vice really is.

Franklin D. Roosevelt, Assistant Sec-
retary of the Navy, was distinctly heard
by every one In the crowd wh rom his
office in Washington he appealed for the
success of the loan. Kut persons who
tried to communicate with their homes

is practically the first week's business.

Following this announcement from the
Treasury the Navy Department ordered
the Victory Ship Crane, an route from
San Francisco to New York, to proceed
to latitude 22% degrees north. This
brings the Crane, whose progress is
determined by the amount of loan sub-
scriptions, to a point about 700 miles
south of the Mexican border and 1,000
miles from San Francisco, By nautical
calculation the ship is far behind her
schedule if she is to reach New York
a week from Saturday.

The proportion of the loan already
subscribed is a fraction of 1 per cent.
greater than that raised for a corre-
sponding perlod of the last loan. The
Treasury Daily Review to-day said:

“This looks rather discouraging for
the Victory Loan, and the most hope-
ful sign connected with the situation
ia that some of the remote districts are
slow in reporting their sales to head-
quarters. This is particularly true in
the Atlanta district.”
