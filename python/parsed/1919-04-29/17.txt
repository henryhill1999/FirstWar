6 SAILORS DROWN [KILLS WOMAN

AS LAUNCH 1S SUNK

Tender of Destroyer Bell Cut
in Two by Bow of the
Henley.

 

 

TEN OTHERS PICKED UP

 

Men Were Returning From
Shore Leave—Fleet Begins
Its Departure.

 

Five sallors are belleved to have been
drowned in the Hudson River early yes-
terday morning by the sinking of a
motor launch from the U. 8S. S. destroyer
Bell. They were Dennie J. O'Connell,
second class seaman, of the Bell, from 13
Cherry street, Derby, Conn; Enrique
Gulopa, a Fillpino cabin steward, of the
same boat; Firemen William P. Otlfver
of Lucien, Mississippi, and Carl Bedell of
1045 Alabama street, San Francisco, and
Seaman John F. Quinn of 8t, Louis, all
of the destroyer Harding. None of the
bodies has been recovered,

The belief that the last three named
perished is based upon testimony of
Radio Operator Fleming of the Harding,
who was in the wrecked motor boat.
Fleming was picked out of the water
half an hour after the accident, and he
sald he had seen both Oliver and Bedell
In the boat. He was uncertain about
Quinn, but said he had seen him on the
pier. Quinn's shipmates are convinced
he must have gone down with Oliver and
Bedell, for he failed to report back from
his Sunday shore leave. He had never

overstayed a leave before, they said. He
was 20 years old.

Inquiry Is Begun.

For the purpose of fixing the blame
for the accident, if there is any, Rear
Admiral Robertson, commander of the
second destroyer squadron, attached to
the Atlantic fleet, held a court of in-
quiry yesterday afternoon in the cabin
of the Bell. He questioned Coxswain
Cook, who had charge of the launch, and
nine other sailors who had been res-
cued from the icy waters. Commander
Charles S. Keller of the Bell sat with
him at the inquiry, which will be con-
tinued this morning.

According to the stories told by the
survivors, a motor launch. belonging to
the Bell put out from the plier at 128th
street at 2 o'clock in the morning, car-
Trying about fifteen men who were re-
turning to the ships after leave ashore.
In midstream, they said, the motor stalled
and the Jaunch was whirled in the swift
eurrent toward the battleship Missis-
sippl.

The 6mall craft succeeded in clearing
the big ship only to strike broadside on
the bow of the destroyer Henley, moored
near by. The sharp brow of the Henley
instantly cut the launch in two, sending
all of the occupants into the stream.

Sailors on watch on the Mississippi,
Henley and the destroyer Warren
sounded alarms. Boats were hastily

lowered and under the rays of search-
lights a bitter fight was made to save
the men, all of whom were badly chilled
by the temperature of the water.

Ten Men Are Picked Up.

Using boat hooks the rescuers were
able to get hold of the clothing of the
struggling men and drag ten of them
into the lifeboats. They then searched
the waters for the rest of the party
as long as there was any hope what-
ever of saving them. The survivors and
rescuers all sald the current was very

atrong and made all operations ex-
tremely difficult. They expressed the
opinion that the five missing sailors

Were so numbed by the cold as to un-
able to keep on the surface.

This occurrence cast gloom over a
visit that would otherwise have re-
mained one of the brightest of memories
io the men of the great visiting fleet.
he sailors are now preparing to leave
these waters, as Admiral Mayo has re-
turned to this city from Washington
with orders for their departure. Some
of the smaller craft already have left
the harbor, and the rest of the war-
shins are due to leave Thursday.

The War Camp Community Service
and associated organizations are doing
all in their power to Nghten the last
few hours which the men will have
ashore, and have arranged a series of
entertainments for the next forty-eight
hours. The officers of the fleet are to
be entertained this evening at a ball
at the Pershing Club, Madison avenue
and Forty-fourth street. One of the
last features of the visit will be a dance
tor the negro sailors to be held to-
night at the Central Casino, 154th street
and Eighth avenue.

ELKS AID SALVATION ARMY.

Offer Services #13,000,000
Home Service Fund Drive.

 

for

Bruce Campbell, grand exalted ruler
of the Benevolent and Protective Order
of Elks, came to town from St. Louis
yesterday to offer the aid of his organi-
zation to the Salvation Army in its com-

ing $13,000,000 Home Service Fund cam-
paigr In company with John K
Tener, former Governor of Pennsy!vania,
Mir, Campbell called upon former Gov-

ernor Whitman and Brig.-Gen. Cornelius
Vanderbilt, respectively national chair-
man and Greater New York chairman
of the drive, to place the Elks unreserv-
edly at the service of the Salvation
Army.

Mr. Campbell gaid he had written to
every one of the 1,300 lodges of Elks in
the country asking that the officers and
members hold themselves in readiness to
do anything asked by the local com-
mittees, “even to the extent of taking
the responsibility for putting the local
drives over the top.”

“The Elks had 69,000 members in the
war and 7,600 officers,” said former
Governor Tener. “We know from them
that the Salvation Army, of all the
elvilian agenciea undertaking war relief
work, came nearest to a perfect score.”

TWO CHILDREN DIE
IN KITCHEN FIRE

Bellevue Hospital Surgeon
Attempts to Rescue.

 

A baby carriage caught fire from a
#48 range in the nome of Mrs, Gertrude
Lazarus, on the sixth floor of 826 Kast
Thirty-fifth street, yesterday afternoon.
Her five-year-old daughter, Gertrude,
who was asleep in the vehicle, was
burned to death and Pauline Otto, an
idopted daughter, 3 months old, who
sas on the floor beside the carriage,

tn Bellevue Hospital.

Mrs. Lazarus was in her dining room
when she smelled smoke in the kitchen.
Hurrying in, she found the baby car-
riage in flarnes and ran screaming to
the street. Dr. E. W. McClave of Belle-
,ue Hospital was passing in an auto-
bile and he and his chauffeur, Frank
lorter, darted up the stairs of the Las-
arus apartment and put out the fire
with a pitcher of water. They were too

late to save the children,

WHEN HE

FALLS INTO PARADE CROWD

Delmonico Employee Leans Too Far Out of Window,

 

and Hurtles Down—Mortally Hurt as He
Crushes Spectator.

 

So dense was the crowd watching the
old Sixty-ninth Regiment swing up Fifth
avenue yesterday that Mra Grace Lafiin
Whitehead, widow of a Chicago mer-

chant, edged away from her daughter
and a travelling companion who were
standing with her on the sidewalk, be-

tween Forty-fourth and  Forty-fifth
streets. She hoped to find a better van-
tage point. Mrs. Whitehead was 65

years old, but managed to make her
way successfully to Forty-fourth street
and across to the sidewalk, just off the
avenue, where the press of parade
watchers was somewhat thinner.
Windows of the buildings nearby
and even the roofs were jammed with
howling spectators, who waved their
hands and shouted at the marching sol-
fiers. Mrs. Whitehead stood looking up
at some of these when Robert Proven-
zano, a bartender in Delmonico's, which
is on the Forty-fourth street corner,
lost his balance as he leaned out of a
fifth story window of the hotel.
Although hundreds of persons saw
Provenszano's body shoot through the air
and screamed a warning, Mrs. White-
head was unable to dodge out of ranga
of the falling man. His body struck her

 

 

YONKERS REFUSES
TO PAY EXTRA FARE

Even Alderman Declines to
Put Up Two Nickels.

Conductors on the cars of the Yonkers
Street Railway Company, a subsidiary
of the Third avenue system, had a busy
time yestegday when they began to col-
lect an extra nickel from each of the
20,000 passengers who ride daily from
Getty Square to the end of the subway
at 242d street. An ordinance passed by

the Yonkers Common Council a fort-
night ago authorizes the extra fare
from all who ride across the city line in
either direction. The company threat-
ened to abandon much of its service if
the measure was not passed.

George Carver, an electrician, living
at 27 Cliff street, boarded a car in Mount
Vernon and paid five cents. When the
city line was crossed he refused to pay
again. The conductor and motorman
held a council of war and called upon a
policeman, also a passenger, to arrest
Carver. The officer refused to interfere
Then the conductor and motorman lifted
Carver from his seat, carried him from
the car and stood him up on the sidewalk.
Carver says they twisted his wrist and
tore his coat and that he is going to sue
the company.

Thomas A. Brogan, Alderman from
the Sixth Ward in Yonkers, boarded a
car at the end of the subway but re-
fused to pay the second fare, even after
the conductor pointed out that he was a
member of the Common Council which
had authorized its collection. Alderman
Brogan defied the conductor to collect
the extra nickel and the latter permitted
him to ride unmolested to Getty Square
after an inspector of the company had

jadvised against open hostilities. About
twenty persons who refused to pay were
undisturbed by the conductors.

In one instance the crew of a car ran
it into the car barn because three pas-
sengers declined to either pay or leave
thelr seats. They were eventually in-
duced to leave by the persuasiveness of
a policeman.

 

 

MADE DEAD BROTHER HER HEIR

Mrs. Kuhl’s Mentality Questioned
on Peculfarity of Will.

When Mrs, Elizabeth Kuhl,
in Brooklyn jn September, 1916, was in
her right mind she knew perfectly well
that her brother, Heinrich, had passed
away in Germany fifty years ago. Con-
sequently her action in drawing a will
leaving her estate of $50,000 to him
clearly indicates her mental irresponsi-
bility, according to an
vanged yesterday by Gertrude Duhniin
of 157 Forty-second street, Brooklyn;
before Justice Kapper in the Supreme
Court. Miss Duhnlin applied for an
order compelling Frederick Herbest,
temporary administrator, to turn over to
her all of the property and render an ac-
counting.

Miss Duhnlin told the court that Mrs.

 

argument ad-|

squarely and she crumpled up, dead.
Several other women standing near
Mrs, Whitehead were knocked down as
the body caromed off, but they were not
hurt. Provenzano's skull was fractured,
he was injured internally and his legs
were broken. He was taken to Bellevue
Hospital, where the surgeons said last
night he has littie chance to recover.

Mrs. Whitehead was staying with her
daughter, Mrs. Edward Shummay, also
of Chicago, and Miss Ryan, Mrs. White-
head's travelling companion, at the Man-
hattan Hotel. They came here from
Chicago about ten days ago, because
Mrs. Whitehead desired to visit relatives
and participate in the welcome being
given to homecoming troops.

Her cousin, Mrs. Alfred 8. Laflin,
lives at 930 Park avenue, and she has 2
brother, Louis Laflin, whose home is in
Princeton, N. J. She was born in Pitts-
field, Mass, but lived in Chicago most
of her life. Her home there was in 83
Bellevue place, and she was active in
charity work. Her body was taken first
to the Bast Fifty-first street police sta-
tion, and later to the Morgue, where it
was claimed by Mrs. Shummay last
night and prepared for shipment to Chi-
cago.

| BANDITS IN OFFICE

| Attack Besex Street Dealer
| and Loot Safe.

Two bandits assaulted Charles Fish-
|

 

 

bach, in his foreign exchange nnd ticket
office at 114 Essex street, yesterday and
got away with nearly $20,000 worth of
money and collateral. The sidewalk
was thronged at the time of the robbery.

Fiehbach had just reached his estab-
Mshment about 8:30 o'clock and had
opened his safe and was arranging some
Liberty bonds and coins in his window
when aman wearing @ soldier’a overcoat
and a soft hat entered. The stranger

offered for sale a cuupon book of the
Third Liberty Loan, u
been paid, but Fishbac?
chase it.

Then, according to Fishbach, the man
levelled a pearl handled revolver at him
while a second robber, who had just en-
tered, rushed toward the safe behind the
; counter, striking him over the head from
= with what he thinks was a, piece

n which $4 had
declined to pur-

of lead pipe. The two men rifled the
safe and then escaped, taking with
them a gold watch, $3,000 in cash, be-
tween $6,000 and $7,000 worth of Lib-
erty bonds, other securities and a quan-
tity of Russian rubles and War Savings
Stampe.

Fischbach told detectives from the
Clinton street station that one of the
bandits ran north and the other south.
He followed the one in the olive drab
overcoat up Essex street to Rivington,
east to Norfolk street, where the thief
darted into the hallway at 135 and dis-
appeared, escaping either over the roofs
of adjoining houses or over the back
yard fence. The second robber wore a
cap and a black overcoat, Fischbach told
the polke.

Dr. M, J. Katz of 122 Rivington street
took several stitches in the long gash
which the lead pipe had cut in Fisch-
bach’s scalp.

CHARGED WITH CONTEMPT

Lawyer’s Pursuit in Taxicab
Ends With New Incident
in Separation Suit.

 

James P, McDonald, a millionaire
contractor, who has built rallroade all
over North and South America, and
who has just completed a $7,000,000
deal in Hayti involving rafiroad and
sugar interests, received service of a
writ charging him with contempt of
court yesterday just as he was about
to sail for Europe on the steamship
Adriatic. The writ charges contempt
for failing to pay back alimony due to
his wife, Mrs. Edith McDonald of 362
Wadsworth avenue, from whom he was
separated in 1913, and to whom the
courts awarded $400 a month alimony.

‘The arrest of Mr. McDonald was a
result of the vigilance of Edward H.
Burger of Burger & Burger, attorneys
for Mrs. McDonald, who had been try-
ing to serve the writ on the contractor
ever since it was issued last autumn.
Mr. Burger said last night that al-
though Mr. MeDonald maintained apart-
ments here in the Waldorf and the
Prince George hotels, he always came
to New York on Sundays and other
| times when service was impossible. The
attorney kept track of his movements,
however, and when he learned yester-
day that the contractor was to sail on
the Adriatic he kept a close watch on
the passport bureau. Mr. McDonald got
his passports at 1 o'clock and went im-
mediately to the steamship in a taxi-
cab.
Mr.

 

Burger's agents kept him in-
formed, and on the contractor's heels
followed a taxicab bearing the law-
yers and Deputy Sheriff Eisenstein.
They reached the pier about fifteen
minutes after Mr. McDonald got there
and found that the contractor had gone
aboard the ship. The vessel] was searched
and Mr, McDonald taken from his state-
room to the wharf, where the Deputy
Sheriff served the writ on him.

While this was being done, and Mr.
McDonald was arguing with the Deputy,
Mr. Burger hastened to court and got
another order for Mr. McDonald to
show cause why he should not be pun-
ished for failure to pay Mrs. McDonald
the $4,800 back alimony, said to be due
her. Mr. McDonald finally was al-
lowed to sail after he had paid to the
Deputy Sheriff $2,500 in cash, and had
telephoned to George Evalenke, a
banker, of 111 Broadway. He told Mr.
Burger that if he and Mrs. McDonald
would call upon Mr. Evalenke to-day
the banker would pay all back alimony
due and would keep up the payments
while he was away.

Mr. McDonald has many railroad and
other interests in various parts of the
world, and recently has been engaged
with New York bankers in arranging
for the construction of a railfoad and
sugar refineries in Hayti. He was the
first man to penetrate the plains of
Ecuador with a railroad project and
bullt the $25,000,000 railroad across the
Andes Mountains Accomiing to Mrs.
McDonald's attorney he owns valuable
property in Knoxville, Tenn., and estates
in New York and other States. Mrs
McDonald was the widow of George
{| Delacey Evans and was married to Mr.
McDonald in 1902.

The separation proceedings were
heard by Justice Gavegan in the Su-
preme Court and a decree was awarded
to Mrs. McDonald with $400 a month
alimony. According to her lawyers
this alimony was not paid until about a
year ago when Mr. McDonald was ar-
| rested at the Hotel Aberdeen in New

| York and paid $18,000 alleged to be due!

| his wife. Mr. Burger asked that the
contractor be put under bond to keep
up the payments, and a bond of $5,000
was directed, which Mr. Kurger says
the contractor never produced. Last
autumn the writ charging contempt of
Court was issued by Justice Delehanty,
but Mr. Burger was not able to serve
{t until yesterday.

 

Kuhl, who was over 70 years old and| care for his mother, Mrs. Anna Devine. |

who lived alone, promised to treat her
as a daughter and leave her all of her
‘property. In return, Miss Duhnlin
agreed to care for Mrs. Kuhl as long as
ehe lived, Miss Duhnlin asserts that be-
fore Mrs. Kuhn died her mind became
clouded and she executed the will which
bequeathed her estate to her dead
brother,

SPECIALIST CALLED
TO ATTEND GOMPERS

Son and Brcther of Labor
Leader Summoned.

 

Dr, Charles A. Peck, a specialist at-
tached to the staff of Roosevelt Hoygpital,
was called in consultation yesterday in
the case of Samuel (iompers, president
of the .American Federation of Labor,
who was badly hurt Sunday afternoon
when a surface car struck a taxicab in
which he was riding at Broadway and
Forty-first street. Two trained nurses
are in constant attendance upon the la-
bor leader, and his son, Alexander J.
Gompers, and his brother, Henry Gom-
pers, also were summoned yesterday.
Mr. Gompers's wife is seriously ill in
Washington and could not be informed
of the seriousness of her husband's con-
dition.

Despite the optimistic statements given
out in regard to Mr. Gompers's condi-
tion attention was directed last night to
the fact that, taken in connection with
his advanced age, two broken ribs and
internal injuries have led Mr. Gompers's
friends to regard his condition as more
than ordinarily serious. In a statement
{siven out by Dr, Peck and Dr. Charles
R. Hancock, Mr. Gompers’s regular phy-
siclan, it was sald that while his condi-
tion is serious, there is nothing to cause
alarm at this time.

Telegrams expressing sympathy were
received at the Continental Hotel, where
Mr. Gompers is confined, from Lord
Reading, British Ambassador, and Will-
fam B, Willison, Secretary of Labor.
Hundreds of Mr, Gompers's friends
called at the hotel yesterday, The only
one who was permitted to see him was
Frank Morrison of the Federation of
labor, Among others who called were
Major August Belmont. George W.
Wickersham and Cornelius Vanderbilt.
Held as Holdup Suspect.

of the Guf of Mexico, where at
times the sea rolls over the whole

on iron piles ten feet above the
surface.

Two men and their little fam-

at the lighthouse, one hundred
feet high, where the revolving
oil lamps, flashing the flood of
light far away over the roaring
sea are visible sixteen miles
from the shore.

With sleepless vigilance;

A Wrap Like

A Gorgeous Orchid

has been designed for sum-
mer evenings, of pale orchid
taffeta; it is gathered on to
a straight band of deep ma-
genta taffeta, a magenta taf-
feta forms a great soft en-
veloping collar that fastens
with a Pierrot pompon of
magenta silk. But the as-
tonishing note—the touch
that gives the wrap its
fragile, flower-like quality—
is a floating back panel—
almost a cape—of the orchid
taffeta painted with great
designs of tropical and fan-
tastic flowers in shades of
orchid, mulberry, and green.
Price $200.

Simplicity to new |

| pleated frock

Georgette crepe—
$39.50

|
{

Two inch pleats—the most |
effective width—are at even |
intervals from the waist to |
the hem of this altogether |
charming dress. Bodice is
pleated, too; the lower pleat |
extends below the waistline |
and gives the effect of an |
overblouse; of course, the |
loose flowing sleeves are |
bordered with pleats. ‘
But the secret of the beauty

of this dress is really the silk
foundation—as it is of a per-

fectly harmonious contrasting
color—rose, beige or French
blue. The Georgette crepe is

navy blue.

We consider this one of |
the best semi-dress frocks

.of the season.

$30, only, for a
golf suit from
England

We consider them worth
$50, as far as cloth, color,
cut, and tailoring are con-
cerned. But we got them
cheap, because the man who
ordered them couldn’t pay
for them. And the makers
preferred to take a loss
rather than go to the trouble
and expense of shipping
them back to England.

Coat and knickers in gray
brownish mixtures. Coat is
full, with sewed-on -belt in
back (placed just where it
belongs), two great bellows
pockets, two inside breast
pockets and a small change
pocket. Knickers have but-
toned cuffs.
