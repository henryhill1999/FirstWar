Special Despatch to Taw Sey. «
WASHINGTON, April 28.—First Chief
Carranza of Mexico has apparently al-
ready begun his campaign of anti-
American sniping which Latin Amert-
can diplomats have predicted would be-

petual peace as a national policy. Re-
ports received to-day by the State De-
partment state that an American
schooner, the Cape Horn, has been
seized in the territorial waters of Mex-
ico, near Vera Cruz, and taken to that
port. No explanation whatever has yet
been received of this apparent violation
of American rights Immediate inquiry
will go to Mexico trom the State De-
partment here.

It is learned here that Mexico, Costa
Rica and the Dominican Republic are
seething with anti-Americanism as a
result of the League of Nations covenant
branding them as unfit hy leaving them
out. None of these Governments want
to join the league, it js sald, but the
public affront given their Peoples by the
omission of their names will serve as an
hate toe "tne arene anti-American

y fin convenient to n -
petrate. ae ge

Carranza is understood to he delib-
erately planning an anti-American cam-
paign if possible to enhance his shaky
prestige with his own people.

WasHINGaToN, April 28.—The State
Department was advised to-day of the
seizure of the American fishing schooner
Cape Horn by the Mexican authorities
on the ground that she carried muni-
tions for revolutionists,

The schooner, which hailed from Gal-
veston, was captured in Mexican terri-
torial waters, according to the advices,
and taken to Vera Crus, where she is
Deing held.

Formal charges have not been pre-
ferred, but the State Department is
making official inquiries into the reasons
for the seizure.

Refusal by Mexico to recognize the
financial clause of the armistice terms
by which Germany pledged herself to
the Allies not to dispose of any of her
stocks in specie or any of her foreign
title deeds or bonds abroad, whether in
the possession of the Government, banks
or private individuals or companies, {s a
eubject of discussion in Paris, it was
learned to-day at the State Department.
Any action taken im the matter will be
for the present directed py the represen-
tatives of the associated Governments
and not by the United States on its own
Initiative. Action. of some kind, how-
ever, is looked for as soon as the peace
treaty {s out of the way.

Mexico made known her attitude in
a reply to M. F. de Jean, French Charge
@’Affaires, who, in the name of the
French Government, warned the Mexi-
can Government of the determmation
of the Allies: not to permit Germany
to profit in any way by the sale of
securities ani thus cheat the Allies of
part of the damage indemnification that
Was to be demanded of Germany. This
was to by Germany in signing
the armistice terms, but the Carranza
Government replied that action on the
part of Mexico in preventing any such
sales would violate the terms of a treaty
between Mexico and Germany and that
the Mexican Government would not ac-
cede to the request of the Allies.

A similar reply was made to the

French Government when the same
warning was conveyed to Mexico re-
garding Austro-Hungarian financial
holdings.

It is believed in official circles here
that this attitude of the Carranza Gov-
ernment was partly responsible for the
failure of the French Government to
receive Alberto J. Pani as Minister to
France, and for the exclusion of Mexico
for the present from the League of Na-
tions,

BELA KUN WAILS AS

Geneva, April 28.—The Rumanian at-
tacks on the Hungarian Red Army con-
tinue successfully according to des-
patches from Budapest, especially in the
“northern sector.

Bela Kun, the Hungarian Foreign
Minister, in a speech. lamented the fact
that his troops are offering feeble re-
sistance, though commanded by profes-
sional officers pressed into service.

Bela Kun, the despatches add, is con-

Europe by and of commandeered funds,

 

 

 

Zuricn, April 28.—An anti-Commun-
ist uprising In Fueles, Hungary, near
Sopron (Odenburg), west of Budapest,
began on April 10 and ended a few
days later with the putting to death ofa
priest on false charges and the imposi-
tion of prison sentences on fifteen others
accused of participation in the revolt.
This news has just been received from
Vienna, having been held up by the rigid
censorship at Budapest.

The revolt began among the peasants,
who defeated a Red army force sent
from Sorron. Reenforcements finally
enabled the troops to suppress the re-
volt. The Communist Government im-
mediately sent revolutionary judges to
Fueles to punish the rebels.

The tribunal caused the arrest of all
the young men of Fueles, and from
them selected twelve of the wealthiest.
They were told they would be shot un-
less they betrayed the name of the real
leader of the uprising. After confer-
ring among themselves the young men,
ft is reported, unanimously denounced
the Rev. Anthony Szedeniker, a Catholic
priest, as the “intellectual originator.”
The trial of the priest lasted less than
an hour and there were no witnesses ex-
cept the young men. He was condemned
«nd shot a half hour later.

Work Available for Anzacs.

Metsourns, Australia, April 28.—A
bi-State scheme of public works con-
struction, involving an expenditure of
almost $12,506,000 ahd offering ample
employment to returned Anzacs, has
been approved by a joint commission
from the States of Victoria and New
South Wales.

BOLSHEVIKI DRIVEN

Natidnal Assembly Forms at
Olonetz After Victory by
Volunteer Troops.

 

Hexsinorors, April 28.—A National
Assembly has been formed at Olonetz,
110 miles northeast of Petrograd, where
the Finns have driven out the Bolshe-
viki. The town was captured, according
to reports, by volunteer troops.

The newspapers report to-day that
Finnish volunteers on Saturday cap-
tured the town of Lotinanpolto, on the
White Sea. The town is an important
strategic point, being the junction of
numerous roads and the railway be-
tween Petrograd and the Murman coast,
which is now closed to the Bolsheviki. |
It is assumed that the Bolsheviki tor-!
pedo boat flotilla at Lotinanpolto was |
unable to escape owing to the ice. |

RAYNHAM HELD BY WINDS

Stands by Machine All Day—
Encouraging Reports Come
From Midsea.

 

 

Sr. Joun’s, N. F., April 28.—Only a
cross wind, sweeping at twenty-five miles
an hour from the southeast to-day, pre-
verted a “hop off’’ in the transatlantic
flight of Capt. Frederick P, Raynham in
his Martinsyde seaplane from Mount
Pearl Plateau :

The British aviator and his naviga-
tor, Capt. Charlies W. F. Morgan, stood

by their craft for three hours ready to
start, but abandoned hope at dusk, when
it became certain that landing on the
“other side,’ figuring on a twenty-four
hour crossing, would have to be made
in darkness.

Raynham probably will get aff to-mor-
row, as weather conditions are still hold-
ing good and predictions are that the
wind will swerve.

Harry Hawker's big Sopwith plane
was not in readiness, as the Australian
aviator and his navigator, Commander
McKenzie Grieve, spent most of the
afternoon in their alrdrome at Quidividi
testing out a new propeller and warmmg
up the engine.

The wind, which was unfavorable for
Raynham at Mount Peart, would have
made possible a start for Hawker had
he been ready for flight. Hawker and
Grieve returned quickly to their hangar
from a motor trip when they heard that
Raynham was waiting for an opportu-
nity to “hop off.”

pressure over areas at sea where here-
tofore low pressure has been a serious
obstacle. Although not conclusive they
contained indications of probable !m-
provement which the Martinsyde crew
was quick to seize upon.

Capt. Morgan had said Raynham and
he would try to make the "big hop" to-

ay, even going so far as to set the
starting time. Those in close touch with
Hawker said to-night that he was tak-
ing every precaution against being

forces commanded by Gen.
have been pressing southward along the |
Murmansk railway and were last re-|
ported approaching Povienetz, at the
northern end of Lake Onega. From,
Povienets the Murmansk railway swings
westward and before it reaches the
southeastern edge of Lake Ladoga, it
comes within a few miles of Olonetz.

A Stockholm report Sunday said that
a revolt had broken out in Olonetz, and
it is possible that the Bolshevik force
facing Gen. Maynard may be cut off
if the anti-Bolsheviki advance from
Olonetz. If the Murmansk railway line!
can be cleared as far south as Olonetz,
the Allies will be in position to outflank
the Bolsheviki south of Archangel, who
also are threatened by the Siberian ad-
vance in the Viatka region.

 

CoPENHAGEN, April 28.—A despatch
received here from Reval, Russia, says
there has been a big fire tn the town
of Narva, eighty-one miles southwest
of Petrograd. The conflagration was
sta'ied by a bombardment of the town
by the Bolsheviki. Hundreds of houses
were burned and 5,000 persons are home-
less.

 

Narva, which lies near the Gulf of
Finland on the Narova River, has a pop-
ulation of some 20,000. There are nu-
mercus textile works in the town and |
there is a considerable trade in fish. The |
priv.cipal buildings are the Cathedral,

ATLANTA VOTES TO STRIKE. |

Telegraph Operators Also Demand
Burleson’s Removal.

ATLANTA, Ga., April 29.—That teleg-

nationwide strike was indicated by the
announcement that of the 475 votes cast
in the official canvass by the executive
committee of the commercial telegra-
phers union in Atlanta district yes-
terday not one was registered against
the proposition.

The operators of the Western Union and
Postal companies voted on the strike
in the general referendum and the vote
of the telephone workers will be taken
in time to be included in the national
canvass on May 6. The Atlanta wire
workers have adopted resolutions de-
manding the removal of Postmaster-
Genera! Burleson.

 

Everything was in readiness in the big
Martinsyde. The cockpit was well
stocked with rations, water and signal
lights, virtually the only supplies to be
carried, and the electrically heated fly-
ing clothes of the crew were alongside
ready to be slipped on at a moment's
notice.

This was announced officially yester-

Four of those selected &re Naval Re-
serve men, one Lieut. Stone, a coast
guard officer, and the ten others regular
navy men. In addition these three men,

neers, men capable of acting either aa

“The flight by the three naval flying
boats will go ahead notwithstanding the
success or failure of any other attempts
before the start,” said Commander
Towers. “The time schedule planned is
liberal as far as Newfoundland, as the
navy does not regard the trip to that
island as part of the transocean flipht.

impores an undue strain on the engines.

“The amount of time spent'at New-
foundland will depend upon whether the
start from Rockaway is made on sched-,
ule. We may remain a week or more at
Newfoundland. The time we take 0:
on the actual flight has been fixed since
February 24, but I cannot announce it
now. It was necessary to settle some
day because of the fact that the de-
stroyers and other vessels must be at
their stations. The route to Newfound-
land will be patrolled to a Iimited ex-
tent by destroyers.”

NC-38 Does Well in Test.

Towers said that tests of the NC-3,
which was up again yesterday morning,
have demonstrated her ability to fly
under the full load. These tests will be
repeated on the NC-4, which will prob-
ably slide into the water and lift into
the air for the first time to-day, and on
the NC-1, which established the repu-
tation of the NC boats, but which is
now being refitted with four engines.
The NC-1 will be ready the last of this
week or the first of next. The start
from Rockaway will probably be made
some time during the latter part of next
week.

The British Government has furnished
and will continue to furnish meteoro-
logical informatton concerning condi-
tions in and around Newfoundland.
The harbor in NewYoundland, whose lo-
cation has not yet been announced, was
also obtained after negotiations with the
Government. No base will be estab-
lished on shore, as this would be too
costly. Instead the seaplanes will be
moored {n sheltered waters with a sup-
ply ship standing by alongside to fur-
nish gasolene, oil and oiner supplhes.

Towers refused
commit himself on the
report that the navy 1s flying to
the Azore#& only because its Planes can-
not make the distance to Ireland.

“I cannot disclose the route,’ he said,
“You must draw your own conclusions.”

Questioned about the flight to the first
stopping place, actually the Azores, al-
though officially a deep secret, Com-
mander Towers said:

“It's a good long filght, but we can
make it under average conditions with-
out depending upon good luck, and
without meeting bad luck. The attempt
of Harry Hawker, whom I know per-
sonally, is sincere, but it is purely a

yes-

| gamble.

Commander Towers started for Wash-
ington last night, and will be back at
the Brockaway station to-morrow to give

out some details of the filght.

The NC planes have a wing spread of
126 feet, a height of 24% feet, a length
of 68 feet and a gap between the wings
varying from 12 to 1319 feet. The maxi-
mum speed—-a speed which cannot be
reached under full load—is ninety-five
miles an hour, and the landing speed
about fifty m les an hour. Commanders
H. C. Richardson and G. C. Westervelt,
both naval constructors and Curtiss en-
gineers, were the principal designers of
the craft.

Sixteen enlisted men, including four
chief petty officers, carried their dunnage
off the stat on yesterday. They will go |
to Plymouth, England. This would seem |
to-indicate that the filght of the NC |

ships may end in England instead of |
Portugal, as previously decided The

Berwin, April 28.—Government troops
have occupied the line of the Glonn
River and reached north of Munich,
Petershausen and Alterhausen and south
of Olt-Oetting and Neuvelting. The en-
circlement of the city ‘a proceeding, but
some days must elapse before a general
attack begins.

Premier Hoffmann, according to the
Zeitung Mittag, has held a council of
war at Ingolstadt with the War Minister
and Commander von Moehl, but the
Government is still hopeful of settling
the conflict peaceably by negotiation.

Gustave Noske, the German Minister
of Defence, has been appointed Com-
mander in Chief of all the Government
troops to operate against Munich. Ac-
cording to the War Minister of Wurt-
temburg both the Wurttemburg and Ba-
varlan Governments have agreed to this.

It is assumed that Noske will have
forces In action soon to put an end to
the delay through which Munich has
suffered so long.

The stcike movement In Silesia is in-
tensified, a ccording to a despatch to the
Vossische Zeitus.7 from Gleiwitz. There
is a general strike at Gleiwitz and vi-
cinity, it is said, and the upper Silesian
electric power stations have been closed.
The whole section is without electric
lights and the iron industry is serious-
ly affected, work being suspended in
many plants. The strike movement is
reported strong among railroad wor <ers.

A casual walk through the streets in
the neighborhood of Berlin police head-
quarters tends to show that there is no
exaggeration to the reports concerning
a’most open plundering in Berlin,
Within a stone's throw of police head-
quarters to-day a street hawker was
found offering for sale a shirt waist for
75 marks. It bore the trade mark of a
well known department store. Shoes
which are selling in the stores for 230
marks a pair were offered for 40 marks.
