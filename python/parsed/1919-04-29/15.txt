MAY PEPPER NOW

IN SPIRIT LAND, GREAT HELP T0 FUND;

Woman Who Conjured Up
“Little Bright Eyes” Is
Dead.

 

FLOURISHED AS MEDIUM

 

Brooklyn Seances Called Thou-
sands of the Curious to
Her Meetings.

Mrs. May 8S. Pepper-Vanderbilt, the
medium who was once a subject of
Spirited controversy, died Sunday in
Boston, “Little Bright Eyes” was the
name given by the medium to the sptrit

through whom she said she communi-
cated with the dead.

Mrs. Pepper-Vanderbilt exploited
spiritualism for many years, but her
flourishing period came between the
years 1905 and 1907 in Brooklyn. People
who were ‘willing to pay 25 cents for
admission thronged the meeting place,
the old Aurora Grata Cathedral, in
Bedford avenue on Sunday nights. Most
of these were devoted bellevers in the
medium’s powers; others were scoffers
whose interruptions made occasional
services take on the nature of a rough-
house amateur night at a cheap vaude-
ville theatre,

The controversy over the medium up-
set Brooklyn and echoes of it extended
countrywide, Friends of the woman
waxed warm in her defence against dis-
tinguished men who said she was a
fakir. The medium did not say much
herself. She went on holding her meet-
inge regularly and taking toll from the
publicity that maintained interest in her
affairs. She called herself the Rev.
May S. Pepper and later Bishop May S.
Pepper.

In June, 1997, Mrs. Pepper was mar-
ried to Edward Ward Vanderbilt, a lum-
ber dealer. With her marriage, she be-
came inactive as a medium. Publicity
continued to follow her, however, be-
cause of a domestic situation that wae
the outgrowth of her marriage.

Vanderbilt was 65 years old. His
bride was less than 40. He was a wid-
ower who had lived with his daughter,
Minerva. Following her father’s remar-
riage, the daughter brought a euit in
partition to recover a part of her moth-
er's estate. The suit was dismissed.

The daughter then began an action
to have her father declared an incom-
petent. Then she caused the indictment
of her stepmother, alleging that she had
by fraud induced Vanderbilt to deed to
her a house at 587 St. Mark's avenue.
The indictment was dismissed.

When Mrs, Pepper-Vanderbilt with-
drew from active direction of the Aurora
Grata Cathedral its attraction rapidly
diminished and services were discon-
tinued. It had been a meeting place for
Spiritualists for a long time. When she
took charge the attendance was usually
about 100 persons, When she quit the
place held a thousand people every Sun-
day night and long lines of those unable
to get in extended down the street. Al-
though the meetings did not begin until
8 o'clock, the audience began to aseem-
ble before 6 o'clock. It was charged by
those who attacked the authenticity of
the medium's spirit messages that per-
fons among the first comers were
marked by efficient aldes as subjects to
whom revelations should be made and
that data relating to them was as-
sembled before the medium appeared.

“Little Bright Eyes" was said by
Mrs. Pepper-Vanderbilt to have been a
half breed Indian girl. The medium as-
ferted that she had power to summan
her at will and communicate through
her with the dead friends of persons in
her audiences, During the early days
of the association of the medium and
Little Bright Eyes, it was pointed out by
sceptics that the spirit’s use of English
@s repeated by the medium was ex-
eeedingiy ungrammatical. After the
spirit's poor use of the language had
been made the subject of much jesting it
was noticeable that it improved greatly.

Mrs. Pepper-Vanderbilt was about 55
years old at her death, She was suc-
cessful through all the time in which
her affairs were a centre of interest in
withholding details of her early life.
She was sald to have been a dairymaid
en a farm near Providence, R. I, ad-
mitted it and would say no more.

She was born Mary Ann Scannell. She
Was married to George William Pepper
when 19 years old. He had a wife and
the marriage led to his arrest and con-
viction on a bigamy charge.

She is supposed to have acquired a
knowledge of spiritualism while em-
Ployed on a Massachusetts farm of
which the owner and his wife were
spiritualists. She practised as a medium
{n an obscure* way in Providence and
Brooklyn until the swift turn of fortune
that made her the most noted spiritualist
in the country at the time and made
the Aurora Grata Cathedral the leading
centre of that cult.

LEAGUE FOR WOMEN
IS MADE PERMANENT

Corporation Is Formed for
Peace Time Service.

 

 

 

Officers of the National League for
Women's Service, which was organ-
ized at the outbreak of the war to as-
aist Federal, State and local govern-
ments, have decided to continue the
wartime inaugurated work in times of
peace.

Articles of incorporation were ap.
proved yesterday by Justice Mullan tn
Supreme Court. The object of the league,
as set forth in its papers, is to provide
organized and trained groups of women
in every community to meet existing
needs and conditions along social and
economic lines, to act ag a voluntary
supplementary force to departments
and divisions of the governments and
to official and sem!-official bodies, and
in times of war to render such pervice
as may be required of women,

Since the outbreak of the war more
than 600,000 women in forty States
and 760 communities have cooperated
with all branches of the Federal Gov-
ernment in a manner which won com-
mendation. Miss Grace Parker, secre-
tary of the nationa) organization, said
last night that application for papers
of incorportion purposely was deferred
until the end of the war so that this
permanent organization would not be
confused with many of the societies
which owed their mushroom like growth
to war conditions and were not Intended
to be permarient,

Mrs. Maude Whitmore is chairman,
Mrs. Cortlandt Van Rensselaer, vice-
chairman; Mrs. John A. Logan, second
vice-chairman, and Miss Anne Morgan
treasurer of the national organization.
Among the incorporators are Mesdames
Frances F. Cleveland Preston, Mabel
Dean Bacon, Mabel kK. Baird, Frances
Burr, Katherine Phillips Edson, Flor-
ence F. Gibbs, Genevieve Hoadley,
Florence Canfield Whitney.

In spite of a counter attraction fn the
‘big Sixty-ninth parade the show of the
i American Pomeranian Club at the Wa!-
| dorf-Astoria Hotel yesterday afternoon
went forward very successfully. More
than seventy dogs of all classes were
shown and there were a number of at-
tractive special prizes. The attendance
was unexpectedly large.
| The ladies of the club who were re-

 

sponsible for the show had, many of
them, exhibits in the various classes, but
to a woman they were, or sald they were,
nore interested in the broad aim of the af-

fair, which was to restore the aristocratic
| Pom to his former supremacy among tov
logs, than in the prize winning power of
their especial darlings. In their argu-
ment they recalled what a number of
| fanciers will grant, that the Pom is the
most beautiful of the toys and that he
is besides every inch a dog and not a
freak. The Pom averages from three to
five pounds, but small as he may be he
is quite capable of giving a good ac-
count of himself in a scrap. Thier qual-
ity in dog of men adds to
and popularity.

Among the club members who were
Present, most of whom had dogs in the
show, were Mrs. Frank T. Clarke, to
whom is due credit for getting together
the elaborate list of specials: Miss Anna
Sands, Miss Theodora Wilbour. Miss Fl-
len Laflin, Miss Rita Harlan, Mra. Irwin
W. Day, Mrs. R. M. Hollins and Mrs.
George Ehret, Jr. These ladies met
their friends afterward at tea in the
| dining room of the hotel.

Throughout the afternoon the apart-
ment where the dogs were shown was
crowded, and as THE SuN Tobacco Fund
is to have the net proceeds it is likely to
benefit handsomely. In the gathering
were many soldiers and sailors, who
were persona grata to the show. While
admiring the dogs several of these ser-
vice men, who have benefited by the
smokes sent abroad, took the opportunity
of testifying their gratitude to the fund
and praised the women of this club for
making it a beneficiary.

Hotel Party a Succens.

In the list of the latest new contribu-
tions appears one which resulted from
the recent party held at the Robert
Treat Hotel, in Newark. <A very inter-
esting entertainment was provided by
the volunteering artists, of whom Miss
Lillan Bradley, a well known enter-
tainer, was one. Her contribution of
songs had a real success. The talent of
a child actress, little Muriel Nelson,
elicited much applause whether she dis-
Played it in singing or dancing or auc-
tioning gifts to the fund. The child,
who fs but 8 years old, displays her un-
usual accomplishments with the ingenu-
i freshness of her years and with the
poise of an adult acress.

Lieut. Rieser, as the war speaker of
the affair, made one of the most inter-
esting addresses ever delivered at these
parties; his experience attained on both
the French and the Italian fronts and
in the school of artillery at Fontaine-
bleau furnished the material for this
talk and the posters collected by him-
self in Europe filustrated !t.
Fitzpatrick, the composer,
his brother, sang his latest popular
plece, “The Wild Irish Boy,” and fol-
lowed it with “Trinity Chimes,” also his
composition.

In the recent donors’ letters are some
written on this side after the return of
soldiers to their homes. For various
reasons they were unable to send back
acknowledgments of tobacco gifts while
in service abroad, but they have not for-
gotten the joy these gifts brought to
them and they hasten as soon as they
have landed to thank the donors.
geant G. Buckley
347th Field Artillery, when he had
smokes from THE SutN Tobacco Fund
and this is what he writes about them
after landing on this side; “Only by
chance I found your card in some to-
bacco given to me in Coblenz, and I
imagine a great many cards will never
be returned to the kind people whd sup-
ported THw SuN Tobacco Fund. There
are many reasons why these cards don't
come home, but not one of them is due
to the indifference of us soldiers. We
all like a good smoke too much to feel
indifferent to those who helped us have
the tobacco. I was all over Belgium
and in the Argonne and at Verdun, so [
Rave seen plenty but am glad to be hack
home. Our trip home on a fine ship was
wonderful. Thank THE Sun
pleasure it gave me.”

attested by a group of doughboys who
were doing Paris on furlough on April

too that there is a dearth of French to-
