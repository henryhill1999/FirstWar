However brisk the speculation in the
oll shares may have been, there were
indications, nevertheless, of more con-
Servatism on the part of Wall Street in
general, One example of this was to be
found in the fact that the banks were
deinanding more margin in their loaning
operations on the higher priced oil
shares. This had absolutely no effect on
the price movement during the day, nor
was it expected to, but it furnished an-
other instance of the caution that

far as to-day’s steel meeting was con-
cerned, not a great deal of attention was
pala to that ,except in the steel and
standard shares. There was practically
a unanimous opinion that the extra div!-
dend would be cut. The only thing that
was uncertain was the extent of the cut
and the extent of ithe falling off in the
cc1poration’s earnings. It was reported
in conservative quarters that the extra
divicend might be reduced to 50 cents a
quarter, This had no foundation, how-
ever. Wall Street was inclined to ac-
cep: it at its face value, however, and if
it should turn out to be true it would
uncoubtedly be pleasing, inasmuch as
th» financial community has expected all

cut off altogether.
