HINES T0 CONFER
ON STEEL PRICES

Is Willing to Negotiate New
Quotations, but Directly
With Producers,

 

 

EXPLAINS HIS POSITION

 

Declares Industrial Board Had
Practically Blocked All
Further Discussion.

 

Special Despatch to Taw Sey.

Wasuinotox, April 28.—Director-Gen-
eral Hines of the Railroad Adipinistra-
tion to-day made known his willingness
to negotiate prices on steel at which he
will be willing to place large Govern-
ment orders with the steel men of the
country. In a telegram from Denver,
where he is on a railroad inspection trip,
he made known his readiness to reopen
negotiations on steel, but with the un-
derstanding that the Railroad Adminis-
tration and the steel producers were to
Have it out and agree.

ite the efforts of the President to
harmonize the situation and bring about
price stabilization the Director-General
is not willing to accept the dictates of
the Industrial Board of the Department
of Commerce. He reiterated that he
would not accept prices fixed by the
board, but was willing to negotiate new
ones directly with the steel men. He is-
sued the following statement from Den-
ver:

“On April 26 Secretary Redfield tele-
gSraphed Director-General Hines suggest-
ing that representatives of the Railroad
Administration confer anew with the In-
dustrial Board relative to steel prices
with the spirit of being engaged in a
common service and seeking a mutual
end. Director-General Hines to-day
called attention to the fact that on April
24 Judge Robert S. Lovett and Henry
Walters as representatives of the Rail-
road Administration had met with the
Industrial Board for the purpose of
reaching common ground in a practical
sense regardless of former conceptions
om either side and had been prepared to
offer compromise suggestions looking to
an agreement as to prices, but that the
board declined at the meeting to act ex-
cept according to its original concep-
tions, which in the opinion of the DI-
rector-General were erroneous, and that
this attitude of the board practically
closed the door to further discussion at
that meeting.

“The Director-General, in view of the
renewed suggestion for conference, indi-
cated a willingness to accept the offer
made by the Industrial Board in a tele-
atam sent by Chairman Peck on April

26 to bring together the representativos | M

of the Railroad Administration and the
stee| producers,”

CONSOLIDATED EXCHANGE.

Industrials were firm and the rails
were reactionary at the close of an ac-
tive market yesterday on the Consol!-
dated Stock Exchange. Final quotations
as a rule were below the best prices of
the session, due to profit taking move-
ments, which were frequent throughout
the day. The notable exceptions were
the Royal Dutch issues, which, toward
the end of the session, resumed their sen-
sational activity and closed at their high-
est prices. Royal Dutch of New York
went to 114, a gain of 8%, and Royal
Dutch to 114%, an advance of 7 points
Speculative activity in the oils was fe-
verish from the outset.

Steel common held steady, with a net
loss of %. Minor steel and equipment
stocks had substantial met gains. Ship-
ping shares were firm. Railroad stocks
after midday were subjected to pressure
and lost previous gains,

t Will Not Appoint Receivers
| te Receive Funds Paid by W. Va.

WASHINGTON, April 28.—The Supreme
Court denied to-day motions of Virginia
officials asking the Supreme Court to
appoint Senator Martin of Virginia and
Thateher M. Brown receivers to take
charge of money and bonds which West
Virginia will turn over to Virginia in
settlement of the Virginia debt case and
appoint a special master to adjust claims
under the judgment.

The effect of the court's action in de-
nying the motions, according to those fa-
miliar wth the cage, is simply to leave
to Virginia the disposition of the cash
and bonds which under an agreement
reached between the debt commissions
of both States and ratified by the West
Virginia Legislature are to be paid over |
to Viriginia in compliance with the Su- |
preme Court judgment of 1915 fixing
$12,393,000, with interest, as West Vir-
ginia’s share of Virginia's old civil war
debt.

The Supreme Court announced to-day
that argument of current litigation will
close for the present term next Friday.
After hearing arguments in the tele-
Phone and railroad cases set especially
for Monday, which will end all argu-
ments until next October, the court is
expected to recess for two weeks.

FOR HIGH PRICES

A. W. Douglas in Convention
in St. Lonis Says They Are
Kept ue Unnaturally.

FEDERAL

HITS CONTROL

Councilors Advocate Budget
System for the United
States Government.

 

Sr. Lovis, April 28.—High prices con.
tinue without “the slightest reason un-
der the sun.” A. W. Douglas of St.
Louis, chief statistician of the Chamber
of Commerce of the United States, to-
night told the representatives of a
thousand American trade organizations
in convention here. He added that there
had been some decline and declared that
if the law of supply and demand were
given freedom of operation the decline
would continue until a normal level
would be reached.

In touching on transportation and its
effect on business, he brought the dele-
gates to their feet in a burst of applause
when he declared that the “unfortunate
\ tate to which transportation has fallen
under Government control is a splendid
example of incompetence and extrava-
gance.”

In speaking before the National
Councillors of the Chamber, which took
up @ score of American business prob-
lems to be substituted to the generat
convention to-morrow, Mr. Douglas
pointed to the Government estimate of
900,000,000 bushels of winter wheat, de-
clared there would be more grain avail-
able for export than our ships could
move and added that there is more live
stock in the country than ever before.

After considerable debate the National
Councillors adopted a resolution advo-
cating a budget system for the Govern-
ment and recommending that the Cham-
ber carry on a campaign in behalf of the
Project in all parts of the country.

In its annual report the committee
on statistics and standards criticised
the method of the Department of Agri-
culture in preparing estimates of the
final yield of growing crops and recom-
mend that Congress be urged to provide
more liberal appropriations for the De-
partment.

American businesa is determined to
meet the needa of this nation and for-
eign countries during the remainder of
the readjustment period and after,
leaders in finance and industry declared
to-day at the convention of the Chamber
of Commerce of the United States.

But to carry out this programme, the
speakers warned, there must be no
further delay in bringing about closest
co-operation of all branches of finance
and industries. Kelations between ths
Government and business must be such
as to instill greatest confidence, they
declared.

With co-operation of all forces, Amer-
ica will be able immediately to develop
her foreign trade, which was character-
ized by some delegates as “a respon-
sibility to the rest of the world.”

Obstacles and setbacks encountered
by business generally since the signing
of the armistice are being overcome
gradually, according to reports of dis-
trict leaders of 2,000 or more delegates
at the convention.

Grain men of the Northwest, lumber-
men of the far West, cotton men of the
South and industrial leaders of the
Fast had problems to place in the big
melting pot, out of which the conven-
tion hopes to mold a complete policy for
the conduct of the nation’s business,

What the SUCCESS of the |
' Victory Loan -7Means to You |

 

Madison Avenue at 45th Street

ho penne MEN are saying that with the incentive of emotional
patriotism lacking the public will not buy Victory Loan
Bonds. An analysis of this attitude reveals the fact that men
who make such statements have in mind the sacrifices they have
already made—the sacrifices of taxes paid and bonds already
purchased. But what are these when measured by what has been
endured in Flanders and France?

“The banks will take the bonds in any event,” they say. YES,
the banks will take the bonds willingly. The terms of the loan,
as announced, offer an extremely attractive short term invest-
ment. It is a business loan which does not need the element of
patriotism to make it a success.

urchased by the banks with-

Attractive as the loan may be, if pe
the American public the result

out the whole-souled support of
will be detrimental to business.

The working man, the employer of labor and the investor all
will suffer.

WHY ?—Because the banks exist primarily to extend credit to
the business community. The banks cannot buy billions of dol-
tars of Victory Loan Bonds and still continue to loan money in
sufficient quantities and at a fair rate to the business man.

The purchasing power of the money you withhold will decrease,
because your bank must buy your share of bonds, causing
additional inflation of currency, more credit liability and higher
prices.

Higher prices for Serine — thst phrase has been a night-
mare to the average citizen for some time past.
If you buy your share of these Victory Bonds you will aid in

lowering the cost of living. If you refuse to buy, you aid in ad-
vancing the cost of living to a still higher plane.

Think this matter over while the opportunity remains—then
enter your subscription to your utmost capacity, It will mean a
lighter burder of taxes in future years. Please consider the facili-
ties of this entire organization at your disposal in entering your

It is an
Affair of
Honor

O win the war—to win it six months
earlier than anybody believed possi-
ble—we incurred debts for so many tons
of steel and so many pounds of beans, so
many feet of timber and so many yards of
cloth, so many horses and so many mules,
so many blankets and so many shoes.

 

 

Some of all this was used before Novem-
ber eleventh, some of it was not. Some of
it was paid for by the preceding Liberty
Loans, some billions of dollars’ worth was
not. Some of it will continue to be used for
months to come—all of it, because it was )
ready to use, helped win the war six months

sooner and save one hundred thousand
| |
|

American lives. And all of it must be paid
| for according to contract. These are debts
of honor.

 

|
Of course we I
shall pay. :
It is only a question \
of how much of this !

Victory Loan each :
of us can buy. |

question now!
