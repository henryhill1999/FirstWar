order for 70,000,000 feet of lumber was!
Placed recently, but it wae followed im- |
mediately by a demand for higher,
| Wages by the various’ classes of work-!
men through whose hands it would |
have to pass, and coupled with this the
further demand was made that only
‘white’ labor should be employed. These
difficulties were accentuated by tl
scarcity of tonnage, the situation with |
regard to which is, however, steadily
improving. On the Atlantic coast orders
aggregating 170,000,000 feet have been
received since the first of the year, In
addition 200,000,000 feet have been sold,
but are awaiting shipment. To move the
lumber already on hand and ordered will
keep all available tonnage fully occu-
pied for the balance of the year.

joyed an exceptionally placid situation
with respect to employment, The main
point at issue in the carters’ strike Is
recognition of the union, and the issue is
being fought: out on familiar lines, for-
tunately without violence. The effect on
business has been serious enough,
however, as Montreal is a large distrib-
uting centre not only for the rest of fhe
province but for the whole of the Do-
minion. Goods have piled up on the
hands of the railroads and the whole-
salers, and in suburban districts the
crippling of distributing facilities has
caused some uneasiness as to food sup-
plies.

Caution in the conduct of business for
the next few months {s urged by the
Canadian Bank of Commerce in its
monthly discussion of commercial cendi-
tions issued yesterday. Calling atten-
tion to the fact that under no circum-
stances does uncertainty conduce to
healthy expansion in production or in
trade, the bank predicts that uncertainty
will continue to exist until the terms
of peace have been finally settled and
have been accepted by the enemy coun-

It ia, however, eae assumed that
prices will remain steady, as lumber \s|
one of the fundamental] requirements for:
the carrying out of ceconstruction plans
in all countries, In British Columbia
a slight reduction in price was required
as a condition precedent to the placing
of recent orders of considerable size.

Ratio of Gold Is Good,

“Parilament has consented to extend,
for a period of two years after the con-
clusion of peace, the order in council
issued in September, 1914, which permits
each bank to issue notes in excess of its
paid up capital to the extent of 15 per

 

Special Despatch to Tux Sox.

MONTREAL, April 28.—An increase of
upwards of $19,000,000 in the savings
deposits of the Canadian chartered
banks is a satisfactory feature of the
March statement to the Government,
just published. It reflects most encour-
agingly the continuance of habits of
thrift formed {n the war years, and
despite the closing down of munition
factories, it is evident that there has

about 15 per cent. over the previous year
and established a new high record. Net
profits after all deductions for interest,
war tax, &c., amounted to $1,604,851,
against $1,208,019 in 1917. After al-
lowing for the preferred stock dividend,
the %alance earned on the common, on
which no dividend is being paid, was
46 per cent. Total assets at $26,305,-
343 showed an increase of about $2,000,-
000 in the year,

It is estimated fn financial circles that
approximately $25,000,000 will be dis-
tributed in Interest and dividend pay-
ments in Canada on May 1. The prin-
cipal factor in the large total for the

With tho coming of peace and the re-
turn of the world at large to commercial
Pursuits once more, Canada is in a much
better position to resume her trade with
other countries than most nations, ,Her
natural resources are plentiful and plans

already made for a more extended de-
velopment of these resources indicate a
certain prosperity for the Dominion for
many years to come. In discussing this
Phase of the Canadian economic situa-
tion, the Guaranty Trust Company has

scout leaders.

Sir Robert has been touring Europe
with this object, conferring personally
with scout officials in France, Italy,
Serbia and Belgium, and by cablegram
with those in Greece and America.

At Washington, New York and Ot-
tawa Sir Robert wil! discuss the project
with American and Canadian scout offi-
cials. At Philadelphia and Washington,
and probably at other citles, Boy Scouts
will assemble to greet him. In New
York he will review 10,000 boys in Cen-
tral Park on May 17, and Mortimer L.

of America, will give a dinner in his

know and understand the terms on/| mitted in respect to this subject, Sir P as to the course of fu-

which peace is to be based a further
period of readjustment will be certain
to intervene, especially so far as for-
elgn trade is concerned, and it may take
ome tirmme for business to settle down."

“From such advices as it is possible to
optain,” continues the letter, “it 1s gen-
erally assumed that we are very near to
& peace settlement and this has led to
active preparations for oarrying on the
work of the country in a normal way.
As yet, however, conditions are far from
permitting this. Productive activity and
business .organization will not proceed
confidently until the regulations and re-
strictions adopted as war measures are
removed, Relatively speaking, however,
business conditions {n Canada are such
as to justify hopefulness. Prices of
home products remain firm and stocks

Animal products are also being ex-
Ported to a greater extent than usual.

“The decline in exports of manufac-
tures is, of course, due to the stoppage
of munition orders, and the decline in
the value of agricultural products ex-
ported in February is due solely to the
fact that large stocks already sold are
merely awaiting shipment. Tonnage is
now becoming available for the ship-
ment of lumber and other goods already
sold, and this should result in a con-
siderable reduction in current loans,
which on this account are considerably
larger than in previous years.”

Despite the note of caution a picture
of satisfactory commercial conditions
and comfortable outlook is drawn by the
bank,, which says: ‘Seeding operations
are commencing under favorable weather

The present high prices for animal prod-
ucts and the prospect that they will con-

that the ratio of gold to circulation in
Canada was a favorable one, as com-
pared with other countcies. His hope,
however, was that al] such regulations
could be safely removed before the ex-
piration of the period mentioned.

“There has been a steady increase in
the amount of gold held by the banks
and the Government against thelr com-
bined note issues, after deducting from
the latter the Dominion notes held in
the central gold reserve,

“At the end of July, 1914, just at the
outbreak of war, the total amount of
gold held by the banks and the Govern-
ment was $1438,754,000, or 70 per cent.
of the notes outstand!ng, which amounted

Thomas White expressed the opinion
to $205,264,000, the amount of the z

the ratio of gold to notes outstanding
was 25.6 per cent. and in the United
States 65.7 per cent. The Federal
Treasury of Australia has issued notes
amounting to £57,035,000, against which
it holds 40.4 per cent., or £23,228,000 in
gold.

“While Canada's ratio of gold to cure
rency compares favorably with that of
the average belligerent country her cir-
culation per capita is relatively high.
In view of this and similar expansion in
Britain and the United States the Min-
ister of Finance has taken power to
continue restrictions as to the export of
gold. ‘Generally speaking,’ the Minister
stated in Parliament, ‘it has been the
policy and is the policy of the Govern
ment to cancel restrictions and regula-
tions just as rapidly as in our judgment

and that profits in business have con-
tinued to hold well.

While the post office and other fig-
ures from special savings banks have
to be reckoned with in estimating the
savings of the Canadian péople, the ac-
cepted barometer of the situation Is the
return of the chartered banks, which
conduct an overwhelming proportion of

the banking business of the country.
Taking the March return, the combined
figures of the chartered banks show an
Aggregate of $1,037,851,766 as the total
in the savings deposit account, This
compares with $939,329,271 at the end
of last November, the month In which
Canadians had rolled up the record break-
ing subecription of $660,000,000 to the

year, increased upwards of $9,500,000,
or close to 5 per cent., as compared
with the end of February. Current
loans and discounts in Canada rose up-
wards of $21,000,000 to $1,117,197,446,
a new high record, while total assets of
the combined banks at $2,612,163,711
were $36,972,220 higher than at the end
of February.

Big Gain in Credit.

The large demands for credit entalled
by high commodity prices are indicated
in the fact that the current loans and
discounts of the banks are now $230,-
000,000, or about 26 per cent. higher than
at the corresponding date a year ago.
Your own situation is more or less paral-
leled in this showing. It cannot be
claimed that business in either Canada

last autumn. This, without allowance
for conversions, on which there are no
definite figures as yet, would amount to
about $18,000,000 alone. As a consid-
erable proportion of the disbursement
will find its way back into the security
markets, prices for high grade bonds
and stocks are being well maintained on
ths stock exchanges, despite the recent
slackening of American buying.
Statistics relative to the growth of the
pulp and paper industry in Canada show
that the value of the pulp and paper
products exported by Canada in the
twelve months ended March 31 last was
$71,755,325, as compared with about
$10,000,000 in the year ended March 31,
1910 It was only twenty years before
that exports of these products began to
figure in the country’s trade returns,

and prices showed comparatively small
changes at the end of the week. In
that respect the market continued to re-
flect to a considerale extent the condi-
tions prevailing in Wall Street, where
United, States Steel has moved within
Narrow limits and the railroad stocks
have been more or less neglected, while
specialties of all descriptions were being
boomed.

Demand for Stocks.

In the Canadian list the chief feature
was a broad demand for low priced
common stocks such as Tucketts To-
bacco, Dominion Canners, Spanish River
Paper and North American Pulp. These
at their best prices of the week showed
gains of about 1 to 3 points. Breweries
also continued prominent, adding at 76

tors to increase the dividend resulted in
some selling pressure on that stock in

“The natural resources which it is
Proposed to develop,” says this pam-
phiet, “are immense in extent and va-
riety. Agriculture is and will long con-
tinue to be the chief industry of the
country, whatever progress may be made
in manufactures. It has been greatly
stimulated during the war both in the di-
tection of a diversity of crops and in the
manner of their cultivation. As the la-
bor supply dimimished with the continu-
ance of the war, intensive methods of
farming became necessary. During the
year 1918 there was a marked tendency
toward mixed farming, which waa re-
flected In a reduced production of wheat
and oata.

The estimated yield in bushels of crops
for 1918 and compared with 1917 is as

    
    
  

 

“The production of crops is likely to
be stimulated by the plans now being
made to settle soldiers returning from
Europe and war workers’ at home as
farmers on the vast stretches of land
hitherto undeveloped, A census taken
at the front in 1917 showed that of the
230,000 Canadian soldiers interviewed,
195,000 expressed a desire to become
farmers after the war. Of these 78,000
had had previous experlence. Canada
feels that the returning soldiers have a
special claim upon her, and that by
treating them liberally in the matter of
land grants she not only will meet an
obligation but also will contribute to
the general prosperity on the theory
that when agriculture is prosperoug the
other industries will be also.
