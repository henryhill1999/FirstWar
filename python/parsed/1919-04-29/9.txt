BOWERY PLATFORM |S’ #aRay Lauer

URGES FREE HOMES;

Backboners Declare for Four
Hour Work Day at 50
Cents an Hour.

HIGH PRICES MUST GO

Bread Line Alumni Bid U/-S.
Deal Out Jobs and Food
in Hurry.

Unfortunately the
vailed over the Liberals of the Extreme
Left in an All-Bowery convention held
in part of what
used to be the Atlantic Garden, in. the
Street whose roof is the Third avenue L’
So instead of the radical demands that
might possibly be expected from a gath-
ering of perambulating philosophers the

declaration to be presented to Mayor
Hylan and the Board of Aldermen, Gov.
Smith and the Legislature and President
“Wilson and Congress as the Bowery's
platform enunclates only these conserva-
tive desires:

First, a four hour day at a minimum
wage of 50 cents an hour until such

- time as everybody can work as long as

he pleases.

Second, free rental, for at least ten
years, of each family’s present place of
abode. )

Third, the Government to confiscate, if
necessary, the nation’s entire food re-
serve and “administer it on a basis of
three meals a day to all who are will-
ing to work.” <A delegate identifying
himself as the Pittsburg Pill asked that
this be
willing to eat,’ but his inspiration came
too late, the platform having already
been adopted when the Pill awoke to
the indignity that was being perpetrated
upon him. ‘

Fourth, the Government to hustle
work on railways, highways and public
buildings, to raise food and manufac-
ture clothing and other commodities to
be sold at actual cost through municipal

Free Rental Makes Hit.

The clause relating to the free rental
of everybody's home made a hit with
Pill and the other Bowery com-
muters, in whose cars the following, was
sweet music:

“In order to get at the root of rent
profiteering it should be recognized that
any man has an inalienable right to a
place to life on God's green earth; that
mor@over any man who is old enough
to have a family has already paid
enough rent in some form or other to
entitle him to ownership of an adequate
dwelling place. The only solution of
the rent problem would be the issuance
by the Government of a new Emancipa-
tion Proclamation giving rent free pos-
session for at least ten years to each
family of its present place of residence.
This might appear to be a species of
confiscation, but in reality it would be
restoring to the great mass of people
the homes which have been confiscated
heretofore by the so called landlord.”

The platform was adopted by a rising
vote of all who were able to rise. It
was then explained to the men that what
they had adopted was not yet the law of
the land, as it had to be ratified by the
official convention of the Backboners of
the Stepping Stone of which last night's
assembly’ in Atlantic Garden was a trial
heat. There is no doubt, however, that
the big convention, which is to take
place Thursday night, will ratify the
action already taken.

“And then,” said Charley Cummings,
chairman of the committee credited with
having drafted the platform, “we'll jump
in and do somep'n for youse. The
Gov'mint is goin’ to bigld State roads
and everything, so they says. Why
don't they do it?”

“They'll know pretty soon,” roared the
Pittsburg Pill. “Ef they don't do it
we'll make ‘em do it.”

“But there's no vi'lent attackrt in it,”
admonished Charley Cummings. “But t
want to say that they say they can fill
all the jobs with soldiers. They can’t.
The soldiers ain't hit the Bowery yet. I
hit the Bowery long ago and had re-
ligion injected into me right here.”

“T got religion,” retorted the Pittsburg
Pill, ‘an’ I didn't get it In no mission,
nefther. TI had it injected into me by
the Stepping Stoners, I hit the old sou
line an’ we've formed a union, and no
we'll see if we can't get no redress
which we deserves.

He. of the Beard Speaks.

Then a long man with a bald head
and a long red beard talked quite a
while, saying that this was no time for
speech, as the workers must be up and
doing and getting the rights long denied
them by the rich, who lolled at ease.
And finally the Bahaists, who had been
holding a convention of their own at the
McAlpin, trooped into Atlantle Garden.
There were still a few old boys on hand
to welcome them:and to hear the gospel
according to Abdul Baha, although it
must be said that neither the Pill nor
the red bearded prophet welcomed this
low brow irruption in the midst of the
Bowery's councelings. But the Backbon-

ers of the Stepping Stone love their

Subject ef Inquiry.

Charles O'Hagen of 82 Forley street,
Elmhurst, was held yesterday by Mag-

court for commitment to the Kings
County Hospital for observation as to
hia sanity. He is one of the best known
public school teachers in Queens, hav-

Recently O'Hagen has become posses-
sed of the idea that he is a man of great

sending about to various people and
committees checks for large sums. Some
of the committees that received them
were very grateful to him until they
presented the checks at the bank and
found that there were no funds to meet
them, O'Hagen's trouble is sal to arise

ACOUSED OF EMBEZZLEMENT.

Son-tn-Law of Late President of
Honduras Arrested.

Santa Rosa, Cal. April 28.—-Senor
Hernando Somezo, son-in-law of the late
former President Sierra of Honduras, is
under arrest here on a Federal warrant
in connection with the alleged embezzle-
ment of funds of the Santa Rosa Na-
tional Bank.

An indictment against Somezo was re-
turned in Sacramento last week.

According to the District Attorney's
office, it is charged that Somezo, a
wealthy rancher and owner of large
tracts flear here, secured large sums of
money from the bank through connec-
tions with Frank A. Brush, son of the
late president of the bank, who {ts under
arrest, E

Somezo came here about six years ago.
During the adminf&tration of President
Sierra in Honduras, 1900 to 1904, he
was a General in the Honduras army and
married one of Sierra's daughters.

Bench werrants were also served upon
Brush, William C. Grant and H. K.
Loyghery, officers of the bank, who are
under indictment in connection with the
alleged embezzlement of $723,208.

Somozo, Grant and Loughery
charged with  peculations
over a period between May,
September, 1918, when national bank
examiners took charge of the institu-
tion., The indictments were returned at
the same time that Frank Brush,
former cashier of the bank, was charged
in a separate indictment with embezzle-
ment of $204,000 of the bank's funds,

Wiilt!iam Le Baron, who did much to-
ward increasing the laughter of a weary
world two years ago with “The Very
Idea” and disappointed expectation last
autumn with “Back to Earth,” came to
the bat last night again as it were at
the HRpoth Theatre with a third farce.
“I Love You" is its prepossessing title.
Apart from prejudicing the spectators in
its favor by this alluring description
there was the singular little psychologi-
cal questioning about the new work at
the back of every mind which such an
experience inevitably creates.

Will this be as funny as tho first

one, seemed to ask one of those atill,
small voice or is it to be another ——?
The first of the three acts of the new
piece passes in the billiard room of a
home on Fifth avenue and the two
others in a bungalow on Long Island.

Mr. Le Baron’s men and women were
also presumably of New York, although
they might have been of any sphere,
since they were no more than the pup-
pets to carry out his farcical scheme.
But there were certain exceptions to this
description,

Humor From the Butler.

The butler who had been at Harvard
and Oxford and found no other occupa-
tion so suited to a man of cultivation as
the task of serving in the pantry, and
the youthful labor agitator who enjoyed
60 much the pleasures of the capitalistic
classes once he had a chance at them—
these were two genuine caricatures that
added some distinction to the humor of
the play. But none of its fun was s0
potent as Mr. Le Baron's witty speeches.
They are always much more amusing
than anything the author devises for the
pergons in his plays to do.

It was the contention of the tired
millionaire that had gathered at his
town and country houses the mannikins,;
in the play that love was but a =

of environment. He was willing to prove
it by a bet. The two on whom he set
out to experiment were a young woman
who secretly admired the gentlemanly
and educated butler and an electrician
of rabid views on labor. He was going
to show that under the right conditions
they could be made to imagine them-!
selves ih love. |

But the wrong couples would sit
among the hydrangeas under the soft

 

called “I Love You,’ which was guar-
anteed to be effective. There the
worldly young woman and the butler

progressed most rapidly toward love,
while the electrician took a fancy to an
altogether different girl of the party, on
whom, indeed, the host had his eye.

So the scheme falled in its purpose,
and this was not unaffected by the pres-
ence in the party of a maid of one of
the women to whom the electrician was
by way of being almost steady com-
pany. But there were happy hearte
united under this magic, even if the host
did not win his bet,

Sparkling Speeches Swing Piece.

All this was developed by witty talk
and ocecasiona) situations such as the
sudden necessity for the electrician to
interrupt his love making to go to the
kitchen and repair the stove, and the
violinist’s misfortune in breaking the G
string just as his ministrations were
most needed. The reappearance ot the
couples on the sofa under the light grew

<<]

inevitably mecharitcal after {t had been
several times repeated.

But Mr. Le Baron always had a witty
speech more or less suited to the minute.
There were ‘fortunately énough of them
ta keep the audience in constant laugh-
ter.

S0 “I Love You" attained success
through its entertaining talk. The spec
tators, grateful for so much, soon ceased
to wonder if the latest play was as good
as the first from the author's pen.

Gilbert Douglas played the butler of
wealth and education tn a way to reveal
the amusing caricature the author had
drawn. As the impetuous young work-
man eager enough to enjoy the luxuries
of capital Richard Dix has all the neces-
Sary spirit and enthusiasm. Robert
Strange, John Westley, an experienced
actor of farce who did not restrain him-

ture and to manufacture new types of |self last night, and Doris Mitchell as a

artillery material the
equipped for the production of aN cali-
bres and types of material.

“To obviate the delay of getting into
production and to provide skilled work-
men, to be transferred in case of neces-
sity to other plants, there will be built
up at the arsenal small production units
for each type and calibre «’ material.
These units will include the least num-
ber of all types of machines which it ia
practicable to install and will be used
from time to time for the manufacture
of small quantities of artillery material.”

 

HARBOR MEN TO SEE HYLAN.

eS
Will Tell Him To-day Strike Im-

pends Unless Boat Owners Yield.

Thomas Delahunty, chairman of the
Marine Workers Affiliation, announced
last night that he will inform Mayor
John F. Hylan to-day that a general
strike of 16,000 harbor workers is to be
| called because the boat owners have re-
fused to meet a committee from the
union, but insist on dealing with the
workers themselves or with a commit-
tee appointed by them. He also will
ask the Mayor to show him a letter
from the boat owners in which they
made a statement of these intentions,

Paul A. Vacarelli, head of the Inter-
national Longshoremen's Union, said last
night that the harbor strike will be ald-
ed by a strike of 15,000 freight handlers,
who are dissatisfied with their wages
and working conditions He said that
‘the strike is certain unless A. H. Smith,
Regional. Director of the Hatiroad Ad-
ministration, notified him to-day that
the terms of the men are accepted,

IT HAS BECOME A STYLE

 

Vaudeville. Audiences Take a
Strange Liking to New
Fad of Follies.

 

Vaudevillians have lately taken to in-
jecting their own names in their songs
just to show audiences they care to sing
only about prominent persons. Blanche
Ring at the Palace yesterday adopted

the practice for the good of her reputa- | ful

tion, warbling about that stage celebrity,
Blanche Ring.

In this number are spoken intermis-
sions, during which she imitates a hotel
chambermaid, a manicurist and a tele-
phone girl, all of whom confide in her
and speak thelr minds frankly about
that stage celebrity, Blanche Rigg. It
is entertaining, but one does wi that
some headliners would let the regularly
accredited press agent earn his salary
and not try to crowd him for the money.
Tt is to be feared that the end of the
war has driven theatrical folk in upon |
themselves too much. t

iMsas Rng, keeping the luminous, cres- |
cent moon smile well to the fore, carols!
also of the difficulty of making returned |
heroes satisfied in an orderly, quiet home |
when they've been usedsto rising and
breakfasting under the starlight, having |
previously had a Big Bertha serve as the |
alarm clock that awoke them. Then, as'
the rider to her act, she baings out table |
and gavel, holds a woman's club meeting |
with the feminine portion of the audi-
ence and sings a topical song, ‘‘All Those |
in Favor of This Motion,” in which she
lets the spectators vote whether to pre-
serve or abolish the shimmy, the Bol-
sheviki and similar social evils.

Miss Ring takes care of the occasion,
of course, but even more amusing is
Clifton Crawford, especially as the in-
ebriated person staggering home with
a bad case of shell shock wito knocks
over the bowl of gold fish just to tcach
them they can't snap at him. The
musical comedy star gives an imper-
sonation of an elocutionist carrying a
handkerchief ‘ salted with pepper by
Practical jokers, which results in spasms
in the audience as great as those in
the elocutionist. It's a case of a sneeze!
turning into a scream. |

Other acts which carry the bill at a}
high level are Charles Lovenberg’s
production of “Hands Across the Sea,” ,
a miniature musical comedy which is!
much more pretentous than most t4b-,
loid revues and establishes an entente |
cordials with the audience; Charles
Grapewin, supported by Anna Chance!
in “Jed’s Vacation,” the second instal- |
ment of the “Poughkeepsie” serial, to

f ,

The Spaniards have a “Boheme” of |
their own and the Teatro Espano) pro- |
duced it last evening in the Park Thea- |
tre. The work is called '‘Los Bohemios” |
and the book {s by Guillermo Perrin and }
Miguel Palctos, the music by Amadeo |
Vives. The work does not belong to the!
grand opera class, but is one of Spain's |
Own creations. a sarzuela, which is |

 

 

kind of comic operetta.

The Bohemians in the garsuela are a
poet and a musician, who write an
opera. Cosette, the heroine, secretry
learns the prima donna role in the opera
and when the singer cast for the part
at the Opera Comique falls {ll calmly
steps in and achieves a grand success.

There {s opportunity for a plenty of
comedy in the action, but the proceed-
ings last evening were by no means in- |
spiriting. The singers were laboring ;
under the famillar disadvantages of |
first night and everything moved, cau-
tlously except when the chorus gayly |

€ sharp minor. The rally was staged by
the Allied Music Division of the loan
committee, and it brought the total of
thie energetic division up to the tidy
sum of $7,816,000, which is considerably
in excess of its quota of $2,750,000.

Helfetz had just finished playing a
group of three pieces, “On Wings of

Song."" by Mendelsohn-Achron; “Dance
No. 7" by Brahms and “Guitgrre,” by

Mostkowsky, when a man arose in Box
25, In which Admiral Mayo had seated
himaelf after opening proceedings with
a brief speech, and announced that that
box would subscribe $500,000 !f the vio-
linist would play the “Ave Maria.” The
man said he was a representative of the
Victor Talking Machine Company, and
Heifetz, ‘apparently feeling that he was
talking to good purpose, instantly com-
plied.

It was after Rachmaninoff had ren-
dered “The Star Spangled Banner” and
Liszt's Rhapsodie Hongrois that Boxes
27 and 29 offered to subscribe $1,200,000
for another tune by the artist. The

G. Foster, president of the American
Piano Company, and the members of the
1 for the subscription were Thomas
ran, J. G. Blaine, Jr.. H. D. Gibson,

» D. MacDonald, Wi!lllam Cochran,
Howard 8. Tierney, Charles W. Reicks
Ernegt Stauffen, Jr, Joseph A. Bower,
J. S. Maxwell, Sidney W. Noyes and
John L. Weeks.

Some of the largest subscribers were
the Edison Talking Machine Company,
Steinway & Sons, the Kohler Industries
and the Aeolian Company. After the
big sums had been announced Motor
Corps girls from the National League |
for Women's Service went through the
house with blanks, and with the aid of
the chairman's appeals from the stage
brought a flood of smaller pledges, in-
cluding one of $1,000 from a Chicago
man, another from New Hampshire and
another which the subscriber sald was
for “one million marks.”

“What? demanded the chairman.

“A million marks is $10,000 in our
money,’ sald the taker.

A mighty round of applause greeted
the statement of the chairman, Morris
K. Parker, that the Allied Music Divi-
sion had more than trebled its quota,
and on top of the enthusiasm Lieut-Col.
Theodore Roosevelt came out and made
the windup speech, telling some of the
experiences of tho Americans in the

|
trenches of France

Admiral Mayo's speech was as direct
and out from the shoulller as were his
performances in the war.

“The Victory Loan must go over the
top,” he said, “because we have to pay,
not only the cost of this war, which is
tremendous beyond anything we ever
dreamed of in past years, but we must
also pay the cost of remissness in the
Past. We are paying for the lack of
preparedness in the past, for every man
must realize that had we spent only a
very smail proportion of the billions we
now pour forth, had we distributed
these over the years in the past, and so
larger army and especially a/|
larger and better rounded navy, Ger-
many never would have carried things
to the pass of foreing this country into
the war. But it was done, we were in
the war and we are glad of it—and now}
{t remains for us td finish the job, as!
our soldiers and sailors finshed theirs.”

The Rev. Dr. C. Wallace Petty of the
Creston Avenue Baptist Church also
made a rousing speech. Before

the
regular programme opened there was
twenty minutes of community singing

by the audience, led from the stage by
one of the directors of the New York
War Community Service.

CUNARD LINE WILL
ENCIRCLE THE GLOBE

Capital’ Increased to Permit of
Great Expansion.

The topic among British ship owners
just now te the increase to $30,000,000
in the capital of tne Cunard line, which
means not only providing new ships, but
increasing the sphere of influence of the
line. Some of the capital, perhaps sev-
eral millions, will be invested in a superb
office building shortly to be erected at

 

Bowling Green. This project is the re-}
sult of the farsightedness of Sir Ashley |
Parks, the lihe’s managing director in
America. The Cunard has acquired in
recent yeara the controlling interest in
the Anchor Line, Glasgow to New York |
the good will of the business and the
ships of the Donaldson Line, Glasgow to
the ships of the Royal Line,
Bristol to Canada, and the Uranium
Line, Rotterdam to Canada and the
United States. |
The Ine acquired interests that took it}
into the freight trade between Great}
Britain and Australia and New Zealand
and lacks now only the connecting IInks!
from India east to China and Japan and
thence across the Pacific to San Fran- |
cisco or Vancouver. The friends of Sir!
Alfred Booth, chairman of the Cunard:
company, say that he doubtless will at-:
tend to the forging of these links that |
will give the line a round
To do this and

tion to the problem, “Why its a college
musical comedy?" But if any person
athirst for knowledge went to the Hotel

Plaza last night to watch Columbia Uni-
versity’s profound undergraduate schol-
ars become boys again with the varsity
show, “Ttake a Chance,” came close to
learning the answer. ;

In fact, he was due for quite a shock.
Not that the costumes of the chorus!
were in any way indiscreet, though the
ladies of the ensemble were all young
men and not co-eds, and the producers
could therefore, so to speak, take a
chance. No, what was likely to as-
tonish any professional Broadway man-
ager who might have risked an evening |
at the Plaza was the high artistic vol- '
tage of the performance, which could
galvanize some Wiseacre Square pro-
ductions into life.

But then that was practically obvious
as soon as one saw the names of Ken- |
neth Webb, '06, and little brother Roy. |
‘10, attached to the programme as the
men who licked the book and lyricy into |
shape, and showed the chorus how to
kick above the belt. Their ndmes have
been attached to all the Columbia Var-
sity shows during the past few years,
which js one of the two reasons why
that university is now coming to be
known as a home of the theatrical art,
the other reason betng Doc Clayton |
Hamilton.

As for the plot-—well, even the higher
education ca@h’t make a musical comedy
plot any more of a plot than Nature in-
tended it to be. Suffice it to say ain |

Arthur Gray, a Columbia graduate, joins
the army, where he falls in love with
Betty High, despite the fact that she's
supposed to be camouflaged from mas-
culine eyes in Y. M.
worker's uniform of horizon
and Betty turns out to be the
daughter of the president of Coal-
wood College, so Arthur enlists there—
that is, he enrolls there as a freshjgnan ;
and he’s hazed by a sophomore whem he
once commanded as a lieutenant im the
army, because he paints his class num-
erals all over the campus; and one of
the college professors dons his paint
deubed clothes and is mistaken for the
smart freshman and haged by the sopho-
mores; and Arthur's father comes to his
son's fraternity house to get some com-
promising letters from a vampire with |
whom he's been too saucy, and his wife |
turns np in time to catch him at it—— |

Well, after the spectator succeeds in
untangling the story like this his next
task jis to discover what in Hall Colum-
bla the title has to do with it. But he
needn't bother, because he should devote
all his attention to Kenneth Webb's book,
which is amusing and could spare a few
jckes for Broadway shows—yes, sir, one
feels that it's even better than Tony
Sarg's marionettes, which is really high
Praise. Roy Webb's music was excep-
tionally tuneful for such productions,
especially in “A Flat on Morningside,”
“You and Me and You" and “A Rain-
bow Honeymoon,” and there were some
effects worthy of the degree of M. A!
The two acts are laid in a frat house in
Coalwood College.

Percival Cowan, ‘19, hero of every var-
sity show since his freshman year, made
a charming Theodora Gray. Mortimer!
Van Raalte was Vincent Stanley. Har-
old Horan played the part of Arthur
Gray. Herbert Rockowitz was Betty
High. Others in the cast were William
Taylor, Thomas Bernardo, F. W. Het-
field, Emil Gyess, Edward Clark, James
Fox, Hugh Burtis, H. Rauchfuss, Leon-
ard Manheim and I. Sagir.

There wjll be four more performances
of the play in the Plaza besides one
which will be given in the Riverside
Community House, Riverside Drive and
Ninety-seventh street, for the men of the]
fleet and the 165th Regiment.
