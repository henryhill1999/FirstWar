"TWO MILLION MARK

Real Estate Team Gathers In
$469,850 in a Day.

With subscriptions of $200,000 each | ST.

from the Title Guarantee and Trust
Company and its subsidiary, the Mort-
gage Guarantee Company, the total re-
ported by the real estate men's division
of the Victory Liberty Loan drive passed
the $2,000,000 mark yesterday, the ac-
tual sum reported being $2,102,500. Al-
fred E. Marling, head of the division,
had hoped to reach the $2,000,000 mari:
last Saturday, but his expectations were
disappointed by a wide margin,

In addition to the subscriptions made
by the Title Guarantee and its sub-
sidiary the division also received a per-
sonal subscription of $5,000 from Clar-
ence E. Kelsey, who controls the two
companies. Other subscriptions were
$30,000 from Mrs. Eliza Stevens, $10,000
from Phelps Stokes and $10,000 from
the Lawyers Title and Trust Company.
Cartier, the jeweller at 653 Fifth ave-
nue, subscribed $5,000, or one-half of 1
per cent, of the tofl of the assessment
of his property, and was awarded an

The actual total for the day was
$469,850. Chairman Marling says that
the daily average of subsgriptions from
tow on until the end ofthe driye will
have to be $300,000.

“There was a slight falling off in last
week's returns,” said Mr. Marling, “and
this will have to be offset by real hard
work on the part of the division mem-
bers. I know that every man in the
division {s ready and willing to do his
utmost to sustain the repuation of the
real estate interests, and I have no fear
of the ultimate result.”

ASKS LUXURY TAX
COLLECTIONS HALT

Dry Goods Men’s Association
Urges Roper to Defer
Enforcement.

 

 

In a letter to Commissioner Daniel C
Roper, Bureau of Internal Revenue,
Washington, the National Retail Dry
Goods Association yesterday entered a
protest against the luxury tax. The let-
ter reads:

“Last Friday I took the liberty of tel-
egraphing you regarding anticipated rul-
ings of the Bureau of Internal Revenue
regarding luxury taxes, Section 904.
Your reply has not been received, and it
seems fair to assume that the luxury
tax provisiong may now be causing your
bureau almost as much difficulty as they

are destined to cause the public and the
merchants,

“In view of this disarrangement of

business which must result from the at-
tempt to administer the tax in retail
stores without the assistance of official
Government rulings, and in further view
of the well understood intent of the last
Congress to repeal the luxury tax, would
it not be a justifiable simplification of the
broblem to defer operation of section 904
at least until such time as the retail dis-
tributers may have the benefit of the
ruling of the Bureau of Internal Rev-
enue?

“May we respectfully urge the impor-
tance of postponing operation of thie sec-
tion under existing conditions?

“Liew HAHN, Executive Secretary.”

An extension of the time in which
manufacturera of furs are required to
make their initial returns to the Govern-
ment under the war revenue act provid-
ing for a tax of 10 per cent. on furs has
been granted by the Collector of Internal
Revenue in Washington, in accordance
with a request of Edward C, Fillmore,
counsel to the Associated Fur Manufac-
turers, Inc, é

Under the revised order returne for
the latter part of February, when the
law became effective, and for the entire
month of March may be filed with the
returns for April, which will not be due
until May 31.

The tax went into effect February 25,
and while under the provisions of the
law manufacturers are required to file
returns showing their monthly sales on
or before the last day of the month suc-
ceeding that in which the sales are made,
the revenue authorities ruled that Febru-
ary returns might be included with thoge
of March, which would have been due
to-morrow.

 

Advances Fail to Halt Orders,
A peculiar situation has developed in

a number of mills, in order to discour-
ag: the buying of fancy shirtings and
similar goods that have been in active
demand, have made material advances
in these lines,

But reports in the trade indicate that
thus far these advances have not been
effective in chusing any decrease in the
demand for this class of merchandise.
Buyers are placing orders for as far
ahead as the mills will sell and in most
instances at whatever prices the mills
asked.

20-2 and 30-2 warps continue to go up

Says Retailers Must
Depend on U. S. Goods

B*eurere the manufacturers of

 

Europe are in no position to

make large exports now, and
provably will not be for some time to
come, retailers in this country must
depend on America during the next
six or eight months for their supplies,
according to 8 P. Halle, president of
the National Retail Dry Goods As-
aociation, who has just returned from
a tour through England, France and
Belgium.

Mr. Halle etates that the reserve
stocks of the world have been practi-
cally cleaned out, and he is certain
that prices never will again return to
their pre-war level. He believes that
when the temporary restrictions are
removed abroad there will be a won-
derful future for American trade.
He advises manufacturers to send
representatives abroad now to make
connections and introduce goods made
here,

carded Southern yarns, and in spite of
advances {n prices considerable business
is being placed. As a result of expand-
ing demand less inclination to haggle
over prices is noted.

Mills are getting more comfortably
sold up and consequently have advanced
quotations.

 

Seal Skins Up 30 Per Cent,

St. Lovis, April 28.—Interest at the
opening to-day of the $10,000,000 fur
auction of Funsten Bros. & Co, at the
International Fur Exchange was centred
in the offering of about 10,000 Alaska
fur seals dressed, dyed and machined,
which were offered for the account of
the United States Government.

These offerings showed an advance

Business Adjustment Rapid.

\
local cotton goods market whereby
|

The adjustment of business in gen-
eral toward a peace basis is proceeding
the
{| most sanguine, states Commerce
Monthly, issued by the National Bank
of Commerce in New York.

The five uncertain months which have
passed without symptoms of a serious
financial or i!n@ustrial malady have
proved the fundamental soundness of
the United States, {t is stated. An
undercurrent of improvement can al-
ready be detected, and while very slight,
it is sufficient to justify an attitude of
conservative optimism on the part of
the business community. Present tem-
porary curtailment of production is de-
scribed as a pause before the wheels of
industry start for civillan production.

 

 

 

Flannel Market Active,

Business in flannels during the last
few days has been unusually heavy in
the cotton goods market, factors in the
trade report. Withdrawals of lines by a
number of the larger houses, which have
been sold up, are looked for. Actual
operations have just been started by
the jobbers and further good buying by
the cutters-up is reported,

One concern, which sellg the produc-
tion of about 2,700 looms on wide out-
ing flannels for the cutting-up trade,
{has announced that judging from pres-
ent indications its goods would be sold
up and withdrawn this week,

Large Birds for Fall Hats.

In view of the fact that collections of
hat trimmings received from abroad re-
cently have contained quantities of large
birds in semi-flat effects, wholesalers in
the local millinery market believe that
these ornaments will figure extensively
in the production here of goods for fall
