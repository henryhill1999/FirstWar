The larger part of 6,000 ren of the
Beventy-seventh Division who got here
yesterday by the traneport America
were unable to appreciate the greet-

were ordered below decks by the naval

commander so that there might be

heaviness and the rush of masses to
the rails of the several upper decks.
The men did not like this, but the
ship’s officers thought it was neces-
Sary, as the America is a seven storied
creation and a bit “tender.” The order
has been given before and for the

reason. ~

Most of the men of the Seventy-sey-
enth declared by ballot taken aboard
that they did not care about parading.
As the Statue of Liberty is the divisional
Seventy-seventh some
of the men. who were not allowed to
see it waid it had lost some of its sig-
nificance to them. But they may change
their minds about this later, also about
their desire to parade.

The “Lost Battalion” or Second of the
308th Infantry, Seventy-seventh Divi-
sion, came back in command of Major
George G. McMurtry, 22 East Seventieth
second in command when the
Germane cut off the battalion anda sur-
rounded it, and who has received the
Capt. William J.
Cullen, lawyer, of 1187 Woodycrest ave-
nue, The Bronx, in charge of Company
H, retold the story of the “Lost Bat-
talion.” The losses were so heavy in
the five days of continuous shelling and

‘sniping after it went over the top that

@ix companies of the 307th Infantry and
two companies of the 806th Machine
Gun Battalion were consolidated with
the regiment of the Second to remake it,
with a total of 690 men.

Men Killed Seeking Water.

The battalion moved forward on Oc-
tober 2, encountering heavy machine gun
opposition. They wiped out some of the
tests and got well into the German lines.
Five attacks were made by the enemy in
the six days the battalion was isolated.
In the intervals between attacks there
was uninterrupted hand grenade - and
machine gun fire. The Germans had the
range of the only water hole and fifteen
men were killed or wounded at it.

The 808th Infantry Band buried the
dead of the battalion after the arrival of
the restue party, and Band Leader Lieut.
Herman Schoenfeld of Patchogue, L. I.,
comes back with two band horns deco-
rated with wound stripes and red crosses
to show where they had been hit. All the
Original instruments of the band were
smashed at Vesie in August. Among
those the band put under earth was Capt.
Eddie Grant of Company H, 307th: In-
fantry, sent to rescue the lost ones.
Three hundred were buried in the woods
where they had fallen. Sergeant Frank
W. Winkler of 3714 Third avenue said
when he went into the woods with the
troops he weighed 180 pounds and when
he came out his weight was 155,

Before the America sailed from France
Col. Maurice Larent decorated three men
of the 308th with the Croix de Guerre.
They are Major McMurtry for gallantry
with the “Lost Battalion,” First Sergeant
Benjamin Kaufman of Company K, who
captured a German machine gun nest
single handed and took a prisoner al-
though his right arm was shattered, and
Private Jack Herschkowitz of Company
C, who carried, messages to Whittlesey
through heavy barrages.

Private Pon Lee, just tall enough to
eet into the army, formerly a waiter in
a Chinese restaurant tn Pell street and
winner of the Croix de Guerre, and
Private Loreto Rodrigues, Mexican
Indian, from Albuquerque, more than six
feet tall, were fast friends on the trip
and went about together so frequently
that they became known as the “Long
and the Short of it.” Pon Lee is ambi-
tious to get off his uniform swiftly and
get back to Chinatown, and New Mexico
is appealing strongly to Rodriguez.

Digs as Decoration Waits.

Lieut. Charlies Ridgely of the 308th,
100 East Seventeenth street, who went
across in September, received the D. 8.
C. at Solssons in July last and wae cited
for action in a raid in the Picardy sec-
tion of the Argonne, when his detach-
ment captured thirty-six prisoners and
killed the rest of a German company.

nel officer of the 308th, and his bride,

Private John J. Kelly of the Sixth
Marines, who returned by the French
liner La Lorraine, wears the Congres-
sional Medal, awarded to him for going
through an American barrage, capturing
a German machine gun nest, killing two
of the enemy and capturing and bring-
ing back eight. He did not get his deco-
ration on the day originally set by Gen.
Pershing, when the American army was
drawn up near Coblenz. Kelly's name
came first on this occasion, because he
was going to receive the highest mili-
tary honor in the gift o: America. He
did not respond to his name and nobody
near by had seen him in the neighbor-
hood. He was reported later twenty-
eight miles away, serenely digging a
ditch. They captured him three days
later and Gen. Pershing decorated him
and the Prince of Wales congratulated
him.

Infantry, the old Sixty-ninth, in July,
1918. They advanced ahead of the tanks
in the latter part of the war and cut

barbed wire, losing many men itn the
hazardous work. Many of them were
decorated.

The Minnesota, which docked in

Brooklyn, brought 21 officers and 1,744
men of the Eleventh Infantry of the
Iron Division, the Twenty-elghth of
Pennsylvania, which lost 3,880 in dead
and wounded while taking part in five
big drives. The Eleventh came back in
command of Col, Edward C. Shannon.

The Texan, which also docked in
Brooklyn, brought home the Eighteenth
Engineers, aJl far Western men, com-
manded by Col, J. R. Holman of Seattle,

Col, William F. Honan, and handlea
some of the first wounded from the

tro-American Line, came in this evening
with the Thirteenth Regiment of Engi-
neers, recruited in Chicago but now
having many men of this neighborhood
who were sent to it as replacements, in
command of Col. C. L. Whitney. It was
a railroad regiment and in its eighteen
months in France it handled trains in
all the fighting sections. It was a
combat unit with the Fourth French
Army in the Champagne, with the Sec-
ond Army in Verdun and with both the
Americans’ and French at.~St. Mihiel,

the Fifty-eighth Coast Artillery Regi-
ment, which is here for demobilization
and transfer, The climax of its run of
ill fate waa reached in stories which
appeared in New York yesterday as-
serting| that the regiment had seen
no action and was inferior as a fighting
organization,

The men and officers are highly in-
dignant to-day and point to 250 wounded
or gassed in their organization, casual-
ties during three weeks’ hard fighting
following the St, Mihiel drive. On Oc-
tober 20 the Fifty-eighth went into posi-
tion at Mont St. Jean and fought at
various points along a_ sixteen mile
front, discharging during that period
more than 4,000 shells. At Arnaville, a
German railway station and two troop
trains were blown up as A result of
the New Yorkers’ marksmanship. Their
eight inch howitzers were often not
more than a kilometer from the firing
line and this proximity to infantry ac-
tion won them the name “heavy dough-
boys.”

One feature of thejr hard luck career
was their delay of a morth at Bordeaux
to do heavy work there after they had
been given to understand that they
would parade in New York Christmas
day. At Bordeaux the Fifty-eighth was
picked as an escort for Marshal Petain,

HEROES’ JOBS FOR FIGHTERS.

Bureau Urges Dead Soldiers’ Posts
Be Filled by Comrades,

The Reemployment Bureau of New
York City for Soldiers, Sailors and Ma-

‘wos, with offices in 505 Pearl street, is-
l seed an appeal yesterday to manufac-
turers and business houses whose em-
ployees’ names appear on the honor rolls
of the Seventy-seventh Division and the
Sixty-ninth Infantry, to offer jobs form-

erly held by these men to other dis-
charged soldiers returning from over-
seas.

“There could be no more fitting memo-
rial to New York men who will never
return than to offer their old jobs to the
men who fought side by side with them
overseas,” said Alfred L. Smith, secre-
tary of the bureau. ‘‘For every type of
work we have ekilled and experienced
men listed with ue, and we pledge to em-
Ployers the most painstaking care in
meeting their requirements.”

Of the men of the Seventy-seventh Di-

vision who were killed in a ‘tign, 998
enlisted men gave New York as their
home, and 602 enlisted men and 23 offi-

cers of the 165th, the old Sixty-ninth
Regiment, who died in action came from
this city.

The delayed arrival of the President
Grant until May 6, the day of the Sev-

1,900 men of @@veral units from parad-
ing. “It cannot be helped,” Major-Gen.
Alexander, commander of the division,
said yesterday at headquarters in the
Hotel Biltmore, ‘for we simply cannot
hold the parade another day, because the
men are so anxious to get back to their
civillan life.”

The units are the Headquarters Troop,
Military Police, 302d Ammunition Train,
302d Supply Train, 302d Sanitary Train
and the 304th Machine Gun Battalion,

Gen. Alexander invites the wounded
officers and men of the Seventy-seventh

charged from the service to don their
uniforms and parade with their division.
