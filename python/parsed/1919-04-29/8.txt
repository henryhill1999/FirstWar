TOLENTINO'S ITALIAN
ANTIQUES ON VIEW

Collection of Renaissance Fur-
niture Rivals the Davanzati
Palace Groups.

 

 

A PORTAL BY SANSOVINO

 

Coats of Arms of Princely
Former Owners Still on
Some Pieces.

 

Several years ago the American Art| W8# “a fortuitous circumstance.”

Association surprised the art world by
starting off the season with the sale of

   

 

dent than can be found in the museums
on this side. In the old world there
are many instances of chateaus and
palaces furnished throughout in furni-
ture of former periods, but the present
exhibition, though fleeting—the sale oo-
curs May 1 and 3—seems to offer the
Same sort of education to our public.
No doubt some of these pieces will find |
thelr way into permanently public col-
lections, but it helps greatly to under-
Stand these works of art to see them
in companionship with fellows of their
own era.

An object that will attract the firat
slance of connoisseurs, especially those
interested in carvings, is a sixteenth
century marble doorway, by Andrea
Sansovino. There is evidence in the
design that the door was carved for that
Sreat historical personage, Pope Julius
II, the friend and patron of Bramante,
Raphael and Michelangelo; and conse-
quently It astonishes somewhat to find
it in America at all, considering the
rather atrict laws that Italy made to
prevent such works from being sold into
foreign countries, But {t seems re

It is an arched doorway, flanked by

three-quarter round pilasters, the upper
portions of which are carved with
masks and floral scrolls and the lower

capital, and indeed all the details of
the ornament are executed with a touch
80 lively, sensitive and sure, that the
door will be the despair of modern {mi-
tators,

The big furniture pieces in carved |
walnut, sometimes much, and sometimes
simply decorated, but always in archi-
tectural form, remind the visitor forcibly
of the famous Davansat! pieces. In-
deed, they are by the same artists and
artisans and were bullt for the samo
fastidious and cultivated patrons. The
arms of the great families ort
appear in the carvings. There is a ric
Tuscan walnut cabinet with the arms
of Prince Doria; a Florentine walnut
bench has the esoutcheons of the famous
family of Piccolément; several pleces of
Breat distinction belonged to the Sforza
family, and a particularly beautiful cabi-
net. bears the arms of the Palmieri
family,

Two sixteenth century walnut cabi-
nets with figure carvings in relief came
from the Stefano Bardini collection.
Two altar stalls have elaborate and
skilful carved decoration, as has also a
fine Venetian carved wainut lectern of
the sixteenth century. Two of the rar-
est of the Dante chairs, on the other
hand, have a primitive simplicity of
line. Carved wood candlesticks of sin-
gular beauty, and in an excellent state
of preservation, are from designs by
no less an individual than the admired
architect of Siena, Baldassare Peruzzi.
Another more ornate set of candlesticks
correspond to those that are the great
pride of the Cathedral] of Parma. *

The bronses, terra cottas and reliefs
bear some great names, There is a
colored stucco relief of a madonna by
Rossellino in the fifteenth century. An
admirable bronse of a dancing nymph
is by San Soevino. An engaging little
fat cupid in terra cotta, by Glovanni
della Robbia, sits upon a rock and
gazes vacantly up at the clouds. This
artist also did the characteristic frame
for @ madonna in relief, A_ lovely
little gothic carving in pear wood, de-
picting the crowned Virgin, is a fifteenth
century French work. A Tuscan bronze
bust of “St, Sebagtian,” with fine patina,
is by Matteo Civitall. A pair of Vene-
tian bronse candlesticks are by Vittoria,
and a little Roman votive lamp in bronze
dates of the first century A. D. A
brongze group that came from the Davan-
zati Palace collection ia the “Apollo and
Daphne” by Bernini.

Painted Furnitere.

The room that fetches one up to the
period of Casanova ts filled with painted
Italian furniture, chairs, a sapectacular
desk, tables, and on the walls are
some painted wall panels, enough to
fit out a room. The subjects are
pastoral, with games, fishing, &c., and
they have been painted with an @t-
tractive and easy unpretentionsness. An
eld spinet in thie room ig unlike any
that the American Art Association has
shown, It was evidently bullt to fit a
special niche, is clever in design and
has on the inside of the lid a romantic
and artistic landscape decoration, There
{s also a remarkable Venetian painted
door or alcove screen, used In the eigh-
teenth century to surround the bed
during formal receptions,

The decorative paintings that accom-
pary this collection include two Vene-
tian scenes by Canaletto, an entertain-
ing work by Hendrick van Lind, a
Fiemish painted who worked ‘n Rome,
and a “Virgin and Child" by Pietro Lor-
enzettL The Virgin in this work is
seated upon a throne, the panels of
which contain the mosaics of which this
painter was so fond, and both the Vir-
gin and Child wear at thelr breasts
raised and colored ornaments of pas-
tiga. One small gallery is given up
completely to a set of fifty-nine painted
panels formerly adorning a palatial cell-
ing. Some of the small panela contain
portraits, doubtless of members of noble
families, and others are of biblical char-
acters.

A large tapestry has for a subject a
most medieval arrangement of tree# and
beasts. A splendid painted and gilded
bookcase, by Venato, dates from the six-
teenth century, and a more formal one
of the same period is in Florentine wal-
nut. The wrought iron grills and
sconces, outdoor torches, are unusual in
design and excellent in workmanship.
Throughout the galleries one is con-
estantly meeting the unexpected in the
shape of small statuettes in porcelain,
bits of glass, Limoge enamel, fatence and
early Italian dolls dressed out in da-
masks.

$300 FOR ITALIAN CUPBOARD.

ae
Art of Refugee Workmen Brings

$0,324,

The first day's sale of the artistic
productions of the Venetian refugees, at
Silo's Art Galleries, brought $9,324. The
attendance was numerous, and there
seemed to be a special interest in the
glass objects.

The top price was $300, paid by Leo-
nello Perrera, for an oak cupboard. Mr.
Perrera also gave $250 for an iron can-
diestick. Mra. G. T. Bhaw paid $135 for
a walnut cupboard; Mra. C, W. Feigen-
span paid $210 for No, 44, a set of
painted chairs, and a pair of lacquered
vases went to Mra Frederick Housman
for $120, The auction continues through-
out the week,

‘Stands for something—

In 1876, at the Centennia] Exposition in Philadelphia,
@ group of forward-looking men met and founded

Library Bureau.

The beginning was most humble.

Even in 1882

there were but three employees in the Library Bureau
organization—the manager, one salesman and an office

boy. Two small second-floor rooms constituted the
L, B. workshop and office.

Today, Library Bureau is the world's largest manu-
facturer of card record and filing equipment — with
seven large factories—branch offices in 49 principal
cities of the United States, England and France.

From the very first,

pioneer and leader.
It 0

the card record desk,

Library Bureau has been both

ated vertical filing, the card record system,

counter-hight units, the L. B,

Automatic index—and practically every worth-while
filing method used in business today.

The L. B. seal, therefore, atands for something. It
etande for progress — it stands for leadership —it stands
for practical usefulness.

Let us arply the practical know-how of 43 years’
experience to the betterment of your own filing methods.
