Borough Presidents Take
Prizes—Riegelmann Asks
$4,572,570 in 1919.

 

With the largest departments yet to
be heard from—Police, Fire and Chari-
ties, to say nothing of Education—the
city’s tentative budget for 1920 is al-
ready many millions in excess of that
for 1919. Most of the increases asked
are for personal service. Some per-
sons predict that it will be impossible
to make a budget that will not be at
least $25,000,000 larger than this year’s
appropriations for the various depart-
ments.

The Street Cleaning Department
asks $243,754 more, half of it for per-
sonal service. The allowance last year
was $11,246,195. The increase asked
by the Dock Department is $696,256
more than in 1919, when it received
$1,146,277.

But the prize is taken by some of
the Borough Presidents. For instance,
President Riegelmann of Brooklyn wants

a total of $4,572,570 for 1920. He got
$3,006,500 in 1919. The increase is
$1,566,070.

This year the Finance Department is
mending $1,397,792. For 1920 it wants
$1,485,982. The Department of Plant
and Structures has asked what it con-
siders a modest increase of $463,684. If
ft gets it its budget next year will be
$2,141,899.

Dr. Jonathan C, Day, Commissioner of

arkets, is not at all backward. His

t thig@ year was $134,191. He
ts $91,692 more than that next year,
$19,578 of it for personal service,

The Department of Correction wants
an increase of $667,722, $161,364 of it
for personal service. The American
Museum of Natural History asks $58,000
more than the $200,000 it received for
this year,

The Metropolitan Museum of Art
Waits $125,000 more than the $175,000
ft had this year. Robert W. De Forest,
president of the board of trustees, writes
that the city has never appropriated
enough money to cover the cost of op-
eration, which in a measure has always
been provided by the trustees. As the
Mayor asks for economy the trustees
have asked only enough for 1920 to
cover half the expenses. ;

“Private generosity in cooperation
with the city has made our New York |
Museum within the short space of fifty |
years one of the greatest museums in
the Western Hemisphere,” wrote Mr. De
Forest. “Private generosity with like |
cooperation bids fair to make it within ,
the next fifty years one of the greatest |
art museums in the world, possibly the |
greatest; but private generosity will not
continue except 'f confident of the con-
tinuance of that cooperation on the part
of the city which the museum has F

 

chived in the past.”

Worcester, Mass., Man Sends $100 for Little Tanner

Children—“The Sun” Duplicates Amount and for
One Week Will Receive Contributions.

 

THE SUN received a letter and check
for $100 yesterday from W. B. Sco-
field of Worcester, Mass., who had
been deeply touched by Tue Sun's edi-
torial article on the tragic death of
Mr. and Mrs. William F. Tanner of
Hubbard Woods, Ill., Mr. Scofield urg-
ing that the money be used for the
benefit of the children of Mr. and Mrs.
Tanner and cf Mr. Tanner’s mother.
To refresh the memories of those who
read the editorial article, and for the
benefit of those who may not have
read it, Tug SuN reprints it here:

Im the Heart of a Good Woman.

Mrs. William Tanner of Hubbard
Woods, Ill, while walking on the
highway at a grade crossing of the
Northwestern Railroad near Chicago,
was caught between two planks as a
heavy train bore down on the spot
where she was held prisoner. Her
husband and a gate tender attempted
to extricate her, but could not. The
engineer threw on the emergency
brakes, but was not able to stop the
train. The flagman persisted in his
efforts to save Mrs. Tanner until the
last possible moment. As he drew
back from the track he was struck
by the steam chest and severely hurt.
Her husband continued in his at-
tempt to free her until the engine
was upon them and death for her
was seen by both of them to be in-
evitable.

As the train neared the doomed
woman her thoughts turned from
herself to her children, her husband
and her husband's mother. Resign-
ing herself to death, she pleaded with
him to desert her, to save himself,
to preserve his own life for the saké
of others. The flagman heard these
pleas. He saw her husband give his -
answer to them. It was to clasp his
wife in his arms and sacrifice his life
with her under the wheels of the
locomotive.

This plain recital of an extraor-
dinary tragedy stirs the mind as well
as the heart. awful alternatives
presented to the husband forced him
a choice all other men may pray to
be spared. On the one hand, his chil-
dren, his family; on. the other; hie
wife, Whom no avaliable human
agency could save. He had no time
to think, some will say, but they have
never been in imminent danger.
When death stares men in the eye
they think quickly. Who ¢an say
what weighing of duty, what ap-
Praisal of human values, he made
while the thundering engine covered
the few seconds which measured his
wife's span of life? We can say that
when he saw her fate was sealed
life as men love it ceased for him.
To survive meant nothing except ex-
istence to bear a burden. To die
meant release from sorrow no man
would face willingly. Was the com-
fort his companionship would give
his wife worth more to William Tan-
ner, worth more to her, than ‘per-
formance of his obligation to their
children, performance of his obliga-
tion to his mother? The decision
was a cruel one to make. There will
be those who will say he failed in
the crisis, that he should have lived,
breadwinner and protector for the
woman who brought him into the
world, for the children he and his

wife brought into the world. But we

count of little worth the condemna-
tory opinions of any who has not
Stood before death with one he loved
and had the choice to make between
dissolution and desertion.

The good woman rings true in the
metal of Mrs. Tanner. Her resigna-
tion to the inevitable came before
either of the men who struggled to
save her would admit it. Her
thoughts turned from herself to
others: her husband, her children,
her husband’s family, Heart and

mind she gave to them. Her body
she forgot. That othera should not
suffer, that others should be saved,

cared for, guarded; these were the
wife's thoughts, the mother's
thoughts, the daughter's thoughts.
There is nothing so fine, nothing so
generous, nothing so wholly free
from dross as the heart of a good
woman,

“The Sun” Adds $100.

THE Sun duplicates Mr. Scofleld’s con-
tribution of $100, thus making $200 as
the beginning of a fund for the children
and mother of Mr. Tanner.

For one week, beginning to-day THe
Sun will give its readers and friends
opportunity to contribute through it to
the fund for the children and for Mir.
Tanner’s mother,

It will report daily the contributions
made and undertake to see that the sum
given through it will be delivered to
the beneficiaries.

Thé children of William and Mary
Tanner are Helena, 6, and William and
Lyman, twins of 4. They have been
taken into the family of their aunt, Mrs.
Francis Tanner Cassidy of Albany, IIL,
who is quoted as saying:

“I shall take them all. We are not
wealthy, but such as we have we shall
share with Will’s children. They will
have the same advantages we give to
our own son.”

In his letter to THe Sun Mr. Scofield
wrote, in part:

The mother of such a man as
Tanner must be a wonderful woman,
and the children of such a family are
entitled to a fair start in the world.

The railroad employee who contin-
ued his effort at the risk of his own
life to rescue Mrs, Tanner is also en-
titled to substantial recognition from
the public. .

I believe that such an example of

' devotion between a man and a woman
and of such courage as was shown
by the railroad man comprise an ad-
venture which should never be for-
gotten.

It {s not only important that the
family of Mr. and Mrs. Tanner should
be assisted and that the flagman
should be shown public appreciation,
but it is equally iniportant that the
people of Illinois, and of the nation,
for that matter, should have im-
pressed upon them the great lesson
of such a splendid example of human
fortitude.

For myself, I should like to eee a
fund collected of sufficient size to
meet the needs of the individuals con-
cerned and also to provide a suitable
tablet in bronze, to be placed in the
State House of Illinois commemo- {|
rating forever this tragedy and its
wonderful lesson.

“That the deed’s self may never quite be

ost,
Its lesson all unlearned by all mankind.”

| Industrial Magnate Agent for

Paris, Sept. 5.—An extensive plot
has been discovered in Vienna, accord-
ing to news just received here, to re-
store the Hapsburgs, and several ar-
rests have been made, including that
of an industrial magnate alleged to
have been acting as the agent of
Count Windischraetz, the go-between
of former Emperor Karl.

A code was found in the prisoner’s
possession which enabled the Austrian
Government to decipher many letters
and telegrams showing the ramifica-

Special Despatch to Tur Sry.

WasuHIncTon, Sept. 5 — Without a
record yote the Senate passed to-day
the dry bill providing for the legal en-
forcement of war time prohibition
throughout the land during the inter-
vening period between the present and
the coming into effect of the constitu-
tional amendment on January 16, 1920.

Owing to the fact that no demand
was made for a roll call the extent of
the opposition to the measure as
modified by the Senate upon the
framework of the moderately drastic
measure passed by ‘the House will
never be known. There was disclosed
in the course of the debate, however,
a remnant of the opposition which for
a century fought against the steady
growth of national prohibition senti-
ment up to the final victory a year ago
when the Seventeenth Amendment
was sent to the Legislatures of the
States for ratification.

Shields Is Voted Down.

Toward the close of the considera-
tion of the dry Dill to-day a contest
was precipitated by Senator Shields
(Tenn.), who offered an amendment pro-
viding that the provisions of title one
of the proposed law, referring to the
enforcement of war time prohibition,
should..not apply extept to States in
whith no Gemodilization “encampments
are

situated,

The only State in the Union unpro-
tected by its present State, laws against
the manufacture, sale and distribution
of alcoholic beverages in which there
is a demobilization point is New York.
Therefore New York was the only State
to which the proposed law would apply
in the interval between now and the
constitutional limitation becoming ef-
fective.

“Why should forty-four States
penalized to carry out the spirit of the
wartime prohibition law?” demanded
Senator Shields, who had said previous-
ly that there were three other wet States
where the law would apply, but no
States in which there were demepiliza-
tion camps.

Senator Wadsworth (N. Y.) said that
within a month or six weeks demobiliza-
tion would be accomplished in full.

“Does the Senator think that the peace |
treaty will be ratified within a month!

or six weeks?’ asked Senator Pomerene
(Ohio), wno was referring to Presi-
dent Wilson's statement that peace could
not be declared until the treaty has
been ratified.

“I do not,” said Senator Wadsworth,
who added that there was nothing to
prevent the President declaring demo-
bilization complete without reference to
the peace treaty, “inasmuch as every-
bedy knows peace has arrived.”

The vote on Senator Shields’s sug-,
gested amendment disclosed him to be
its only serious supporter.

An amendment by Senator Jones
(Wash.) prohibiting importation or sale
of intoxicating beverages in the Panama
Canal Zone was adopted without:a di-
vision, but the Senate rejected Senator
Curtis's (Kan.) amendment which would
have taken from the enforcing authori-

ties discretion as to imposition of pen- |

alities ranging from fines of $100 to

; $1,000 to imprisonment from thirty days

to a year.

Defines Intoxicating Liquor.

As it passed the Senate to-day, the dry |

bill is but little changed in outward form
from the measure passed by the House.
It comprises three sections, the | first
dealing with enforcement of war time
prohibition, the second with enforcement
of the constitutional amendment and the
third with the production and distribu-
tion of alcohol for use in industry and
art.

Intoxicating liquor is defined as any

beverage containing one-half of 1 per
cent. of alcohol or more.
Control is reposed in the Commis-

sioner of Internal Revenue, who will

STEEL UNIONS’

to Wilson for Answer Be-

CALLS SITUATION ‘AWFUL’

Special Despatch to Tae 8cx s

WASHINGTON, Sept. 5.—Samuel Gom-
pers, president of the American Feder-
ation of Labor, and the executive com-
mittee of the iron and steel workers
international unions passed up to the
President to-day the problem of pre-
venting a nationwide strike in the iron
ang steel industries that would go far
toward ending the labor truce and up-
Setting the efforts at stabilization and
price reduction that are under way.

In a telegram to the President Mr.
Gompers and the officers of the iron
and steel unions declared that the sit-
uation was beyond their control, and
they passed the problem and the re-
sponsibility to the White House. They
asked for immediate action, indicating
that something would have to be done
betore next Tuesday.

President Wilson had given assur-
ance to the labor leaders at the White
House last week that he would do all
possible with respect to preventing the
impending strike in the iron and steel
industry. It was expected that he would
invite Judge Gary, chairman of the
board of the United States Steel Cor-
poration, and other officials of that or-
ganization to Washington. Presidents
of the twenty-four international unions
in the steel trade will be in Washington
Tuesday and the labor leaders asked for
® reply from the President before that
day.

The telegram signed by Mr. Gompers
and the executive committee follows:

Though there is no real ground for
going behind Secretary Redfield’s state-
ment that he has had no row, it ts
known that he has several times been
compelled to accept the overturning of
his plans and the taking from his hands
of important work and credit for many
large accomplishments. Though his
resignation was frequently rumored
there was generally no basis for such
rumors. At one time when the Sec-
retary was ready to quit the President
urged him to stay, “assuring full sup-
port and cooperation.

The one instance tn which the Sec-
retary of Commerce did not have ful!
support was when the industrial board
of the Department of Commerce at-
tempted to stabilize steel prices. Seo-
retary of the Treasury Glass, Attorney-
General Palmer, Director-<General of
Railroads Hines and other Administra-
tion officials combined in a fight on
the board on the ground that it had
gone too far. President Wilson was
in Purope at the time, and when Direc-
tor-Genera!l Hines, supported by other
Cabinet members, refused to accept the
findings of the board it quietly went out
of existence. That was many months
ago, and at that time Secretary Red-

The result of this defiance by Mr.
Wilson is that Senatorial speeches in
the Senate and outside will be started
immediately. Senator Reed (Mo.) wil!
fire the first volley at Akron, Ohio, on
Sunday. Two days later Senator
Wadsworth (N. Y.) will address a
gathering of veterans of the First Di-
vision at Salem, N. Y., with the league
and Its shortcomings as his topic.

That same day or the next Senator
Harding (Ohio) will talk in the Senate.
He will answer the President's sug-
gestion that the business of the other
ccuntries will become America's busi-
ness through the operation of the pro-
posed league.

The greatest anti-league demonstra-
tion, however, has been reserved for
Wednesday, when Senators Johnson
(Cal.), Borah (Idaho) and McCormick
(11.) will speak from the same plat-
form in Chicago. These three will
dissect the league and plead America’s
Tights as the great vital consideration
demands defeat of the President's
demand for ratification of the treaty
and the league “without the dotting of

i ‘l’ or the crossing of a ‘t’.”

| Te Speak in Middle West.

After the jecint appearance of the
three Senators they will separate for
further speechmaking in other sec-
tions of the middle West. Senator
|Johnson’s engagements include In-
dianapolis on September 11, St. Louis
or September 12 and Kansas City on
September 13. Senator Borah will
hunt the “mild reservationists” in their
}lair, plunging right into Minnesota,
speaking at St. Paul, Minneapolis and
; herhaps Duluth. The duration of his
Stay in the territory of Senators Nel-
Son and Kellogg will depend upon how
speedy shall the consideration of
the treaty in the Senate and how ur-
gent the call for his return hither.
Senator Poindexter (Wash.) an-
nounced to-day his anti-league speak-
ing dates. He will appear in Dunkirk,
N. Y., September 11, Pittsburg Sep-
tember 17 and Long Island City Sep-
tember 27.

This ds all the result of the first day's

effort by President Wilson to convince
the country that it does not appreciate
the benefits and blessings of the League
of Nations. It reflects the first precipi-
‘tation of sentiment engendered by the
nation-girdling excursion in defence of
his acts and those of his subordinates
[on the American peace delegation.
} The Senate has been plainly aroused
{by the initial utterances of the Chief
Magistrate, and there were murmurings
in other quarters of the Senate to the
{effect that if the President continued
his statements that the treaty was not
understood by the ratifying body others
would follow in the campaign to make
the falsity of this suggestion clear.

Senator Sherman (I!1), commenting
on the statements made by the Presi-
dent in his Columbus speech, said that
the report of the speech in the Columbus
Citizen stated that when the President
declared that the labor assembly would
meet in Washington “whether the treaty
is ratified by that time or not,” he
; ‘thrust out his jaw as he made the grim

Later, after Secretary Redfield had tni-

the War Trade Board, one of his crea-

placed under the State Department.
Later the Secretary evolved plans for
industrial aid to Ruesia that were ex-

country, but after plans were completed
for a great industrial and agricultural
commission to give friendly aid they
were abandoned.

By a Staff Correapondent of Tus Sex.
St. Lovis, Sept. 5.—President Wil-
| son’s intellectuals ares beginning te
| whirl off sparks as he travels west-
ward trumpeting the League of Na-
tions to a people who appear to be
thinking about cabbages rather than
kings, His temperature and- temper
have mounted steadily as he passes
through the gentres of population.

Whether the cause be the curious
apathy with which his person and
his selected defence of the “league of
fine passions” have been received in
the Central States, or whether it may
be put down to his own growing un-
derstanding of the task he faces,
the fact remains that he grows in-
creasingly resentful of opposition, in-
creasingly sharp of epithet.

In Columbus, the first day, he was
content to refer to his opponents as
“misrepresenters.” In Indianapolis
last night he shouted into the tele-
graph instruments (much more than
into the ears of his immediate audi-
ence) a challenge to all amenders
and reservationers to “put up or shut
up.” And here in St. Lowis, on the
second day, at the luncheon tendered
to him by the Chamber of Commerce.
he branded “certain gentlemen”
presumably Senator Lodge, Senator
Knox, Senator Brandegee «and all
others of their opinion—as “contemp
tible quitters.”

 

Audience Somewhat Shocked.

His mildest terms, indeed, for such
as distrust a treaty without reserva
tions was “dreamers” and “trade
ruiners,”.and not “the kind of Ameri
can I am.” And he was at great
pains to inform his audience by
violent inference that he was no
dreamer, that he was a trade builder
and protector and that he was a
sample of the straight, old fashioned.
simon pure George Washington-Abra-
ham Lincoln brand of American, His
audience of manufacturers, merchants
and bankers seemed to think that the
“contemptible quitters” epithet was
fairly rough stuff. popping from the
cultured Wilsonian vocabulary, and
heads were shaken over it as heads
were shaken in Indianapolis over the
“put up or shut up” defiance,

came to this: That it was impossi-

ble to talk sensibly in Washington
about the league because a lot of

troublesome persons surrounded the
whole matter with a mist of words
difficult for even omniscience to pene-
trate, and because these same relics
of a past age keep harping on three

or four more unessential detalle of
the “league of fine passions,” such as
Article X., Shantung, Ireland and
withdrawal, rather than on the large
noble aspects of the pact which touch
the heart of the world. This, with
the flat siatement that the league is
sure to prevent war because of the

boycott weapon ready to be employed
