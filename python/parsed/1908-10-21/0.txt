Specine Charge Is Forgery—Rewe Disap-
peared on Oct. 18 After Trying to
Get a Loan From the Firm--Supposed

A.W. Kilborne & Co. of 40 Wall street,
disappeared 4 week ugo yesterday and
an examination of the firm's books by
expert accotintants convinced his em-
ployers that he had got away with about
$30,000 since the first of January last. A
warrant was obtained on Monday from
Magistrate Droege in the~Tombs court
for his arrest on a charge of one item of
forgery by which he is believed to have
made $2,600. The amount of the defalca-
tion practically has been determined and
the los will have no serious consequences
for the firm.

The firey was organized about 1884, in
which year Allerton W. Kilborne became
a member of the Stock Exchange. The
