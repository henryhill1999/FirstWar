feveral Women Met on leetion Day to
Talk it Over--Promise of All the
Money That Is Needed--Idea ‘Took
Shape After ‘Sun’? Interview With

Allve Smith, the Prebation Officer.

4 hotel for working girls and working
women will soon be built in this olty if the
plans now under consideration are carried
wit. Philanthropy and business will be
combined in the running of the hotel.

4n informal meeting of some of the
women intereated in the project was held
on election day and the plans of a building
were submitted by an architect and dis-
cussed. It seemed to be the general opin-
jon that a building to accommodate 300 to
aw women and girls should be erected.
the architect's estimate of $300,000 cost
gid not seem to be much of an obstacle.
the women interested in the project think
that there will be no difficulty in raising
whatever money is necessary, because as-
sistance has been offered by men _ protni-
nent in the financial world

It waa the social conditions of the pro-
posed hotel that engaged most attention.
On just what linea to run the hotel in order
‘o do the greatest amount of good was
what the women were most anxious to
settle. Jt was decided to hold a formal
rneeting on Dec. 1 and then to organize a

Brooklynites coming to New York over
the Bridge early on Saturday morning
were treated to a beautiful sight. It was |
down upon a white city that they looked. |
Everywhere, as far as the eye could reach,
the roofs had been painted a dazzling white
by that master artist, Jack Frost. He |
had paid his firet formad visit to town in |
the night. |

society for the erection and operation of |

the hotel.

After that meeting the names of those |

actively interested in the movement will
be made public and the erection of the
hotel will be pushed as rapidly as possible.
The idea of such a hotel took shape after
the publication in ‘Tie Sun of an interview
with Miss Alice Smith, the probationary
officer of the Yorkville police court, about
the pitfalls in the way of young women
who are obliged to work for a living and
who have to pay moat of their small wages
for board and lodging. Miss Smith has
had ample opportunity to study social
problems among the poor. She is con-
Rected with the West Side Settlement
House. All the women arraigned in York-
ville court for street walking who are put
on probation are turned over to Miss Smith.
There are from twenty-five to thirty women
arraigned in court daily for being on th
streets

“These women tell me about their lives,”
Misa Smith said yesterday, “and I know
that ifa kind and protecting hand were he!d
out et the critical moment a human
being would be saved from social destruc-
tion. The representatives of the Jaw are
like the law itself—that is,cold. If a police-

for loitering. That is the beginning of her
downward career. A helping hand instead
of a station house cell at that moment © ould
have kept a respectable woman in society.
There is great need of such a place as the
contemplated hotel for respectable girls
of slender means. Magistrate Cornell spoke
to me some time ago about the necessity
of such a house in a great city like ours.
He was impressed by the arrest of a re-
seer young woman who came from

was searching at night for a cheap boardin,
house when an overzealous policeman took
her to the station house.

“T asked Judge Cornell the other day
if he still held the same opinion, and he
said that he waa more firmly convinced
than ever of the need of such a hous» to
save women from the streets. I ttave
talked with a number of people who are
interested in philanthropic work in the
city and they favored the idea. A woman
friend told me that the Rev. Dr. McMahon,
haad of the United Catholic Charities, ap-
proved such a project and declared that
it was one of the greatest needs of the city.
Magistrate Barlow is in warn. sympathy
with the movement. Magistrate Hogan
takes a great interest in the female dere-
licts that are brought before him and al-
wavs holds out a helping band in the way
of fatherly advice whenever he sees a chance
to reclaim one of the lost members of
society. His daughter is active in chari-
table work and the Judge asked me to call
a! his home to talk with his daughter about
the women who came into court. One of
the ladies who attended the conference
on election day came to the court to see
for herself about the women brought there
and to get what I was able to give from
my experience. I know some of the ladies
who are taking an active part in the con-
templated erection of such a hotel. They
are women of sympathetic hearts promi-

|

nent in social affairs and I am sure they |

will make it @ success
“There was some discussion at first as
to whether to have several boarding houses

in diferent paris of the city or to have one |

large hotel. The latter was decided upon,
as it was thought that the influence of the
older women upon the younger ones would
beneficial. The hotel will probably
lw in the neghhorhood of the large depart-
inept stores on the West Side, where so
many girls and women are employed.
Their board at the hotel will probably be
$ or $4 a week. They will have the use of
the hotel laundry when they wish to do up
their collars, handkerchiefs and cuffs and
sich light articles. There wiil be a room
with sewing machines at their service when
they want to do mendin A mimber of
stuc ll reception rooms will be on the first
floor, where the girls may receive friends.
Nothing will be said to the guests about
religion or their family affairs.

“The hotel will be of especial service to
young women coming from the country
or another city for employment. The
knowledge that there is such a home for
respectable girls will be sent out, so that
when a girl comes to the city she may
bring a note from her parish priest or ber
minister and she will fing a home waiting
for her, so that she will not be adrift. ‘The
table board will be good, better than could
\e had in a cheap boarding house. This
can be done because there will be no rent
to pay, and it may be that there will be an
endowment fund.

“Anrhow, the emall charges for board
will probably keep the hotel self-support-
lug. The rooms will be clean and well
ve itilated and the food nourishing.

Turner, ,

 

 

  

Harper's Book ‘News.

The ,
Masquerader

Here isa book made of paper
'and ink like any other hook—but
different. Who shall say wherein
the difference lies?) Who can tell

 

 

 

| just why this book has been run

|away with by the public, why
| the presses are kept continuously
‘busy over it, why the libraries

|
'

| | cannot supply their patrons, nor

| bookstores keep it sufficiently in
‘stock? ‘Ihe fact that it is agreat
| story of a man and a woman with
‘red blood in their veins does not
‘entirely answer the question—
there is more than that to it.
. Other novels languish, Why not
this?

When it was running serially

people kept writing to the editor
‘begging for advance proofs, one
man pleading that he had heart
disease and teared he might die
before itcametoaclose. A reader
of the English Blackwood’s tor
sixty years says: ‘Not since
1 waited feverishly for ‘Monte
Cristo’ to appear have | been so
excited by a story. And Mrs.
‘Thurston has given me what
Dumas did not—a_ perpetually
‘increasing wonder as to how the
adventure is to end.”

The New York Evening Mail

says of the novel:

‘This is a story of a strong man and a strong
woman and their high-handed grasping for hap-
piness in the face of the moral law. The woman,
magnificent in her love, rises above considera-
tions of conventions, above fear, above con-
science, Circumstances give her the right to
' follow the dictates of an overwelming passion.

* * * Jt will take rank with the few really
good books,'’

Already in England and in
America the book 1s being made
into a play, and France and Ger-
many have begun, translating it,

Mark Twain

Seldom has a story made such a wide-
| spread appeal as this little masterpiece by
the great Humoris:—‘*A Dog's Tale.’”
There are both tears and laughter in it,
| Daintily bound in holiday style with illus-
| trations in color.

|

|The Georgians

| Every one will welcome the re-appeate

| ance of Abner Daniel in this new book by
Will N. Harben. Old Abnér made a host

lof friends, who eagerly followed him

| through the pages of «* Abner Daniel ’’—
that delightful story of Georgian life.

The Flower of Youth

fccte can hardly be called a «story °s this
| book by Roy Rolte Gilson; so fleeting it
; so trail of substance; so filled with a
| grace and sweetness that refuse to be
roughly handled or dissected. One ana-
lyzes it, and Jo! it is gone—and one
| vaguely wonders wherein was the charm,"”
News Dork Times.

The Russian Advance

Pre-eminently the one great book on the
| Far Eastern troubles Senator A. |. Beve-
ridge has written not only wisely, but enter-
| tainingly of Russian conditions and factors
Which resulted in the present war.
