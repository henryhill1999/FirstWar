THE LONDON ISSUING BANKS MAKE THE FOLLOWING STATEMENTS IN THEIR PROSPECTUS WHICH

AS BEEN APPROVED BY KOREKIYO TAKAHASHI, ESQ., VICE-GOVERNOR OF THE BANK OF JAPAN, THE
MPERIAL JAPANESE GOVERNMENT'S DULY AUTHORIZED SPECIAL COMMISSIONER IN LONDON:

“This Loanis repayable at par, October 5, 1911, but the Imperial Japanese Government reserves the right to redeem
at par all or any of the bonds at any time, after April 5th, 1907, on giving six months’ previous notice. Partial redemption
to be effected by drawings at the office of the Yokohama Specie Bank, Ltd., London, and the New York Agency of the same
bank, in the usual manner. The bonds will be secured both as to principal and interest by a charge, limited to the £12,000,-
0 and the interest thereon, upon the Japanese Government's customs receipts, subject only to the charge in favor of the
\ existing Loan of £10,000,000 sterling. The Imperial Japanese Government will pay each month one-twelfth part of the
gum required annually for the interest payable on this issue to The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation and to
The Yokohama Specie Bank, Ltd., as representatives of the bondholders, in Yokohama or in London at the option of the
Imperial Japanese Government. Coupons and drawn bonds of this issue will be receivable for their full face value in pay-
ment of customs duties at all the custom houses of the Empire of Japan at the fixed exchange of two shillings one half- |
,penny per yen.” , |
” “The average annual yield of the customs receipts of the Empire of Japan, as officially stated, for the five years 1899- |
: 4900 to 1903-4 was 15,891,458 yen =£1,822,283. The yield for the year 1903-4 was 17,378,902 yen =£1,774,035; the exchange is |
i ‘taken at two shillings one halfpenny per yen. A revised and increased tariff came into operation on the first of October, |

1904, and this, it is expected, will largely augment these receipts.”

; PERIAL JAPANESE GOVERNMENT TO ISSUE THE ABOVE LOAN AND HEREBY OFFER

NEW YORK, October Sist, 1904

 

To the Holders of Voting Trustees’ Certificates for
First Preferred Stock, Second Preferred Stock
and Common Stock of Reading Company:

By the agreement dated February 1, 1897, under which the above-mentioned
Voting Trustees’ Certificates were issued, it was provided, among other things,

that: ‘

“On the first day of January, 1902, if then the Reading Company for two
“consecutive years shall have paid four per cent. per annum cash divi-
“dend on its First Preferred Stock, and, if not, then 60 soon as such divi-
“dend shall be so paid, and upon surrender of any stock trust certificate
“then outstanding, the Voting Trustees will, in acoordance with the terms
“hereof, deliver therefor corresponding proper certificates of stock of the

“Reading Company.”

On June 15, 1904, the Board of Directors of Reading Cempany declared a divi-
dend of two per cent. upon the First Preferred Stock, payable September 9, 1004.
The payment of this dividend, being the second dividend of two per cent. paid dur-
ing the year 1904, two dividends of two per cent. each having previously been paid
during the year 1903, fulfills the condition limiting the period of the Voting Trust
as above set forth, and it therefore becomes the duty of the Voting Trustees to
arrange for the delivery of stock of Reading Company in exchange for the Voting

Trustees’ Certificates now outstanding.

We give notice that, on and after December 1, 1904, we shall cease to issue Vot-
ing Trustees’ Certificates, and we have arranged for the delivery of stock of Read-
ing Company in exchange for such certificates which may then be outstanding.

On and after December 1, 1904, holders of the present Voting Trustees’ Certifi-
cates bearing the registration of the Central Trust Company of New York are re-
quested to present their certificates at the office of Messrs. J. P. Morgan & Com-
pany, Transfer Agents of the Voting Trustees in New York, and certificates bearing
the registration of the Pennsylvania Company for Insurance on Lives and Grant-
ing Annuities, Philadelphia, to Measrs. Drexel & Company, Transfer Agents of the
Voting Trustees in Philadelphia, who will be prepared to deliver certificates of stock
of Reading Company in exchange for the same. *

One hundred echedules per diem will be received at each Transfer Office.

No transfers of Voting Trustees’ Certificates will be made after November 30th,
1904. All certificates surrendered must be properly endorsed in blank by the regis-

tered holder thereof.

Holders transmitting certificates by mail will please indicate the name in which
Stock Certificates are to be issued and whether they wish such certificates sent
by registered mail or by express at their expense.

WOMAN LEADS “IN MINING.

MRS. LANE SUCCESSFUL ON A
QUARTZ LEDGE IN ALASKA.

 

Twenty Stamps Now Dropping on Her
Propérty, Located Only Two Years
Ago—Nevada’s New Gold Field Con-
tUnues to Show Excellent Results.

SEaTTLe, Wash., Nov. 7.—It remained for
an enterprising and energetic woman of
California to open up and demonstrate the
value of the quartz ledges of Nome. When
Mrs. Charles Lane bought a mere prospect
on Anvil Creek and developed it to a stage
where she thought ten stamps would handle
the ore, she started the stamps and then went
to her home in San Francisco. Returning
to Nome last spring, she found some good
returns, and the ground opened to an extent
demanding ten additional stamps, with ore
enough blocked out to keep them dropping
steadily for two years. These stampe were
put in. Mrs. Lane came down on the last

trip of the steamer Oregon, on her way to her
San Francisco home, several hundred thou-
sand dollars better off than when she took
the little gold prospect less than two years

ago.

The strike in Little Creek continues the
absorbing topic of cabin and camp in Alaska.
This property was discovered by J. C. Brown
less than a month ago, and he is now taking
out an average of $5,000 a day with eight
men. The gold is taken from a shaft at a
depth of 40 feet, and those who have been
Received to see it pronounce it phenomenal.

round adjoining the Brown claim is in great
demand, as hi as $100,000 being offered
in cash for a claim: P. D, Winter, one of
the pioneer miners of the district, sold out
for $100,000, and again reinvested in the same
district, paying big prices for the claims,
Thee mines will be worked vigorously all
Ww er.

Charles Lane of San Francisco, who is in-
terested in the Nome mines, and who has
spent a large amount in development, has
come out to spend the winter. He reports
the production of the district fully up to that
of last season—-$1,000,000—regardiess of water
shortage and other difficulties. He looks
for a much larger output next year, and ex-
pregees confidence in the future of the dis-

ric

Reports from the Solomon River country
are of cheerful character, and mining opera-
tions there are being conducted on a larger
scale. One company, the Alaska-Boston
Construction, has recently acquired twenty-
seven claims that will go $2 a yard. They
have seven miles of ditch with 2,300 miner's
inches of water, all of which will be made
available next spring.

Miners enga in the York peninsula
tin mines have demonstrated the value and
extent of several of the principal claims and
are satisfied with the results. They have
sent out about 100 tons in fulfilment of prom-
ise to two of the Puget Sound smelters which
were under agreement to work the ore for
$10 a ton; but when ore came down on the
last steamer, the price of reduction was ad-
vanced to $90 a ton. This ore will average
from 40 to 60 per cent. and is far superior
to the product of the mines in Wales. It is
demonstfated beyond any doubt that the
veins are true and the ore is there in quanti-
ties to last for years. It will require a large
smelting plant to reduce thié tin, and it will
be necessary to establish it on Puget Sound,
where coking coal can be obtained easily.

NEVADA.

RENO, Nov. 7.-The new Clark road from
Salt Lake to Los Angeles will open up many
of the best old time nyining camps in eastern
Nevada, as a branch line will be built from
Caliente north to Pioche, Ely and Cherry
Creek, ending at Wells, on the main line of
the Southern Pacific. In all these camps
arrangements are being made to reopen old
silver mines which have been shut down
for years because freight rates did not permit
shipping ore to smelters. Ely is coming to
the front as a copper camp and Cherry Creek
and Pioche have good silver mines, which
will pay if ore does not have to be hauled
long distances by mule team, :

There is great activity at Caliente, Nev.,
and many transfers of mining property have
Deen made during the past month. Some

oof strikes have been made, John P.
Burwell and Morton Sykes in the Galena
group have struck a four foot ledge of gold-
silver ore at sixty-seven feet depth, which
assays $100, In the Lone Star mine on Virgin
River free milling quartz has been found
which assays $56.20 a ton. The Twin Peaks
group of mines have_been sold to Goodwin
and Burbank of San Diego for $30,000. The
five foot ledge has ore ranging from $5 to $65
in gold and from 67 to 240 ounces of silver a
ton. Th: richest find in the district was
made by Max Friedman and Leon Busby in
the Snow Drift mines on Virgin River. In their
tunnel at a depth of 230 feet, they hive struck
a body of coarse gold ore which assave $1,000
to the ton.e The vein is a true fissure between
granite walls.

Zeb Kendall from Springville, Utah, ig one
of the lucky owners of a rich lease of the Janu-
ary mine at Goldfield. He and his associates
have atruck ore which assays $3,800 a ton.
The ledge is 4 feet wide and is only fifty feet
below the surface, so that it can be easily
worked.

A shipment of 1,133 tons of ore was made
last week from Tonopah to the smelters at
Reno, Salt Lake and San Francisco. Of
this amount the big Tonopah company
shipped 610 tons and 58 sacks of very hig
grade ore and the Tonopab-Belmont 70 tons.
From Goldfield the Bowes-Kernick lease
shipped 185 tons of sacked ore and the Lin
lease, 63 tons of sacked ore.

CALIFORNIA,

San Francisco, Nov. 7.—The big bend of
the Trinity River, one mile from Lewiston
is to be mined for the fold that lies in the bed
of the river. A tunnel 1,350 feet long will be
dug throwgh the mountain at the neck of the
bend. Through this tunnel the water of the
river will be taken, thus leaving bare the bed
of the river for a mile and a half. About
half of the channel is virgin ground and this
is more than 20 feet deep and very rich in gold.

On the 100 foot level of the Sierra Gold
Mining Company's Groveland mine a promis-
ing strike has been made in the last drift,
A little of the ore was worked out in a hand
mortar and found to run several hundred
dollaretotheton. There isa surplus of water
and workine can be done until next season.

Work will be begun at once on the 750 ton
smelter forthe Mammoth Mining Company
at Kennett, Shasta county. The site will be
half a mile south of Kennett and the Southern
Pacific Company will run a spur track to the
smelter,

COLORADO.

COLORADO SPRINGS, Nov. 10.—The No-
vember output at Cripple Creek will be limited
by the capacity of ore treatment plants,
These are swamped with ore. The present
shipment rate must soon slacken or the mill
capacity increase. The latter {s most likely,
although wpeny of the mines will be sunk
deeper and other development work will
done until the output can be treated.

The American Smelter and Refining Com-

any is planning extensive additions to
the bie plants in Denver and Pueblo, which
will greatly increase their capacity. Cyanide
mills are going up in various parte of Cripple
Creek. The United States Reduction and
Refining Company will increase the capacity
of its chlorination mills at Colorado oy:

The Michardo company has begun the con-
struction of a cyanide mill on its Summit
claim on Ironclad Hill. The plant will have
thirty-five tons a day initial capacity. The
ores in that district average from to $8
a ton, which will afford fair profit when
treated by the cyanide process.

A phenomenal strike has been made in the
Gold Coin at a depth of 1,100 feet in what is
known as the Parallel vein. The ore body
is large and the values range close to $80
aton. Stringers of sylvanite abound in the
vein matter. The workings have attained
a depth that corresponds with 1,500 to 1,800
feet in Stratton’s Independence and Port-
land mines, which are located higher oP on
Battle Mountain, while the Gold Coin is’ at

its base.
ARIZONA.

Bisper, Nov. 6,—The October production
of the Calumet and Arizona copper mine was
2,611,000 pounds. Six hundred men are em-
ployed at the mine, many of whom are in
deadwork. Development is proceeding with
rapidity through this and adjacent mines
of the same group, and the ore bodies being
opened into are serge and rich.

Among the ated C. & A. companie's
reatest Pevelogment is now in progress in
a 8. & P. and P. & D. The former has six

crews in each shift, at as many levels, enlarg-
ing the small 2-compartment Cole shaft i
an 8 by 24 shaft. As soon as stations can be
cut on the firat to the fifth levels these will
be enlarged also, On the 1,100 foot level,
th north and south, ore is being cut. At
4 . large bodies of oxides and native
copper were encountered recently and have
extended several hundred feet into the Sunny-
side claim. At Calumet and Pittebure the
sinking of the F coment msent shaft pro-
aees a foot daily, and the pumps are lift-
ne 4,000,000 gallons of water from
1,000 feet. _¢ has been out for the first
time in the Junction Develo t Company's
drifts, and it is a high ie, from 5 to 9 per
cent. Drifte connecting Junction and ©. &
P. shafts, 3,000 feet apart, will be cut through
this week.

MONTANA,

Burra, Nov. 6—Amalgamated officials fh
that the negotiations looking toa transfer ofa
of the Heinze interests in Montana have not
been abandoned, but that they are held in
abeyance pending an examination of the

roperties and titles, upon which work has

een going on for more than three months,
The list.of properties furnished by Heinze
himself covers more than 400 descriptions,
and includes all of the stock and properties
of the Montana Ore Purchasing, Corra-Rock
Island, Nipper Consolidated, Hypocka, -
mont, Minnie Healey, Johnstown, Chili Gold
Mining and Basin Reduction companies, to-
gocher with the Heinze holdings of Unit
pher. and the stock in the Amalgamat
companies, which has been employed
{ot years to harass the Amalegmated by
tigation, The option which has been given
phn W. Gates of New York calls for a price
of $8,000,000, though Mr. Gates has stated to
Mr. Rogers that the properties could probably
be acquired for $5,000,000 or $6,000,000.

A new cyanide pant has been built near
the Lexington mill on the Walkerville hill,
in Butte, for the purpose of treating 1,090
tons of tailings from the mill ‘The

lant started work a few days a on two

wenty-five ton lots. of the rock. he plant
contains, besides all the other necessary
machinery for cyaniding, eleven twenty-
five ton tanks, The plant is the only one
of ite kind in Silver Bow county. The enter-
rise is in charge of F. W. Link, a man who
8 thoroughly conversant with the process
of separating gold and silver from tailings.
Last summer he made an investigation o!
the Lexington dump and demonstrated that
he could savea large percentage of themineral
value in the waste. A company was formed
of New York and Butte men, and
pied plant is the result. The Lexington

{lings are rich in both silver and gold. ey
were deposited in the gulch several years ago
when the mill was in operation. At that time
the facilities were very imperfect for the sav-
ing of metals and much gold and silver es-
caped to the gulch The tailings are from
15 to 20 feet deep. Horses will be used in
transporting the material from the gulch
to the plant. From the top of the planr the
tailings will be carried through chutes to the
vats, The treatments made have proved
satisfactory.

WYOMING.

CHEYENNE, Nov, 11.—What is believed to
be radium pitchblende has been found in
the Silver Crown Mountains, twenty-five
miles west of Cheyenne. John Morris, @
railroad brakeman, who made the fifd, says
he has between one and two hundred pounds
of the precious ore in sight, and be believes as
much more can be taken from the crevices of
the rocks, Local experts pronounce the
material the genuine radium pitchblende,
but in order to get the best analysis possible
samples have been sent to New Jersey ex-

rte for tests. If the ore should prove to

as valuable as that found in Nevada re-
cently, when 4 miner in two hourg took out
$45,000 worth of the material, Morris will
find himself a very rich man, and with little
effort on his part. _

The bonds of the North American Copper
Companz. which has been operating the
famous pete Hager copper mine, Wyom-
ing Southern aerial tramway, smelter, water
works, electric and power pant, Copper State
Bank and other enterprises in the Grand
Encampment copper mining district of south-
ern Carbon county, Wyo., will be purchased
by an Eastern syndicate, and operations in
the district will be resumed ona large scale.
Experts recently examined the properties
of the company and reported that there is
$2,400,000 worth of high grade ore in sight
in the mine, and that the smelter, tramwey
and other enterprises can be made to pay
large dividends. Among the purcngsers of
the bonds are a number of the old stock-
holders, who are increasing their holdings.
All stock held by Wyoming men will be
bought up. bee

The ore from the Ferris-Haggerty averages
better than 35 per cent. copper, while many
tons of ore have been treated that averaged
better than 52 per cent. copper. The ore
carries a small quantity of gold and silver.

With the reorganization of the North Am-
erican,Company comes the report that the
Union Pacific will build a branch line from
Walcott to Grand Encampment, Via Saratoga,
The line was surveyed several years ago and
the grade stakes set. It was with the distinct
understanding that the Union Pacific would
build the line that the New York capitalists
took up the North American Copper Com-
pany's bonds.

WASHINGTON.

SEATTLE, Nov, 7.—Within the last month
developments in State Creek have opened the
eyes of mining men who have stayed with
the district through good and bad report for
years. The strike is in one of the old mines
and is from twenty to thirty feet in widtb,
the ore, which is free milling, assaying $50
a ton. There is said to be enough in sight
to keep all the stamps in the district busy
for years. This is a gold district, and all of the
ore is free milling. At present there are
three smal] mills operating.

Improvements are also reported on Silver
Creek, one of the oldest and most important
mining districts on the western slope of
Cascade Range. Ohio and Pennsylvania
capital has recently become interested, and
the Montana and Washington claims have
been demonstrated to a depth of negrly 600
feet. This is a copper group, the ledge being
ten feet in width, the ore going $25 on an
average. This is the greatest depth at-
tained by any mine west of the Cascades,
excepting one in Great Salt Lake cistrict, which
is also owned and developed by Eastern
men.

BRITISH COLUMBIA,

SFATTLE, Wash., Nov. 7.--London capital
is investigating the iron, gold and copper
mines on the west coast of Vancouver Isiand,
and a number of properties changed hands
last week. This part of the Province, while
it has been slow in development, possesses
merit, and the mines, which are mostly on
tide water, should be able to handle all their
ores very cheaply. New strikes are reported
on the Dewdney and Anderson properties
--gold, copper and iron—and Montana capital
is looking them up.
