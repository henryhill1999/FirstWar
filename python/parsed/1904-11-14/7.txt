From the speculative point of view the
outlook in the stock market is still, cer-
tainly, for higher prices. The aspect of
general business is unchanged, and if
not wholly favorable is nearly eo. Rail-
road earnings are making good showings
and the weekly record of bank clearings
and collections is well up to the normal
standard in such things. The mercantile
trade is demurring a little, perhaps, at the
mildness of the weather, and conservative
people in the iron and stee] business are
venturing the opinion that the stock market
has exaggerated somewhat the improve-
ment in the business, present and prospec-
tive. But all these matters are of small
account beside the one great stimulating
influence on which Wall Street relies, a
seemingly unlimited supply of money
available for speculative uses at a merely
nominal rate of interest. This has long
been the mainstay of the present upward
movement in security quotations, and while
{t 80 continues and no new unfavorable fac-
tor in the situation develops stocks will,
doubtless, continue to advance. It is use-
jess to argue with Wall Street speculators
in their present frame of mind that this
situation is temporary or that if it is not:
temporary and money is to remain heaped
up at the financial centres because businéss
does not require it then it is no time for any
one to be buying stocks. Wall Street is only
impressed by what immediately confronts
it, and what confronts it is easy money. Few
people recall, perhaps, how long this spell
of easy money has lasted. Save during the
first two weeks of the year call money in
Wall Street has only loaned on one or two
occasions in 1004 as high as 8 per cent.
With the exception of loans made in the
fortnight described, it is doubtful if as much
asa million dollars has been put out in this
city in the present year on call at rates
higher than 2% per cent., and making all
due allowances, it must be said that this
excessive and prolonged cheapness of
money atill remains something of a mys-
tery. Itis not sufficiently explained by the
addition to the volume of our circulating
medium of $156,000,000 during the year, by
the accumulation of money here owing to
the “bidding” of our banks for country
deposits or by the supposed disuse of funds
in general business. According to all
sources of information, business in the
Western and Southern portions of the
country and in the East and North, save in
New England, is about as brisk asit usually
is, Ever since the 1st of July bank loans
here have gone on expanding under the
rising movement in prices of stocks and
bonds, and anadvance, not quite so striking,
but still great, in the price of commodities,
until they are now greatly above all past
records. It is said that commission
houses in Wall Street are not borrowing
money on a very large scale for the purpose
of “carrying” stocks and that the stores of
share certificates in their posseasion are
small; but it is clear that somebody is bor-
rowing money on this account, nevertheless,
and that, with prices of stocks $25 a share
higher the market through than they
were on Jan. 1 the borrowing must
be much heavier than it was on the date
named. The bank surplus here stood on
Saturday at a total below the average at
this time of year. The student of Stock
Exchange history may search it in vain
for asimilar record when, with a bank situa-
tion as disclosed, with such demands upon
our hoard of gold addressed to us, with a
Government call upon the banks for a large
sum of money impending, and with a gigan-
tic home speculation in progress, money
still pressed upon those who desired to
gamble with it in the stock market for any
and every purpose on such paltry terms as
those now offering. The idea that there isa
conspiracy on the part of great financial in-
terests to keep money cheap, with the end in
view of getting the public into the stock mar-
ket and of ynloading upon them holdings of
! securitiesjiong painfully carried, is, of course,
| absurd, although the attitude of certain
| banks has at times seemed to lend color to

this theory. Ordinary financial criticism is,
/in fact, wholly in the dark regarding
| this matter, because of one circumstance,
namely, the closed ledgers of our trust
| companies. We now know only half of the
truth regarding the local financial situa-
tion. If it should be found, for in-
stance, that there had been—for reasons
that are needless to discuss—a transfer of
loans from banke to trust companies under
conditions which never before sufficed to
bring this transfer about, a reenforcement
of the bank position by reserves of invisible
credit which were never before asked to
work for such emal] pay, the puzzle would
be solved. However it all may be, the
essential fact remains: money at 2 or 2%
per cent. to whoever wants it. As long as
this holds, railroad stocks yielding a 4 or
3% per cent. return are cheap even if they
were thought dear when selling at a price
which made them yield 5% per cent. less
than a twelvemonth ago, and even if the
varying price suggests that some time it
may vary down as well as up. As long
as this holds, industrial shares may be
bought at a price which makes them afford
a far smaller income to the purchaser than
was thought safe or conservative a few
months since with due consideration of
their known volatile earnings and unstable
character; and one may buy freely and in
large quantity any cat and dog stock traded
in in Wall Street, even jf it is selling for
five times what it is worth, for the chances
are that it will sell for six times what it is
worth before the boom is over and brokers
will carry it meanwhile for almost nothing.
From an investment point of view the out-
look is, of course, not so inspiriting. The
investor contemplating a purchase of stock
at ruling prices knows that if a great revival

as to extinguish the disparity now presented

“coups,” not to mention others of the same
kind, great stockholding interests no longer
dare in the degrae that they onoe did, to
part in the stock market, even with the
utmost secrecy and for a limited time, with
actual control of their corporations, Cau-
tions of this nature, however, elther a tight
money market or poor business speedily
dispel; and these charm away, too,as bya
fairy wand, the hobgoblin stock speculators
who would make midnight raids upon the
shares, There is another fact, also, which is in
the investor's mind at present, or, if it is not,
ought tobe. The national election has dem-
onstrated, as is now universally admitted,
that the electopal contest four years from
now will be between the forces of conserva-
tism and radicalism, under whatever party
banners they may cluster; and that, while
the exact issues of the contest cannot now
be framed, the battle itself will in all prob-
ability be as serious an affray of the kind as
our country has ever known. The most
significant result of the election is, in the
opinion of many observers, not the vast
majorities given to Mr. Roosevelt but the
increase in the Socialist vote from less
than 98,000 four years ago to more than
000,000 at the present time. There is, of
course, small force in the ‘argument that
stock market prices should already begin
to anticipate a faraway etruggle. . But what
effect upon political party policies, upon na-
tional and State legislation, and especially
upon the conduct of the present national ad-
ministration, wil] knowledge of this ap-
proach ing conflict have? Summed up in
ajfew words, are we likely to have soon “a
moderate revision of the tariff” undertaken
by the party now in control, with the object
of lessening the power of their adversaries in
the battle four years away? If this event
is probable, it has a very manifest bearing
upon the stock market, at least upon the
market for various industrial securities.

The election news last week was, of course,
the only great news that Wall Street had,
and what happened was eo thoroughly
expected—save in the size of the magorities
rendered—that the stock market by no
means “boiled” when the result was an-
nounced. There was, on the contrary, a
good deal of profit taking. The market
during the week did not at all change its
character. There was a perceptible in-
crease in outside public support of the
speculation, but most people who had oc-
casion to familiarize themselves with what
was going on were inclined to speak of the
entrance of the public into the market
as a future rather than a present develop-
ment. The fact is unquestionable that,
whatever may be the case in the future,
the public in its immediate attitude toward
Wall Street is cold, cautious, discriminating:
and timid. The market is still one of enor-
mous, excited professional speculation
which has not yet, apparently, reached its
climax. It is a market in which profes-
sional operations for the decline have
practically ended, a market whose progress
those who are not in sympathy with it have
almost entirely ceased to oppose. It is
a market which exemplifies as much as any
that has ever been seen in Wall Street the
truth that to make money by speculation
in securities one must study fully as much
as the facts regarding the various proper-
ties dealt in on the Stock Exchange the pre-
vailing state of professional and public
sentiment. When waves of buying or
gelling such as that nay exhibited in the
financial district have” been excited, i,
is idle totalk about the intrinsic merits
of this or that corporate proposition, to
discuss values or philosophize concern-
ing economic principles in any way. The
only thing for the speculator to do, if he
is bound to do something, is to push his boat
out into the stream along with the others,
and to trust to his lucky star to bring him
safe again to the shore; knowing perfectly
well, however, that the ourrent is running
to Niagara, and that such is ite fascination
that, once one is carried upon it, all thought
of Niagara disappears.
