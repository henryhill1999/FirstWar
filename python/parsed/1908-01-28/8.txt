Congressman Bannon Says We Not Only
Scores the" Alleged Bad Trust, but
brightens All @ther = Interests—
.¢ More Honesty and Courage Needed.

Watrrpory, Jan. 27.—The annual dinner
and reunion of the Waterbury Business
Men's Association was held at the Elton
o-night, where covers were laid for 230.
the toastmaster was C. F. Chapin, editor

   
  

ee ee eee

. of the Waterbury Amcrican, and the

ss speakers were the Hon. Leslie M. Shaw,
{ , former Secretary of the Treasury; the Rev.
t Dr. A. 7. Conrad of the Park Street Congre-
ny gational Church, Boston; the Hon, Henry

} Bannon, Congressman of Ohio, and the
. Hon. EF. J. Hill, Congressman of the Fourth

jiatrict, Connecticut.

Mr. Shaw discussed the financia! situa-
tion and praised President Roosevelt.
Congressman Hill, while dissenting from
the general view of the President, exoner-
ated him from all blame in the present
panic.

Congressman Bannon laid the blame for
the panic on the great publicity given to
the prosecution of corporations, and the
Rev. Mr. Conrad spoke on “The modern re-
ligion of the square deal,” saying trusts and
combinations have come to atay.

Congressman Bannon spoke in substance
as follows:

While business conditions are far from
aa good as they have been, vet there is con-
solation in the fact that they are not as bad
as they might be.

A year ago shippers were complaining of
the shortage of cara, and demands were made
‘hat the railroads buy thousands of cars,
hundreds of locomotives and build thousands

 

 

of miles of double tracks. To-day thousands
of cars and bundreds of locomotives stand
idle

A vear ago the great influx of immigrants
was causing deep concern not only to the
laboring men with whom they came in com-
petition, but to Congress as well Now these
immicrants are loading to its capacity every
vessel leaving for their native lands

} There must be a reason for this. True, we
; can not always have prosperity, for inflation
is inevitably followed by depression. Every
one knows that a bank can be ruined by

talking about it: and a wilful standerer of a
nancial institution is as bad as is the slan-
derer of a good man or woman.

Sweeping indictments have been made
by persons in authority and by the public
press against certain corporations. In some
cases these criticiams were well founded,
and had they been received in the spirit in
which they were, in some instances at least,
intended no harm could have resulted, but
good would have come out of them, But
unforunately these indictments were not
received in that apirit. When certain great
corporations were attacked in the common
mind the charges made were accepted as
proven against them and against all cor-
porations, Capital is timid and the investor
became alarmed. This suspicion obtained
not only against swollen fortunes and pred-
atory wealth, but against small corporations
and institutions of limited capital: not only
against the big fellow, but against the little

 

fellow: not only against the dishonest man
and corporation, bat against the honest
ones also. And this waa only natural.

The man who had his investment in a small
institution read sweeping accounts of corpo-
rate dishonesty and mismanagement, and
instead of applying these statements (to some
corporation far removed from him he applied
them tothe corporation that was nearest him

Too much publicity has been given to the
prosecution of trusts. I mean by this that

44 there has been entirely too much agitation
before, during and after these prosecutions
We read that certain great corporations are
under investigation After the publie mind
is agitated with that for a while we next hear

that big game is in sight and that seou the

batteries will be turned upon them After
that has made its impression we learn that
an indictment is found. This is followed
by the trial and the results of it thus simple
prosecution of a corporation is magnified
far beyond what is justifiable, In many
instances nothing whatever cAimes of it
The better war would be to jiaintain abso
lute silence and seereey until an indietinent
is found.

The method that has been weed is iike

hunting bears with a bras# band -it not only
frightens off the bears buteversthiog within
earshot. The sweeping charges that have
been made long before the machinery of
the law has been put in motion not only make
success{ul prosecution diMfleult but frighten
those interested in other corporations
, These conditions have affected not oniy
dj those interested but often find their expres
sion in hostile legislation. Beeause one men
has been proved to be recreant to his tro«t
or one corporation has been proved to be
dishonest is no reason why there should be a
q presumption that all corporations are dis-
honest and all business men taworthy of
trust. Without fear of refutation | would
say that the businesa men, the bankers and
M the corporate managers of to-day are jnat
ty us honest as those of any other time, and
i 1! would go further and say that the per-
lf centage of either corporate or
dishonesty is infinitesimal!
here are some things which the country
needs in public life to-day. One is honesty
and another ia courage, not only in Congress
but in the Legislature of every State. By
honesty J do not refer to refusal of bribery,
but the honesty that secures to all interests,
rich or poor, high or low, such legislation as
z will not deprive them of any right
ue And legislators must have courage. Ir is
not courage to attack corporate wealth as

 

Bee such and business men as business men
‘- That is cowardice, inasmuch as it arrays
4 class against elass and produces discord

4 Legislators ought to possess sufficient courage
not only to frankly express their opinions
a but to cast their votes in accordance with
a their opinions regardless of consequences.
a Another important thing is for us to follow
the principles upon which this republic was
founded. If a member of Congress opposes
% a bill because he believes it is unconstitutional
his constituents are apt to say that they
elected him as a legislator and not as a judge:

constitutional doubt should be left to the
judiciary. This view is thoroughly wrong.
The rule of law on this question is fowhere
more.clearly stated than by Judge Ranney,
one of the greatest jurista that ever occupied

the Supreme bench of the State of Ohio. He
said in one of his opinions:
‘The Legislature is, of necessity, in the

firat instance, to be the judge of its own con
stitutional powers. Its members act under an
oath to support the Conatitution, and in every
way under responsibilities as great as the
jndicial officers. Their manifest duty is
never to exercise a _ of doubtful con-
stitutionality. Doubt, in their case, as in

tof the courts, should be conclusive against

il affirmative action. This being their duty,
we are bound in ail cases to presume they
have regarded it: and that they are clearly
convinced of their power to pase a law before
they put it in the statute book.”

And thus I plead to-night for @ return not
Only by Congress but by the Legislatures of
the States to the well beaten paths of our
fathers. Let confidence be again restored in
the business world. Let the demagogues
fi quit preaching that because one corporation
i is dishonest all others@re, Let us not keep
up a constant agitation before, during and
after the prosecution of corporations. Let
honest courage and perfect freedom of action
obtain in all legislative bodies. Let us stand
by the Constitution and again we will see
business moving forward with renewed vigor.

Amendments to the Rate Law.

WasmiNoTon, Jan. 27.—Certain impor-
tant proposed amendments to the Hepburn
railroad rate law were discussed at con-
ferences held to-day at the White House and
at the offices of the Interstate Commerce
Commission, A group of vice-presidents
and traffic managers, representing nine
trunk line railroads, took up with President
Roosevelt the desirability of amending that
feature of the act which becomes effective
on May | prohibiting railways from own-
ing mines or factories along their lines |
that originate traffic. They also directed \
the attention of the President to hard- |
ships that would be inflicted through a
literal enforcement of the law prescribing
a nine hour day for railroad telegraphers.

The President was asked if the Adminis-
tration would not be willing to suspend
the operation of the commodity amendment
to the rate law until a test case could be
carried through the courts. The President
did not give a conclusive.answer. As to
the law prohibiting railways from working
telegraphers more than nine hours in
twenty-four. the President referred his
visitors to the Interstate Commerce Com-
mission.

An _ interview was later held with the
members of that body, who made it clear
that as they viewed the law at present
they had no discretion but to enforces it.
The law provides that no operator, train
despatcher or other employee using the
Seri shall be required or permitted
“to be or remain on duty for a longer period
than nine hours in any twenty-four hour
period in all towers, offices, places and sta-
tions continuously operated night and
day.” The commission will make a final
decision in a day or #0.

Those who talked with the President |
and conferred with the commission were |
C.R. wae of the Frisco lines, J. W. G, Rawn

of the Illinois i ‘entral, H. U. Mudge of the
Rock Island, D. Willard of the pusingies.,
z’ A. Garrett of the Seaboard Air Line,

E. Schaft of the New York Central, W. A.

CONSTRUING INSURANCE LAW.
Opinion on Section Limiting Amount to Be
Expended tn Procuring New Business.

ALBANY, Jan. 2 Attorney-General Jack-
son to-day gave an opinion to Supt. Otto
Kelsey of the State Insurance Department
relative io the interpretation to be placed |
on section 97 of the Armstrong insurance | >
law limiting the amount which may be
expended by life insurance corporations
in procuring new business. There was |!
a difference between the State department
and representatives of large life insurance
companies operating in this State as to |
how this section of the law was to be inter-
preted. The Attorney-General] sustains the |
ruling of Supt. Kelsey in 80 far ae he held
that the amount which the law permits |
to be used shall be computed on the value
of each policy separately rather than on
the aggregate gaina of a company on the |
business of a year.

On another point the opinion of the
Attorney-General differs from the con-
struction of Supt. Keleey. The insurance
companies claimed that under the law ,
they had the right to use for expenses of
new business a part of the premiums pay-
able in the future although the pees
had in fact lapsed. The Attorney-General
holds that this could not be done, but the |
companies were limited to moneys that
actually had been paid in upon the policies
in making their computations '

Supt. Kelsey had ruled that the com-
panies were, limited to a “provortionate |
part” of the amount secured from such
policies. In conclusion the Attorney-Gen-
eral in his opinion says:

“In this discussion i have not referred to
the contention strenuously made before me |
that this constreection may foree life insur-

ance companies doing a non-perticipating
business exclusively to either raise their
rates or retire from the State and that

such a result could not have been contem-
plated by the Legislature. This ia a con-
sideration to be subnitted to the L ogisle-

ture in asking for an amendment to the
statute rather thau to this de artment in
conetruing the statute ast stands, It muy

well be that the jaw should distinguish
between a mutual life insurance comer any
doing participating business exclusively and
a stock company doing a non-r articiy at
ine business exclusively, but the statute
as it now exists makes no such distinction.”

ONION PACIFIC FINANCING,

Nothing New tn Wand at Present, 80 Par as |
an Be Learned, |

4 report that the management of the
Union Pacific was busy on a new financial
plan gained a great deal of currency in the
financial district yesterday. Mr. Harriman
wae not in his office. Among men close
to the company the report was neither
explicitly affirmed nor explicitly denied

“It is not true,” said a financier in a posi-
tion to speak with authority, “thar the
company will do any new financing in the |
near future. On the other hand it is ap-
parent that the market for high grade |
bends and notes is much improved, and |
if the demand for such securities continues,
as is now generally expected, the Union
Pacific may consider it wise to take advan-
tage of the opportunity for advantageous |
financing and engage in new construction |
and improvement work on a large scale. }
Thia phase of the business situation has |
naturally been considered, but there has
been no discussion of the form or time
of any new financing. |

The last Union Pacific flotation was an
issue of $75,000,000 convertible bonda last |
summer. The receipta from the bonds were |
used to reiire a floating indebiednesa of
$69,000,000 remaining at the close of the
last fiscal year on dune 30. Before the |
Union Pacifie financial plan is arranged
it is probable that an anno:mcement will |
be mace of a sale of securities by Mlinois
Central, another Harriman line.

 

ALL THE ery

Demand Increased for the Last of the o8
Millions,

The last of the New York city 4 per cent.
revenue bonds were sold yesterday long in
advance of the time within which the syndi-
cate composed of J. P. Morgan & (o., the
First National Bank and the Nationa! City
Bank had an option. Up to the middle of
last week the syndicate had exercised its
option on $62,000,000 of the $65,000,000, In
the latter part of last week the remainin
$3,000,000 were taken, and it waa the last o
these which were sold yesterday. Through-
out the offering of the bonds the demand
for them was good and it increased rather
than diminished in the closing week of the
sale, Concurrently the market for other
city bonds strengt hened, despite the offer-
ing of the short term és. The offering of the
revenue bonds also proved instrumental
in bringing abont the return of hoarded
money.
