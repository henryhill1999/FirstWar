COURT 10 HEAR DROEGE CASE

MAYOR STARTS 1T TOWARD THE
APPELLATE DIVISION,

He Also Calis for a Night Court Investiga-
tlon-- Magistrates Vote Droege’s Act
“Improper and Reprehensibie,” but
Vall to Approve the Mayor's Part.

Mayor McClellan yesterday sent Corpo-
ration Counsel Pendleton a letter in which
he virtually aska that the case of Magis-
trate Droege, who in’ refusing to resign
suggested that the Mayor institute charges
against him before the proper tribunal,
be brought before the Appellate Divisien.
The letter says:

I desire you to consider this question at
the earliest possible moment and take such
steps as you deem necessary to bring the
matter before the Appellate Division of the
Supreme Court. I suggest, however, that
before preferring charges you consult with
the District Attorney and the proper com-
mittee of the Bar Association, in order that
all those who are interested in investigating
this matter, and in preferring the proper
*harges, may have an opportunity to co-
operate for this purpose.

Earlier in the day the Mayor directed the
Commissioners of Accounts to investigate
the records and books of the night court
and to make a report to him as soon as
possible on the methods which have been
followed in the conduct of the business of
that court. The Commissioners put ctethe
on the job at once.

Meanwhile the Board of City sehen
was considering the Droege case at its
monthly meeting in the West Side Court
Building. Magistrate Butts, having read
a newspaper clipying in which Magistrate
Droege admitted that he had given $250
to a lawyer to give to a free lance reporter
to keep him from publishing an article
relating to the conducting of the business
in the night court, offered this resolution:

Whereas it appears that the said Magistrate
has admitted offering money to suppress
the publication of certain official acts as
performed by him in his administration
of the duties of his office, and that therefore
the judicial impropriety of such act. of offering
said money is the sole question before the
board, therefore be it

Resolved, That this board without hesi-
tation pronounces the act of said Magiatrate
as improper and reprehensible and emphati-
cally condemns the same. Further, that
the board approve the act of the Mayor in
regard to the matter.

Magistrate Cornel] said that for the
purpose of bringing about a discussion of
the resolution he would second it.

“To me all of this seems rather prema-
ture,” said Magistrate Finn. “Magistrate
Droege is a new man. The surroundings
were probably more than a man with a
supersensitive nature could stand with-
out trying to curb a story of the nature
that threatened him. But the proper tri-
bunal to haadle his case is the Appellate
Division of the county.” Magistrate Ker-
peetan heartily agreed with Magistrate

inn

“There should not be two views as to the
eonduct of this young man,” said Magis-
trate Cornell. “But I agree with Magistrate
the case.”

“The subject is a painful one and involves
the honor and nee, of the board, but
it is not properiy ore us,” said Ma =
trate avgen. Steinert said t
Inasmuch as rate Droege was A
the board shoul ar tee Ge Whe caw fit to
make an explanation. “In his printed
statement he admitted that his act was
foolish and said that he himself cisap-
proved ot it. 1 personally consider the act
idiotic,” said Steinert.

Magistrate Cornell moved to amend the
resolution by striking off the endorse-
ment of the act of the Mayor, and in the
discussion that followed it was brought
out that if the resolution in ite entirety
was defeated, the board would stand in
the position of ignoring the act of Magis-
trate Droege.

Magistrate Crane advised Magistrate
Droege to keep his mouth shut, but Droege
did get up to say that he welcomed any
proper investigation and that he hoped
his colleagues would pass no resolution
that would prejudice the case.

When the resolution as amended came
up for a vote it was adopted by a vote of
12 to 3, Butts, Herrman and House votin,
in the "negative because they had wish
to vote on the resolution in its entirety.

3 MONTHS or NIGHT COURT.

Mandatory That ‘It

At yesterday's meeting of the Board of
City Magistrates President Wahie reau
Lis annual report, which said of the night
court:

Its record and history not only justify the
‘isdom of its institution but made it abso-
utely mandatory that this court be continued.
'\ has created for itself a fixed place in the
sdiministration of our criminal jurisprudence.

|here were arraigned in this court interme-
diate the ist of August, 1907, and the 8ist of
lrecember, 1907, 15,203 prisoners. The amount
of additional expenditure for the night court
as $10,316.53,

The legislation affecting the night court
* in @ wofully unsettled condition. The
‘aw provides that a prisoner arrested must
ve forthwith arraigned before the nearest
Mgelstrate. If this law was strictly complied
ving every Prisoner arrested after the -ad-
jouyament of the day court, whether charged
wite a felony or a misdemeanor, would be
arraigned in the night court. Manifestly
hat is impossible and was not the intention
of the Legislature; but the law remains upoo
he statute book.

There is also this anomalous condition—the
statute provides that a person giving bail
arrested after the day court commences
shall give bail for the next morning. This
law was passed before the night court was
in existence. The result is that a person ar-
reuted for a misdemeanor or for disorderly
conduct tending to a breach of the peace now
gives bai] to attend not in the night court
bur in the day court the next morning. There
is no reason why this should be so,

Magistrate Barlow was elected president
of the board for the ensuing year. Philip
Bloch was elected secretary.

There was a lively fire yesterday after-
noon in the Wells Building, at 18 Broadway,

about 3:30 from ‘some unknown origin.
The elevator starter pulled a box. The
elevators went whizzing up and down,
carrying out the tenante at full capacity.
Lumber men and brokers on the lower
floors t i down by the stairs, their
arms full of books and papers. Those that
had no time to wait for the crowded cars
did the same from higher up. Among the
stenographers who burried down a half
dozen swooned and did not revive until

SOUTH ORANGE MAN GONE,

ils Former Bookkeeper Also Absent From
Her Home—The Wife's Story.

South Ornanag, N. J., Jan. 27.—Ralph L.
Salter, son of the Rev. R. Newton Salter,
pastor of the Unionville Chapel, has been

and friends. er mother to-day spoke |
bitterly about Salter. She said that when |
her daughter left home on Friday she said |
she was going to visit Mias Hattie Crozier |

“The mother of the bookkeeper for my
husband,” said Mra. Salter to- day, “called
here and asked me if it was true that my
husband wy to get a divorce and m +H
her daught®r. I was dumfounded.
Salter denied eve aeaetibaedas. ;
Then Edwin S. Black, counsel for my hus-
band, called on tried to get me to consent
tora divorce. I ask on what grounds, |
but could only get the reply that my hus-
band wanted to go away. I consulted my
attorney, William P. Martin, and when he ,
asked the cause for divorce the same reply
was given. Mr. Black then admitted in
my presence that Mr. Salter wanted to
leave me and his child.”

Soon after this interview Salter began
petpesetions for his departure. Last week
e transferred the house in Burnett avenue
to hia wife. He has always borne a good |
es here.

LEARY ON THE WITNESS STAND.

Thinks He Can Show That His Challenge
List Was Genuine.

William Leary, Superintendent of Elec-
tions, was put on the witness stand yester-
day, when the investigation of the charges
of neglect of duty which have been made
against him was continued. Nathan
Vidaver, counsel for the Independence
League, which is trying to get Mr. Leary’s
scalp, asserted that out of the 5,600 names
on the challenge list compiled by Mr.
Leary’s deputies only about 33 per cent.
were genuine. Supt. Leary started out to
compare his books with the registry lista,
and in many instances the challenge lists
and the books did not tally The in A
Mr. Vidaver sought to make was that
‘the Superintendent's men had padded the
challenge books with fictitious nannies.
Mr. Leary said the deputies had been ied
astray by the reapportionment of the
Assembly districts and that the names of
persons to be challenged would be, found
registered in other districts. An adjourn-
ment was taken until mext Monday so
that thie may be looked up.

FAKE ALARMS ¥ROM SCHOOLS. |

Hartem Firemen Out | Foar Times at Behest
of an Idle Cotup. |

Carl Weinstein, 19 years old, of 540 Wen- |
dover avenue, The Bronx, was arraigned
in the Harlem court yesterday and held
for trial for sending in four false alarms
from public schools, which kept the Harlem |
firemen jumping yeaterday morning.

The first alarm came from Public School
103, at Madison avenue and 119th street.
Battalion Chief O'Connor hustled over
with all the apparatus at his command to
find school running as usual. The firemen
were just getting back into quarters when
a second fake ca}! came from Public School
159, at 119th street and Second avenue.

4t 9:15 o'clock an alarm was rung in from
School 83, at 216 East 110th street, and fifteen
minutes later a fourth alarm was sent in
from School 57 at 176 East 115th street. The
firemen were boiling mad by this time, but
out they tramped n, with the same re-
sult. Battalion Chiet Dougherty, watch-
ing near the school in 102d street, between
Second and Third avenues, saw Weinstein
enter the building and leave it again. The
chief followed him to School 100 and caught

ke

tie said he got the key from a school
to which he had gone to answer an adver-
tisement for “a useful man.” He admitted
sending in the alarms, but couldn’t think |
of any reason why.

Deputy Fire Commissioner Hugh Bonner,
testifying yesterday before the Commis-

firat that a committee consi of an
expert in mechanics, an expert in chemistry
and an expert hydraulic engineer should

possible by competitive bidding.
Mr. Teener’s second sug; ion was that
there should be established a school of
for firemen, and third
recommendation was that all iron or steel
girders, columns, posts or pillars in build-

| ing# #ehould be more firmly seoured than

they are now. He explained that when
the freproofing surrounding these sup-
ports is exposed to a powerful stream of
water it is often weakened or washed away,
and this condition helps to bring about the
collapse of buildi

Mr. Bonner also testified that $150,000 to
