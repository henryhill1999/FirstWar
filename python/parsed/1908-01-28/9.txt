FINANCIAL AND COMMERCIAL.

 

Monpay, Jan. 27.
Although the course of prices in the

‘ from that which prevailed throughout last
¢ sts BR . * week, yet the results of the day's business

pany in a more elaborate way than had |

hitherto been outlined for alleged violations
of the anti-trust law, but the weakness of
the market lasted only a short time and
was hardly deserving of the name. For
four hours thereafter prices advanced, the
vigor of the movement being greatest in
ita early period. Then in the lest hour of
the Stock Exchange session the market
again declined with even greater rapidity
than it advanced, wiping out the larger
portion of the day's gains, but still leaving
most of the principal stocks at higher
prices than they closed on Saturday. All
this of course plainly exhibited the work
of professional market operators. These
speculators commonly and freely sold
stocks last week and rushed “odver”
to-day, as they not infrequently do, all at
one time, taking advantage in accordance
with invariable custom of the announce-
ment of unfavorable news. When the buy-

The rumor might have been inoorrect in
that no euch issue was immediately forth-
coming, but it is believed in high banking
quarters that an appeal to the money market
of this character will be made at no very

Coffee Steady —Provisions Firmer.

Coffee showed little life. Prices wound up
at, where they stood at the close on Saturday
Roasters and spot dealers continued to buy to
some extent and there was more or less scat-
tered covering of shorts. But on the other
hand tired holders sold out and there was
some selling attributed to Europe. Buying
and selling orders were so evenly balanced
that they produced little effect on prices,
The warehouse deliveries on Saturday were
11,217 bags, making 73,036 for the week,
against 60,007 in the previous week and 115,820
last year.
