RYAN QUESTIONED ILLEGALLY

BY JEROME, SAYS JUDGE Ro.
SALSKY, AND WORK VITIATED,

Inquiry Inte the Purvhasge of the “Paper
Railroad” by Metroepeliten Wilh Have
te Be Done Over Agein—Creveth
Is Upheld in Refusing to Testify.

In deciding yesterday that Paul D.
Cravath is not in contempt for refuging to
testify before the November Grand Jury
about hia client Thomas F. Ryan's part
in the Wall end Cortlandt Street Ferry
Railway purchage by the Metropolitan
Judge Rosalgky disclosed some of the
questions the District Attorney asked of
Mr. Ryan before the Grand Jury and says
they were improper and of such character
that the validity of an indictment found

 

alter such an inquiry would be doubtful. , aaa

He diemiesed the November Grand Jury
with an address to them in which he said
that the work would have to be done over

again

Thomas F. Ryan was before the Grand |
Jury under subpena and, as the Judge |
says, as a possible defendant. He declined
to waive the privilege of client and counsel
as to Mr. Cravath. He was pressed to do
so but still declined. Judge Rosalsky in his
address to the Grand Jury went on:

The District Attorney, evidently dissatis-
fied with the witness’s attitude in his per-
sistence in refusing to waive the privilege,
then stated to the witness Ryan that for
many years he had been the subject of per-
sistent and venomous attacks in the public
Preas not oaly ip the city of New York but
all over the country, that up to this time
he had never had an opportunity to appear
before a judicial body to which he could
eiplain any of the transactions on which
he was attacked, that this was the firat op-
Portunity offorded to show a smal! group
of his fellow citizens, meaning the Grand
Jury, that the attacks made on him were
dishonest, that his conduct was beyond re-
proach and that he was Fesponeible for
closing the door to the Grand Jury by re-
fusing to allow bis counsel to testify.

The Ju quotes some of the questions
asked by Mr. Jerome:

Q. You see, Mr. Ryan, it puts you in an
extremely equivocal position. You tell us
@ etory that on. its face seems reasonable,
seems to correspond with the facta as far
as wo know them: vet you shut the door, or
endeavor to shut tee door, to information

 

|

 

that might in any way go further and throw |
more light than you persenally are inclined ,

to throw on this situation?

Q. Let me point it eut to you
don't make myself clear
astory which | say, as far as | know, seems
to be consistent with such facta brought
out before the Grand Jury, and such facts
as I have been able to discover an, the out-
side. but it may not be the truth. It may
be a fake story from start to finish, You
may have in
committed some crime for whieh vou ought
to ge to ja:|, and it is the duty of this Grand
Jury to find out whether vou have or net?

You have told us

At a later examination Mr. Ryan was
asked:
Q You have definitely decided not to

throw open voluntarily to this (irand Jury

that lise of information? A. Yes. eir

Q. Although vou realize perfectiv that
vou are practically accused of # criminal
act? §& IT do. | am sorrg for it but

Judge Rosalaky commented

I. is the duty of the District Attorney to
conduct an investigation before a Grand
Jury in euch # manner that if an indictment
is found the indictment shall not be of doubt-
ful validity. The practice of calling a prob-
able defendant under a subpena or other-
wise before a (irand Jury and interrogating
him should be condemned. and the law does
condenip it, since even if auccessful at the
outeet in securing an indietment the prose
eution thereunder result in the defeat
of its purpose

1 deem it my duty, therefore, in order that
justice may not be defeated, to direct the
District Attorney to submit the transactions
which vour reened discloses to another Grand
Jury and that a legal investigation be insti-
tuted in order to ascertain whether the laws
of this State have been violated. and that
in the new proceeding care should be taken
that in the presentation of the case the vices
which T have pointed out may not recur

Since the witness Ryan in the mos! posi-
tive terms refused to waive the privilege
which belonged to him, Tam of the opinion,
im the light of the authorities cited, that the
District Atterney could not by @ compulsory
line of examination require the witness
against hie will to reveal the communica-
tions confided to his counsel It cannot be
denied that the witness Ryan was subjected
to 8 rigorous test fo elicit from him the nature
of a confidential communication to his at-
torney

Tf such an examinaiion of a witness would
not be permitted in a court of justice, where
the rules of evidence prevail, then it should
not be permitted in the Grand Jury room,
that body being enjoined by law to receive
none but tega! evidence It does not follow
that because a trial Judae did not preside
over the proceedings of the Grand Jury the
Grand Jury ts freed from the restraints of the
law of evidence, or that the District Attorney,
who is one of the legal advisers of the Grand |
Jury, can transform a legal! inquiry before a
(rand Jury into an inquisitorial proceeding:
and to what extent the District Attorney
may question a witness is likewise limited
by the rules of evidence

The seg) on the attorney's lips would not
aive any protection to the client if the client
could be placed upon the witness stand and
forced to testify as to a communication be-
tween himself and his aitorney in the course
of bis professional employment, and it must
inevitably follow that the client eannot be
compelled to disclose communications which
hie attorney is expressly forbidden to disclose.

connection with thie matter .

a@pssir or WALL STREET.

The advance in the market yesterday /ol-
lowing the definite announcement of the
Government's intention to bring suit to dis-
solve the relations between the Union Pacific

and the Southern Pacific company
made it very clear that Wall Street bas mo
Spprehension regarding the outcome. The
general opinion wae that the Department of
Justice had fred at random and bad failed to
hit the mark. To the outsider the investiga-
tion conducted by the Interstate Commerce
Commission a year ago suggested the possi-
bility of suits, but not of thie kind, and the
matter having narrowed down to the institu-
tion of proceedings that the @nencia! com-
munity believes oan ond only in failure, it has
cnaséd to exert a disturbing influence on
stock market sentiment.

 

The principal coptention which the Gov-
ernment will have to sustain in ita suite againet
the Harriman system is that two sides of an
penne triangle are parallel lines, Starting

m Balt Lake, the Sen Pedro, Los Angeles
Galt Lakp line and the Central Pacific di-
vision of the Bouthern Pacific diver ge some-
thing like the first aud second fingers of the
song when distended as much aa possible.

he “parallel” between the route made up of
} Central Pacific and Union Pacific to the
nerth and the Southern Pacific proper to
the south is scarcely more exact. To prove
that the lines compete of ever competed to
any extent on interstate business will be a
hardly less diMicult matter than to show that
they are parallel.

Not the least extraordinary part from
Wall Street's point of view of the suit against
the Union Pacific interests is the contention
than “as a result of the close union” between
Vaion ifle and Atchison “competition has
to a lar

“union” shown te exist between the two com-
panies consists of the ownership by Union
Pacific of $10,000,900 Atchison preferred out
of a total of $216,000,000 capital stock out-
standing. How the ownership of less than
5 per cent. of the voting capital constitutes
control or a union nobedy in Wall Street han
ever been able to see and the only side of the
matter that ever was regarded with any real
interest in the financial section was, From
whom were the stocks purchased and for what
reason?

The announcement of a receivership for
The National Bank of North America pro-
duced no disagreeable sensation in Wall
Street. Infact the effect was of a reassuring
kind, as the news set at rest the rumors that
had beev in circulation at the end of last
week exaggerating. as such rumors usually |
do, the significance of the matter to which
they vaguely referred. From the statement
of the bank it was plainly seen that the de-
positors would not lose anything, and this,
coupled with the fact that liquidation meant
only the end of @ disagreeable incident, gavé

Nobody can complain of the amount of
wreckage that has to be cleared away after
such a storm as swept over Wall Street a few
weeks ago.

a@ considerable degree of vigor and then

@ covering movement had retired their con-
tracts there was nothing to sustain an ad-

vance and in the lest hour a sharp reaction |

occurred, speculators who had been largely
instrumental in causing the decline last week
renewing their activity on the downward
tide

The reaction in the last hour was arcele-
rated by a rumor to the effect that Union
Pacits
an issue of $35,000,000 additional common
stock Nothing of this kind had been heard
since last summer, and coming unexpectedly
the story exerted an unfavorable influe «e
on the general market.) Denials came, but
these only mitigated the effect of the rumor
and could net entirely remove it
who started the story on ita rounde were
ready for the denial and asserted that the
latter was only technical and that if not
immediately then as soon asthe money situa-
tion became entirely favorable the company
would enter the market for new funds the

We to seek reasons. These who did,
balou. received only vague replies. The
general tenor of the talk on the stock was
of some closer relations between the company
and American Smelting and Refining, but al!
of the storien current were too indefinite and
most of them too palpably absurd to receive
much attention. The rise wes probably
little more than a aqueees of shorte.

the range of ite movements surpassed every
other stock on the list. Its opening quota-
tion wae slightly under @aturday’s close, but
it moved steadily upward until! it touched
10@ at about 2 o'clock. From this point it
declined until it ended the day heavy under
92. A decided reduction inthe extent of the
borrowing demand wes shown at the close,
theatock being offered more freely in the loan
crowd than at any other time for several
days past.

The December statement of the Chicago,
St. Paul, Minneapolis and Omahe showed a
falling off tn gross earnings of $292,506, or 72.3
per cent.,as compared with the corresponding
month in 1904.

The feature of the day wae the strength
and activity in the bond market, and al-
though there was in many places @ dispo-
sition to argue thet the increase of interest
in thie department was more of a speculative
than of an investment kind, it had te be ad-
mitted in el] quarters thet it was a good
omen. When the market for outstanding
bonds is cleaned up there will be an oppor-
tunity for the railreads to arrange their long
postponed fimancing.

SUE MET. SECURITIES MEN.

Recelvors of N. ¥. Ott cry & Raliway Company
an Accounting.

The receivers of the New York City
Railway Company have obtained Judge
Lacombe’s permission to sue the Metro-
politan Securities Company and such
persons as were directors of both com-
pahies at the time of the transactions
complained of to recover $2,797,200 which
the plaintiffs aay they have reason to be-
lieve was wrongfully, illegally in

the ssles of the New york City Railway
Company's ten year debenture notes to
the Securities company at 70 without, as is
alleged, any necessity for making such a
digoount and the inmediate redemption of
the greater part of the notes at their face

» which ware tated ae al
in equity:

The receivers, in applying for leave to fle
the annexed bill, have advised the Court that
the defendants deny al) liability {0 respect
of the matters therein set forth, and have
brought to their attention various facts on
which it ia claimed thet, upon a proper ac-
counting between the New York City Rail-
way Company and the M litan Securi-
ties Company, the latter will be found to
bave made advances to the former largely
in exceas of any amount fer which liability
is asserted in the bill. [t also appears that
the transactions in question were made the

| subject of investigation by the State Railroad
Commission in 1906, and thet charges hased
thereon were dismissed by that tribunal.
The conclusion of the receivers that there
should, nevertheless, be a judicial deter-
mination of the important questions involved
is a proper one, in view of the subsequent
insolvency of the road, and it has the approval
of the Court. It is manifestly to the interest
of all concerned that whatever defence is
to be made or explanation offered in re-
spect of transactione which have been the
| subject of considerable criticism should be
| presented in a judicial proceeding where
the fullest investigation can be made and
the rights and equities of all parties in‘in-
terest adequately protected.

Mesers. Cravath, Henderson & De Gers-
‘dorff make the yates statement:

This suit involyes the accounts between
the New York City Railway Company and
| the Metropolitan Securities Company, which

le the owner of every share of stock of the
New York City company. the individual de-
fendanta being the persons who were directors
| of both of those companies at the time of the
} transactions in question. The defendanis
| are confident that there can be no recovery
| against the directors personally and that the
| Suit involves ofiy an adjustment of the
| accounts between the two corporations con-
| cerned. The transactions on which thie suit
; is brought are the same transactions which
| were investigated by the State Railroad
Commission in 1906 with the result that the
charges based | thereon were dismissed.

Prices Down—Heavy Setting by Spot in-
terests—Long Liquidation.

Persistent selling by large spot interests
was still reported and there was enough
general liquidation by local, Southern and
Liverpool interests to send prices to a lower
level. Some decline in stocks and the Bank
of North America incident were not without
their effect. Some of the Lancashire and
German mills, moreover, are going to run
on short time, though this is of compare-
tively little uence. The vital fact
is that a big English strike has been averted.
Liverpool was stronger than even the bulls
had expected, its spot sales increased 12,000
bales, the receipts were light and if there
is any break in the farmers’ phalanz it is not
perceptible to the ordinary vision. Some
local intereste gave the market support
from time to time and there was a certain
amount of covering and general commission
house buying. The truth is that the specuia-
tion is beealmed, and in such circumstances
persistent drives at the price by specuianve
and trade interests naturally have some
effect. Whether it means so much grist
