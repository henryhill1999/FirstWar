‘yYransports—No Heathen Ballet and

' No Sporting Contest, but a Big Fight.

*The Prince of India,” Gen. Lew Wallace's
gompanion novel to “Ben Hur” and oo-
dignitary as forebear of the Indiana achool
of historical fiction, was presented in dram-
atio guise last night at the Broadway and
yeceived a welcome at the hands and voices
of the non-theatregoing publio that to all
appearances augured success, though per-
haps not in the same measure as that of ite
predecessor. Appearances are all one can
judge by, for this kind of show transcends
the ken of the habitual playgoer, appealing
jntentionally to the public for which the
mere art of the drama is anathema.

During the prologue and four of the
five acta the production had not much to
commend it from any point of view. The
goenery was muddy and the lights garish.
The story was by turns bald and bom-
bastio and the acting turgid. Even the
allurement of beathen dancing in bad pigk
tights and the sop of a chariot race were

lacking. If the godly want the Hippo-
drome they will have to go to the Hippo-

drome.
+ In the third act, it is true; Emmett

Corrigan in the title réle of the prinoply
Indian Wanderer, roused ® momentary

outburst by cursing the court of Constantine
in blank verse. But it was not until the
last act, which represents the fallof Christian
Constantinople before the infidel Mohammed

in two eognes, and the happy ending to
the love story of the Turkish prince and
the Grecian Jrene in two more, tW&t the
house was roused to any real or prolonged
enthusiasm.

Then amid the din of arms, the sound of
assault and the dust of a fallen wall
realistic dust that Burged into the audi
torum and clog the lungs = the
shouters--the fate of the production was
gettled. War, carnage and love soared
triumphant above the allurements of dance
and sport.

By and large, the story was pompous in
the extreme and the scenic setting iose.
That is about the worst that can said of
it, and the best. Intrinsically the milieu
of the tale is of historic ay ery ey —
in the necessarily meagre stage form given

derous solidity. It Sates one of
ponderous picture of Washington crose-
ing the Delaware on an ice wagon,’ which
inspires patriotic fervor in the heat of mid-
aummer, though it should only remind the
parched consumer how heavy his ice cake
might be, and isn’t,

Once there was a reminiscence of “Par-
sifal,” when a stage storm blew the Gate
of Blacherene on the Golden Horn, Con-
stantinople, in one direction, and at the
same time blew the fair Princesse Irene,
The Wanderer and his beloved Gougnier
Inel in the other—right acroas tbh

we to the castle of Mohammed, where

hey appeared in the next scene with gar-
ments dry and nota lock displaced. Clearly
that Wagnerian storm worked more than
ordinarily in collusion with the author
and stage manager.

Yet with all t: 4, one hesitates ta apply
the term melodraruatic in ite abusive sense.

characters have real nobility and heroism

irresistibly, from scene to scene, toward

its end. With a tragic close—the only
dignified solution—instead of the present
bappy ending, it might well serve the turn

GAUDY AND TALKY,

Play and the Audience Does Its
Best to Help it Out.

The oo story .of Esther, as under-
stood by Ella Wheeler Wiloox and Lus-
combe Searelle, was told last night at the
Academy of Musio @der the title of “Miz-
pah.” it was a valiant effort that took up
four acts and ten scenes. An audience,
friendly in the extreme, tried to help along
play and players, but in spite of this gener-
ous assistance the way of the beautiful
Jewish maiden to the throne of Persia and
that of the wicked Haman to the gallows
Was not a triumphant success,

The piece is mounted with care and some
of the stage settings are beautiful, while
the music, which is Mr. Searelle’s exclusive
contribution, is appropriate. Some of the
scenes, especially those marked with the
Most em tion, are strongly reminiscent of
Mrs, Wilcox's earlier efforta.

This version of the story opena in the

“The Red Mill,” the new musical’ play
which opened at the Knickerbooker Theatre

“This arrangement was thoroughly under-
stood by my partners in the Va'uleville
Theatre and was a business agreement
to which they had agreed. They broke
it from the desire to secure for the theatre
the benefit of the prestige which a young |
woman of the cast had gained by the an-
nouncement of a marriage which would |
give her social position. On, account of
thia yiolation I have withdrawn from a

The book is bright from start to finish,
with just enough plot to keep things run-
ning smoothly and furnish a surprise now
and then. One of these comes at the end
of the firet act and gives Fred Stone a chance
to prove himself to be “America’s most
athletic comedian,” as the press agent will
probably call him. Jt wouldn't bs fair
to tell just what his stunt is.

It comes ae suddenly to be spoiled
