~ Men’s FALL OVERCOATS

Hundreds of men yesterday morning were sorry that the Fall
overcoat was not ready to wear. The well-drest man always prides
himeelf in being first with the latest style. The early man always
gets much longer service than the one who waits.

We have the finest collection of Men’s Fall Overcoate that we
have ever shown. Prices start at $15 for smart Overcoats of Oxford
mixt or black cheviots, cut 42 inches long, to cover the frock or cut-
away coat, with broad lapels and shoulders. Some full serge-lined,
others serge-lined and silk-faced. There are sizes toe fit men of all

 

   
 

style for men of all ages.
Main floor, Wanamaker Building.

Men’s Sample Shoes, $2.85 a Pair

These are the present season's $4, $5 and $6 Shoes for Men. The
man who wishes to select from a very wide variety of the very latest
styles is fortunate today if his size is 614 to 74, in A, B and C widths.
The collection includes every style of shoe correct this season, in all
the different leathers for all sorte of wear. All are made in the perfect
manner that is essential in sample shoes. It is one of those rare
opportunities that thrifty men will never miss if they know about it.

We also offer today a collection of Men’s $3 Shoes at $2.20 a pair.
these are discontinued styles of our own “Wanamaker Wear-Well” shoes, and other
lots specially made up for us in dull times at factories, All are welted and stitcht,
and in the lot are all sizes. $2.20 a pair.

Boys’ $3 and $3.50 Shoes at $2.20 and $2.40 a Pair

From a factory that is discontinuing the manufacture of boys’ shoes, because
they find it unprofitable to produce them in this high quality at their special prices.
A practically compelete range of sizes to select from.

This Preparatory-to-Removal Sale
| _Was a Tremendous Success Yesterday

More Half-Price Furniture Today

It is one of the most important steps toward opening the furniture floors of our New
Building with SPIC-‘SPAN-NEW FURNITURE. The immediate cost will be great; but the
splendid NEW stocks of Furniture, soon to be presented, will repay us abundantly—and ALL
OF OUR LOSS GOES RIGHT INTO THE POCKETS OF THE FRIENDS WHO HELP

 

 

 

 

niture deserved their admiration. It ranges from popular-priced grades up to some of the finest
furniture made in this country. And every piece or suite in the offering is JUST HALF PRICE,
excepting a few that are less than balf.

TODAY ’S offering is just as large as yesterday’s.. We couldn't get near all of the special-
priced furniture on the floor until that sold yesterday was removed, Reserve lots have filled up
the gaps, and another day of extraordinary opportunities awaits home outfitters.

All of the furniture is sold “‘As-is,” for immediate delivery, without privilege of exchange or
return—the nature of the occasion and the half-price demand that.

The list that follows tells of pieces that are here when the store opens. As most pieces are
without duplicates, the one you wish may be gone before you come, but other furniture of the
same class will be found, at the same reduction, and it may suit you even better. But promptness

will be profitable where the selling is so rapid.
