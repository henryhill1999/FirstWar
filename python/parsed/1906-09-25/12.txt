CASTRO-ASPHALT SCANDAL

qooroa LAWYER'S STORY OF A. L.
BARBER’S CAMPAIGN

 

pat in by the General Asphalt Company as
part of the Defence to Mr. Barber's
guit for Libel—Lawyer Gays That
Barber Told Him the Pilot tn Advance.

Wuiiam Y. Kinleyside, a Scotch lawyer,
examined and cross-examined yester-

> at the hearing before George Gordon
patde, referee, in connection with the

(000 libel suit brought by Amal L. Barber
ggainst the General Asphalt Company and
4 officers
Beinsoraiie was a witness for the com-
y, and his examination, before trial, was
sted on the affidavit of Gen. Avery D.
Andrews, vice-president, that his testimony
would show that Amzi L. Barber had been
the head and front of a conspiracy to de-
prive the New York and Bermudez Com-
~ of its asphalt properties in Venezuela
and turn them over to Barber and his asso-
ciates so that the General Asphalt Company
would be forced to make terms with Barber.

Mr. Kinleyside said that three years ago,
sehile acting as counsel for John Gordon
Douglas of Edinburgh, who had become
heavily loaded with unprofitable asphalt
stock, he met Barber in this country. Kin-
leyside’s mission was to effect terms with
Barber favorable to the Pan-American
company, in} which Douglas and Barber
qwere interested.

Barber told him, the witness said; that
he had a scheme on hand to get possession
of the New York and Bermudez Company's

operties which was of far more interest
to him, Barber, than the future of the Pan-
American {company. The scheme consisted
in baving President Castro of Venezuela

sh the New York and Bermudez Com-
pany for lending aid to the Matos revolu-
tionary party. The punishment was to be
tbat on the demand of Barber the Bermudez
company would be judicially declared
insolvent, and a receiver named for it who
would be acceptable to Barber. The re-
caiver would, of course, have full possession
of the company’s asphalt roperties and
the company’s asphalt would be marketed

Barber wished.
In the remote event that any of Vene-
guela's judicial officers shou balk at

the scheme Castro had as-
removal from
such recal-

carrying out
gured Barber that summa
office would be the fate of all
citranta.

Kinleyside testified that he had agreed
to help Barber get evidence to lay before
President Castro showing that the New
York and Bermudez Company had provided
the necessary funds for the - ment
of a boat, the Ban Reich, which the tos
evolutionists were to use as @ saben’.
In return for these services nleyside
was to get, in addition to his fees, a block
of stock in the Pan-American Company,
which he also agreed to boom in England.

Following this Kinleyside learned that
Barber's scheme was carried out as planned
and that a director of the Pan-American
Company, Ambrose H. Carner, had bro
named as receiver of the New York and
Bermudez. Company with the result that
Barber, through Carner, had full control
of tne marketing of the Bermudez com-
pany’s asphalt. Barber also organized
about this time another corporation, called
the A. L. Barber Asphalt Company, of the
existence of which neither leyside nor
Douglas knew anything for some time.
But they found out later that Barber was
devoting all his energies toward making
a success of the Barber company, an
Kinleyside concluded, as he swore, that
Barber had deceived Douglas and ‘palmed
off on the Edinburgh investor stock in a
company which was unlikely to bea success.

The Luver declared further that he
had been approached by a man who told
him that rber would pay him hand-
somely if he would stay out of the jurit-
diction and not testify. Hedenied de -
me sum of money with the threat that
if he did not get it he would testify.

J. H. SMITH OUT OF ST. PAUL.

Retirement Only Temporary, Thereby Dis-
counting U. P. Merger Rumors.

There was considerable comment in
the financial district yesterday over a
fact which had escaped notice at the time
of the publication of the annual report
of the St. Paul system. The report showed
that James Henry Smith had retired as
a director of the road and that his place
had been filled by Herman 8. LeRoy.

Mr. Smith's retirement led to many
rumors yesterday. It was said that Mr.
Smith has always stood between St. Paul
and Union Pacific, and that now that he
had retired there would unquestionably
be a deal by which Union Pacific would
take over St. Paul.

Another story was to the effect that
Mr. Sinith had sold his St. Paul holdings
and revired, the bulls using the story as
a basis for touting a 6 per cent. dividend
and the bears contending that there would
be no change in dividends.

It was learned on excellent authority
that Mr. Smith has not sold his St 1
holdings, and that his retirement from
the board of directors is merely temporary.

“Mr. Smith is abroad at present with
his wife,”. said a man in close touch with
him yesterday, “and will probably remain
abroad for some months. Mr. Roy is
acting as*Mr. Smith's personal representa-
tive on the St. Paul board and only until
Mr. Smith returns.”

 

 

BR, SAGE’S BLUE NOSE RAILROAD.

Canadian Pacife Likely to Get the New
Brunswick Southern.

It was reported yesterday in Wall Street
that the old Shore Line Railway, now the
New Brunswick Southern, had been dis-
posed of by the estate of the late Russell
Sage to the Canadian Pacific Railway.
An executor of the Sage estate said:

“The report is at least premature. No
such deal has as yet been consummated
to my knowledge.”

There was no denial that such a deal
Was in contemplation.

The New Brunswick Southern is a etand-
ard gauge road of 82.5 miles which runs
from St. John to St. Stephens, New Bruns-
wick. The entire equipment consists of
three locomotives, six passenger cars,
thirty-seven freight cars and one snow

lough, The company was incorporated
n 1902 with a capital stock of $49,000 and

a bonded debt of $800,000 in 4 per cent.
gold bonds, due 1953. H. H. McLean is
President and manager.

The road touches some territ which
{s considered valuable to the jan
Pacific,and it is said that the Canadian
Pacific is to make some extensions in which
the New Brunswick Southern is an im-
portant factor,

 

 

MEETS THE ERIE’S RATE.

Pennsylvania Lines Not Going Below Two
Cents a Mile in Central Territory.

CuIcaco, Sept. 24.—The Pennsylvania
Lines, being that portion of the Pennsyl-
Vania system west of Pittaburg, has an-
Bounced that it will maet the competition
“< 4he Erie in reducing the rates in the
central passenger territory to two and a
~salf cents per mile with a flat two cent
Mileage book
P Notice of this will be given to the Central

assenger Association to-morrow, and
other lines are expected to follow the lead.
co action places the possibility of a flat
t o cent rate in central —— er terri-
. beyond the range o' posalbility, as
s Was expected that the Pennaylvania
would make the reduction if it was made.
oo that this line has indicated ite inten-
— of going no lower than two and a half

GOSSIP OF WALL STREET.
Rough.computations af.the amount of the
October 1 dividend and interest payments
put them at about $75,000,000, or $4,000,000
more than the amount for the same period
Inst year Coincidental with the pay day
this year ie the last day for the trust com-
panies to raise their reserves from 5 to 15
per cent., so that altogether about $85,000,000
will be needed to meet these requirements.
However extensive the provision for the
emergency, it seemed certa'n to traders and
brokers yesterday that call money rates will
advance the latter part of the week, and most
brokers were very emphatic in the morning
in calling their customers’ attention to it as a
consideration to be weighed seriously before
undertaking operations on the long side.

That very largeprovision has been made for
the quarterly requirements appears ovident
from the remarkably large amount of bankers’
balances offered at call. One well known
banker said yesterday that the amount of
money available for call loans was much
greater than at any other time for several
weeks. He expected a great contraction
in the amount of this money on October 1
but did not believe call money would ad-
vance to as high a rate as some people antici-
pate. In his opinion a rate of 10 or 12 per
cent. would be demanded by banks for loans
extending from yesterday over October 1.

One of the most prominent Chicago bankers
in conversation with bankers in this city
yesterday expressed the opinion that as
far as the interior is concerned at least
most of the strain on the money market
is about over. He said that since this year
every oneanticipated remarkably high money
rates in the fall business men all over the
country protected themselves more ex-
tensively than ever before by securing time
loans. He was assured, he said, that New
York brokers had likewise taken on more
time money than ever before, and altogether
it was his opinion that more people in all
lines of business had already made pro-
vision for the supply of money necessary
to carry them through the year than had
ever been the case before. To this unusual
demand, he thought, were largely due the
high rates for mercantile paper and he was
certain that deposits in interior banks,
such as have been abundantly predicted,
would answer all the mercantile needs and
the requirements for crop moving.

The stock market, reactionary in the morn-
ing on account of fear of a money stringency
within a week, rallied vigorously in the after-
noon on reports from a number of different
sources that Secretary Shaw had definitely
decided to put out a large amount, prob-
ably about $40,000,000, in interior banks. At
the close of the day's business there was a
general feeling that ihe relief would be
granted very soon.

Inter-Met preferred took no part im the
afternoon rally; but 60 shares of it changed
hands. But on this small volume of trading
the stock declined 2% points and held at
75%, the low point of the day, until the close.
Brooklyn Rapid Transit and Inter-Met com-
mon were also weak, and thie general weak-
ness in the local traction shares was ascribed
in some quarters to political developments.
But B. R. T. only lost \ of 1 per cent. and
Inter-Met common %, 60 that this explanation
failed to explain the much Leavier loss ia the
only dividend payer of the three issues.
“Perhaps,” one broker suggested, “the sales
of the preferred were made with the intent
of testing the market and ascertaining to how
great an extent it would absorb real distri-
bution of the stock.”

Ice, which in the hot weather advanced
to successive high records by gains of but
a fraction of a point a day, jumped ahead 8%
points on the first cool day of the fall. Fol+
lowing the course of reasoning that has been
applied to the stock all summer, cold weather
must be added to low prices and a scanty
supply of ice to Make ideal conditions for the
business. The stock closed at 04.

Anaconda, which is a #25 a share stock,
paid stockholders $1 a sharein 1904. The
following year it paid a total of $1.87% end
this year it has paid dividends of $1.12,
an annual rate of 18 per cent., in March, and
$1.37, an annual rate of 22 per cent., in June.
The directors meet to-day to declare the
dividend for the ensuing quarter, and the
expectation that the rate will be increased
seemed to be quite general yesterday. Most
of the speculation in the etock "appeared to
be based on the difference of opinion whether
the declaration will be $1.50, an annual rate of
24 per cent., or $1.62%4, an annual rate of 26

per cent.

New York Central, after dropping to 141,
fell a full point lower on a single transaction
of 300 shares. A later rally brought the
quotation to 143 at the closing, a net gain of
% of 1 per cent.

 

 

 

The latest version of the Southern Pacific
story is that the outstanding $40,000,000 pre-
ferred is to be called at 115 and that the entire
$100,000,000 of preferred is to be issued to
stockholders as a 7 per cent. stock without
the redemption clause, the proceeds from
the sale of the issue to be used, of course, for
the acquisition of St. Paul.

Are the 160,000'shares of Norfolk and Western
sold by the Pehnsylvania to Kuhn, Loeb & Co,
to be held by that house as an investment, to
be sold on the market or to be transferred toa
previously known purchaser? The question
has interested many bankers and railroad
men for some time. Assuming that the
present owners do not care to hold the stock
asan investment, it was pointed out yesterday
that the market for it was rather narrow and
that it would undoubtedly take some time to
distribute so large a block and at the same
time maintain the price.

Henry C. Frick has long been known as &
fancier of Norfolk and Western, and it was
considered just possible yesterday that Mr.
Frick and Henry H. Rogers might have come
to some understanding about both Mr. Frick's
holdings and those sold by the Pennsylvania.
In the event that some arrangement is made
it might relieve Mr. Rogers from the expense
of constructing a considerable part of his
Deepwater and Tidewater Railroad, which was
conceived as a direct competitor of Norfolk
and Western. Those who discussed this
phase of the matter admitted that it was pure
conjecture but insisted that it was very
largely to Mr. Rogers's interest to keep the
Norfolk and Western from falling into un-
friendly hands.

Strength in the steel shares, one of the
features of Saturday's market, was wel]
maintained yesterday. Buying orders ap-
peared to come from good sources. Several
brokers said that large buying orders came
from the same source as on many other ree
actionary periods of the past few weeks.
Many who follow steel movements closely
were of the opinion that while no great ad-
vance may be in prospect any material de-
cline in the stocks seems to be out of the
question.

In the morning the decline uncovered a
large number of stop loss orders, many of
which, it was said in commission houses,
were for the account of a part of the “public”
brought into the market by the declaration
of the Harriman dividends and since grown
impatient. As on hundreds of occasions
in the past it has been the case this year
that a large number of new customers have
not been willing to accept a 5 point profit
but have been quite satisfied with a 2 or 3
point loss. Of the large number of buyers
who came in at the time mentioned, how-
ever, the majority are atill believed to be
trading. The public is not in the market as
heavily as was the casea few weeks ago, but
the public participation is much greater than
it was last fall.

IRON AND STEEL.
Little Foundry Iren Available for: i
—High Activity in Finished Steel.

Moderate demands for foundry deliverable
within this year are absorbing the, small
tonnages that can be shipped.. There is
little Northern, Southern or Western foundry.
metal available for shipment within the yéar.
A number of important furnaces report that
their order books are closed for account of
fron deliverable within nihety days.’ For
the little nearby delivery Southern foundry
that can be had for November and Decem-
ber prices are strong at $16,50@817 for No.
2 foundry at Birmingham. For the . fret
quarter of 1907 foundry iron from Southern
furnaces ia held on the basis of $15.50@816
for No. 2 foundry at Birmingham. One of
the largest foundry iron consumers in this
vicinity has just returned from a visit to the
furnaces in Alabama. He reports little stock
to be eeen and the certainty that the pro-
duction of foundry iron in the Alabama
district will continue to decrease, as a sum-
ber of furnaces that have hitherto run on
foundry iron are to be turned altogether to
steel making iron for consumption by Southern
steel plants. Pennsylvania and New Jersey
pig iron is strong and unchanged. There is
little available for 1006 shipments.

Bar iron is in increasing demand and in
adequate supply at unchanged prices. Old
materials are remarkably active under in-
sistent demands for acrap. Prices are un-
changed from last week's quotations. But
an advance is anticipated.

Prime foundry and furnace coke for ship-
ment within the year are somewhat stronger.
One large sale for nearby delivery of the beat
Connelisvillé foundry was made in yesterday's
market at $3.85. Several dealers are entering
Connellsville foundry at $3.75 for shipment
within this year. Deliveries from ‘Southern
and Pennsylvania ovens are far behind on ac-
count of the shortage of cars.

In the steel trades there is intense activity
for finished materials. The rail market: is
exhibiting continuously good demands, so
much so that the mills are engaged far into
the second half of 1007. In orude steel and
semi-finished materials there is no likelihood
of an alleviation of congeated conditions for a
long time ahead. Demands are far beyond
the capacities of producers to meet, except
under far off deliveries.

However, shorts covered, the cables were
better than expected and leading local in-

was reported and for a time the offerings
were light. On the rise commission houses

NEW L. I. R. R. COMMUTATION,

 

Rates to Be the Same All the Year and
Substantially Lower.

On October 1 the Long Island Railroad
will readjust its commutation rates so that
they will remain the same throughout the
year. The readjusted rates will be the
average of the various rates now in force
and their effect will be to lower present
commutation charges. If this readjust-
ment, which’is really a reduction, does not
increase commutation business materially
and if the sale of commutation tickets is
made hereafter in the same proportion
in summer and winter months as in the
past the road will lose yearly by this plan
about $49,000.

That the public will correspondingly
gain from the new rates appears from a
consideration of the present commutation
charges between Long Island City and
Far away. The present commutation
between these two points ranges from $11
to $% a month. Roughly, the $11 rate is
char during the Way months, when
travel is heaviest, and the $5 rate in the
winter, when it is lightest. The new com-
mutation rate between these distances,
which will begin October 1 and continue
during the year, is $7.50 for the month.

‘In July, 1906, the Long Island carried
1,205 passengers daily between Long Island
City and Far Rockaway, who paid a com-
mutation rate of $11 a month each. , In
February, 1906, however, when the rate
was $5 a month, only 112 commuters were
carried daily between these points. In
July, 1906, it carried 1,188 persons daily be-
tween Long Island City and Arverne at a
commutation rate of $11 a month each
but in February, 1906, 33 only were carried
daily for $5 a month. In other words,
where 1,205 passengers travelling between
Long Island — Far Rockaway and
1,188 ngers between Long Island ~
and Arverne are charged $11 a month
under the present rate the new rates will
ona them to travel for $7.50 a month
each.

 

BANKS SUBJECT TO $100 FINE.

 

Penalty For Not Promptly Forwarding
Reports to the Comptroller.

WasHinaton Sept. 24.—The resources
and liabilities of national banks at the close
of business on September 4, as shown by
reports to the Comptroller of the Currency,
wera made public to-day,

Several years ago, when there were but
3,500 national banks reporting, it took foure
teen clerks of the reports division of the
Comptroller's office thirty days from the
date the call was issued to complete the”
total sheet for the United States. With
6,154 banks reporting on September 4, 1906,
including four trust companies and thirteen
savings banks in the District of Columbia,
it took fourteen clerks only fifteen working
days to complete the total sheet just made
public, and it is stated at the Comptroller's
office that this work under the improved
methods now employed could be completed
in ten days from the date the call was issued
if the banks would forward their reports
promptly. The work of abstracting the
reports, it is stated, is delayed goveral days
at each call by the tardiness of a dozen or
more banks in forwarding their reports.

Section 5211, United States Revised Stat-
utes, requires reports of condition to be
forwarded to the Comptroller within five
days from the date of receipt by the bank
of the notice of a call, and section 5213 pro-
vides a penalty of $100 for each day's delay
ower the allotted time for failure to make

report.

With a view to correcting this tardiness
the Comptroller has notified ail of the de-
linquent banks under the last call that
they are}subject to the penalty referred
to and that unless some satisfactory excuse
can be furnished for tailure to promptly
transmit the report, the fine wil] be imposed
and collected.

In a letter to Redmond & Co. the rail-
road company states that the earnings are

year of $620,146 over the corresponding

period last year.

mortgage covering the entire property of
the company owned in 10901, which includes
