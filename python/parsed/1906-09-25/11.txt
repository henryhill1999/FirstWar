Northwestern markets, unexpectedly small |
receipts there and ‘persistent reports of un-
satisfactory. threshing returns.

The Van Dusen-Harrington Company as-
sisted the advance with an estimate of, 200,-
000,000 boshels as the crop of the three big
spring wheat States, including 45,000,000
bushels of macaroni wheat. This would
mesn « supply of contract wheat of some
20,000,000 bushels less than that of last year.
The estimates of late have been considerably
smaller than the Jones figures of some time
ago.

Suineben Prices Lower—Liverpool Dull and Weak

Receipts increasing - Weather Favorabie,

In a emall professional market it was as
easy matter to force prices down here aud ia
Liverpool, and {t was done. There was con-
siderable talk about an increase in the re
ceipts. That Liverpool prices were depressed
partly from thie side, is a fact admitted ia
private despatches. Yet it is quite as true
that the spinning demand in Liverpool! shows
a distinct falling off, and there as well as here
there is a general expectation that in the noar
future something will occur that always

8 per cent. late in the day, and substantial
further engagements of gold were made in
London.

What probably contributed in no small
measure to the late strength of the market
was the belief that a further measure of
relief for the money market from the

was imminent. In banking cir-
cles it was anid that in all probability
Secretary Shaw would in the near future
deposit a large part of the Treasury's funds,
possibly as much as $40,000,000, with the
country banks for the relief of the mercan-
tile community. That the Secretary would
do so when oocasion demanded has been
expected for some time, but a section of
Wall Street has taken it for granted that
nothing would be done until the Govern-
ment had been given another object lesson
by an advance in the call rates to 90 or 40
per cent., an assumption, however, which
disregarded the essential fact that the
measures about to be taken are not for the
purpose of aiding speculation but of re-
Neving the commercia! classes which have
suffered by their inability to obtain money
except on practically prohibitive terms.
The present situation again forces on public
attention the necessity for getting the
United States Government out of the bank-
ing business. This could easily be done
if Congress would only enact a measure
requiring that, instead of allowing money
to pile up-in its vaults, the Treasury should
promptly turn over its receipts to the Na-
tional banks so as to restore the funds to
the regular channels of trade. The deposit
of a large amount of funds in the country
banks now would be timely, as in the ab-
sence of such a supply of money the move-
ment of currency from New York during
the present week must assume large pro-
portions.

Directors of the Anaconda Company
meet to-mofrow for action on the dividend
question, and it is thought probabie that
the rate will be increased to 24 per cent.
from the 22 per cent. rate established three
months ago. Should this be done it would
strengthen the belief in the probability
of an advance from 7 to 8 per cent. in the
rate on Amalgamated Copper, in view of
the strong position of the metal all over
the world. John D. Ryan, the manag-
ing director of Amalgamated, has been
credited with the statement that his com-
pany has not a single pound of copper on
hand at present and is sold ahead for several
rmoonths. Spot copper was quoted in Lon-
don at an advance £1 2s. 6d. above Friday's
closing price and all grades were marked
up %0. a pound here. Rumors regarding
the alleged serious condition of Mr. Cassatt's
health were said in well infoPmed bank-
ing circles to be greatly exaggerated, and
while it was rumored that men claiming
to be representative of a newly formed union
of Standard Oil workers had threatened
to call out a great many thousand men
on etrike it was doubted very much if any
serious suspension of work would ensue.
The Standard Oi] Company has always
treated ite workmen liberally, and labor
agitators have heretofore had very little
guoccess in sowing the seeds of discontent
among them. Toward the end of the day
it was stated on seemingly good authority
that the situation had undergone a change
for the better, and that there was littie
danger of trouble. The London market
was depressed on account of the money
situation and the approaching settlemens.
