JAIL WOMAN FOR ALIENATION,

BURKE’S FAMILY ‘TAKE BIG
STICK TO ALMA ROBINSON,

hen Burke Bales Mer Ont—Mrs. Barke
Deciares That the Young Woman Hs
Enticed, Harbored and Otherwise

Wrongfully Approprieted Mr. Burke.

Miss Alma Robinson, who Iivea on Weet
114th street, was lodged in Ludlow street
jail on Saturday afternoon by Deputy
Bheriff Walgering, who arrested her on a
civil process signed by Justice Newburger
of the Supreme Court.

The order was granted on the application
of Walter L. Bunnell, as counsel for Mrs.
Srank St. Jobn Burke of 477 West 140th
etreet, who is suing Miss Robinson for
$5,000 damages for the alienation of the
affections of Burke, a Harlem builder.

As eoon as Burke learned that. Miss
Robinson had ‘heen arrested he hustled
down to the Sheriff's office and deposited
$500 cash for her release on bail.

Mr. and Mrs. Burke have been married

‘ trey years and have two daughters.
ss Robinson, who is under 20, appeared
on the Burke family horizon early this year.
As Mrs. Burke relates in her complaint
and affidavit, Miss Robinson “gained the
affections of Frank St. John Burke, en-
ti im into improper relations and conan
eee him and enticed him to leave

®, the plaintiff, without support, and
spend his time with the defendant ”

On August 10 last, Mrs. Burke says,
Miss: Robinson “induced and ‘
wilfully and maliciously enticed the pos #1
Frank St. John Burke to desert the plain-
tiff and leave her without means of support
and protection,” and has “harbored and de-
tained him against the will of the plaintiff,
and has been wilfully and maliciously de-

hapcbing hit .
rs. Burke and her brother-in-law,
William Burke, have made several un-
availing efforts to rescue Burke. They
went so far as to have him removed to an
institution that professes to cure alcoholism,
but, according to the wife and brother,
Miss Robinson followed him there and
fot him away again. They say that they
ve repeatedly begged Miss Robinson
to release her hold on Burke's affections,
but that she won't. It was in the hope of
tThaking her see the error of her ways that
they set about her arrest, but they were
unprepared for Burke's action in going
bail for her himself.

TUESDAY AND THURSDAY LUCKY.
Testimony of the Jeweller Who Lost His
Diamonds Monday Night.

Some expert opinions on which days of
the week were lucky and which were not
were vouchsafed before United States Com
missioner Alexander yesterday by Solo-
mon Urbach, the jewelry merchant of 47
Maiden lane, whose creditors had him
arrested for fear he would flea the juris-
diction of the bankruptcy court. Urbach
reported to the police ten days ago that he
had been robbed of $40,000 worth of dia-
monds while in a sleeping car on the way
to Baltimore on the night of September 10.

A representative of Hays & Hershfield,
attorneys for Job Bonen. the receiver,
asked him how he had happened to take
the trip to Baltimore 01 Monday night,
September 10. Urbach, after admitting
that he had never taken a night trip for
business purposes before, d that he
had gone on Monday night in order to be
noe oe business on eee

“Why did you not start on Sunday, then?
You'd have been all ready to start in on
planday . which is a pretty good day to
begin business on.”

. use I never start any new business
on sneer. It’s an unlucky day. Tues-
day is a lucky day. That and Thursday
are the only lucky days in the week to start
any new business on. Saturday is the only
day of the rest lucky enough to continue
any business already begun. That is the
result of observations I have made in the
@onduct of my business.”

The ultimatum sent by the management
of the Mutual Life Insurance Company
to three of its general agents who have
failed to declare themselves for the ad-

sawered before 12 o'clock to-day.

The three agents who have been called

administration ticket are Herbert Fell of
this city, whose brother, T. Reed Fell,
was dismissed the other day after he ac-
cepted a nomination on an opposition ticket;
Frederick O. Paige, manager at Detroit, and
Biscoe Hindman of Louisville, Ky. The
Mutual management summoned these three
agents to the home offices last week, but
“wy Hindman has replied.

he was busy moving and could
on to New York just then. Both Paige
and Hindman are named the
Mutual or fusion ticket.

this afternoon and will act on the man-
agers’ cases. It was said vesterday that
practically all the managers in this country,
with the exception of the three mentioned
above, have given assurances of their
allegiance to the administration ticket.

The persona who are directing the cam-
paigna for the fusion or agents’ ticket said
yesterday that, while it is true that the
aoee are giving pledges, fearing dia
missal, when the votes come to be counted
it will be found that many of thern have
