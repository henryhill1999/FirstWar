Hits by the Giants off Slim Sallee yes-
Mwrduy were few ut ey were not far
between T close order {n which
came ts w Giants, with four
beat the © ils, with twice that quin-
tits Tha sore was 4 to 2, and the are |
rangement of the New York hits was a
happy one Iwo of the safeties, which,
with a third, drove three Giants to the
plate ir tundem, were of the scratch
persuasion, but the other, the oniy hit the
(ilants made that cleared the infleld, was

au full fledged, earnest folt and essential

 

 

It was a triple by George Burns, which
belted the three men to the plate itn the
iy inning {n which the Glants were dan-
us, and tts timeliness was Increased
y the fact that there were two out when
FPurns jammed the hit through the cen-
tre spaces and .eleased a trio of mates
from the base One good hard lick was
all the Giunts needed to win the game,
considering wiat had just preceded, and
George produced tt.

The Giants were the tamert sort of op-
Position for Sallee in the other innings,
with his crossfire curve and mixture,
bor when Burns struck for his sltars and
lils fires and hoped for share in the world’s
feries spoils the ben:fits of all of Sal's

effectiveness were shot away,
