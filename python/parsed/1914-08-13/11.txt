While eteel manufacturers are agreed
that the European war will result event-

   

ually in a sharp increase in the price of
all finished steel products they admit that
they are laboring under considerable em-
merseeemenis just now because of the im-
possibilit of forwarding goods abroad,
Prices, however, have been advanced
sharply of late and it ts the opinion of
leading interests that further advances
are in order ‘
The ferromanganese ettuation is seri-
oue Leading companies have sufficient
supply to satisfy requirements for sev-

eral months, particularly
poration, but the smaller concerns are in
danger of being compelled to close, Simi-

GOSSIP OF WALL STREET.

New Haven Episode,

The general construction placed on the
adjustment of the Government's civil
sult recently brought against the New
Haven road was that the settlement was
dictated by a general desire on the part
of all concerned to lighten as far as
possible the problems to be faced in the
present financial and commercial crisis,
Nevertheless, the sudden collapse of the

 

weeks ago was a distinctly interesting
episode There was some hasty criti-
cism of the action of the apparent re-
treat of the company from its etand.
Neertheless, from some aspects ft ap-
pears ae if the é¢ompany had gained
sortething by {ts agreement to a peaceful
dissolution of the merger out of court
The outcome of the controversy has at
least removed the Iikelihood of a long
and closely contested sult with the Gov-
ernment. The terms made by the com-
pany with the Department of Justice
show that the Interests of the New
Haven shareholders have been = safe-
gunrded as far as is possible
terval allowed for the disposal of the
Hoston and Maine stock has, it Is true,
been shortened to a year, but provisions
are made for a sale of the stock by a
trial court If it has not been disposed |
of in that time, The necessity for undue |
haste in this matter is therefore removed.
In {ts larger aspects the settlement of
the New Haven sult is accounted highly
gratifying. It removes one difficulty from
a highly complicated and awkward sit-
uation

Facilities for Cash Shiles,

The ruling made by the Stock BEx-
change authorities permitting the execu. |
tion of buying orders in stocks for anah
at prices above the closing quotations,
of the last day of trading on the ex-
ehay 's a tacit admission that suah a
dem exists to an extent important

enough be

|
been signs of a widespread demand for
stocks, Surgestions have been continu-
ally offered that some way ought to be
devised to met into circulation the large
amount of cash that investors were anx-
fous to convert into securities at the low
prices, not only because this would re-
lieve the atock market position, but be-
catise the general financial ettuation would
be immensely strengthened thereby, The
exchange authorities in permitting trans-
actions In a limited way have adopted
the only policy that they could under the
circumstances. The situation required
action of the sort and undoubtedly it
would have been taken earlier if the |
technical situation had permitted. For
some days past tt has meen evident that |
there was a real call for a cash market
in some form. This has been displayed
in the success of the effor's to conduct
a curbstone market {in New atreet, and |

Harvester Suit,

Tf? there was the normal keen !ntereet

ernment of its sult against the Harvester

|Exchange Committee of Five|

Allows Cash Trading Un-
der Restrictions.

 

 

 

JULY 80 PRICES MINIMU M)

New Ruling Expected to Abol-
ish Unofficial Market on
Curbstone.

 

 

The Stock Exchange committee of five, |
which has charge of all matters relating
to the exchange and its members while!
business is suspended, ruled yesterday
that cagh trades may be made under
certain restrictions. This ruling of the
exchange authorities is designed to
ebolish the unofficial market in New
Street and to atrangthen the market
position by eliminating weakly held stocks
by employing a portion of the existing !n-
vestment demand for stocks.

Members of the exchange desiring *o
buy securities for cash may send a lis'
of the securities wanted and the prices

they are willing to pay to the a |
on clearing house at 55 New atreet. No

bids at less than the closing prices of
Thursday, July 30, will be accepted. |
Similarly members desiring to geell
securities, but only in order to relleve
the necessities of themselves or their |
customers, are instructed to notify the |
committee, no prices less than the clos-

ing quotations to be considered i

In effect this ruling opens a way for:
dealings in securities for cash and for
the absorption of the undoubtedly large
amount of capital pressing for Invest-
ment. But Stock Exchange authorities
say that there !s no intention of estab- |
lishing a market on a cash basis. The
measure taken !s primarily to facilitate
a clearing up of outstanding contracts
and a genaral strengthening of the market
position and also to provide proper chan-
nels for liquidation where ‘9 18 neces-
Sary or advisable.

In this way a mass of weakly mar-
gined stock will find permanent lodg-
ment with Investors. Incidentally the new
arrangements will permit the speculator
with short contracts to cover if he wishes
to do so by paying cash down

All transactions will be arranged pri-
vately. The prices and amounts of stock!
involved will not be made public.

One of the reasons prompting the ex-
change authorities to establish means of
dealing a cash basi« was the steady
growth of trading !n an unoflictal way tn
the curbstone market in New street. The
development of this market was insured
by a continuous Increase in the supply
and demand for stocks. It was felt that
this outside market constituted a source
of possible danger to the situation. While
dealings outside may go on in a amall way

{t is belfeved that the latest measures
taken by the exchange have dealt the
curbstone market a body blows

FORBIDS NEW CLAFLIN SPLIT.

Judge Refuses to Let Twenty Cred-
itors Form Committee.

Judge Lacombe fn the United States
Pistrict Court yesterday dented a motion
to allow twenty creditors of the H. B.
Claflin Company to organize a committee
distinct from those which already repre-
the Merchandise Creditors Associa-
tion, the Noteholders Assoctation and the
Creditors Audit and Adjustment Associa-
tion.

The the London
Company, Ltd,

motion was made by
Muaranty and Accident
which has insured the claime of twenty
merchandise creditors, including the Lor-
raine Manufacturing Company, the Red-
ford Mills and Wilson & Bradbury. The

motion also called for the recognition
of especial counsel for these creditors,
whose claims are said to aggregate a
large amount.

In opposing the motion Rushmore, Bias-
bee & Stern, attorneys for the receivers,
sald that there were 2,794 creditors, ex
clusive of the forelgn creditors, and that

 

the recognition of another committee with
{ta separate attorneyg would only add to
the cost of the receiv®rsehip.
THE COPPER MARKET.
Another dull day was added to the
record of copper yesterday. There were
a few inquiries and fewer sales Book- |

ings were made by producers at 12% and
12% cents and by dealers at 12% cents
The thing most interesting to producers
at the moment is when they will be able
to resume exports of the metal to Euro-

|

pean countries now at war. The uncer-
| tainty tn shipping circles makes {' risky |
to semi copper to the other side

A war risk of 15 per cent. stil! holds
on exports of the metal, but aside from

this fact shippers do not care to endan-
ger thelr consignments at this time with
vessels of unfriend!y nations awaiting an
opportunity to pounce upon merchantmen
and selze contraband cargoes,

The American Metal Market saye: “The |

|outbreak of the war in Europe has played |
| pared with a surplus of $44,160 a year ago

havoc with the copper market, but no- |
body in the trade thought that things
had reached such a etate with certain

interests that they would be able to itn-
duce the Prngineering and Mining Journal
to suspend all quotations, Certain sell-
ing interests have contracts to take cop-
per based on the Journal's quotations,
which under ordinary conditions is a very
for them, but it would
hawe been embarrassing to have to take
in copper under present conditions, and it
{es very fortunate that the Journal has
suspended quotations,

"There {s just as much of a copper
market to-day as there was tn 1997, and
{f the Journal saw fit to publish prices
every week during that year we would
like to know what is the meaning of their
present action. There are several big
copper houses who would also like to
know this, tncluding one house whose
eales during the last four yeara have
averaged 4 cent per pound above the
Journal's anetasions”
