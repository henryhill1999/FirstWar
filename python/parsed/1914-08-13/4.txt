The character of

Equitable tenants

The Equitable will be a building of character,
not alone as a building, but with respect to
those who conduct their business there. {

|
For it is our avowed purpose not only to have
the Equitable Building famous as a wonder-
structure for the curious, but to give it that
solid, substantial reputation which comes of
being identified with business institutions of
| reliability and repute.
Already the Equitable has leased space to con-
cerns which typify the highest ideals in Ameri-
can business.

| Leases now betny made from May 1,1915. The building, how.
ever, te due to be completed 2 or 3 months ahead of that data,
