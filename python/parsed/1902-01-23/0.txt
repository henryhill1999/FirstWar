NEW ISSUE TO PAY FOR A FORMER
VANDERBILT PURCHASE.

 

Control to Pass to the Bigger Road at
About 6C6 a Share—Pilan to Tunnel
From the Grand Central Under the
East River and Establish a Yard at
Hunter's Point Also Under Considera-
tion —Submitted to State Commission
—It Would Cut Park Avenue Tramo
Two-Thirds and Would Afford a Solu-
tion to the Road's Worst Problem,

Tan Svn learned yesterday on good
authority that a large part of the pro-
ceeds of the proposed $35,000,000 of new
atock of the New York Central Railroad
would be used to pay for the acquisition
of the stock of the Cleveland, Cincinnati,
Chicago and St. Louis (the Big Four) Rail-
road. The Big Four road is controlled by
the Vanderbilts and it is proposed to make
it a dependent possession of the New York
Central, just as are the Lake Shore and
the Michigan Central.

The Big Four's stock, it is said, will be
turned into the New York Central's treasury
at about $96 a share. The Big Four com-
pany has among other assets, a very large
block of Chesapeake and Ohio stock. Rep-
resentatives of the Vanderbilt interests
refused to discuss the report as to the
future of the road.

The acquirement of Big Four stock by
the Vanderbilts has been going on for a
longtime. The lowest price in the common
stock in recent years was 19% in 1896. By
1899 the stock had risen above 60. Since
then, with occasional reactions, ite ten-
dency has been steadily upward. In No-
vember of last year the top price of 101
was touched. Yesterday the stock closed
at 06).

The floating supply of the stock in the
market has been steadily decreasing.
Dividends were resumed in 1900—3 per cent.
being paid that year in semi-annual pay-
ments. Another 1% per cent. dividend
was paid in March last and in September
the rate was raised to 2. The preferred
stock, on which 5 per cent. has been paid
yearly since 1898, sold at the top price of
124 in November last Yesterday it closed
at 118.

In 1900 the Lake Shore and Michigan
Southern Railway purchased $11,225,400
of the $27,989,310 common stook of tho Big
Four company, also purchasing $5,940,000
of the $11,840,000 common and $5,930,000
of the 711,840,000 Lake Erie and Western
preferred stock, these being the entire
holdings of the Vanderbilt roads in the
two companies. The whole cost the Lake
Shore company $12,942,000. It haa been
understood in Wall Street that the Big
Four common stock owned by the Lake
Shore company, together with the private
holdings of both common and preferred
shares of the Vanderbilt family, consti-
tuted a majority of the company’s entire
sharecapital. The preferred stock amounts
to $10,000,000.

“CENTRAL TUNNEL TO HUNTER'S POINT.

It was also learned yesterday that one
of the plans suggested to the New York
Central, which the company has been con-

sidering in addition to its plan for an under-
ground terminus for ite suburban trains,
as a means of solving the tunnel problem,
ie the construction of a tunnel from the
Grand Central Station in Forty-second
street to Hunter's Point, across the East
River, and the laying out there of a big
yard similar to that at Mott Haven. The
outlines of plan, it is said, have heen
submitted to State Railroad Commis-
sion, but the commission has not given
any opinion on the project yet and will not
until it hae looked into the matter
thoroughly.

The objection of the Central to the plans
for tunnel improvement that have been
advanced has been that they were useless
unless the road could get more room. The
traffie of the three roads running into the
tunnel bas far outgrown the capacity of
the tunnel. If there was more yard room
at this end of the line, the officials have
eaid from time to time, it would relieve
the pressure in the tunnel, because it would
then he possible to stall care without send-
na them back through the tunnel to Mott
Haven every time they came in. In the
rame way the bringing of cars down through
the tunnel morning and night for the rush
our service would be made unnecessary

number of other officials. The inquiry
= ? a — examination to find
ou possi w the present system
of signals in the tunnel can be improved,
After a week, which will be devoted to the
examination of the officials of the New
York Central, the Harlem and the New
Haven lines, the commission will hold
executive sessions at which the witnesses
will be signal experts and tunnel managers
from other lines. Already the commission
has before it a number of systems. One
of these is the Tripper system, now in use
by the electrio roads in the Boston tunnel.
By this system a train may run past a danger
signal, but if it does the brakes are auto-
matically set. So that even if an engineer
should die in his cab while his train was
going at full speed it would stop a few
yards on the other side of the first danger
signal it encountered. There is some
question, however, as to whether this
system can be applied to a steam railroad.

District Attorney Jerome said yester-
day that he would complete the Coroner's
inquest to-morrow by the examination
of President Newman and Track Manager
Franklin. No other witnesses will be called.

 

 

 

POLICE HUNT FOR A GIRL,

 

Father Heard She'd Been Kidnapped by a
Young Man—Both Came Home.

James Gresham of 5 South Oxford street,
Brooklyn, who once ran for Congress on
the Republican ticket, reported to Police
Captain Baldwin of the Classon avenue
station last night that his fourteen-year-
old daughter Florence had been kidnapped.
He said that she started on an errand for
her mother and met Robert H. Patton,
the son of John T. Patton, a former livery
stable keeper of 446 Hudson avenue, on
the street, According to Mr. Gresham
young Patton invited the girl to go for a
drive with him and she accepted the invi-
tation.

Mr. Gresham, when this was reported
to him became very much excited and
appealed to the police to find his daughter
and to arrest Patton. A general alarm
was sent to all the precincts in Brooklyn.
The Coney Island, Parkville and Sheeps-
head Bay police turned out all their reserves
to aid in the hunt. The police had no re-
port of the discovery of either the boy or
the girl up to 1 o'clock this morning, but
it was said at the Gresham house that the
girl had returned just before midnight.
Young Patton came home without knowing
that he was a subject of police interest and
went to bed soon after midnight.

James Gresham is an inventor and has
been much absorbed in a device to greatly
increase the speed of ocean steamships.

 

 

FOUGHT FOR LIFE IN ICE FLOE,
Yan, Horse and Wagon Were Swept Head-
long Down Raritan River.

SomeERvILLE, N. J., Jan. 22.—When Tax
Assessor John H. Saums of Hillsborough
township, left his home in Millstone this
morning with his bay trotter hitched to a
light road wagon he found the approaches
to the big iron bridge over the Raritan
River south of this place under three feet

of water. He urged his horse through
and had nearly reached the bridge when

the animal disappeared in a hole that had | 1901 than in any year since 1874

been washed out in the roadbed. The
horse came to the surface and swam out
into the river, carrying the wagon and
Saums with it.

The swift current and floatin
the heavy rains of last night d broken
up swept the horse and wagon along. They
were struck by the ice and rolled over and
over and often disappeared beneath the
surface. The accident was witnessed by
farmers on an embankment near the river,
but they were unable to go to the rescue
through the flooded lowlands. William
Snyder, a farmer who was nearest the river
hid behind his barn to avoid seeing the
man drown

After being swept down the river for
an eighth of a mile Baume cut his horse
from the wagon, and got on its back. Then
Began a desperate eruggle for life. Horse

nd rider were frequently hit by the ice
and submerged, but finally reached shallow
water exhausted, where they were quickly
rescued by the farmers. Saums was taken
to the house of John Frazee. He was cut
and bruised, but was able to return home
later in the day.

LOW FOR EXCISE REFERENDUM

BUT THE MAYOR WANTS IT RE-
STRICTED TO THIS CITY.

 

 

To Meet Citizens’ Committee on Mon-
day, but They Khow His Views—As
to Restaurants Selling Liquor, Ho's
Considering —Expert Deuel's Views.

The sub-committee of the committee of
citizens appointed on Tuesday to confer
with the Mayor on excise legislation has
arranged to meet Mr. Low in the Mayor's
office on Monday morning at 10:80 o'clock.
It was learned yesterday that the action
taken by the whole committee on Tuesday
was, in a meastire, inspired. It is under-
stood now that the committee knew in ad-
vance that the Mayor is heartily in favor
of a referendum. He wants the refer
ence, however, to be made to the people
of this city alone.

The Mayor would very much like, it was
said yesterday, if an arrangement could
be made within twenty-four hours by which
New Yorkers could vote on the question,
If such an arrangement could be made.
the Mayor, so some of his friends said,
would wait until the result of the vote be-
came known before replying to Dr. Park-
hurst’s letter. By that vote, also, he would
be guided in his enforcement of the excise
law.

While it seems to be generally known
among the Mayor's friends that he is in
favor of a referendum, it is not so
well known whether or no he will
favor the other of the committee's pro-
positions, that which would provide
for thesale of liquor in restaurants
under the same conditions as are now in
force in hotels. Some of the committee
tried to find out the Mayor's views on this
proposition before it was approved by the
committee, They learned, so it was said
yesterday, that his Honor said that the
proposition was new to him and he would
want time to think it over.

Magistrate Deuel, who is regarded as
the expert among the City Magistrates on
excise questions, said yesterday that he is
in favor of what some people might call
a semi-open Sunday.

“I am in favor now,” said Mr. Deuel,
“and have been for eome years, of an amend-
ment to the Liquor Tax law which will
permit the a of the saloons on Sun-
day between the hours of 1 and 7 P. M.
for the sale of liquor not to be drunk on
the premises. I am utterly opposed to
the open Sunday hours from noon to 10
P. M. Open saloons during those hours
would be an interference with religious
services. Between the hours of 1 and 7
P. M., however, there are few religious
services. Such an amendment to the law
would enable the poor man to have his beer
for dinner, as the rich man has his wine,
and there would be no turning of drunken
men from the saloons to the streets
would also amend the law so as to provide
for the sale of liquor on Sunday in resorts
where men might take their families for
the afternoon or the evening or both.

“With such amendments to the law, we
would have quite as orealy a Sunday as
we have now, and it would be a brighter
o for the poor. The present law can be
enforced, There's absolutely no doubt
about that. But it would take the entire
police force of the city to enforce it. The
result would be that the violators of other
laws would have fairly easy times.
add that there were fewer penalties imposed
for violations of the Liquor Tax a

he
reason for this I do not give, but it was
evidently not because the liquor dealers
were particularily careful not to violate
the Jaw. You may draw your Own con-
clusions.”

Fritz Lindinger, President of the Liquor
Dealers’ Association, made this announce-
ment yesterday of his views on the excise
question:

“I wish to state that I fully approve of
the course pursued by the fon William
Travers Jerome, He has the proper idea,
and has the full and hearty support of the
organization of which I have the honor
to be chairman, and numbering upward
of 7,000 members in Manhattan and The
Bronx. Mr. Jerome is an upright, honest
and fearless man, and his ehor ® to solve
the liquor question deserve the undivided
support of all right thinking men *

MOUSE IN THE THEATRE—OH!

Squeaks and Squeals From the Orehestra
Chairs at Mrs. Pat Campbell's Play.

Just before the rising of the curtain
on Mrs. Pat Campbell's performance of
*The Notorious Mrs. Ebbamith” last night
at the Theatre Republic a number of women
seated in the first two rows of the orchestra
chairs began to squeal and stand up, and
make wild efforts to get out into the aisle,
Qne of them, who had gold and black open-
work stockings, stood up on the seat of
her chair. Just as the other folks in the
theatre began to wonder what all the trouble
was the curtain went up and the women
quieted down gradually, although one or
two of them bounced into the air from
time to time without Apparent reason.

During the intermission between the
third and fourth acts the disturbance was
renewed and became much more general.
Women in the first ten rows on the east
side of the house were all squeaking and
prancing around together with their skirts
pulled close around their ankles and point-
ing with horrified faces at something under
the seats. Their men folks and several
ushers made wild assaults with umbrellas
and sticks on the hidden foe and it was at
last driven out into the aisle.

It was a single little gray mouse which
had got its time of day mixed up and had
made the fatal mistake of coming out
during a performance. It was slaughtered
by an usher with a broom.

Then Mrs. Pat went on with “The Notor-
ious Mrs. Ebbsmith” as though nothing
more awful had happened.

UNIONS UNFAIR TO

Thetr Complaints Prompted by Malice,
President Pattison Says.

President Richard Pattison of the Board
of Delegates of the Building Trades made
an official statement yesterday regarding
the complaint that the new city adminis-
tration is not keeping its promises to the
labor unions, Mr. Pattison says that the
complainants were only too anxious to
make complaints and that the complaints
themselves wero prompted by Tammany
Hall.

“There are no good grounds for any of
the complaints,” he declares. “The new
administration has not yet had time to be
fully conversant with the needs of the
city and there is no reason to assume that
the promises of Mayor Low and the new
heads of departments will not be carried
out. Mr. Low has always shown himself to
be a friend of organized labor and even
when he was Mayor of Brooklyn he had
ap geet will of the working people. —

“We do not forget that the trades unions
were snubbed both by Mayor Van Wyck
and Corporation Counsel Whalen during
Mayor Van Wyck's term of office. Mr.
Whalen put himself on record as saying
that $2 a day was enough for any working-
man. I voice the sentiments of the entire
Board of Delegates when I say that organ-
ized labor generally has confidence that
Mayor Low and the other city officers of
the new administration will be fair and just
to the working people on city work.”

 

 

Low.

NEW BANK OF ENGLAND QUEER SEMBRICH HURT IN SNEEZING.

 

RUSSIAN OF FERS COUNTERFEITS
TO THE STATE BANK.

 

Stamp of the London and Weatminster
Rank, Presumably Imitated, on Their
Face —Counterfeits Very Nearly Per-
fect—Watermark Betrayed Them

New counterfeit Bank of England notes,
with the stamp of the London and West-
minster Bank on their face, appeared in
this city yesterday. Jacob Stern, a man
of 30. who says he is a Russian artist and
came here from Bremen a month ago pro-
duced £155 of them at the State Bank in
Grand street. He poked them in at the
cashier's window at 2 o'clock in the after-
noon and asked for their value in American
money. The State Bank doesn't handle
many Bank of England notes and the cashier
asked Manager Roth about it. Roth thought
the notes were not quite right and they told
Stern that they would have io send them
to an exchange office downtown to find
out their precise value.

“Come back in three-quarters of an hour,”
said Roth. Stern said he would.

Oscar L. Richard, President of the bank
is also head of (. B. Richard & Co., bankers
at 61 Broadway, who do a large exchange
business. At their office Manager Machol
and Assistant Manager Reisman pronounced
the notes counterfeits. (. B. Richard &
Co. at once notified the United States Secret
Service and the State Bank sent word to
Police Headquarters.

When Stern came back for his money
Secret Service Agents Connell and Peake
and Detective Sergeant Kiernan were
waiting for him. He wastaken to Police
Headquarters for the night. He is a fine
looking man, was well-dressed and wore a
Vandyke beard. He said that he had found
the notes on the sidewalk in Bowling Green.
He wou!d give no other explanation.

The notes are five £53, three £108 and
two £508 Mr. Reisman said last night
that they were nearly perfect

“The watermarks are a little heavier
and longer than in the genuine note,” said
he. “It would have been difficult to dis-
cover the counterfeit had the notes been
worn at all, They are brand new. The
stamping of the name of the London and
Westminster Bank on the face was a clever
trick, Persons buying notes of this kind
usually ask for an indorsement by the
seller in order that there may be no @tis-
pute about where the note came from in
case it turns out to bea counterfeit. The in-
dorsement has no other significance

“A counterfeit Bank of England note is
a rare thing. I have seen them before,
but never so perfect a one as those of to-
day. When Mr. Roth compared them with
the genuine he was convinced that they were
counterfeits and he sent them to Manager
Machol of our concern for his, opinion,
which was to the same effect.”

*The last forgery of Bank of England
notes that I know of,” said Director FE. H
Richard of the State Bank, “was at the time
of the Bidwell! forgeries, 1 don't know how
many years ago.”

William B, Flynn, who haa charge of the
Secret Service bureau in this city, said
imitation

| that the notes were the finest
i that he had ever seen The watermark
was particularly well reproduced. The

lof the Journal office at

English bank authorities hold that it is
absolutely impossible to imitate it

Strange Mishap Causes Postponement of

been permitted to see the contracts and
the list of subseribers. On the list were
the signatures of Levi P. Morton, Andrew
Carnegie, Daniel O'Day, of the Standard

“I did not care to be handed down to
fame in just this way,” said this million-

Mr. Morton said last night that he had
