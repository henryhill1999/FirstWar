JITSU

FOR GIBSON

Authorities Decide It Is New
York Case—Will Act
To-day.

 

DETERMINED BY AUTOPSY
Judge Admits Evidence Sup-
ports Charge of Murder and
Orders Arrest.

 

A warrant charging Burton W. Gib-
son with the murder of Mrs. Rose
Menschik Szabo was issued yesterday
by County Judge Herbert C. Royce of
Middletown.
had left his law office at
oo Liberty street before Deputy Sheriff
Willis C. Degraw could reach the city,
and as he lives at Rutherford, N. J., it
was decided not to arrest him until he
landed on New York soll this morning,
unless he endeavored to leave his home
during the night. In that case the
Rutherford police, who were cognizant
of the situation, were to act.

The action taken by the Orange
county Judge in ordering the arrest of
Gibson vesterday was after District At-
torney Thomas C. Rogers had laid a
strong first hand case of murder be-
fore him.

Nothing was taken for granted by the
Judge, who had all the conservatism of
a man who must angwer to the tax-
payers. There was no hearsay ev!-
dence accepted. A delay in granting
the writ was due to the insistence of
the Judge that Dr. Otto H. Schultze,
Coroner's physician of Manhattan, who
assisted at the autopsy and who made
a microscopic examination of the in-
ternal organs, as well as a chemical!
analysis of the contents of the stomach
and other organs of the dead woman,
should appear personally before him.

Dr. Schultze swore before the court
that Mrs. Szabo died by strangulation
and not by drowning when she fell out
of the boat on Greenwood Lake on
July 16. In other words the physician,
who has conducted several thousand
autopsies, swore that Mrs. Szabo was
so Injured before she fell into the water

Gibson

on that. day that she never breathed
after she had sunk below the sur-
face of the water.

The testimony of the ‘surgeon In-

jected into the case a new feature of
the murder, He testified that there was
experience in jiu jitsu. and an expert
knowledge of anatomy and physiology
concerned in the woman's death. i

According to the surgeon, before Mrs.
Szabo fell from the boat on that day
she suffered a sharp blow on the throat
which so affected a nerve in the throat
as to close her air passage, making it
impossible for her to breathe. The fact
that she had never drawn breath after
she was struck was shown by the fact
that although she was under water
there was no single sign of it In her
lungs. There Gan no congestion, which
