PERSHING'S TROOPS
NOW ON THE MARCH

‘Entire 12,000 Men in Mexico
Will Be Brought Out as
One Body.

MILITIA TO BE RELEASED
Strong Border Guard to ‘Be
Ready to Enter Again if
Emergency Arises.

WASHINGTON, Jan, 271,—Withdrawal of |

the American troops from exico has
been ordered by the War Department,
and officials here expect that by Monday
morning the entire column will be mov-
ing north. The exact time of the with-
drawal is left by the department's or-
ders to the discretion of Major-Gen.
Funston, the border commander, and
will be determined by his assessment of
military conditions and facilities for
transportation.

As soon as the regulars reach the bor-
der a large proportion of the National
Guardsmen still at the border, and pos-
sibly all of them, will be relieved and
sent home for muster out.

It is expected here that about a week
will be required to bring the entire com-
mand to the border.

Although officials have been silent on
the subject of Mexico since failure of the
joint commission negotiations, develop-
ments outwardly have coupled the troop
withdrawal with Carranza’s refusal to
accept the Atlantic City protocol and
have plainly forecast an Intention to let
the First Chief settle for himself here-
after the many problems endangering
the tenure of the de facto Government.

Rigid Border Control.

A patrol considered adequate to pro-
tect the border will be maintained
rigidly, however, and notice has been
served on Carranza that the United
States will not hesitate to use its armed
forces again, if necessary, to protect
American territory and American rights.
‘The Americans on the joint commission
told their Mexican colleagues at Atlantic
City that this Governmen never would re-
linquish the right of unlimited and un-
restricted pursuit of bandits guilty of
border depredations.

That Gen. Pershing's command, sent
into Mexico last March to disperse the
bandits who raided Columbus, will be
regrouped at the border and put into
a condition of preparedness for a recur-
rence of raiding, is not doubted here,
and in that connection army officers
are observing with keen interest the
preparations being made dy Villa and
his followers and allies to debate the
territory that Petshing will evacuate.

All the recent moves in the Mexican
situation, however, and all those in con-
templation, are kept under cover by the
officials shaping the course of the Ad-
ministration. After Carranse sent back
the Atlantic City protocol without his
signature, it was made known that when
the time came for the next step it would
be taken without announcement, and
that the future policy of the Adminis-
tration would be revealed only as it was
translated into action. In line with this
decision, the War Department made no
announcement of the withdrawal order
to-day and officials there and at the
State Department and the White House
rigidly preserved silence about Mexico.

10,000 Are Concentrated.

It is known, however, that President
Wilson's determination to withdraw the
troops followed closely upon the failure
of Carranza to ratify the agreement
entered into at Atlantic City, and that
Mr. Wilson indorsed the American com-
missioners’ recommendation that he act
independently on the question of with-
drawal and adopt @ policy of purely for-
mal, rather than altruistic, treatment of
Carranza, ,

Gen. Funston was apprised of this de-
cision immediately and soon after that
went into Mexico and discussed with
Gen. Pershing personally the question of
moving the troops. His return to the
border was followed by ‘(preliminary
movements to facilitate a withdrawal.

Of the 12,000 men in Pershing'’s com-
mand, 10,000 have been concentrated at
Colonia Dublan for the march north.
Most of that number have been there
for many weeks, but a large part ar-
rived within the last two days from El
Valle, which has been the southernmost
point of the expeditionary force since
the fight at Carrizal. The plan is to
march the entire force out at the same
time, leaving no detachment far to the
rear as @ bait for attacks from wander-
ing bands of rebels.

It has been indicated that the border
guard will be maintained indefinitely at
almost its present potential strength,
even if it is reduced in numbers. It is
pointed out that the stationing of Per-
shing’s 12,000 men along the border will
make up for the withdrawal of more
than an equal number of guardsmen, be-
cause a large part of the strength of the
army on the border has been used up to
now in supporting the column south of
the line.

Many army officers high in the service
believe that the withdrawal of Gen, Per-
thing will mean early occupation of the
territory about Colonia Dublan by Villa
and his followers. Gen, Obregon has
ordered the forces of Gens. Murgula and
Dieguez to that section, but information
at the War Department indicates that
Villa, with a strong command, has been
inoving steadily forward into strategic
positions near by, prepared for a deter-
mined interference with Carranza’s
forces whenever he can get at them.

PERSHING’S MEN START.

U. S. Troops Begin Firet Leg of
Homeward March.

Eu Paso, Tex., Jan, 27,—American
troops of Major-Gen, Pershing’s punitive
expedition tramped along the high road
leading from Colonia Dublan to the bor-
der to-day on the first leg of their re-
‘urn from the march which took them
i to Mexico in pursuit of Francisco
Jilla,

To-night the troops were encamped
along the road with the head of the
column twenty miles north of the Mor-
non colony where Gen. Pershing has
made his field headquarters since the ex-
pedition ceased its pursuit of Villa.

At sunrise the advance guard of fhe
expeditionary forces was on the way to
the border, according to Americans who
came from the front late to-day on truck
trains to Columbus, N. M, Gen, Pershing
vnd his staff were expected to be among
ihe last to leave fleld headquarters and
wil! ride to the first night's encampment
in automobiles with the rear guard, these
arrivals said, The march will be re-
sumed to-morrow,

Stop at Las Palomas Lakes.

Gen, Pershing was said to have ar-
ranged to establish his porary field
headquarters at Las lomas Lakes,
seven miles south of the border, where
he would hold a general review before
completing the march into Colunfbus.
The actual crossing of the order would
hot occur, it was predicted to-night, un-

Ul next week.
Following the troops were hundreds
of refugees.  P Mormon fami-

é rosperous
hes rode in comfortable farm wagons or
in small motor cars. Some Mexicans

ros and on the motor lorries of thé ex-

evacuated region walked through the deep
dust which had been made by the feet of
hundreds of troops. The exodus of civil-
jan residents was caused through fear
that Villa might take vengeance upon
them for having served the American
troops while in Mexico.

Villiatas im the Wake.

Villa followers were moving in the
wake of the American expeditionary
forces as they withdrew from E! Valle,
San Joaquin and Charcos, according to
a report received here from previously |
reliable sources. They remained at safe |
distances, but moved northward slowly
as the rear guard of the American col- |
umns disappeared toward the north, it
was sald.

When the last of the Fifth Cavalry
cantered out of El Valle Wednesday
morning the Carranza garrison there,
consisting of 100 soldiers, left for Casas
Grandes to join the garrison at that
point. From this same source it was
learned that the Villa troops met with
no resistance at El Valle, but appeared |
soon after the last American troops had |
left and occupied the Plaza. : |

Government agents here received a|
report from local Mexican sources to- |
day that Villa had been defeated by
Gen. Francisco Murguia’'s troops in the
vicinity of La Junta, Chihuahua. He
was said to have lost his trains and
200 killed and wounded.

The same source reported that Jose
Ynez Salazar and Villa had quarrelled
again and that Salazar had gone to of

|

 

mountains with 1,600 men.

RAIDS TO BE AVERTED. |

Obregon Says Marguia Will Inter-
cept Villa Column.

Mexico City, Jan. 27.—Gen. Obregon,
Minister of War, announced to-day that |
complete preparations had been made!
for the occupation by Government troops |
of the positions in northern Mexico from
which Gen. Pershing withdraws, and that
orders had been given to Gen. Murguia
for such disposition of his troops as will
prevent any raid by Villa's command.

“The military situation throughout the
republic has improved immeasurably
during the last month and Gen. Mur-
guia's campaign in the north is proceed-
ing with the utmost success,” said Gen.
Obregon. “This is the first real cam-|
paign in the north againet Villa and will
be pressed home to the end. The Gov-
ernment*never again will make the mis-
take of simply defeating and scattering
the bandits, but will crush them beyond
any chance of recovery or of future
menace.”

Villa, said Gen. Obregon, now is in the
mountains of western Chihuahua, near:
the Sonora border. \

Gen. Obregon expressed an urgent}
hope that; on the departure of Gen. |
Pershing’s command, the American em-
bargo on shipment of, arms and ammu-
nition to Mexico would be lifted, saying
that euch action would be material aid
toward the prompt pacification of the en-
tire country.

MEXICANS BEATEN OFF.;

Band: Which Fired on Utah Cavalry

Tccson, Ariz., Jan. 27.—Fighting at
Stonehouse, on the border near Arivaca,
Aris., between Mexicans and United
States cavalrymen stopped at noon to-
day, according to reports to-night. No
casualties were reported on the Ameri- |
can side. Mexican losses are unknown.

Mexican Consul Delgado at Nogales
telegraphed to @hertff Rye Miles of
Pima county here to-day that he bee
lieved the Mexicans were Carranza
soldiers, Authoritative reports from
Arivaca said the Mexicans who fired
upon the Americans were members of
the Carranza garrison stationed on the
border. The Mexicans fled at 10:30
o'clock this morning and the Americans |
grossed the border, but found no}
‘wounded or dead Mexicans.

Lying in rocks close to the internation-
al line, forty members of Troop B, First |
Utah cavalry commanded by Lieut. Arne, |
kept up a fire across the border off and |
on all night. The Mexicans replied from
their side of the line. This morning the

WILSON LOSES HOPE
‘OF DRIVING SENATE

Administration Backdown on
Legislative Programme
Arouses Interest.

 

 

AGAINST EXTRA SESSION

 

Railway and Water Power
Bills Among Those Likely
to Be Jettisoned.

 

WASHINGTON, Jan. 27,—Democratic
leaders in the Senate have practically
abandoned the legislative programme of
President Wilson. There is reason to be-
lieve the President, after a few visits to
the Capitol to urge action, has realized
the hopelessness of trying to drive the
Senate and has given up the plan. At
any rate some Republican Senators have
learned on what purports to be high
Democratic authority that the President
probably will not call an extra session,
even if the whole programme fails, pro-
vided the Senate passes the general ap-
propriation bills and the revenue meas-
ure now before the House.

The Administration backdown on the
programme of dominating Congress
aroused much interest to-day in the lim-
ited circle to which the facts were made
known. The programme of legislation
that will be jettisoned includes the rail-
way bills which the President recom-
mended and which have been changed in
such a way that if passed they will not
be recognized by him; the water power
bill, which has been tied up hopelessly
in,a constitutional snarl in the Senate

nationalists and between the conserva-
tionists of the old and new schools; the
Porto Rican bill, in which there is less
interest ; the Webb bill for foreign sell-
ing agencies, to which there is not so
much opposition and which may’ creep
under the tent yet, as one Senator ex-
pressed it; the corrupt practices bill,
which everybody views with askance, and
a few minor matters.

Many Hopes Blasted.

With the session so far advanced lead-
ers in the Senate recognize that unless
the general programme is cut out en-
tirely and the work of the rest of the ses-
sion devoted to routine the extra session
cannot be avoided. For some reason
best known to himself the President
does not want an extra session, but his
party. leaders told him he could abandon
his legislative programme or accept the
inevitable—the failure of his necessary
supply and revenue bills. In the cloud
of smoke that arises from the offering
up of so much Presidential legislative
hopes goes also the hopes of many good
people for a bill for universal military
training.

In the collapse of the Administration
legislative plan some wiseacres to-day
read the end of the attempts on the part
of the Executive to direct legislation
from the little red ‘room at the end of
the Senate lobby, called by courtesy the
“President's room.” It was a remark-
able precedent the President set when
he announced his intention to take com-
mand {n person of the legislative pro-
gramme, as most Senators viewed it. In
the failure of the plan many observers
to-day read another triumph for the
silent and deliberative Senate over
would-be trespassers on its ancient con-
stitutional preserves,

“The Senate kills with silence,” said
one of the leaders to-day. There was no
general outburst in the Senate against
the President's plan for driving legisla-
tion, but the plan failed just the same.

Yay by day the appropriation bills lagged
men of Troop E' were relieved by Troop Pe Te erate

Talk went on, but of the
monotonous sort, much of it about noth-
ing in particular. The appropriation
bill, however, that was to have been dis-
posed of in a single afternoon required
ten days.

Old System to Obtain.

In sheer desperation the Senate lead-
ers gave up the attempt to stand behind
the President in his plan to boss the
job and it will be turned back into the
conservative hands that have guided it
in other days. It would surprise none
if the routine did not take on new spirit
next week and things move with accus-

The steering committee of the Senate
will meet to-morrow (Sunday) to fron
out the wrinkles. There are a few
Senators whose feelings will have to be
cared for. Men behind the power bills,

the oil leasing bill and other measures

NORTH TO PAY MOST OF TAX.

Southern Democrats Achleve

Double Purpose in New Bill.

WASHINGTON, Jan, 27.—Following dis-
cussion of the operations of the proposed
Democratic revenue bill as adopted last
night in caucus Southern Democrats are
congratulating themselves to-day on the

adroitness with which their leaders have
placed both the tax and the responsibil-
ity for the revenue requirements “north
of Mason and Dixon's line.”

It developed to-day through a colloquy

which attended an attack on the bill by

Representative Gillet of Massachusetts
that Mr. Kitchin and his anti-prepared-
neas friends on the Ways and Means
Committee framed the measure with the
double purpose of imposing the burden
on industry in the Northern, central and
mountain States and also with a view to
discrediting expenditures for prepared-
ness before their Southern constituents,
thus vindicating their former opposition
to preparedness measures.

Mr. Kitchin to-day in reply to a
query by Representative John J. Rog-
ers of Massachusetts répeated what he
had eaid in caucus:

“[ said something like this: ‘That
these taxes will go to pay appropriations
practically all or most of which go
north of Mason and Dixon's line, and I
will say that now. That is, appropria-
tions for preparedness, ship yards, munl-
tion makers, &c., will go to the benefit
of those classes who happen to live
north of Mason amd Dixon's line.”

“Where do you think the tax will
fall—south of Mason and Dixon's line?”
asked Representative Norton of North
Dakota,

“I think most or the greater part of
the tax will be levied north of Mason
and Dixon's line,” replied Mr. Kitchin.
“All those fellows who live in the lo-
calities who will pay the large part of
this tax can get rid of it by moving
down to my town of Scotland Neck and
spending a little bit of it there.”

should have tubes of the diameter of 24

ing the tubes to 24 inches at once and
cutting out the wagon service, This
would be a matter of economy as well
as convenience both to the Government
and the city,” said Mr, Morgan.

Mayor Mitchel dealt mainly with the
effect on the traffic of the city of in-
creasing the vehicular traffic by wagon
or automobile service,

“There were 659 persons killed in the

of these 105 were killed by motor trucks
which represent less than 2% per cent.
of the vehicles that move in the streets.
I say in all solemnity that the traffic
problem is a crushing one in New York
city to-day. It has already cost the city
millions and will cost millions more be-
fore we have solved it.”

In closing the Mayor said: “I want to
lay before this committee the lives of the
city of the future, lay them on this
table. The adoption by you of the recom-
mendation of the Postmaster-General for
the increase of motor trucks in the
streets of New York will ‘be an actual
menace to us.”
