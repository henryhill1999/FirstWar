Wanted.

 

 

* Embargoes, Floods and Lack

of Raw Materials Curtail
Production.

 

American steel mills continued to be
“overwhelmed jast week with inquiries
&, from foreign countries for steel plates,
% rails, cars, tin plates and munition ma-
Jterial, Domestic requirements at the
** @ame time were equally heavy, while the
mills have been hampered by ratlroad
embargoes, floods and a lack of raw ma-

terial to keep the plants operating at
full capacity.

It ie estimated that production in the
Pittsburg district, where floods occurred,
was further reduced 10 to 12 per cent.
Incidentally shipments against contracts
have been smaller in volume, while spec-
ifications against orders are sufficient to
keep the mills operating at full capacity
for six monthe or loner.

Entente agents since the first of the

eear have been able to place large con-
tracts for shell steel with four or five

“mite. Actual purchases for 1917 deliv-
ery, mainly during the second haif of

* the year, aro estimated at 600,000 tons,

*, and Canadian inquiries are in the mar-

“ket for approximtacly 300,000 tone of
Dillets and forgings.

Export sales of commercial shapes are
w Yelatively small, but Italy obtained 10,-
st 000 tons of billets from an eastern Penn-

eyivania mill, and other small lots
* amounting to several thousand tons have
< been sold for shipment to Great Britain
at prices ranging from $58 to $63 a ton

+ Although inquiries for 150,000 tons of
marine and structural plates and shapes
*are before the mills orders for only 20,-

delivery. Most of the sales are for do-
“mestio shipment. A few thousand tons

The first setp toward the development
of the resources of Hayti by American
capital, as an outcome of the treaty ex-
ecuted recently between the Government
of that republic and the United States,
has been taken by a group of New York,
Chicago and Cincinnati bankers. In des-
patches from Albany it was announced
that the financiers had obtained a char-
ter for the Haytian American Corpora-
tion, capitalization of which is to be
$6,000,000 of preferred stock at a par
value of $100, 60,000 shares of common
stock without par value and 60,000
shares of founders’ stock with no par
value,

The principal object of the corporation
is to develop the vast resources of the
island, which have lain dormant since the
Napoleonic era, more than one hundred
years ago, and to restore the country to
the condition of prosperity it enjoyed in
those days. The company has acquired
the control of the railroad, electric light
plant, wharf and warehouses in Port au
Prinee, the capital and principal seaport
of the island, which are now being oper-
ated profitably under exclusive conces-
sions and which serve the most thickly
populated portion of the country. The
company also has acquired control of the

in the little State of Yucatan, in south-
ern Mexico. ,

In ite report the committee said:

“As this monopoly is beyond the ter-
ritory of the United States, it is dificult
to see how it can be reached. Whether
our laws have been-violated or not, there
ean be no question that the Comission
Reguladora conducts a most oppressive
monopoly.”

Menalio Marin, agent of the commis-
sion in New York, asserts

fibre is being sold to American manu-

; rectly,

that sisal!

facturers at from 2%, to 6 cents a pound |
below the price of its competitor, manila |

hemp, and that it is his belief an or-
gunized publicity campaign is being con-
ducted by American manufacturers with
the deliberate purpose of preparing the
farmers to pay excessive prices for twine
and put all the blame therefor on the
Mexican farmers who produce and sell
sisal fibre.

“It is true,” said Mr. Marin, “that
sisal fibre is selling at a price consider-
ably higher than a year ago, but like;
wise the products of the American farms
are higher—-in fact during the year just
ended American
dreds of millions of dollars more for
their grain crops, whereas the Yucatan
planters really netted practically noth-

is ownership of land in excess of 20,000

acres and will at once install a centrale
with a capacity of 2,000 tons a day.

In discuseing the advantages to be de-
rived by the people of Hayti through the
investment of American capital in the
island, H. BR. Tippenhauer, president of
the Tippenhauer Trading Co., who was
born in Hayti, said:

“We natives of Hayti have fealized
that sooner or later the island would re-
gain the splendor of former times, when,
as a colony of France, it was conisdered,
and justly so, one of France's most val-
uable possessions. This moment, the ar-
rival of which we had foreseen for years,
came in September, 1915, with the es-
tablishment of an American protectorate
over Hayti.

“With the impending development of
Hayti'’s natural resources and the ac-
companying investment of American
capital, the public utilities, such as those
the new corporation controls, will be the
first to be benefited, directly or indi-
Incidentally the whole island
will.

Vast Area to Cultivate,

“The island of Hayti fs situated al-
most in the centre of the West Indies,
between Cuba and Parto Rico. It is di-
vided into two parts, the Dominican Re-
public, comprising the eastern’ two-
thirds, and the Republic of Hayti, the
western third. The latter, exclusive of

j; adjacent small islands, has an area of

/is about 110 miles, and from east

10,200 square miles, being about one-
fourth the size of Cuba and pot quite
three times as large as Porto Rico. The
greatest distance from north to south

to

| west about 190 miles across the southern

ing by reason of the increase in price of!

their fibre, because what they received
came right back to the United States in
payment for flour, corn, wheat, meats,
machinery and other commodities which
have greatly increased in price.”

“Hayti's present annual trade amounts
to about $25,000,000 and T do not hesi-
tate to say that with stability of govern-
ment and a systematic and intelligent
development, it will be increased tenfold
within a comparatively short period, My
reasons for this assertion are several.

“Hayti has a superficial area of six
million acres, of which 3,690,000 acres
are occupied by mountains, rivers, water
courses and springs; towns, villages and
hamlets; forests, highways and roads,
and lands generally unfit for cultivation.
The remaining 2,400,000 acres represent
the lands absolutely fit for high cultiva-
tion, but of these only 160,000 acres
are under culture; and it is from this
one-sixteenth that the present expor.
trade of Hayti is derived.

“When-~we consider that the cultiva-
tion on this one-sixteenth is but crude,

BY BANK OF FRANCE

Official Report Made on Hold-

Special Correspondence to Tur Scn.
Lonpon, Jan. 17.-—The French State
Bank holds the largest amount of gold
of any institution in Europe, Russia com-
ing next. These facts appear from a
return given in an official report, which

gives the latest figures as follows:

  
    

 

 

 

1916. 1914

France... .ccceecesss $1,016, 186,000 $828, 350,000

Austria-Hungary. None Issued 257,890,000,
Belgium an None issued 54,485,000

"It is possible that the figures for Italy tn-
clude seme portion in silver.

During the year the holdings of gold

most of the state banks have in-
creased, The Allies’ gold resources total
$2,227,985,000, or, taking into account
the British visible stock other than that
in the Bank of England note reserve,
amounting to $560,525,000, a grand total
of 2,788,510,000, as compared with
$629,770,000, as announced by the Ger-
man Reichsbank.

Notwithstanding the vicissitudes at-
taching to this war of wars, the Bank
of England has maintained a unique po-
sition among other State banks by the
encashment of its notes in gold on de-
mand, and also as to the proportion be-
tween the*gold reserves and the total of

by

  

notes issued, The amount was 74 per
cent. of the note issue. The proportion
of gold to the amount of notes in cir-

culation other than those retained by the
Bank of England was very much greater
than this, namely 138 per cent.

‘At Discount in Sweden,

Last spring Denmark, Norway and
Sweden released their respective banks
from the obligation of buying gold ata
fixed rate. A year ago Messrs. Sain-
uel Montagu & Co, remarked that “a
glut of gold has its disadvantages as well
as a deficteney,” and the action of these
Seandinavian countries is an
confirmation of this statement. So re-
luctant was Sweden to receive payment
in gold that a parcel shipped as a te-
mittance to that country was refused by
the Riksbank at the normal price, and
only received, as a matter of grace, at
2 per cent. below. Thus goid was at a
disoount in Sweden, as compared with
its currency.

The bullion letter adds: “This unique
crisis in the fortunes of the British Em-
pire has revealed the strength of its
tirances, the resilience of its trade, and

 

a spirit of self-sacrifice in which the
British people and those varied races ;
whose destinies are linked with the}
British Crown have slaared alike.”

Commenting on the oullook, the report
says the State has been driven by the
force of events to become «a= spend-
thrif

 

“The return of the State to its normal
condition of an economical spender will
be fraught with danger, for it will im-
upon workers and capitalists the
of making good the Interest upon
ts debts at the very moment when it
to be their best customer for
goods and money.

“Both wages and commodities have
risen in value on wecount of the war,
but both will not fail on the proclama-
tion of peace. The return of several!
million men to industrial markets not
yet accommodated to new conditions
will, except in certain skilled occupations,
create a tendeney for wages to fall.
On the other hand, the cost of living
will remain high until shipping facili-
tres, production and our export of manu-
factured and raw material expand.

CeASES

ee Post-war Demands,

“Post-war demand upon this country
for gold will be governed, among other
factors, by the indebtedness of allied
Governments to Great Britain, the ques-
tion of indemnities ind a probable de-
mand from abroad for gilt edge securi-
ties

“The dominant factor af all, however,
will be the ability of her sons and
daughters to Insure that the world shall
remain debtor to their industry.

“It was stated by Prof. Foxwell to-
ward the close of May last that the
Urited States of America had absorbed
{350,000,000 ($1,750,000,000) worth of
American securities since the beginning
of the war, The total amount of such
securities estimated to be held by Eng-
lish Investors before the war amounted
to between £500,000,000 ($2,500,000,000)
and £600,000,000 (¢€$3,000,000,000),

“The Transyaal and other African dis.
tricts," adds the circular, “continue to
show improving returns, and the world’s
gold production for 1916 is likely to be
about £99,006,000 ($495,000,000)."°

Mrs. Heath Says Any Plan to)

Will Assist Caminetti.

 

! Women the country over will be only

; too glad to cooperate with the Depart-

| ment of Labor in its attempt to solve the
| “servant problem,” Mrs, Julian Heath,
| President of the Housewives League, said
| yesterday, Any plan that will help to
| dignify housework and make it so at-
tractive that more girls will adopt it as
la profession will be welcomed with
\ shouts of approval, and, what is better,
| with hands outstretched to help.

| Mrs, Heath said she went to Wash-
, ington three weeks ago and had a talk}
with Immigration Commissioner Cami-
netti, who has announced that the Gov-
ernment, with the assistance of house- |
wives in and out of women's clubs, 18 |
about to tackle the problem. She found,
'she said, that his ideas were splendid,
tand the branches of her teague in other
Jeities will give him every possible aid,
{Thus far Mr, Caminetti has asked only
jfor advice and promise of cooperation
and has not made public the dethils of
his programme,

said Mrs, Heath, “we will get the

zations will do their share. The servant
problem is merety a tater problem and
should be treated as one. One of the
linet things to be done ts to alter the re-
lations between empioyer and employee.
The terminology ‘mistress and maid,
‘master and servant,’ Is unfortunate and
must be changed. It will be a great
step forward when housework {is placed
on the eame plane as other honest work
and the girl who works in the kitchen
or the dining toom regards herself and
is regarded by her employer as a worker, |
not a ‘servant.’

“But first housework must be stan-
| dardized by the general use of efficient
| methods. Kitchen labor is not drudgery
jie the housewife will fit up her kitchen

with modern labor saving and step say- |
ing appliances such as her husband re-
gards as a necessity in his business. |
This fact must be impressed on women
everywhere. Housewifery is a business
}—-a woman's business—although com- |
| paratively few women regard it in that |
| ight and consequently they make a muss!
| of it. The other day I had occasion to |

NEW ASTORIA LINE
TO OPEN THURSDAY

Will Operate in “Connection
With Queensboro Subway
to Grand Central.

The Public Service Commission an-
nounced yesterday that the Interborough
Rapid Transit Company would begin op-
eration of the new Astoria elevated line
on February 1. This part of the dual
system will afford relief to a district not
now served by any rapid transit line and
will also connect other Queens lines with
the new Queensboro Bridge Plaza station,

The line just completed cost $1,350,-
000 without equipment It leaves the
Queensboro Bridge Pluza at Jackson
avenue, turning into Second or Debevoise
avenue at Paynter avenue and then ex-
tends northerly on Debevoise avenue to
a point between Potter and Ditmars
avenues, approximately a mile from the
northern water front. Stations are lo-
cuted at Beebe avenue, Washington ave-
nue, Broadway, Grand avenue, Flushing
and Hoyt avenues and Ditmars avenue.
The last two are express stations served
by a third track,

The first operation of the line will
be in connection with the Queensboro
subway from Grand Central station in
Manhattan to the Queensboro Bridge
Plaza station. Early in the summer
trains also will be operated by way of
Queensboro Bridge in connection
with the Second avenue elevated line
to Park Row. Upon the completion of
the new East River tunnel under Sixtieth
street two yeare hence, operation will
be had by the New York Consolidated
Railroad Company, a B. R. T, subsidiary,

will tap a terri-

The reute for the new line follows a

beginuing at the Spuyten Duyvil station
of the New York Central on the Hudeon
River, running along the Harlem River
ship canal to Tibbet Creek, to West
288th street, to Bailey avenue, to Mosh-

nine miles and it is estimated the project
will cost about $1,000,000,

A strong feature of the new route ts
that it will cross all the north and south
transit lines at points where there are
Stations, thus filling the demand for a
