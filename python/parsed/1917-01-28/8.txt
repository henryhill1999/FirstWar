OVER BELGIUM ‘BELATED JUDGESHIP

IN REPUBLICAN CLUB, TIES UP AN ELECTION

 

Theodore Marburg Resents| Legality ofSwayze Reappoint-

German Professor's Expla-
nation of Invasion.

PEACE SOON PATCHED UP
President Wilson's Recent
speech to Senate Is Favor-
ably Discussed.

 

The Republican Club was more or less

peacefully discussing “What can be done | 37

ment Made Issue of. Con-
test in Hoboken.

 

Gov. Edge of New Jersey did not re-
@ppoint Francis J. Swayze as a Justice
of the New Jersey Supreme Court until
last Monday, whereas his term of of-
fice expired two days previously, The
fact is likely to occupy the attention of
the courts for some time to come. The
contention regarding the alleged lapse
in Justice Swayze's judicial authority

was raised yesterday in connection with
the recanvass of the votes cast for the

to insure world peace after the war?”,@t the November election, which has
yesterday at its weekly luncheon when a! been carried on by the County Board of

clash of views stirred up a lively rumpus.
Prof. Moritz J. Bonn of Munich was

| bei

or in Jersey City since Decem-
r 7.

On the face of the returns Paul Seglie,

explaining his version of the etart of | Who fs allied with the anti-Verdon wing

the war when Theodore Marburg, for-
merly United States Ambassador to Bel-
gium, jumped to his feet and amid ap-
plause and hisses and ‘cries both of “Go
on!” and “Sit down!” championed Bel-
gium.

With the shouts of tho several hun-
dred present making his words almost
inaudible Mr. Marburg said: “Mr. Chair-
man, I realize that I am only a guest
bere and that this {ts hardly an open
forum, but I cannot remain eilent
while this smiling gentleman backs up
the effort of his Government !n a nen-
deavor to rob Belgrum of her honor after
beating her bleeding people to the earth.
Hie accusation that Belgium was open-
ing her door to England was a false ac-
cusation. All the eviden as viewel
from what has happened shows simply a
German assault on Belgium.”

Due to a Misanderstanding.

The dramatic incident was explained
afterward as resulting from a misunder-
standing of the meaning of Dr. Bonn’s
words. His reference to a “certain emall
nation was applied by Mr. Marburg to
mean Belgium when Dr. Bonn announced
later that he referred to Serbia.

President Wilson's recent step in the
direction of a world peace pact was the

. theme of most of the addresses during
the afternoon, The purposes and plans
of the International League to Enforce
Peace were described at some length by
several of the epeakers and for the most
part the comment on the President's mes-
@age to the Senate was very favorable.

“The President's address,” said Dr. W.
H. P. Faunce, president of Brown Uni-
versity, “has forced the proclamation of
democratic principles in every court im
Europe. The consent of the governed,
the equality of nations, liberty of work
and worship for all, freedom of the weak
from the oppression of the strong, re-
lease from ever increasing competitive
armaments, thse principles are the bed
rock of American life and are now for
the first time being discussed with joy
throughout the civillzed world. We must
give Europe more than munitions—we
must give principles and ideals.”

U. 8S. Prosperity After the War.

Henry Clews in pleading for a world
court, aninounced with firmness that
American business would continue to
prosper afte? the evar. “Even under the
Most favorabte cirfamstances Europe
will be unable for many years to meet
the demands for rebuilding her cities,
railroads, bridges and steamers,” he
said,

Other speakers were Hamilton Holt,
editor of the Independent, who de-
scribed the hopes and working plans of
the League to Enforce Peace; Dr. Bonn,
who pleaded for a better international
understanding between countries, and
said that arrogance backed by ignorance
fe the real danger to an understanding
between nations; Prof. W. J. Shephard of
Columbia University, and the Rev. Cor-
nellus Woelfkin, Andrew B, Humphrey
acted as chairman of the meeting.

5,000 SING AS BILLY
ARRIVES IN BUFFALO

Feeling Fine and Ready to
Put Forth His Best, Says
Evangelist.

—f

 

Burra.o, Jan, 27.—"I'm feeling fine
and in perfect condition to put forth
my best, my heartiest efforts in the work
ef the Buffalo campaign. I like your
city and your people, and I admire their
thorough preparation for the work here.
I'm glad I came.”

With these words Billy Sunday an-
*wered the greeting of 6,000 Buffalo folk
who waited two hours at the station
this morning until his train, very late,
pulled into the shed. As Billy and “Ma”
left the steps of the coach 5,000 voices
were raised in the chorus of the evan-
Selist's favorite song, “Brighten the Cor-
her Where You Are.” Billy grinned at
the welcome. “Fine, fine! I'm glad
you're here,” and, “Ma, what do you
think of that?” were his exclamations.

Mounted policemen leading his auto-
Mobile, Sunday and “Ma” then drove to
the house which will be home to them
during their eight weeks campaign.
There an impromptu reception was held
by “Ma” and Billy, the dinner call put-
‘ing an end to the greetings.

George M, Sunday, dropping his: pre-
liminary campaign work in New York,
Was on hand to greét his father and
mother, The son expressed himself as
overjoyed at the warmth with which
New York is meeting his advances, “It's
® great town, and they're going at the
campaign in great style,” he said, He and
Dr, James E, Walker, Mr, Sunday's ad-
‘ance representative, will go to New
York Sunday night.

Henry Ackerman, who was the candi-
date of William P. Verdon, G. O. P.
boss of Hoboken, obtained an order for
a recount, and yesterday at its conclu-
sion the county board declared Ackerman
elected by a majority of 104. Justice
Swayze presided over the recount, pass
ing upon the disputed ballots.

J. Emil Walscheid, counsel for Seglie,
announced last night that he will ques-
tion the validity of the recount when
Justice Swayze sits on Tuesday to pass
upon the legal questions involved in the
recount.

It ig Mr. Walscheid's contention that
inasmuch as Justice Swayze's term ex-
pired two days before he received a
reappointment it -affected his juris-
Cetion in the matter and that therefore
the recount is void. The recount has
been a stormy one, Seglie charging that

Attorney Who Figured in Osborne
Case Defendant Again.

Harold Spielberg, the attorney who
was a figure in the Safford trial, was
made defendant in the Supreme Court
yesterday in a suit for $6,000 brought by
the American Steel Export Company on
the ground that when the concern loaned
that amount to ‘the Allied Steamship
Corporation on May 6, 1916, Spielberg
guaranteed repayment within thirty
days. The company says the payment
has not been made.

Spielberg was recently sued by Leo IL, |
Leventritt as trustee in bankruptey for |
the Inter-Ocean Transportation Com-!
pany. Leventritt sourht to recover $29,- |
502.11, alleging that ‘> ‘4 turned over |

TELLS OF RAID’S RESULTS

 

Officer Now in Hospital at Las
Animas, Col.—Trailed by
Four Sleuths.

 

Testimony that Capt. Alfred M. Rob-
bins, formerly an officer in the United
States Marine Corps, locked himself in
a‘closet during a divorce raid was
offered before Justice Lehman in the
Supreme Court yesterday by his father-
in-law, Herbert F. Patterson. As a re-
sult of the testimony a decree of divorce
was granted to the officer's wife, Mra.
Hazel D. Robbins of 800 Riverside
Drive, The Captain was last reported
in the naval hospital at Las Animas,
Col.

Patterson told the court that the
couple, who were married in Jersey
City on October 28, 1913, separated last
year, the Captain going to Cincinnati.

The father-in-law thought this circum-
stance noteworthy enough to send four
detectives after him. Just as Patterson
expected, the detectives were able to
learn something among the four of
them, and he received a call to come |
on and look for himself.

He and the detectives, Patterson testi-
fied, inanaged to keep Capt. Robbins in
sigh: after watching him leave the Gov-

yinent garage on East Fifth street in

son said he and his detectives. waited
until the lights in the apartment went
out, which they considered their signal
to break down the door.

When the light was switched on in-

side, hig story ran, no one was visible,
‘but two closets seemed to have developed
asthma, When coughs were heard, the
raiders directed the occupants to come
out, Patterson said, to avoid asphyxia-
tion. But apparently those inside
seemed to feel there were worse things
than being smothered, Patterson de-
clared, and the party had to force open
the doors.
The Captain, according to his state-
ment, had taken off his shoes, collar
and necktie, and the young woman was
clad in a ailk kimono. The father-in-
law himself was affected by the atmos-
Phere and developed a chill toward
the Captain, The latter was retired a
couple of weeks ago,

TO PROBE NEWARK COUNCIL.

Chief Justice Gammere Appoints
Two Inquisitors to Act.

Chief Justice Gummere of Newark
yesterday made an order directing art
investigation of the Newark Common
Council by two Supreme Court Commis-
sioners, He appointed Nelson B. Gas-
kill of Trenton, former Assistant At-
torney General, and Frank M. Taykor

 

‘}of Hackensack, a lay member of the

Court of Errors and Appeals, to con-
duct the inquiry.

Charles F, Herr, counsel for the Demo-
cratic majority of the council, told the
court that an inquiry is now being con-
ducted by three Democratic Aldermen

nd a group of citizens.

“The suggestion then ia,” said the
Chief Justice, “when a charge of ille-
gality is made against a man he should
turn around and ask himself if it is
true. It would be rather startling if
the members of the Common Council
should find themselves to be crooked, al-
though such a discovery, of course, is
not impossible. The statute contem-
plates an impartial investigation.”
