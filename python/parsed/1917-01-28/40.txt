Edison waves a _ protesting,

werld returns to the attack:

“But you are 70 years old, Mr. Edi-

His white hair, avalanching over his
massive head, may be a little thirner,
but there is still plenty of it. His deep
set, friendly gray eyes are ag luminous
as ever; indeed, they insisted on twink-
ling throughout this interview. His

and smiles without effort—exactly the
same smile that smoothed the rough

luckless experimenter of his youthful
days. as is proved by comparison of
the familiar picture of the fourteen-
year-old Edison with the world figure
of to-day.

is nothing now. More than forty years

To get back to the interview: The

a somewhat complimentary reference |
Mr. Edison. He answered it by
chuckling, looking quizzically across
at Mr. Meadowcroft and saying:

“Taffy.”

The visitor finally found an oppor-

with which he was loaded:

“Mr, Edison, which one of your in-

work upon it?"

“The phonograph; 1

swer.

“And which did you find the hard-
est?"

“The incandescent IMght- that was
the hardest and most important. As
I say, the development of the phono-
graph was most interesting, but it
took a long time—-twenty-five years.”

“Thirty years,” said Mr. Meadow-
croft.

“As long as that?
Well, thirty years,

Which led to the query: What sort

Vhen Mr, Idison hag the time for
it he loves to spin yarns and to listen
to them—if they're good. One of them
hag to do with his encounter with
Steve, an engineer who was frequently,
detailed to guide visitors through @
great factory where electrical appli-
ances were made. One day Steve
trotted around with a litthe man who
seemed so impressed and yet so re-
served that the guide set him down
as a famous electrician travelling in-
cognito, only to be informed when
they returned to the office:

“Much obliged to you. I don’t know

much about the electrical trade. I'm
a barber. If you ever come to Chi-
cago, look me up.”

Steve was disgusted. He resolved
that the next visitor wouldn't fool
him, Jt chanced that another silent
man came to see the factory- 9 rather
seedy man, whose attention, despite all
Steve's eloquence, could not be di-
verted from insignificant details.

Steve concluded he had another barber
on his hands and set out to fill him
up with wonderful stories,

He pointed out a dynamo so power-
ful that it never could be run to ca-
pacity because it was impossible to
control the current. The stranger
seemed so deeply impressed that Steve
picked up an incandescent light and
declared that its discovery was due to
the accidental observation of a light-
ning flash playing on a two pronged
fork in a pickle bottle. Rising to his

, toes, Steve gestured magnificently and

orated:

“And that inestimable boon to
mankind, the incandescent lamp, was
born.”

At that moment the visitor stepped

so

up to a workman who was winding
coils, slapped him on the back ana
said:

“Hello, Dan."

The coil winder looked up. started
end grasped the outstretched hand.

“God bless my soul! [t's my old
boss,” he exclaimed “Mr Medison,
how are you?"

Steve staggered back and sat down
on a casting, his mind a blur. The

only thing he could remember was that
he had told the inventor of the in-
candescent lamp that it evolved froma

  
 

pickle hottle. A few davs Inter he
{received from Mr. Edison a book on

wonders, written for hovs
and girls. On the flvieaf was a draw-

ng of a fork in a@ pickle bortle

been described “thoroughly com
fortable and undeniably human,” and
the words exactly fit him, just as does
that other metaphor:

Mdison’s employees are getting it up.

business associates and employees ar-
ranged to surprise him at the Ritz

of the gift.

Mr. Edison is one of the few great
contributors to the advancement of
the world to whom the world has
given a full measure of appreciation
in their lifetime. There jis no selen-
titie honor that is not his already, no
| civilized village that does not bear
daily witness to his achievement as in-
!yestigator, inventor and perfecter, no
man of ambition who has not as a

hoy been fired by the “typleally Amer-
ican" life story

There the unimpeachable testi-
mony of Charles VP. Steinmetz, him-
self a towering figure in science, that
“IMdison is the greatest of these giants
who have made the modern world.”
And the part of it is that over
there at Orange, in the full maturity
of his powers, he is showing us that
