Photographs snapped under the sea
showing film actors descending from
Jules Verne's famous submarine ard
taking a hunting trip alnog the bottom
of the ocean are only some of the many
curious scenes in “Twenty Thousand
Leagues Under the Sea,” now running
at the Broadway Theatre, which the
Universal presents for the first time
in this country. In this fascinating
adventure story the Universal has pro-
duced the only submarine photoplay |
ever attempted. It represents nearly!
two years of work by a company that
required nearly 2,000 people in the 900
scenes shown on the film. |

The submarine pictures have been |
declared by scientists who saw them in |
tho Smithsonian Institute at Wash-|
ington to be the most wonderful photo- |
graphs ever taken. In order to reach |
the bottom of the ocean the actors |
were first taught the use of the latert |
naval invention—the _ self-contained
submarine diving suits. The photo-,
graphs show them under the water
with no air hose or life jines con-
necting with the upper world. Jules
Verne used the self-same suite of un-
dersea armor fifty years before the}
ingenuity of man was able to perfect!

von Hofmannstal)'s “Madonna Din-

Arrived in New York, Kitty Hayes—
now Gertrude Hoffman—went into
vaudeville as an imitator. Then came
the wave of classic dancing, and danc-
ing that was not classic. Gertrude
Hoffman could dance as well as mimic,
She presented impressions of Ruth St.
Denis, Isadora Duncan and other pro-
tagonists of the new terpsichorean
vogue and achieved a greater success
in her imitations than has come to
the originals themseives,

She was the first American artiste
to do the famous Dance of Salome and
shortly thereafter she went at the hed
of a big troupe of Russian dancers
which toured the entire country.

There will be a new bill at the Com-
edy Theatre on Monday evening, Feb.

to whom they promised five bills in ad-
dition to any special performances they
might give. The new bill will be made

John T. Murray of the “Show of

that “few people can have any notion,

who have not tried it, the strain that

nate cleverness and the conscientious
effort he ever puts forth to win an
audience, I know, as a matter of fact,
that Al Jolson makes a minute study
of every word he uses when on the
stage. I have heard him try a phrase
in a dozen different ways till he found
the exact Inflection to get the best
results, and always in a carefree sort
of way as if he was ealling along

Miss Spencer may lay claim to the ir-

clearly understodd title of “natura!

stage since she was 5 years old. She,
was known as the youngest star in |
the theatre when she appeared in the
title role of “Dolly Vardon"” under the |
management of Milton Aborn. She has

Adams in “What Every Woman |

When John E. Hazzard first’ pre-
senied to Winchell Smith and John L.
Golden the scenario of his play based
upon the regeneration of two young
crooks through the efforte of a saintly
old woman who was famous alike for
her piety and her peach jam he called
it “Like Mother Made.” By the time
Mr, Smith, author of “The Boom-
erang,” “The Fortune Hunter” and
many other guccesses had rewritten
the play as it was finally presented
at the Galety Theatre six months ago
it was decided that another title would
be better, but what title neither au-
thors nor Mr. Golden, Mr. Smith's
partner, could decide upon, The final
discussion of this absorbing subject
was held at Mr. Smith's home tn Con-
necticut, and a silent but much inter-
ested listener to the arguments for
this title and that was Mrs. Smith,
the wife of the famous dramatist.
