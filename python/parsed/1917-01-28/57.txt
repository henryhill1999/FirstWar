~Facts Bea ring Upon an Extremely
Difficult and Complex Problem
of Worldwide Importance

By DR. PAUL BARTHOLOW. |

kets is anomalous. In fact
there is no paper market.

Moreover the public is not in the pa-
per market. Outside business in paper
is almost stagnant and shows no signs

of improving, and publishers are not

in the buying mood.

All this is pointed out by the Ger-
man expert Demuth in a letter re-
cently published in the Berlin Borsen-
blatt. “Paper manufacturers,” he
writes, “are not real eellers
fleute), There are various grounds for
this state of things. There is no paper
marke@nor an adequate market report
in the newspapers.” Again, and thie

Thus there has been a constant and
serious rige in prices, and the public
is entirely in the dark as to what
could be-done to check it. Its

paper is different from such articles of
commerce as grain, oil, cotton, coffee
and stocks.

Sales and offers, in the case of pa-
per, are not in a groove in which
everybody who goes to buy or sell
must run. There is a groove, to be
sure, but it is too narrow to be favor-
able to speculation. The bull account

count is always a huge, indigestible
masse the paper market has a rickety
constitution which is always in a state
of feverish convalescence.

Of lafe the public has educated itself
to realize the extreme difficulty and
complexity of the problem. The pub-
lication of facts, such as lay at the
diaposal of the pres, recently became
a public service. Naturally these facts
were general, for in this case state-
ment must be proof against critical ex-
amination by experts who have been
handling these matters with special
knowledge for months paet.

The mere student or observer,
ever ably equipped, cannot
compete with the manufacturer in a
technical and expert matter.

For the Bake of clearness

stated. For example, the Minister of
the Interior at Berlin, sums up the
matter of price as follows:
