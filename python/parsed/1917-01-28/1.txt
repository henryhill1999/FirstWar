by an asphyxiating gas attack.

the Rumanian army will be heard from

covering the period from January 12 to

On the western frontier of Mol-

patrol actions. In the Kasino Valley
our troops attacked the @¢nemy and
in spite of severe cold and heavy
snow succeeded, after eleven hours of
desperate fighting, in driving him
south of the Kasino and Suchitza val-
leys.

The Ruasian and German statements

Russitan—After a heavy bombard-
ment of our trenches east of the
Kalnzem road, toward Chlok (west of
the River Aa, Riga front), the Ger-

NEW PEACE STEP SOUGHT

 

 

Lansing Opposes Any Plan to
Check Shipments to En-
tente Allies.

 

WASHINGTON, Jan, 27.—It was
mated at the State Department to-day
that the United States Government is
becoming concerned over Ambassador
Gerard's latest advices from Berlin re-
garding Germany's prospective campaign
against all armed merchantmen. The
President's peace moves have admittedly
strengthened the Imperial Chancellor,
Von Bethmann-liollweg, in his efforts to
keep subsequent submarine operations
within the scope of the German piedge
to the United States not to sink mer-
chant craft without warning, but ad-
vocates of relentless U-boat warfare now
wish to force the United States to go
further toward helping Germany's pres-
ent aims.
| The situation in Germany apparently
| is crystalizing along these lines: if
the United States will follow up its
peace programme with measures destined
to force Germany's enemies to give her
a more respectful hearing, Germany will
hold aloof from any radical change in
its U-boat campaign. If the United
States permits the peace discussions to
fade away Germany must necessarily
turn its attention to more vigorous use
of the U-boats,

The Imperial Government wishes to
know from Mr. Gerard whether Presi-
dent Wilson contemplates advocating
such measures as an embargo on muni-
tions and food supplies to the Entente
in ease in his Judgment some such pres-
sure 1s necessary to support the Amer-
jean peace plan. Germany, and particu-
larly Austria-Hungary, feel that Presi-
dent Wilson should apply threats and
economic and financial force, if neces-
sary, to bring the Entente to the point of
considering peace seriously.

Lansing Opposes Embargo.

But Mr, Gerard not only has no in-
structions to interpret the President's
peace message as a veiled embargo
threat, but ia not likely to receive such
instructions, according to officials of the
State Department. Secretary Lansing is

| known to be opposed to such measures,

and although strong pressure is being
brought to bear on President Wilson it
!s firmly believed here that Mr, Lansing
will hold him in check so far as an ag-
gressive peace campaign against the ma-
terial interests of the Entente is oon-
The only danger at present is
the possibility that the President may
take offence at same of the hostile eriti-
cism in Entente capitals of his peace
Plan and that the whole trend of this
Government's relations with the Entente
thereby become seriously affected.

No secret is made of the fact that Teu-
ton diplomats hope to see the Entente
carry its objection to the President's
peace plan to the extent of nettling Pres-
ident Wilson or forcing him to consider
further measures to keep the peace germ
alive. The value of this to tiertnany
{would be to enhance the probability of

Ansiety Over Berlin's Stand. |

In the latter connection the apparent
determination of Berlin to press the em-
bargo issue as a price for continued ob- |
servance of the American pledge is caus-
ing some anxiety. This phase of the

with, it Is pointed out, because the cam-
paign for the resumption of relentless
warfare is being pressed by forces an-
tayonistic to the Imperial Gevernment's
present U-boat policy.

Officials of the State Department
stated to-day that the various contro-
versial questions betwee@ Germany and
the United States would not be pressed
for the present. The time is not re-
garded as opportune, it is explained, In
other words the United States Govern-
ment, acting on advices from Mr. Gerard,
is refraining from embarrassing the Im- |
preial Chancellor in Berlin by adding
fuel to the fire of opposition te the
present restricted U-boat warfare.

Secretary Lansing said no word had
yet been received concerning American
prisoners on the Yarrowdale. There is
so far no proof that Germany intends to |
hold American members of the crews of |
armed merchantmen as prisoners of war |
or that the Imperial Government will |
hesitite about releasing any Americans, |
if there be any, on the Yarrowdale.
