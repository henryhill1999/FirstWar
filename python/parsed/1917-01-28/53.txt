A History of Ornament.

There Are histories of architecture
and critically descriptive books on
ornament, its “grammar,” but A His-
«: tory of Ornament, ancient and medi-
@val, by A. D. F. Hamtin (Century),
is as unusual as it is interesting and
useful. How did ornamentative art
develop among the different peoples of
antiquity? How was the originative
impulse in one people affected by their
contact with other peoples? And how
da the advance through successive
styles to be accounted for? ‘Without
~ either excessive techmicality or sacri-
*" fice of correctness and dignity for ac-
commodation to the layman's com-
prehension, Professor Hamlin answers

 

" these questions with a simplicity and
~ ‘eompleteness satisfactory alike to the
i st who has not lost the appre-

¢fation of the “human element” and
to the intelligent but umtrained ad-
mirer of earlier generations’ endeav-
ors to make beautiful the world of
their own creation.

Even the oldest surviving examples
of ornamental art, dating back to pa-
leolithic times, are of a skilful finish
that points to beginnings immeasurably
remote in the history of mankind.
Earliest ornament has Its genesis, no
doubt, in primitive superstition. The
qualities of animate beings and in-
animate things were supposed to be
carried by rude caricatures of these
creatures and objects: “An eye paint-
ed on « canoe gives the camoe and its
owner the power to steer a_ safe

* course; a bird on the stern gives it
speed; a human face with a mouth-
ful of flerce teeth imparts tierceness
and coilrage to the bearer of the
‘weapon on which It is carved or paint-
ea.” By the animistic theory, it was
this representation in fetish or totem,
peimarily for the sake of supposed utlli-

ts tarian magic, that awakened the rudi-
mentary decorative instinct: “And
this instinct, asserting itsclf with
constantly increasing force, has led
to the progressive modification of the
original semi-naturalistic forms until
othéy are often no Jonger recognizable
as such.” A certain Papuan design,
for example,.can be traced back from
its present scroll arrangement to a
first crude drawing of the head of the
frigate bird.
_' But there is another theory, the in-
@ustrial, as it may be called.

cketer and weaving there will neces-
sarily occur certain rhythmic repeti-
tions and alternations of form which
are inherenuly decorative and encour-
age experiment with intentional varia-
tions. Savage ornament shows: “A
keen sense of decorative propriety; a
wise choice and proportioning of
means to ends; great skill in space
Alling”? What it jacks in subtle grace
it makes up for in boldness of design.

It is not structural ornament, but
“pure surface decoration.” The ani-
_. mistic and the technomorphic motives
» fe difficult to distinguish. “The zig-
gag, quadrilateral, fret and spiral ap-
pear in nearly all savage styles, but
the coil and spiral are wanting in cer-
tain defined districts in the South
Beas,” an omission that seems odd in
the decorative art of a people whom it
would be natural to expect to borrow
@uch lines from shells.

Egyptian art shows this influence
of climate:

Except during the short rainy seasan the
Tegyptian sky is cloudless, the sun Intensely
brilliant, Mists, half lights, soft gray tones
and delicate tints such as: northern jands
and artisis know and love are here un-
known. In the blazing sun and black shad-
‘ows delicate relief and subtle modulations
of surface would be lost. Hence strong
and bold refief are necessary out of doors,
while both there and in the dim interiors
eolor is exsential for decorative effective-
mees, Egyptian ornament is preeminently
@R ornament of color. The dryness of the
‘alr and the absence of frost result in a
Permanence which cannot be secured tn
ether climates, Wood and cloth seem {n
Egypt as imperishable as stone and bronze.
Hence an influence toward slowness of
change, toward permanence both of types
and details, which ®xists nowhere else.

The rigidity and formality of Egyp-
tien design permitted no rapid evolu-
tion or sudden marked changes in
style. The stock of “fund: nental mo-
tives” was somewhat limited, but in
their treatment an extraordinary va-
riety of detail is apparent. The lotus,
sacred flawer, symbolizing the Nile
€ end the solar divinities that ruled the
“river's rise and fail and so regulated

-the land's fertility, is A in the alpha-

bet of Egyptian ornament; Professor

year calls it the source of all

; Peyptian ornament, hence the parent
»* of all historic decorative design.

The Assyrians borrowed freely from

t in decorative art forms, but to
all their borrowings they imparted
some new quality that made it in the
new form characteristically Assyrian.
For example: “The lotus was carved
in low relief with sharply pointed,
gracefully curved petals and sepals
and a wholly new calyx, the three
sepals being evidently looked upon as
petals. It was alternated with buds
. -and with pine cones and combined into
“" elaborate rosettes.” In Assyrian bor-
ders the units were connected by vo-
luted bands, “a purely Assyrian de-
vice”; “and the organic linking of the
units, no longer merely. strung along
a straight line as in most Egyptian
examples, marks a decided decorative
advance.” Persian ornament stands,
in time, place and character, between
the Semitic art of Mesopotamia and
the Aryan art of Greece,

It is an interesting part that the
Phenicians have in this history of
decorative art. The mercantile car-
riers of the ancient world, they “car-
ried and exchanged, and frequently
counterfeited, Weyptian and Assyrian
or Babylonian wares and stuffs.”
Cypriote ornament jis remarkable for
its mingling of the Egyptian, A¢gean,
Phenician and early Greek influences
in this form of art.

What happened when the Greeks
came.into contact with the art of
older civilizations? Prof. Hamlin indi-
eates it In this way: “Where other
peoples had simply acquiesced unques-
tiontngly in nature's order or the
teachings of tradition, the Hellene
asked Why? Whence? How?) and
strove unceusingly after unrealized
perfections in every undertaking. The
progress of Greck civilization stands,
therefore, in sharpest contrast with
the slow advance and slow decline of
Egypttan art .bound by ancient and
sacred traditions, and with the stay-
nation of Assyrian art.” In Egyptian
ornament color had predominated over
form; in the Greek, form was the con-
‘trolling element-—not mere pattern-
ing, but that idea of structure which
is not dictated by the framework of
the object to be decorated, but recog-
nizes the organic and logical relation
that obtains between the obleet and ite

unit, was a weld of many elements in
a powerful and highly organised em-
pire. The stock contrast between the
artistic and philosophical inclination of
the Greek intellect and the bent of the
Roman mind for organization and ad-
ministration comes here into play.
The Romans borrowed in the arts, and
in adapting foreign ideas the Romans
stamped them with their own person-
ality. In the imperial era “the Ro-
mans became a nation of mighty
builders and engineers, and architec-
tural decoration and all the decorative
arts that are concerned with personal
comfort and luxury were carried to a
remarkable and in some cases ex-
traordinary degree of elaboration and
splendor. Sculpture, on the other
hand, was never a characteristic me-
dium for the expression of Roman
genius. Roman ornament lacked
somewhat of the refinement and re-
straint of the Greek but was more
varied and flexible.”

What the “ordinary” reoter 0” Pro-
fessor Hamlin's book will look for in
his illuminating pages is the state-
ment of essential differentiating facts
and principles in the working out of
national characteristics in the efforts
of the peoples to adorn their environ-
ment, and such readers will pick up
his paragraphs, beginning at page 133,
on the Roman “decorative system.”
Roman buildings were made massive-
ly, of coarse materials. Use of the
arch and the vault produced “novel
effects of scale and grandeur.” Such
construction made necessary “a deco-
rative skin or dress, both internally
and externally, of finer material”;
hence the work in = stucco, mosaic,

cornices and so on, a system of beau-
tification “fundamentally different”
from the Egyptian and the Greek. In
them the decoration, apart from paiat-
ing and sculpture, had to be an inte-
gral part of the construction, where-

not have it said that such a system,
extending into modem usuge, is false
or illogical; it is dictated by the na-
ture of the materials used.

Japanese Trees for American Parks.

A naturalist and botanist who has
distinguished himself by extensive ex-
ploration of the flora of western China
and his discovery of numerous trees,
shrubs and plants previously unknown
to science, ERNEST HENRY WILSON has
just issued a most interesting book,
No. 8 of the publications of the Arnold
Arboretum, Harvard University, under
the title of The Conifers and Tawxads of
Japan,

Mr, Wilson spent 1914 in the Japa-
nese Empire under the direction of
Dr. C. S, Sargent of the Arnold Ar-
boretum. He made the most thorough
scientific investigation of the Japanese
cherries that probably was ever made
by any man from the Occident, and his
book on “The Cherries of Japan”
speaks for itself.

Simultaneously with his study of the
cherries Mr. Wilson made a most criti-
cal scientific investigation of the coni-
fers and tuxads that characterize the
wonderful flora of Japan, and has
solved several problems in regard to
the limitation and validity of certain
species. This is particularly true in
regard to certain firs and spruces
whose exact specific position has puz-
zled botanists and arboriculturtsts for
many years.

Mr. Wilson says he commenced his
work on the island of Takushima, the
most southern point of Japan proper.
and he was much impressed with the
wonderful forests in which the Cryto-
meria is the dominant tree, and known
commonly to the Japanese as sugi, It
is the most generally useful and popu-
lar tree of Japan and has been planted
by the Japanese from time immemorial.
“The sugi is the noblest of the Japa-
nese conifers, and many famous places
in Japan owe much of thelr charm to
stately avenues and groves of this im-
pressive trep. There is a solemnity
and dignity about it, with its perfectly
straight trunk towering heavenward
and tupped with a conical dark green
crown as ‘befits a tree used for en-
shrouding temples and sacred places
generally, The famous and well known
avenue of Nikko, said to be the humble
gift of a daimio, poor in worldly goods,
is the most magnificent of all the
monuments raised to the memory of
the first Shogun.”

From the island of Takushima Mr.
Wilson travelled northward through
Kiushu, Shikoku, Hondo and Hokkaido
to Japanese Saghalien. He says that
with the exception of four species and
one variety he saw every conifer and
taxad from Japan growing wild. ‘There
is no record of any one, foreigner, or
native, having previously enjoyed such
opportunity to study these plants.”

About the maidenhair tree, Ginkgo
biloba, Mr. Wilson says that it is no-
where spontaneous in Japan and that
it has not been discovered in a wild
state in any country. Frank N. Meyer,
botanical explorer for the United

| States Department of Agriculture, re-
|ports “the ginkgo growing spontane-
fously in rich valleys over some ten
square miles near .Changua Hsien in
the Chekiang province, China.” Mr.
Wilson, however, doubts that this is

‘lowed Mr.

Rochester, N. Y., and are very
promising.

Mr, Wilson says about the economic
value of Japanese forests: “In few
other countries are the forests of such
supreme importance to the prosperity
of the nation, and no other people are
such consumers of forest products as
the Japanese, ag nearly all their build-
ings and most of their articles of do-
mestic use are entirely made of weod.
The coniferous trees are the principal
source of the timber supply and the
Government forests, now controlled by
a good and increasingly efficient for-
estry service, are a source of yery
considerable revenue.” ‘

Mr, Wilson’s enumeration shows that
there are thirty-cight speciés and four
varieties of taxads and conifers indig-
enous and largely endemic in Japan.

This is a remarkably good showing for Stand forth, aware and shaken!

an area the size of Japan.

An excellent feature of Mr, Wilson's
book is the fifty-nino full page photos
gtaphs of taxads and conifers taken in
mostly spontaneous conditions, and all
showing remarkable characteristic de-
tails. Any arboriculturist fully ac-
quainted with the Japanese umbrella

Cardinal Gibbons.

No single man, probably, has had
Sreater influence in bringing about
the changes which the last half cen-
tury has made in the attitude of the
American people toward the Catholic
Chureh than James Cardinal Gip-
Bons through his personal ¢ iaracter
and wise guidance. The stor, of the
period is told in a way in the cvilection
of his published writings and of some
of his sermons in two volumes
under the title A Retrospect of Fifty
Years (John Murphy Company, Balti-
more), Important as this record is,
the few explanatory pages in which
the author allows his personality to
appear are so interesting that the re-
gret is unavoidable that the venerable
Archbishop of Baltimore has not
chosen to relate his own experiences
instead. In the brief introduction in
which he gives the brief summary of
his career he has this to say of one
aspect of his life:

There are few Americans living now who
can remember the things which Ican. I fol-
Lincoln's dead body in proces-
sion when it was brought to this city; I
have seen every President since his death
and have known most of them personally;
l was a grown man and a priest during
the Civil War, when it seemed as if our
country were to be permanently divided,
Very few people now living have seen the
country in such distress as 1 have seen it.
But I have lived, thank God, to see it in
wondertnl prosperity and to behold it
grown Into one of the great powers of the
earth. Younger men may tremble for the
future of this country, but T can have
nothing but hope when T think what we
have already passed through, for I can see
no troubles in the future which could
equal, much lecs surpass, those which have
afMfiicted us in bygone days. If only the
American people will hold fast to that in-
strument which has been bequeathed to
them as the palladium of thelr liberties—
the Constitution of the United States--
and fear and distrust the man who would
touch that ark with profane hands, the
permanence of our institutions ts assured.

How precious would be Cardinal
Glbbons’s record of these things which
he has seen in the country and in the
Catholie Church.

It is natural that the Gcumenical
Council held in the Vatican which de-
clared the dogma of the infallibility
of the Pope shpuld seem to be of the
highest importance ecclesiastically to
Cardinal Gibbons and should take up
the larger part of his first volume.
The fiftieth anniversary of the Vatican
Council is near at hand, and he, the
youngest bishop in attendance, is now
the sole survivor. On the twenty-
fifth anniversary he wrote a brilliant
account of the council In the North
American Review, which serves as an
introduction to the contemporary re-
ports of the proceedings of the council
went by him and Bishop Lynch to the
Catholic World; these make complete
and satisfactory history. There follow
articles on various matters of secular
interest, the Knights of Labor con-
troversy, lynch law. liish immigra-
tion, patriet’<iu, the Church and the
Republic.

The sermons included in the second
volume are mainly those Celivered at
consecrations or anniversaries and are
therefore chiefly historical in charac-
ter. Cardinal Gibbons preached at
the eucharistic congress in Westmin-
ster; he related:to his Baltimore con-
gregation his reminiscences of Pope
Leo XIIT.; he told them about the
conclave that elected Pius X., the first
one in which American Cardinals
helped to elect a Pope. At the conse-
cration of churches and at the jubi-
lees of other bishops he gave a his-
tory of Catholic progress in each place,
and, ‘as he was called on to preach in
his own cathedral in Baltimore, in
New York, in Boston, in Cincinnati,
in Hoboken, at the Catholic University

 

{in Washington, the sermons taken to-

the original home of the ginkgo. The;

ginkgo, however, has been for cen-
turtles planted by the Japanese in their
temple gardens.

Among the taxads perhaps the most
important is the Japanese yew, Taxus
cuspidata, It is not exaggeration to
say that the Japanese yew is from an
ornamental standpoint the most im-
portant evergreen introduced
Asia to the parks and gardens of the
northeastern United States, as it ap-
pears to be perfectly hardy under ex-

| tremely rigorous conditions and many

beautiful individuals are now growing
on private grounds throughout the
northeastern States.

Among the true conifers the genera
|that have contributed most markedly
{to the decoration of the parks and
{gardens of the northeastern United
| States from Japan are the pines, firs
‘and spruces, Beautiful adult individu-
als of Japanese firs, spruces ang pines
are now growing on the Hunnewell
Pinetum at Wellesley, Mass.; founded
in 1853, and on the estate of the late
br, George R. Hall, Bristol Neck, near
Warren, R. IT. As these estates per-
haps show the oldest planted examples
of Japanese coniferg they illustrate the
udaptability of these beautiful plants
to our climate. A number of Japanese
conifers are doing remarkably well on
the estate of Paul Dana, Dosoris, Glen
Cove, Long Island, The most of them
were planted by hig father, the late
Charles A: Dana, who had great ad-
miration for coniferous evergreens,

fers and taxads are growing in the

accomplishment of the Catholic Church
in the United States. At the end are a
few sermons on public occasions such
as the funeral of Gen. Sheridan, a
few on doctrinal points and some arti.
cles on public affairs. It is a collec-
tion that, apart from its historical
importance, exhibits the valuable ser-
vice that during his long life Cardina)
Gibbons has rendered to his country
and to hie faith.

Feat ef a West Virginia Munter.

Here is a hunting “yarn” that used to
be told back fn the hills of West Vir-

e

 

from | ginia, says the Youth’s Companion,

A young hunter went up into the hills
to “try his luck.” There was one “point”
in the hills almost perfectly round, and
the soll was so loose and dry that it was
easily marked by the feet of a passing
animal. The hunter saw turkey tracks
the moment he had reached the point,
and followed them. They circled and re-
circled the point, and still no turkey ap-
peared. The tracks were fresh, too.

“There's only one thing about it! That
turkey just watches my tracks and keeps
following just in back of me." thought
the young man. Accordingly he took off
his shoes, put them on backward, and so
went round the point and got the baf-
fled turkey!

The only restriction seems to be that
the purchases must be made in lots of

one of the honor Hst, because that fs
eupposed to be restricted to auction
bridge; but the number of correct solu-
tiona received exceeds the number sent
in for any auction problem since the con-
ea began. Were js the distribution:

must depend largely upon the circum-

be well to communicate with the An-

the Coal Age and the Coal Trade Jour-
nal of this city.

Ciubs are trumps, Z having been the
original bidder, When there were still
thirteen cards in each hand which player
accepted him and what is the result on
these five tricks? The solution depends
on the recognition of the fact that the
one who accepts is supposed to be the
one with whom the bidder can get the
most tricks, the left hand opponent to
lead,

This points to B as the original ac-
cepter, although he has not a trump left
in his hand. The experienced pirate
player will readily see that Z nvust have
had trumps enough for both and that B
accepted on outside strength. With B
as the partner it will be A's lead and
Z-B make five tricks, no matter what A
opens,

A’s best defence is the trump and Z%
must continue the trump lead for two
more rounds, which will force Y to un-
guard the diamonds or give up the win-
ning spade. If A Jeads a heart instead
of a trump Y will trump to avoid dis-
carding, but Z trumps the heart and
leads two more rounds of trumps with
the same result as before,

If Y were the accepter A would lead
the heart instead of the trump, and
there is no way for Y and Z to make
their trumps separately, so that B must
win a diamond or A will make a trump.

If A were the accepter Y would lead
the trump, so as to prevent A from get-
ing in a ruff and giving his partnerZa
ruff on the hearts. Z wins Y's trun
lead and gives A one ruff in diamonds or
6pades, but when A leads a heart for the
thimi trick Y trumps it to prevent a dis-

 

How much does the Government al-
low a dependent wife of a soldier doing
duty on the border? N. O. H.

Congr+ s appropriated about $2,000,-
000, Wiich was to be available to re-
Heve distress in the families of National
Guardsmen and soldiers of the regular
urmy alike. The distribution Is con-
ditioned upon the amount a soldier has
been sending to his wife or dependents
in the past. The soldier certifies that
he has been contributing a certain
amount—$6 or $10 or $25 or whatever
it was—at such and such intervals and
that he is no longer able to contribute
this amount or is only able to contribute
a certain part of it, which he states.
The Government then undertakes to make
up the rest of the amount and will .do
80 while the appropriation holds out.
What further provision muy be made,
if any, depends upon the future action
of Congress.

Ix the expression “brass tacks’ trace-
able to Ruskin's dream in his “Phi-
losophy of Life’ wherein he saw the
children pulling brass tacks out of the
furniture and then quarre!ling over pos-
session of the tacks?

Admitting that we cannot give a rea-
sonable explanation of the source of this
expression we must record the opinion
that it has nothing to do with Ruskin's
dream. Ruskin is not one of those au-
thors from whom figures of speech are
derived which have the wide currency of
this one.

By R. F. FOSTER.

Duplicate auction seems to je having
& vogue this winter, and almost a)j the
leading clubs are running duplicay

When prizes are offered tor the pew

season the natural tendency is for 4

club to get together and phiy with one

They are afraid to risk the result of a

The consequence of this practice is
that the average players, who form t)»

Another point about this liberty in the

a foregone conclusion that no other E

The chief objection of any systen that

leaves the E and W positions open to all
kinds of players, and if some of these are
