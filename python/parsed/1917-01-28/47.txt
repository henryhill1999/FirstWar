TROUBADOUR THEME ee INTO PLAY BY

JuliaArthur Selects
Lines Frum ‘‘Ser-
emonda_ That
Most Appeal to
Wer in Poetic
Beauty

By JULIA ARTHUR.

(Appearing in .William Lindsey's
“Seremonda” at the Criterion
Theatre.)

The following are my favorite
lines of “Seremonda” hecause they
best indicate the poetic beauty of
the play and also ‘stamp its distinc-
tive qualities as a decided romantic
drama. Many of the lines set
themselves to music, more of them
than I have selected, but these are
the ones that sing themselves
through the brain like poems.

(Mr. Lindsey is a
Man Who is a poct. He made
a study of the Troubadours and their
times. “Seremonda,” which was pub-
lished under the title of “The Red
Wine of Roussillon,” is placed in the
Troubadour period The theme comes
down from the twelfth century and
has been used by Boccne io and other
authors absent one of
