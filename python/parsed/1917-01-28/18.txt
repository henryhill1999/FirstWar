opening. The fire started in her engine
room when she was a mile off Orient
Point, but the blaze was extinguished
easily after she had been run in close

This submarine chaser was built by
the Greenport Basin and Consteuction

and scout cruisers appear in this show

war has brought to the front the possi-

| Elimination of Qualifying
Round Makes Plan Pos-
| ble for Clubs.

SEEK MORE COMPETITION

~— ee

At the annual meeting of the Metroe
politan Golf Association held more than
'a month ago J, B. Coles Tappan, preste

j ent of the body, outlined a plan for two
| day tournaments which could be held at
afferent clubs, He suggested that the
qualifying round be done away with
and that the entrants be classed accorde
jing to handicap ratings. In this way,
he pointed out, the four match play
rounds easily could be played in the
two days.

| It is next to impossible for businces
| men to get away for a week of polf
;more than once or twice during the
; Season, yet these business men are juss
| as eager for tournament competition
| as the men of leisure. However, there
{ure many who could arrange to play in
{two day tourneys, 6tnce only Friday
tim the half day on Saturday would be
| sacrificed at the altar of the popular
sport.

| The qualifying round of tournaments
| has become so much a fixture that many
| players consider the competition income
| plete if they are not allowed to try for
| # medal score. However, Mr, Tappan
suggests that if a medal is needed the
first round of the match play could be
used for thie purpose, with all cone
testants playing out bye-holes and the
cards turned in. In this way the playerg

{could get practice at medal play ag
i; well as match play,

| More Chances for Play. /

|

Mr. Tappan's scheme is entirely feasle
ble, as it would bring out more golfer@
and also provide greater chances ‘oP
| Competition, As it is there is @ notices
| able lack of tournament competition
now, More clubs try to arrange invitae
tion events when the dates are yt
Fuitable to the players and because 0}
this there is a conflict which not only
} cuts down the fields but also bars seve
e.al clubs from holding tournaments.

Golf js becoming such a factor in the
sporting world that there must be @&
renovation of traditional rules, Three,
four and five day tourneys are attrace
live to the greater percentage of players,
but there is the trouble that holidays
cannot be arranged, Most of the exe
rerts try to complete their business (ue
ties so as to find time to play in the
lrational amateur and the open, When
‘the time is given to these two eventa
‘und possibly to the big fixture of the
@striet association the business man

feels he cannot spare any further time
i for tournaments. Therefore hie game
falls off and he loses interest,

If the scheme of Mi® Tappan were
adopted there could’ be no such excuse
offered, ‘Time in plenty could be had, as
most of the men playing golf can sacrie
flee two days for the sport where it
would be impossible to arrange a threa
day splurge for pleasure.

j

 

Following the advice of Mr. Tappan,
‘the Hackensack Golf Club already has
announced that it will hold a two day
tourney Several other New Jersey clubs
will ask for dates for similar events,
Now that the big metropolitan fixtures
have been awarded and the dates set
for these events the clubs can begin to
jarrange the invitation tourneys, There

 

 

 

is a bit of precedent which must be fol-
lowed, but if the clubs try out the two
dav scheme there is 10 reason why all
‘elubs cannot have a chance to get select
company over their links at least once
