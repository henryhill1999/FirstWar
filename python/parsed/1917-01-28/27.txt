LIZABETH MARBURY, who
E entered the producing field
two seasons ago With the

| mustoal comedy “Nobody “Home,”
has established a distinctive type of
entertainment that bids fair to revolu-
tionize musical comedy stdndards in
América. For years manageré have
Been providing light amusement for
the tired business man. Miss Mar-

buty has discovered and developed the
atyle of production which appeag to

,

“Very Good Eddie" and “Love o

Mike’—with pretty girls dressed
lik ladies, with an atmosphere
of smartness and refinement and
daintiness, with delightful and tin-
kiy tunes and with youth as

the keynote. Look for the slapstic

comedy and you will not find it, nor
will you find tights or spangles, or
the suggestive dialogue which fea-
tured the musical plays before the

Marbury era.

“Why have you selected youth
as the inspiration and ideal of your
musical productions?” Miss Marbury

Was asked,

“Because youth represents the
springtime of life,” she replied. “It
typifies freshness and grace and op-
timism and enthusiasm. Despite the

They ‘had no opportunities for the ex-

They had to put up

there is a universal effort in the theatre
to express the beautiful,

And so we Nave progressed to a point
where we are infinitely superior to any
production of

Miss Marbury said she was amused

“and that proves my conte: ntion that
youth is the most successful ideal wo

| ‘Love o’ Mike’—Vivian Wegsell. We all

know that she is not a prima donna
in any sense, yet slé receives five and
six encores for every song she sings.
She possesses “personality; that is the
reason.”

“A little less talent, then, and a little
more personality should be the rule of
all producers of musical plays?" was
suggested.

“precisely,” she answered. “Place
two girls ste by side, one possessing
a fine singing voice but no person-
ality and the other plenty of person-
ality and youthful charm but no sing-
ing voice to speak of, and [ will select
thg latter every time. You'll find that
most of the other producers observe the
same rule.”

MISS WATKINS'S IDEAIS.

Life of the Zuni,

sublimated cliff dwellings which bor-
der the park on the south a young
waman sat and gazed down on the
mountainous landscape of Manhattan

tric signs which make a sort of golden
glow of Broadway. Th@ sky above

borrowed the color from the sky, The |

Some one mentionad the desert, In-

stantly the focus of her eyes widened
and deepened. She seemed to be look- |
ing over and beyond the glitter and

tinsel of Broudway, across the Hud-

son and Jersey and on and on to the

great, wide plains of the Southwest.
It’s queer—this pufl of the desert,

Here was this young woman in the |
midst of the gay social life of the
metropolis, herself adding no small |

part of the gayety of her little group,

desert, including the writer, it seems

v0 arid waste, little better than a tofal

void, unfit for human habitation, eager
to ewallow up the unsuspecting travel-
ler and to leave him to perish of
hunger and thirst om its inhospitable
wakte, But to those who have known
it the desert is a paradise, They may
come away, but they all go back ulti-
mately.

She like# to talk about her raw
boned, blav@ faced, albino eyed, painted
ponies and of sleeping on ‘the hard,
stony ground, and she calls that living.
She looked out of the window over
New York's ex¢lusive clubs, glittering
apartment houses and luxurions hotels
with an air of scorn,

She came to New York with the
fixed purpose of bringing a message.
The message is from the cliff dwellers
of the moufitainous deserts of Arizona
and New Mexico to the lift dwellers of
Manhattan and the world in general.

She has heard the songs and seen
the dances and ceremonials of the Zuni
Indians embodying the folklore of
those primitive descendants of the
Incas. She has crystallized the folk-
lore of the Indiang with the aid of
Carlos Troyer, who tranacribed the
music, and she comes to New York to
fulfil her duty toward American music.
But when her duty is done it is West
ward Ho! for her again.

The luxuries of civilization will not
lure her. She is golng back to her old
red blanket and astride a painted pony
she will “trek” back into the heart of
the wilderness to!study the heart of
the Indian.

“There is a certain grandeur about
the character of the Zuni Indian,” she
says. “He is the real American stoic.
He has a nobleness of character which
his white brother never suspects. He
has a monumental racial pride and a
colossal contempt for all other races,
Tt is rather unique and decidedly in-
teresting @ find such complete scelf-
reliance and assurance.

“He is charged with being the most
stolid of brutes, but it is because the
white man misunderstands him and
because the Indian does not care.

“Instead of being stolid, he has
a soft of Scotch sens6 of humor. He
has a keen appreciation of a joke and
a little humor goes a long way with
hit. His humor js as ufique and in-
dividual as his customs.

“For instance, the Indian would
think it an immense joke to take a
white man's money to act as a guide to
see a snake dance and to lead him toa
dry creek bottom instead. The white
man’s discomfiture would amuse him
greatly.
