Another young French airman, Lieut.

brought down two German machines, his

Thursday he winged his nineteenth air-

The deeds of Guynemer and Herteaux
contributed in large measure to the allied
victories in the air announced in the last
few days, in which many more German
than allied machines have been lost. The
communiqué reports to-day that during
Friday five German airplanes were
