‘BOWERY CARUSO
SINGS FAITH TUNE

In Old Chin@&e Theatre Ellis
Tells of His Days of
Crime.

A PUPIL OF “RED GOSS”

And Now He Points With
Pride to Seven Years of
Conversion.

 

 

 

 

 

The Bowery Caruso came into his own
in Chinatown last night. Not that he
thas been neglected heretofore, but when
the whole Bowery district—or as much
of it as dan crowd into the old Chinese |
Theatre—turns out to do one honor it's |

hound to be a sort of red letter day. |
And that's what happened last night, |
and for three hours they told in songs
and in broken speeches and in bursts of |
e@pplause the love they have for “their |
toy’’—George B. Ellis, the Bowery Ca-
ruse.

It was a strange gathering in the
Rescue Society Midnight Mission, en
ancient building with a thousand mem-
ortes of the days when it was a Chinese
theatre still clinging to its worn beams
and ceiling.

Some came in fur overcoats and kid
®loves and sat up on the platform. But
most of them came without any over-
oats or gloves and with a three days
stubble to match their worn clothes, and |
these sat down below and eang the!
liymns and applauded and dreamed |
about the daya when they wore white |
collars and gloves and would have been
@pated on the platform too.

; But All Knew George.

But they all knew George. They had
him sing on every street corner

from the City Hall to Twenty-third
street—heard him above the rumble of
the elevated trains and the clanzing
ce cars. And in this very mission,

th ite queer little red benches and ite
pictures on the wall, checkered

With signs that pointed the way to peace
faith—in this same mission, when

had dropped in to rest a bit and

, warm, he had sung for them and
them the story of the light that
never failed. These were the boys who

in of the road that had carried him
the desperate paths of a master

Tuso began. He didn't look very big

27.—Gov. Edge and
of the Prison In-
quiry Commission he appointed § thie
week, spent nearly four hours at the
State grison this, afternoon. They vis-
ited every wing, the workshops, death
house, kitchen, hospital and other parts
of the institution, talked with convicts
and ended their firet cursory survey with
a firm determination to accomplish re-
forme in several directions, .
Through William B. Dickson, elected

tem must be abolished regardless of
cost. The Governor was convinced that
at léast one of the workshops, that in
which mats are manufactured, is condu-
cive to tuberculosis and should be elim-
inated. He was painfully impressed by
the fact that the path house is closed

for eight mgpths of the year, during
which inmat must wash themselves
from buckets in therr celle, and he was
surprised to learn through personal con-
tact that imbeciles form a part of tue
prison population,

Notwithstanding these and other
shocks received during the tour of in.
spection, Gov. Edge said as he wae leay-
ing that conditions were improved from
three years ago, when, as a member of
the Senate, he made a similar tour. He
expressed the belief that in the main
the prison authorities are doing their
best with the physical handicaps of an
antiquated institution lacking in nearly
all modern improvements.

Preceding the prison trip the commis-
aion met with the Governor for an hour
to plan the scope of its inquiry. This
will include investigations at the Rah-
way Reformatory for Men, the Clinton
Reformatory for Women, the State
Home for Boys at Jamesburg and the
State Home for Girls at Trenton.

The commission will give a public
hearing at the State House next
Wednesday, when members of the Board
of Prison Inspectors and the Prison La-
bor Commiesion will be interrogated.

Other officials who will be asked to
attend are Commissioner Lewis T.
Bryant of the Department of Labor,
Commissioner Edwin A. Stevens of the
Road Department, Commissioner Cal-
vin N. Kendall of the Department: of
Public Instruction, Director Jacob C.
Price of the State Department of
Health, Commissioner Richard Stockton
of the Department of Charities and Cor-
rections and Director Alfred Gaskill of
the Department of Conservation and De-
velopment. a

It was decided to push through the in-
quiry as quickly as possible, and be-
tween the public hearings executive ses-
sions will be held to consider the evi-
dence and plans for reformation.

DEMOCRATS PLEAD
FOR NEW HARMONY

Factions Meet at Banquet
Board to Discuss Munici-
pal Prospects.

 

 

The roar of the Tammany tiger was
like the bleating of a lamb last night
at the tenth annual dinner @f the
Cleveland Democracy at the Hotel Savoy,
which developed into a “get together’
harmony feast with the speakers in-
dulging in oratorical flights to express
their approval of a movement to bring
all warring factions of the Democratic
party togethes for the municipal cam-
paign this fall.

For the first time in its history Tam-
many, through Sheriff Alfred E. Smith
and others, addmitted that so long as
the Democratic party is split it will be
impoasible to capture the city govern-
ment. He frankly admitted that the
trouble with the Democratic organiza-
tion in this city is that it has not prac-
ticed what it has preached; that it
has paid too much attention to regulat-
ing men instead of adhering to the prin-
ckples upon which the party was founded.

The Cleveland Democracy, which was
started by William F. Schneider to op-
pose Tammany Hall, appeared last night
to have been taken over bodily by Tam-
many. The “get together’ movement
was launched in a letter from Mr.
Schneider, who was ill antl could not
attend. He pointed out that it was es-
sential for Democrats of all kinds to
forget their dffferences and pull together
if victory was ever to be won. He sug-
gested the creation of a committee of
150 prominent Democrats of all factions
to get together to select a ticket for
the coming munic!ipal election and to
smooth out the differences which now
exist,

Stuart G. Gibboney, who was down
on the programme as representing the
national Administration, asserted that
he was heartily in favor of such a move-
ment,

“But you cannot expect that great
body of independent Democrats to follow
@ candidate which has been selected
behind closed doors in star chamber
proceedings,” he asserted. “If you would
bring harmony to the Democratic party,
let all factions be consulted, and if a
good, clean ticket is nominated there is
no reason in the world why the Demo-
cratic party cannot come back into ite
own in this city.”

Such was the tenor of all the speeches,
Sheriff Smith especially approving the
idea. He took a fling, however, at
those who belittled Tammany Hall, and
announced at the outset of hig speech
that he appeared as a “100 per cent.
Tammany Hall man.” He was more
than once cheered as “our next Mayor."’

William B, Selden, Deputy County
Clerk, presided. Other speakers were
Kings County Clerk William E. Kelly,
Judge J, Harry Tiernan of Richmona,
the Bronx District Attorney Francis
Martin, Sidney Harris, D, T. Jameson,
aselstant treasurer of the Democratic

tional Committee; Justice John F,
eves and Bronx Register Edward Pol-

MORE FRENCH’ CREDIT URGED.

ee
Industrial Commission Reports on
Means to Promote Trade.

If American exporters expect to sell
more goods in France they must grant
extended terms of credit, just as they
do at home. They can get from French
banks which the buyers give as refer-
ences all the information required.

This is one of the points made by the
American Industrial Commission, sent to
France by the American Manufacturers
Export Association, in the fifth instal-
ment of its report, made public yester-
day. The commission says there are few

 

 

credit or to make advances or loans
than France, in spite of the war.

The things found to be e&#pecially re-
sented by the French are:
fleulty of establishing a dutiable market
value, the unwillingness of our Treas-
ury Department to accept their consular

private books, labor costs, costs of raw
material, &c.”

The commission points out that the
chief exports of France to us are lux-
uries, and adds: “It will merit study on
the part of the Tariff Commission
whether in all instances high rates of
duty should be charged on luxuries re-
gardless of the country of origin.”

AUTO TRUCK LICENSES HIGHER.

Motor Buses Also Must Pay More
Under 18917 Regelations.

In order to accommodate the thou-
sands of automobile owners and drivers
who have delayed getting their 1917
licenses the automobile bureau of Secre-
tary of State Hugo, at Broadway and
Seventy-fourth street, will be kept open
Monday and Tuesday evenings until 9
o'clock. These licenses must be ob-
tained by February 1, otherwisé opera-
tion of the car will be a violation of
the law.

The fees for pleasure vehicles remain
the same this year, but for motor buses
and automobile trucks the charge has
increased greatly, For buses the charge
will be $15 if the vehicle seats five pas-
sengers or leas, $24.50 for 6 or 7 pas-
sengers, $30.50 for 8 to 10 passengers
inclusive, $43 for 11 to 16 passengers,
and so on up to $67.50 for 27 to 30
passengers, after which is imposed a
$2 tax for seating capacity for each
additional passenger. For auto trucks
the charge is $10 for two tons capacity
or less, and $5 a ton for each ton up to
fourteen tons, after which the charge is
$10 a ton.

 

 

Ald Society's Report Reflects In-
creased Prosperity,

Homeless children in New York are
probably one-third fewer than they have
ever been before, according to the an-
nual report of the Children’s Ald So-
clety made public yesterday. Accord-
ing to Charies Loring Brace, secretary,
this is because of increased prosperity,

“Usually the society is flooded with
6tranded boys from nearly every State
who come to this city seeking adventure
and employment, but now they are re-
maining at home, employed in facto-
ries,”

The total income of the soolety in the
nine months covered by the report was
$492,600, of which $142,500 was from
public donations and $53,600 bequests.
The rest was received from investments,
the city and miscellaneous sources,

In nine months the society returned
601 runaway children to their homes,
plated 296 children in families, sheltered
3,991 boys and girls in lodging houses,
taught 10,602 children in industrial
schools, treated 1,973 children in dental
oiinios, gave 680,080 meals to school
children and distributed 3,936 paire of
} shoes,

ALBANY, Jan. 27.-—Steps to reorganize
| the National Progressive party in New
{ae along the lines laid down by the
| Chicago platform of 1912 were taken
here to-day. Thirty-four delegates, rep-
resenting Progressives in fourteen of the
sixty-two counties, perfected a tempo-
oo organization, adopted a declaration
of principles pledging ceaseless work for
the reorganization of the party in coun-
ty, State and nation, and took a stand
against fusion with any political party
in local contests.

The meeting was part of the reorgani-
zation plan sponsored by Matthew Hale
of Massachusetts, acting chairman of the
National Progressive party. Several
Suggestions were made to change the
name and emblem of the party, but these
details were left to the national conven-
tion to be held in St, Louis. Theodore
Roosevelt and George W. Perkins were
| criticised in the discussion which pre-
| ceded the report of the resolutions com-
| mittee, but no mention of either was
made ifn the resolutions.

The meeting was harmonious. Early
in the session there was a bit of a flurry
over the selection of a temporary chair-
man. Friends of John J. O'Connell of
New York and J, Taylor of Kings
presented their nam@. However, a com-
promise was effected under which J. H.
A. Hopkins of New Jersey, of Mr, Hale's
proposed national organization,
Homer D. Call of Onondaga was made
permanent chairman and Harrison Deyo
of Westchester secretary.

The proposed reorganization plan is
