at the closing business session of its

Other speakers included Herbert My-|

ment of principles the congress declared

for universal military training, for res-|

toration of the navy to second place in
the Atlantic and first place in the Pacific,
for development of American woman
Power, for a nationwide campaign for
Patriotism through education and for ef-
feotive Americanization efforts to destroy
 @ual citizenship.

To-night the meeting came to an end
with a banquet attended by more than
$00 delegates who heard addresses by
Rear Admiral Robert FE. Peary, Senator
Chamberlain, chairman of the Senate
Military Committee; Lafayette Young,
formerly Senator from Iowa, and George

Rear Admiral Peary outlined a
me for developing air power for

’ tacks have had jin the fighting of the

In its declaration of principles, the
ss affirmed the belief that the
right of the individual to life, liberty and
the pursuit of happiness is the basic prin-
ciple of the American Government and
{ then declared: “and we hold that in our
relations with foreign governments we
should continue to aflirm and to defend
these rights.”
} Warning of Unpreparednens,
' All Americans, it is declared, should
be brought to recognize “the dangers
that beset our republic,” inasmuch as
“we are unprepared to defend our na-
tional integrity against other nations
whose aspirations and theories of gov-
{ ernment may be in conflict with ours.”

The congress adopted also a committee

procure “a national executive budget ays-
tem.”

In recommending unjversal training
\ the congress indorsed the following gen-

eval principles:

“Military or naval training for all

A committee proposal to include in the
section the statement, “No pay to be
during training,” was stricken out
the Congress.

{ Peary on Air Costrel.

Rear Admiral Peary satd the day was
at hand when command of land or sea
‘would mean nothing without command
of the air, and that no attack can be
driven home on European battlefronts
“without the assistance of the air service.
He pictured some of the great advances
fn aviation that already have come out
» of the war.

“at the present time,” he said, “four
foreign Powers, probably six, have the

@dge that would enable any one of them

i The United States, the engineer and
,explorer said, could be given an adequate

Plant. To cover the expense of these
measures, Rear Admiral Peary said, a

millions spent on the army and navy,
he declared, ‘will ‘be wasted unless we
have such an air fleet as will give the
United States unquestioned command of
the air for the continent of North
America,”

Young for More Americanism.

Lafayette Young pleaded for national
efforts to weld the country into one na-
tion. He urged that every practice of
accepting foreign fashions and views,

{\ from philosophy to muste and women's

~ Gresses be discouraged, and that no im-

© migrant be admitted to eitizenship until

' his every qualification had been ade-
quately tested.
Mr. Wickersham dwelt upon the place
has played in
American history. “Our nation was
» @reatest,” he said, “when it most clearly
recognized its responsibilities and most
courageously stood forward, sword in
hand, to enforce them. We have talked
much of late-—too much—about peace
without regard for any consideration of
what peace entails. Some of us have
talked and are still talking about becom-
fing part of a league to enforce peace,
apparently without reflecting that such
a league is but another name for an
Offensive and defensive alliance such as
eur whole national history and policy
‘ run counter to,
“If we are permanently to surrender
our right to exclude the nations of Bu-
. rope or Asia from the extension of their
institutions to South and Central Amer-
ica it will be idle to talk of forming an
international peace league,”

“The only league I am for,” said Mr.
Gardner, “would be composed of the
forty-eight States of the Union, made so
strong that they could enforce peace.”

Mr. Myrick took a different view of

“Pan-American peace, successfully es-
tablished now,” he said, “twill go far
toward inducing the nations of the East-
ern Hemisphere to adopt forthwith those
eternal American principles whose au-
thoritative enunciation may be crystal-
fized into two words—the Wilson doc-
trine.”

But Mexico was a challenge to the
Pan-American peace union, Mr. Myrick
pointed out, adding:

“Let us make a good job of it before
we tackle the Pandora's box of Old
World troubles."

P. H. W. Ross, president of the Na-
tional Marine League, declared that the
upbuilding of an American merchant
marine must have a@ part in any pre-
paredness programme for both military
and economic reasona

TARIFF BILL TO BE
OFFERED THIS WEEK

Republicans Decide to Propose
Omnibus Protective
Measure.

 

 

 

Wasninoeton, Jan. 27.—Republican
members of the Ways and Means Com-
mittee of the House have decided to in-
troduce early next week an omnibus
protective tariff bill which approximates
the protective tariff plank in the Repub-
Iican platform. This decision was
reached to-day, Representative Fordney,
Michigan, rdfiking Republican on the
committee, having sounded the other
minority members.
{ The basis of the omnibus bill will be
the Payne tariff bill as it passed the
House tn 1909 and before the inequali-
tles originating in the Senate had been
incorporated in the measure. For sched-
ules I and K—the cotton and wool sched-
ules—will be substituted the measures
offered in 1913 by Republicans as sub-
atitutes for those schedules in the Under-
wood bill. For the present schedule A
will be substituted the chemical sched-
ule of the Payne bill, with the Hill bill
Providing additional protection of dye-
stuffs added.

In addition to these

large free list carried in the Payne bill
by placing a duty upon every product
that comes into competition with Amer-
ican products. An insistent demand for
the restoration of raw hides on the duti-
able list in the Republican bill will be
made.

The decision to submit a concrete
counter proposal to meet the Demo-
cratic revenue bill will come as a sur-
| prise to many House Republicans who
| had'a very clear understanding that the
minority members of the committee

would not introduce a bill which be-
cause of changing conditions and lack of
time must necessarily be archaic in some
degree. Moreover, it may be impossibie

for the Republicans to obtain a vote on
their bill during consideration of the
revenue bill, as the tariff measure proba-
bly will not stand up against the point

PEEKSKILL, Jan, 27.—Police of Bed-
ford, near Peekskill, were called to the
summer place of Clarence Whitman, a

day to rescue a lame deer cornered by a
pack of dogs in a flower garden.

; when the policemen arrived and routed

war materials of all kinds with private
plants listed to furnish certain things
in war times. Beyond that he said was
the enrolment of skilled labor to guard
against enlistment of these men and
disruption of the industries,

American manufacturers had found
by bitter experience, he said, that it
took from one to two years to convert
their plants to produce foreign war or-
ders. It would take nearly as long, he
said, to again convert them to turn out
American arms and ammunition. “And
about 80 per cent. of our total manufac-
turing’ capacity would be turned to that
work In time of war," he added.

THE SUN, SUNDAY, JANUARY 28, 1917.

 

there is furnished a striking example of
the menace of the system, predicted by
its opponents and presumably appre-
hend by its advocates. The nomina-
tion of Passed Assistant Surgeon Gray-
son with rank of Lieutenant Commander
to be Medical Director in the navy with
rank of Rear Admiral has elicited from
the daily presa that critical comment to
which it fs fully entitled as an appoint-
ment based unmitigatedly upon personal
favoritism, and this without reflection in
the least upon the officer’s personal char-
acter or professional ability, in which
characteristics he is above reproach,

“Admiral Fletcher in his testimony be-
fore the House Naval Committee in
March, 1916, went into that phase of the
situation without reference to the factor
of personal or political influence, and his
remarks might very well have given
pause to any Congressional tendency to
adopt aelection as a substitute for se-
niority in naval promotion. .He opposed
selection because of its harmful effect
upon service efficiency.

“Rear Admiral William 8S. Sima, one
of those selected this year among the
line officers, advanced from the grade of

“Army and Navy Register”

WASHINGTON, Jan, 27.—The Army and

afraid of the political and particularly
the social and eervice influence which
might be brought to bear’ upon a board
detailed to select officers for advance-
ment, he being in favor of a system of
individual markings and of ascertaining
the judgment of senior officers,

“When the House conferecs had before
them the naval appropriation bill pend-
ing in July and Auguet of last year, re-
sulting in the enactment of the law of
August 29, a number of officers were
heard for and against selection. Rear
Admiral C. J, Badger said: ‘I am op-
posed to the principle of selection for
promotion in the navy and always have
been during my career in the service
on the ground that [ believe it prac-
tically impossible to arrive at a Just and
equitable basis for selection without in-
jury to the morale of the whole service.’

“Rear Admiral Joseph Strauss, the
then Chief of Ordnance of the navy, also
opposed to selection, said: ‘Everybody
in the navy is afraid that influence be-
yond their control will guide the pro-
motions. They are afraid of political ine
fluence.’ "

$15,000,000 SHORT

U. S. Armor Plant Will Cost
$27,000,000, Not $11,000,-
000, Experts Declare.

 

 

WASHINGTON, Jan. 27.—Secretary
Daniels's plan to economize on navy
munitions and keep down Government
expenses received a jar to-day when he
learned that his calculations for the $11,-
000,000 armor plant are approximately
$15,000,000 short of what this plant is
now expected to cost. Experts have re-
ported that the plant cannot he built for
double the $11,000,000 which was orig-
inally set aside for the purpose. By
considering $27,000,000 as a probable

reduced prices of

 

basia of cost, ordnance experte believe
that work could be begun as soon as &
proper site is selected.

The reason which prompted Secretary
Daniels to seek competition abroad for
armor plercing shells was purely econ-
omy. He has explained that he wants
the best munitions for the navy, but
does not want to pay high prices if he
can gave money by purchasing abroad:
If the Bethlehem Steel Corporation will
come down in its prices for shells so
that the navy does not have to pay up-
ward of $50 or $100 a shell more than
Secretary Daniela desires to pay, the
United States Government will gladly
continue purchasing its munitions “at
the same old stand.”

In view of this plan the news that
Congress would have to be ready to sup-
ply $15,000,000 more than Mr. Daniels
estimated for the armor plant, is dis-
turbing. Tt !s erpeotally so, it is said,
because the Navy Department's esti-
mates for battle cruisers, scouts, &c.,
have all been proved to be below the
mark. Mr. Daniels now wante Congress
to Increase the limit of cost on the acout
cruisers to $4,000,000 and on battle

cruisers to $19,000,000 each. He Says
battle crulsers cannot be constructed for

by Congress, and he points out that
much valuable time has been lost in the
negotiations with the shipbuilders and
