OTTO KAHN PROPOSES BUIL

By JEANNE JUDSON.

TTO H. KAHN is looking for a|

rich man,

The natural assumption
would be that he would not have far |
to,search; but he is looking for a par-
ticular kind of rich man—one who has

unlimited means and has not yet done |
anything for art and the peaple, but

has the desire to do something which |

will not only be of lasting benefit but

that man's far sighted generosity and |
intelligent appreciation of the veal
needs of humanity,

When Mr. Kahn finds this man he
has a definite task outlined for him to
perform. He is to establish in America
a counterpart of the Luxembourg gal-
lery of Paris, a place where the work

be exhibited to the people free, a
place where the artist can go for

go for a better understanding of art.

* Edke the Luxembourg in France, this
gallery would be only a temporary
home for the paintings. In the Paris
institution ten years after the death of
an artist, after time has proved the
worth of his pictures, they are sorted
out and the best work is given a per-
manent place in the Louvre. The
Louvre might be represented in Amer-
jea by the Metropolitan Art Museum
or by a new-gallery established for
that purpose.

Es

a

Mr. Kahn first revealed his plan for |

an American Luxembourg to the
members of the Salmagundi Club,
where he spoke at a recent dinner.

“The natural question,” said Mr.
Kahn, “is, Why don’t you do it your- |
self? I have several reasons for think-
ing that this should be the work of
another man. In the first place I am
already busied with so many things
that I have not time to devote to this
9 big work. Also I believe that some
other man should be given this won-
derful opportunity.

“Wall Street is filled with rich men
who could afford to take up the
work, men who are honestly seeking
to find a way of expressing themselves

made that the Salmagundi Club should

| $60,000. dt is largely the gift of a}
small gronp of art lovers, of whom J.

| tributor. Artists have willed it their
libraries, as that of F. Hopkinson

the ideas that led up to Mr. Kahn's
search for the rich man who is to es-
tablish a counterpart of the French

this country the art centre of the
world. Some of the things he said
are:

viewpoints ought to meet fgr more fre-

thus far. Yet the opportunity is |
| boundless and the need very great for
men who will put some of their |
wealth, of their time and ability in the |
service of this cause; who, conscious |
_of the importance and the far reach- |
‘ing influence of art, will help along
movements having for their purpose
the advancement of art and of art)
standards, and the procuring of more
and better opportunities in the fleld
of art, both to the public and to Amer-
ican artists.”

“The people at large are astir, grop-
ing, seeking for a condition of things
which shall be better and happier,
which shall give them a greater share |
not only of the comforts and rewards, | |
but of the joys and recreations, the |
beauties and the inspirations of life. |
It is a movement that is full of prom-
ise and a menace only if ignored, re-
pressed or falsely and selfishly led.”

“Every kind of talent is latent here.
All that is required is opportunity, in-
spiration and guidance. And in addi-
here to

|

 

quently; we ought to get to know
each other better.”

“Among the common meeting
grounds available, one of the most ap-
propriate is that of art. For art is
democracy: art is equality of oppor-
tunity.” ;

“T have an abiding faith that the

people collectively know a good thing |

when they see it. It is true that some-
times they make the judicious grieve
by taking a pretty poor thing for a
good thing, but [I have never known
them to fail to recognize and appre- |
; Clate the truly meritorious in art, In|!
, fact, I have admiringly wondered more
} than once at their capacity to enjoy
|} and digest heavy and unusual artistic
| food, free from the salt or spice of
{what is ordimarily considered popular
| appeal.”

| “For educational and scientific pur- |

poses a vast deal has been done in
America. The generosity displayed by |
| many of our wealthy men in this re-
spect is the admiration of the world.
But to the immensely large and im-
mensely important field of art rela-

|lic eager to learn,

jin

appeal to that exists anywhere, a pub-
quick to perceive
respond, sure to appreciate and
retain; fresh, spontancous and genuine |
its feclings, clean and healthy in
its artistic instinets ‘4nd aspirations,
not as yet affected by the taint of de-
jcadence which has begun to cast its |
| blight upon art in other countries.”

“America in the past century had
|} the formidable task of conquering a
continent, physically and industrially,
and it was necessary that the best!
| brains, the intensest energies and ac-
tivities of its people should devote
themselves to that stern task of mua-
terial effort,
|which was naturally measured and |
| expressed largely in terms of dollars |
|and cents. But the day of the indus-
jtrial pioneer is over and with it has;
| gone—if it ever existed—the day of the |
almighty dollar.”

“We have reached a stage where we
ean afford and ought to occupy our-,
selves increasingly with questions af-,

and

|

|

well being and progress of the race."
“A vast army equipped with ee

| with but few attendants.

nation, stands ready and impatient to
follow those qualified to lead across
the tenaciously held trenches of ugli-
ness, dulness and commercialism to
the heights beyond.”

“When this appalling war comes to |
| be ended the utmost energies of the

men and women of the leading Furo-
pean nations will have to be devoted
,for years to come to the hard and
| stern task of material effort. The high

altar on which there burns the sacred |

flame of art may be left for a time |
It is Amer- |

ica's ‘opportunity, it is America’s high

privilege and duty, to ald in keeping |

that sacred flame alive. It is her
| privilege and duty to open wide her |
portals to art and artists, to become
a militant force in the cause and ser-

| Vice of art, to be foremost in helping

to create and spread that which beau-
| tifies and enriches life, to seek to de-
| Stroy that which vulgarizes and lowers
lit. To accomplish this great task there
must be leaders.”

Mr. Kahn is now searching for one |
,of these leaders,

“There are so many rich men in
America,” said Mr. Kahn, “who
to say the least, uneducated in ways
and means of spending money for the
public welfare,
desire to do something. IL feel sure
that I will find a man who will appre-
ciate this suggestion and act upon it.

“We ‘have all sorts of public in-

I’. Ballard Williams, president of !
last of the Romanticist school of
painters in America, was asked what
he thought of Mr. Kahn's plan.

“It is one of the most practical sug-
gestions for the advancement of art in
this country that I have ever heard,”
he said. “The gallery could be estab-
lished much on the same plan as the
Luxembourg, for the exhibition of the

fecting the mental, moral and physical | work of living American painters,

WANT somebody to talk to and |

es
| there isn't anybody I know
well enough.”

That's a curious sentence for the
opening of a newspaper advertisement.
It isn't from a column of “personals.”
It doesn't end with those familiar |
words “Object matrimony.” The rest
of the advertisement is as follows:

“It's the old story of the imperson-
ality of New York. Lonely men and
women are coming daily to pour their
troubles into the sympathetic ear of
a member of our staff, who can give
them the simple, kindly, commonplace,
human advice they need,

“Not all the work of the Charity Or-
ganization Society is with poor people,
Last year 10,000 persons called to ‘talk
over’ their affairs and to ask advice,
They needed not alms, but a friend,”

That was the wording of an adver-
tisement that appeared in Tie Sun the
other day. It wasn't an appeal to peo-
ple to give help, but an invitation to
it come and get it; not material help-
shoes and mittens and clothes, coffee

 

 

and beans and rice-—but the human in-

not part of his stock in trade.

He practises painless extraction of
what he seeks from a witness, yet if
a witness is:not frank he is certain
to be left at the close of his examina-
tion by the soft voiced attorney in
' such a position that his evidence will

have little weight. He does not seek
' to get out of witnesses by terror what
they have to tell. He leads them along
carefully, courteously and shrewdly

and accomplishes a good deal more |

than could be done by browbeating.
If a man can tell anything he tells it
whether he intended to or not.

Mr. Whipple's behavior in conduct- |

ing a case is impressive. He wins the
esteem of the court and provokes the
jadmiration of jury
| He never forgets himself and with the
utmost simplicity introduces evidence
of vital importance. He never becomes
| excited. A kind word and a smile are
characteristic. He never seems in a
hurry.

For the past eight years no less than
10,000 persons a year have poured
their troubles into the sympathetic ear
of this reception agent. And what an
| amazing variety of trouble they have
had to tell! They are not all of one
class. They are rich and poor, old and
young, male and female.

Some of their problems seem trivial
and the reception agent a queer person

to appeal to for a solution. There is
the young college girl, for example,

it does seem extraordinary that she

Comparatively simple also are the
cases of the people who are just plain
lonesome. They don't know anybody,
} They haven't the courage or the injtia-
tive or the “know how" necessary to
make friends, Their thoughts and
feelings have been bottled up inside
them so long that they've got to get
them out of their system or explode,

she lets them talk. Lets them! She
