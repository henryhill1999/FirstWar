RUNNING TO FIRES IS SMALL PART OF. THE

 

Dr. Harry M. Archer, honor- |
ary medical officer of the)
Fire Department.

By ROBERT ADAMSON,
Fire Commissioner.

HERE is something about the}

work of firemen that has al-}

ways appealed to red blooded |

citizens, That explains why we have |

80 many enthusiastic “buffs” in the

Fire Department.

The buff is a fire fan. A buff never

belongs to the Fire Department; be

is a citizen who makes a hobby of the

 

 

 

department, and as a rule there is} new home now in process of con-! salaries

no sacrifice that the good buff will not
make to help out the department, and
particularly the firemen.

There have always been buffs, but
they have not always been known by
that name. I understand the name |
originated back in the volunteer days,
when the men who were interested and
enthusiastic about the Fire Depart-!
ment work used to go around to]
the fire houses and sleep there. They |!
used to wrap themselves up in buffalo
robes; hence the name.

There isn't a fire house in New York
that hasn't its quota of buffs. There!
are local buffs who take pride in being
connected with a certain engine or
truck company, and then we have a}
number of distinguished buffs who are |
interested in the department as |
whole. |

The local buffs are of all ages. Some |
of them are young boys, who are glad |
of the chance to run an errand to the!
corner restaurant to get a sandwich |
for a fireman, and who are glad at al
big fire to carry cans of coal for the |
fire engines. These buffs know every- |
thing about the company down to the |
minutest detail. They know just how
many runs the company made last |
year, what sort of fires it extinguished, |
and they know all about the individual |
firemen, their work and their troubles. |

There are about a dozen men who |
for a great many years have been |
the stanch friends and followers of the)
department. One of these was Col. {
Nathaniel B. Thurston, who was _ buried
en Sunday, and who had the love of |
every man in the Fire Department.

Col. Thurston had been running to)
fires for nearly forty years. I gl |
he probably knew every offics in the}
department on Manhattan Island, aha
myany of them in other parts of the!

ty.

 

 

|

He visited the fire homes and |

yerformed an untold number of |
7 e

friendly services for the men. He was}

@ mine of interesting and colorful!

about the picturesque men who were
Prominent in the department twenty-
tive or thirty years ago.

He had a genuine love and enthu-
siasm for everything connected with |
the department. He would get up at
any hour of the night to help a fire-
man or to perform some service for
the department. He had its interest
just as much at heart as any official |
have, and he was al-
ways watchful of the department's in-
terests.

He was a type of the men I have
just mentioned, Another who has
performed the same kind of service
for the department is Dr. Harry M.
Archer, who, perhaps more than any
other living man, devotes all of the
spare hours from his large private
practice to the service of the depart-
ment.

For about thirty-five years Dr.
Archer has been going to all big fires
and giving medical treatment to in-
jured firemen and others, of course
without a cent of remuneration, He
has performed thousands of acts of
kindness to the members of the de-
partment, and in recognition of his fine

service a medal has been endowed in
the department, to be known as the
Harry M. Archer Medal, |

Another man of the same kind is
Robert Hi. Mainzer, the Wall Street
hanker,. Mr. Muainzer has not heen

going to fires as long as Dr. Archer,

| scoots along he is accorded
rights extended to apparatus of the|

but he is one of the most enthusiastic |

citizen firemen in the whole city. He
was responsible for the creation of the
Neustadt Memorial Fund, a fund for
the relief of firemen and their families,
and is a trustee of that fund. There
ie nothing connected with the de-
partment's welfare which does not in-
terest him and enlist his help.

Dr. Archer is an honorary medical
officer in the department, and Mr.
Mainzer is an honorary officer, as was
Col, Thurston. Jerome Siegel is the
remaining honorary officer in the de-
partment. Mr. Siegel likewise is

always interested in anything which |

is for the benefit of the department
and the men.

James M. Leopold is known as the
honor buff in the department. He
has been yoing to big fires for many
years, and if he should fail to appear
at one the officers would begin to won-
der what had happened. He created
a few years ago a fund known as the

Firemen's Emergency Relief Fund, the |

object of which was to make loans to
firemen at nominal rates of interest.
He had had a great deal of trouble
with “loan sharks” in the department,
and this fund was designed to put an
end to this evil.

1 could mention scores of other men
who are equally devoted to the de-
partment, among them Herbert Smyth,
former Assistant’ Corporation Counsel
Charles F. Bostwick and Joseph J.
O'Reilly;
igs one of the warmest friends of the
firemen.

It is a great tribute to the firemen:

that they have such stanch friends.

These men have performed great ser- |

vice for the firemen, and we,don't see
how we could well get along without
the honorary officers and the buffs.

THE BUFFS AND THEIR WORK.

NLY a few buffs could be men-

tioned by Commissioner Adam- |

son in his short article. There
are hundreds of them. The faces of

|
many of them are familiar to the |
uniformed fire fighters all over the.

city. n tf

Dr. Archer always finds time to re-
spond to all two or more alarm fires.
He has a red automobile like those |
used by battalion chiefs, as he

and

department. On the way he usually |
picks up his associate buff, Robert H. |
Mainzer, who lives at the Hotel An-
sonia, and together they report to the}
chief or the officer in charge at a
fire. The records show that they are}

| often called upon for service.

James M. Leopold's usual method of |
getting to fires is by taxicab. In his

Robert H.
struction he will have a ticker that
will record al! fire alarms. At pres- |

ent he gets his calls over the tele-
phone, whether he is at home, at his
clubs or at the Stock Exchange. It is |

said of him that he is never too busy |
to attend a fire, provided two or more |
|}alarms have been rung, and that no
fireman, in or out of uniform, was |
ever turned from his door.

Mainly tbrough his efforts many a

anecdotes about firemen, particularly \ man who wears th '

juniforne has been able to get out of

the hands of loan sharks. Tlrora close |
assoc“tion with the men in blue Mr.
Leopold learned the need they some-
times felt of a little, ready cash, The
old way in the Fire Department of
meeting this need was to run to the
handy loan shark who charged ex-
tortionate rates, in many cases caus- |
ing real privation to the borrowers
and their families,

Assisted by a few friends Mr, Leo-
pold organized the New York Firemen's
Emergency Relief Fund, Ine, Its ob-!
ject is to lend sums up to $100 for
eight months at the rate of 4 per cent. |
To get such loans the applicant must |
simply be in good standing with the)
fund. The result has been highly bene- |
ficial to the men.

Mr. Mainzer has made a study of |
firemen for the last twelve years.
As a result of his associations with |
the men he and his aunt formed the |
Sigmund Neustadt Memorlal Fund. |
From this source a fireman can bor- |
row money in case of illness or death
and if his situation warrants it he is
given the’money outright. No charge
is made for loans. |

Col. Thurston was one of the most |
conspicuous of the so-called civillan
members of the Fire Department. A!
stickler for form because of his mili- |
tary training, he always reported at |
once to the chief in command at a fire, |

Mr. Leopold became interested in
the Fire Department when he was 18

years old. That was thirty-five years |

ago. In this interest he finds relax-

ation from the troubles and cares of

Wall Street. Now, after thirty-five

| years service, he finds himself senior |

| buff of the department, this title hav-
ing been conferred upon him about a
year ago when the late Col. Thurston,
who had been senior buff for years,
was made an honorary member of the
department,

On his desk in his office in Wall
| street Mr. Leopold has a telephone by
! which he receives notice of all two
alarm fires. When. an alarm is re-
| ceived the banker will cast aside busi-
ness matters and get to the scene as
quickly as a taxicab will carry him.
| Mr. Leopold is best known in and
out of the department as the presi-
dent of the New York Firemen’s Emer-
gency Relief Fund, which, as has been
said, makes loans to needy firemen.
The other officers are Lewis L. Clarke,
vice-president; Herbert N. Armstrong,
| secretary and treasurer;
missioner Robert Adamson, W.
Weeks, Richard KE. Laimbeer, Fire
Chief John Kenlon and Deputy Chief
Thomas Lally of Brooklyn, trustees.
Regarding this fund, Mr. Leopold said:

“The fund was established

sisting needy firemen who required
money for various purposes,
debt, sickness, &c.

“Before the establishment of this

fund many firemen made it a practice

when requiring money for an emer- |

gency to borrow from loan sharks, to
whom they paid large sums in com-
| missions. If they were unable to pay

; they were in danger of having their |
garnisheed

and of

Mainzer.

It is the pur-
pose of the fund to free the members

| of the force from the evils of the loan
| sharks.

“Furthermore, some firemen make it
a practice to borrow money from sa-
loon keepers four or

their semi-monthly checks are due. In!
order to get a loan of, say, $25 the
borrower is required to spend about
$2 or $3 in the saloon before he gets
the loan, this despite the fact that he!
borrows the money to use for only
three or four days. When he visits

the saloon again to repay the loan he
is expected to spend about $3. If
doesn't the next time he tries to get a
loan he will be refused, So you see in
order to oatain a loan of $25 for three
or four days he is required to spend at
least $5 in the saloon,

“Some of the best known men in the
city are contributors to the fund, The

| amount that we have on hand would

surprise you if I were to
give out the figures, but
is entirely philanthrople the contrib-
utors prefer to have their names and
the amounts donated kept secret,
“Under the system any fireman inj
good standing can come here and bor-
row money. He is limited to the
amount of $100. This amount may be

their duty. The fact that this fund)
has loaned approximately $8,000 in
the last year without loss vindicates
my judgment

Mr. Leopold has not confined his
ictivities as a buff to the maintenance
of an emergency fund. He is con-
stantly making suggestions for im-

proving the lot of the firemen and for
bringing the efficiency of the depart-
ment to a higher plane.

For instance, the hanker recently
attended a fire at which a woman and
child had overcome by smoke.
A hurry ¢ to a hospital covering
the district brought ambulance,
The woman and child were placed in

ire of the ambulance doctor. The
latter found that a pulmotor was
ssary for the proper treatment of
the patients, but owing to the weight
of the pulmotor the machine was not
carried on the ambulance. So the
embulance had to go back to the hos-
pital for it. But this took time.

When the ambulance returned with
the pulmotor the woman had died,
and it required the undivided attention
of the doetor for over an. hour to re-
susvitate the child. Mr. Leopold
served what had happened, and the
following day sent a comniunication to
the Fire Commissioner suggesting that
in future all wagons of deputy chiefs
should be required to carry pulmotors

work as a fire buff, and when his in-

don't know.”

“I've been a buff for thirty-two
years, but honestly and truly I don't
know how I started,” he went on.

“Just drifted into it, I guess.”

In the course of the conversation
Dr. Archer corrected a popular im-
pression that many buffs attended
fires for the pleasure of watching the

| spectacle of a burning building.

“L go to fires to dj} some good,”
Dr. Archer. “If it wergn’t: for the
fact that I am certain that I can do
some good in ministering to burned or

 

injured firemen I never would attend
| fires. 1 don’t like fires; they con't
appeal to me even as a_ spectacle.
Usually at two or more alarm fires
some work can be found for me to
do, I have my auto fitted up as an

| my

ambulance and [I am prepared for any
sort of emergency case that requires
attention.”

Incidentally it may he explained
that Dr. Archer never uses his red
auto for anything but fire service.

“My fire auto is prepared to answer
my call during the day or night,
chauffeur being constantly on duty
ready to crank the engine whenever
he gets the call. On the latter’s day
off I go to the garage myself and get
the car,” said Dr. Archer.

“Yes,” he went on, “I'm a trustee of
the Neustadt Fund and so are Com-
missioner Adamson, Chief Kenlon,
Joseph J. O'Reilly, Maurice W. Neu-
stadt and Robert H. Mainzer, whose
aunt, Mrs. Sigmund Neustadt, donated
the fund in memory of her husband.
The trustees have never been changed,
although the fund was created about
nine years ago, except in the cases of
the Commissioner and the chief of the
Fire Department. We use the inter-
est of the fund to carry on the work
tor which the fund was donated.

“Take, r instance, a fireman who
has been injured in the performance of
his duty. The injury may be serious
enough to require the attention of a
specialist for whose services the fire-
man is unable to pay. If the case is
brought to our attention the Neustadt
Fund will supply the necessary money
with which to pay the specialist. Very
often, you know, firemen have their
eyes injured in various Ways while
working at fires, and in such cases ey¢
are called in to save
