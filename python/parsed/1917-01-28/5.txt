way leading down to the basemei. of,
the hotel. On the basement floor she.
had entered the elevator, had taken a |
flying trip up to her 6uite, had been)

| dropped again to the basement and had |

@lided out of the side door again unseen
by the entire fourth estate.

Aha! the Telephone Bell Rings.

And not many minutes tater along |
came a telephone message to the Mc- |
Alpin.

“Tell any one who,may be waiting to
see me," Miss Sachen said over the tefe- |
phone, “that I'm out on Long Island And |
will not be home to-night.”

Judging from the time she had slipped
out of the hotel and the time she tele-
phoned “from Long Island” she had es-
tablished a world’s record for the trip.

Nevertheless the intefviéwers helq on

at the MgAlpin bravely for wt longy e
after nie Also Major Car Snota the |
43 ‘with
TiMave

Australian promoter, whose

the twenty-seven pockets

added picturesqueness to thes MceAlpin |
lobbies, waited, but not so patienfly.

“Only yesterday,” ‘sighed the Mafor |
to the assembled reporters, “she prom-,
ised to meet me here to-night at $:30)
o'clock to go to a show. As 1 often
used to say to Bulwer-Lytton, ‘Bulwer, |
no-woman has 4- right. to. keep .ane wait- |
ing except your own wife.’” .

And so there was nothing to do to kill
time while waiting hopefully through the
stretches of the night but to borrow
from the young man who had been en-
tertaining ami writing about the north-
ern queen from .Doc Cook's néighbor-
hood the clippings of the ‘reams of stuff
he and the sob sisters—-he had,the clip-
pings all with him—had been\ grinding |
out all week. ‘ i

She Came From ‘Kuyukuk, Alaska,’ |

Yes, the clippings showed, she was at
true child of nature. There was, one
read, the fine brass bed in father's home |
in far off Kuyukuk, Alaska, ich had |
been mushéd over the virgin snows at,
an expense of 50 cents for every pound |
of brass and trtmmings in‘the.bed. Oft |
and oft, one read on, after@émaking the |
beds she would drive her dog team over!
the owy hills madly, ®aping the |

 

team from crag to crag and laughing |

into the midnight sun.

Ah, why did the women of this great!
fearsome city paint, their cheekse—one
read further—when, if. they would go!
into the great silences of nature, as she
had, nature would paint their cheeks for-
ever and ever? Yes, Frank, her father—
Nick Sachen's first name is Nick—was!
a miner who had struck it rich in placer |
mining.

“Gal,” he had said to her (the reader
is still reading the news of the,day pub-
lished during the past week, rémember)
—'Gal,” dear dad had ‘said, “with my
bare hands I've torn a great fortune |
from the rocks that form the eaves of |
the world, Now’ you shall have your}
fling. Here are gold nuggets, gal. You |
kin take keer of yourself. Go down
and see the great tall buildings of New
York, gal, and learn the ways of the}
great world Do not look frightened, ,
gal, ‘No one will harm you.”

Niek Gives Another Version.
“She always was talking about going

 

 

| to New York around here,” said Nick |

Sachen out in Kansas City yesterday,
“so I said, ‘Go ahead if you wont to—
if you can raise the dough to bum
around on,’"” ;

But there was her sweetheart, Jack,
noble and true—to return to reeent Now
York interviews with Miss Sachen, Jack:
was a hotel man ‘in far off Fairbanks,
Alaska, and tt was Jack who had given |
her the diamond earrings, the diamond
studded watch and the diamon! ring
she displayed so demurely to sob sister
after sob sister. The men of the great,
terrifying city, ah, were so splendit in
their store clothes and citified ways.
But some day, yes, some day—the call |
of: the North would come to her agan, |

jand sho would rush far over the snowy |

mountains again to her Jac¢ and wed
him and live with him in the twilight
of the world for all time,

“here's some fellow named Jack
something that's stuck on her,” *said |
Niek Sachen (to come back 4gain to.
telegraphic interview from Kansas City |
yesterday). He's a saloonkeener some |
place up in Alaska, Last summer when
Louise pulled this stuff about Jack T
told her she ought to marry him while
the rotng ts gg!

Worked in a Boarding House, |

“My Gaughter was in Alaska for about,
two years. She worked !n some hoard-
ing house up there, But she blew back |
here to Kansas City Jast Jyne. 1 didn't |
see much of hersthough, because she |
spent most of the‘time living with a
woman friend of hers down the «treet,
here with, some diamonds—
I whould'say so! ‘Where'd you get ‘om?

She In Willing to Be Adopted.

“My daugher,” said Nick Sachen, out
in Kansas City yesterday, “always was

In fact. a few years ago Louise
wrote a letter to Helen Gould asking
Miss Gould to adept her.” '

“What! laughed Miss Sachen over
the McAlpin house telephone yesterday
at noon when a reporter from an eve-
ning paper told her that a laborer
named Nick Sachen in Kansas City said
she was his daughter and not the daugh-

She talked somewhat in that fashian

her slang for their readers. They knew
it wag just the rouzh speech of a timid

was the guest of honor at a dinner given
last night by the Pilgrims Society at
the Union League Club in celebration
of his anniversary. The dinner is the
only affair at which he has appeared
since the indisposition which kept him
confined during the past week, and his
presence at the table was a direct refu-
tation of the statement of his physician,
made on his birthday, that the veteran
diplomat would not be able to leave his
house for a weéK,

About ninety prominent men, including
many guests who were not members of
the Pilgrims Society, were at the tables.
im. Hughes and Chauncey M.
Depew were among them, while George
T. Wilson was toastmaster. Among the
others were Cornelius Vanderbilt, Lord

Aberdeen, Commissioner R. A. C. Smith,
Major-Gen. Leonard Wood, Herbert L.
Satterlee, Gen. T. L. Watson, Brig.-

Gen. Daniel Appleton, Samuel W. Fair-
child, Patrick Fran@is Murphy and

the trembling pair now beseeching aid
from the priests.

Start With New Moon.

Mrs, Lysaj's sister was she. Two
years ago she died in the home that now
stands haunted, where heavy objects sail

through the air, where pictures jangle

on the walis, where counterpanes, tugged
by unseen hands, slide from the bed;
| where visitors are assailed by fierce as-
| paulte from decorations propelled by in-
| visible forces, where bottle stoppers
{dance merrily from room to room, and
| where the pious prayers of priests are
unabie to counteract the evil machina-
tione that find free play there.

All these things and many more have
occurred since Wednesday evening upon
the devout and humble adjurations of
| Lysaj, of his wife, of two priests and of
| neighbors,
| They began when the new moon was
| born—at midnight on Wedneeday.
| Strange creakings then assailed the eurs

ject whizzed through the air and crashed
against the wall at their side. In fear

mantelpiece

Uneasy, but not yet conquered by their

fears, they made ready for breakfast. |
As Mrs. Lysaj performed her duties
over the stove the heavy iron Iifter

popped from its resting place and landed |
its point upon the woman's pet bunion. |
The scream that reached Stanislaus was |

caused only in part by her anguished

but there was nothing mystic about
that ascension,
The hairpins and sidecombs dropped

consequently herself toward the door.
Came a blow on her back; a flatiron had

That day it required the efforts of
two priests to allay the fears of the
couple that the devil had possession of
their home. Even before the eyes of the
holy fathers the mystic antics continued.

Mra. Lysaj denies that her sister died
with a curse against her. The Rev. Paul

Commissioner Lewis guaintains the
appearance of composure throughout the
hubbub, He expresses something of an

she is certainly plucky and seems to be
a pretty fine type of woman; but that

can be who dented herself food for’ six |

days, and he is quite sure that the
Process of forcible feeding will give her
sufficient nourishment to last out her
imprisonment and without deleterious
results,

“Mrs. Byrne is a small, thin, nervous,
wiry woman,” said Mr. Lewis. “She is
very high strung. It is for that reason
that I have thought it best to forbid the
visits of persons that might excite her.

We are hiding nothing, concealing noth- |

agreed and all the more because Mrs.

jif she didn’t think she had done her |

theory of woman's unconquerable van-

} Mrs. Byrne had lapsed into coma
/5 A. M. yesterday and had remained
unconscious ever since It was Mrs

 

missioner Lewis with a demand for
passes to the workhouse, The Com-
missioner declined politely but firmly
and Goldstein departed fuming, to re-

port to Mrs, Sanger.

Snffered Complete Relapsc,

“Oh, it is horrible!" Mrs. Sanger burst
out. “Their brutality is unspeakable
While my sister was consctous she ar-
ranged with a person who has access
to her to notify me if ehe lapsed into
coma, This morning at 11 o'clock the
person in the arrangement notified me
that Ethel has suffered a complete col-
lapse; that she was growing worse and
that it was necessary for me to go to
her, [ am informed that she has a
subnormal temperature of 97.2."

To this statement Commissioner Lewis
replied calmly that if Mrs, Sanger was

as careful of facts in inculcating birth |

control knowledge as she was in talking
about her sister's condition he didn't
think her advice was worth much.

And in tne meantime the birth control

cyl, is getting almost as much publicity
as Becky Edelsohn in dietary revolt once
gave the I. W. W.
“Mra. Sanger received last night from
a private source of information in the
workhouse the following report of her
sister's condition:

“At 6:50 I. M. patient came out of
coma after having been unconscious for
twenty-four hours, Tension of all con-
cerned greatly relieved, Fulse 90. Tem-
perature 97, Breathing very irregular.
Lips and tongue greatly swollen. Eges,
milk and brandy in small quantities
had heen'administered through a tube
every four hours, It is the opinion of
the conference of physicians that Mrs,
Byrne cannot live three days if she re-
sists feeding,”

“Now just,contrast that with the bul-
letin given out by Lewis and his doc-
tors,” ‘said Jonah Goldstein, Bigure out

| Wanted Two Nights a Week
| for Cards, One for Dane-

|

Mrs. Esmeralda Colle, whose husband,
| Bernard Colle, a druggist of 1103 Lex-

| ington avenue, discovered her at an early |

hour one morning in a situation which,
|immemorially, has been displeasing to
{all husbands, pleads in her defence to

| fore Justice Gilegerich, that consclence

came to her rescue before the sttuation,

reached a statutory status, The point is
novel, though by no means the only novel
feature of a case which interests
amuses visitors to Justice
court,

It seems the lady had a premomition
that her marriage, which occurred in

Giegerich's

1913, might be terminated in the divorce |

court. She prepared against that event-
uality by keeping a diary, which is lively
with brief sketches of her husband and
their domestic life. At the time of her
marriage ehe wrote this introduction to

the diary:

“T have decided to keep a diary 80
if ever our marriage should terminate
in the divorce court I shall at least

le this little book to show the nature

“Married to a Store.”

It was her opinion at threshold
of matrimony that a modern wife should
devote two nights a week to bridge or
poker, one night to dancing, one night
to the theatre and three nights at home
| with friend husband—in case he could
be made to stay at home. Also, it was
her. conviction that A. M. was too
early to go to bed.

Within two years her meditations on

the

the married state had taken form in
the diary.

“Yes," she wrote, ‘I'm married. To
what—not a man, but a store, for 1

am continually there, and when he takes

an evening off !t is only to aitend aA
meeting or to go to a club. Either I
go out with my Hittle brother or play

poker, which I usually do

“He told me it was a vice to be affec-
tionate, that he detested the clinging
vine sort of woman and that a slick,
shrewd woman was the kind he asimired.

my life it has been denied me, and 1
thought when I ‘married [ would be

sink to the lowest depths of degrada-
tion or in the end commit suicide.”

Colle said he had read the letter and
that it had touched him deeply, One of
the extracts from the diary which was
offered in evidence was:

“Our neighbors have nothing but dis-
dain for me and sympathy for him, He
taunts me with his superior education,
and just as a nature study did he marry

a girl with the exact views he has;
others advised him to marry just the op-

wants to ascertain which was right,
Thus I am classed as an experiment.”
