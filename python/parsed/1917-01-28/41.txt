President of the National City Bank
Writes of How Big Salaried
Men Are Made

Frank A. Vanderlip, president of
“the National City Bank, was asked
to answer the following questions:
te What are the opportunities of-
‘fered to young men in industrial

“and business life to-day?

, re these opportunities the equal
~ of those which their fathers encoun-
“tered, or have difficulties been buiit
“up by the great development of our
. industrial life, by the aggregz<on of
«@apital and the increase of its power
“through the formaticn of corpora-
tions, by the keener competition
«which characterizes our times, so
@that the chances of success are less

‘for-its attainment. greater, the prize
wharder to secure, the worth of the
*gndividual more difficult to demon-

impending uprising against the Ameri-
can occupation by the Piquettes, the
Nationalists of the south In the
north the Caco wing of the National-
ists had flamed out in open resistance
and the First Regiment had seen lively
campaigning. Finally the vague rnu-
mors centred on a reported plan of the
Pigacttes to rally their forces at Lea

Platones, in the Notte range of moun- !

tains, and from there to launch open
hostilities.
There were ninety of us all told to

or twice a month one of our gunboats

put in at Aux Cayes with mail and |

etores and then steamed out, pic-
turesque with her bulging sponsons
and towering stacks, bound for the
Seventeenth company at  Jacmel,
ninety-odd miles to the eastward.

To run down these persistent ru-

mors, to show the restless Piquettes

the uniform of the forces of occupa:

tion and to penetrate into the little
known district in which they were
supposed to be operating were our

‘ missions.
The Valley of Cayes, walled in on

‘the north by the Montagnes de la,

Hotte and on the south by the Mon-

tagnes de la Notte, stretched away
lke a great V tou where the towering

ranges merged with the Magaya range.

In Aux Cayes even little definite could

be learned about this district except

that the vafley was a fertile paradise
“where cane, oranges, pineapples and

grapefruit grew almost ( untended.

Along the mountain slopes, we heard,
stretched mile after mile of neglected

| CAMPAIGNING

Was less true of the man who hopes to
make an intellectual success of life.

I have often said to young men who
have asked advice about their work
that if they hoped for a large measure
of success they must make up their
minds to do two full days work each

,day. They must do one full day's

work at their regular appointed task--
tt their job; to that day’s work they
must bring energy, «a quick intelli-
genee to comprehend not only the de-
tails of what they are doing but the
relation of what they are doing to
the larger movement to which their
work belongs, and not only must they
have a desire to accomplish the stint
of work that will justify their day's
pay but they must voluntarily and
vigorously assume every other duty
to which they can lay their hand in
addition to that stint, so that they may
learn not alone the technique of their
own task but the tee:nique of the
work others are doing.

When they have done all that, how-
ever, they have done but one day's
work, and they have done but half of
what should be the real measure of
a day's accomplishment for the man
who is determined to make a distin-
guished success,

I tell you if you are to secure one
of the large prizes of success you must
make up your mind to adopt the theory
of the double day's work, and when
the regular day's work is finished
you must be ,. spared systematically
to devote some considerable portion of
time to study, toward gaining a broad
and intelligent view in aH its large as-
pects of the work with which you are
engaged, toward making additions to
your stock of general knowledge, to
the understanding of problems of the
day, to your duties as part of the
social organization.

You will not do that by a quick
scanning of newspaper headlines or
a detailed study of the baseball scores;
you will not do it by any desultory
und unplanned system of reading. You
will only accomplish it in full measure
if you have learned or have natively
implanted in you habits of systematic
mental application, the intelligence to
lay out definite courses of study and
the strength of purpose to adhere to
them.

Now just one more thought in re-
gard to those qualities which make
for material success. To forget your-
self is more important than to re-
member any single thing you have
ever learned in your lifetime.

Do not worry about your personal
relation to a piece of work, but give
the deepest attention and considera-
tion to the execution of that piece
of work, Never mind whether you
have what you regard as your full

shake of ft: never mind whether you |
ure getting; what you feel to be your

 

 

man to make progress against the en-
croaching jungle. We found it painted
a rich green with its fields of untended
cane, and here and there the jungle
growth failed to obscure the ruins of
the old French sugar mills. To-day

There was only the flicker of an oc-
caslonal charcoal fire in all Aux Cayes

; When we filed out of it at 4 o'clock on

a December morning to make a recon-
naissance of this prir- tive part of the
Black Republic. ‘fie se were eight of
us, one officer and ix enlisted men,
and Gilibert to inter,ret the curious
French patois of the in. orior.

The way of the Waytian burro is
strange and wayward, so one of the
men led the head of the pack train of
five laden burros, another the rear
beast, and each burro was tethered tu
its mates. The sun was just blinking
through the paims that fringed the
banks of the Grande Ravine Riviere

Montugnes de la Hotte.
In the days of the French it had

) been broad and paved. We found it
j almost impassable at points, leading

through streams and swamps, and
treacherous svith mudholes and rocks

traces of the old roadbed to!d their

produce for the city. They affected
the brightest hues of red, yellow and

straw hat of Hayti. The’ more fas-
tidious had tied their shoes and stock-
ings on the top of their packs, to don
them at the outskirts of Aux Cayes,
In close proximity to these evidences
of a vanity that had survived where
stone culverts had fallen were squeal-
ing pigs lashed firmly to the packs,
poultry and vegetables.

purpose of getting the work done, of
seeing that every proper means is

‘employed to do the work better than

it has been done before, and forget

| yourself, the credit you will receive, |

the relation you personally oceupy
toward the work, and if you will do
that I give you my word you will
have accompfished for yourself the

greatest good,

You will not be unwatched, Men,

will have an eye to your capacities
and characteristics, their observation
will be far greater than you guess, and
when that overseeing eye finds the
man who is interested in the job more
than himself that man will be marked
for promotion and for larger things.
Integrity, honesty of purpose, good
character ate the foundations upon
which success must depend, You may
hear stories of gains that have been
made by unfair means, by sharp prac-
tices, by shrewdness that only just
keeps within the law; but those gains
are not success, and in so far as you

will establish a reputation for honor, |
‘in so far as you put sound character
| into your work and never try to reach

a goal by a short cut that means some
loss of your own self-respect, you will
lay a substantial foundation for real
SUCCESS, ,

This is not a mere preachment; it is
one of the most practical suggestions
that I could’ give you out of the years
of experience that I have had, For
just mere practical shrewdness tn the
way of advice by which to reach posi-
tion and secure reward there is no ob-
servation that I could make that would
be of more use to you than one that I
once heard to the effect that God had

' somehow so fixed the world that a man

can afford to do about right.

We are in a time when there is
going on much readjustment in regard
to our views concerning business
ethics, concerning natural laws affect-
ing the distribution of wealth. and the
varying proportion that = different
classes are entitled to in that distri-
bution. It is a time when there is
great criticism of the established order;
when there are many new theories of
how the powers of government should
he exercised. These days are fruitful
in the birth of hopeful plans fer giv-
ing equality of opportunity, easier con-
ditions of life, a wider distribution of
prosperity by the magic of legislation.

Now, I tell you that there is no new
political economy. There is no novel
arrangement of society which wil! per-
mit you to succeed otherwise than by
the exercise of those same qualities
that have brought success in other
generations But you are entering

, active life at a time when sound judg-

ment and serious purpose must be
brought to the testing of an endless

in umber of legislative schemes, to the tions of the ee

 

residence In Cuba must have learned

and my French we were unable to
demonstrate to Port Salut our need
for water and grass for our horses. I
had almost despaired when two na-
tives led toward me an old, white
haired negro. Up from the crowd
rose the exclamation: “Here comes the
Englishman!”

tewildered at the confusion, the old
man stood still until T laid my hand
on his arm and said:

“Lam the white man, Capt, Hill, the
white Captain, Can you understand
me?

\ great smile creased his face and
he peered as us through dim eyes

“On, yes, the white American from
Aux Cayes Not since Capt. Young
wus here have I heard English. I
cooked for him, Tell him you |!
seen me, old Joe, and he wal re-
member.”

The Capt. Young he referred to was |

missions in the United States army,

mingo as military attache,

pe of the greatest moment.
It is undoubtedly possible to legislate
in a way that will be helpful in effect-

ing a more just division of the resulte |

of labor, legislation that will make «a
more equitable distribution of pros-
perity, but it has been well said that
the method of dividing prosperity is of
ttle importance if there is no pros-
perity to. divide, In order that we
may all have prosperity it will be one
of your solemn duties, and a duty the

| Wiese exercise of which will have much

to do with the opportunities for sue-
cess in life for you, to make wise po-
litical decisions.

Educated men in accepting the same
rights of citizenship that uneducated
men accept assume a far greater
weight of responsibility. It is the duty
of the educated man to etudy with in-
telligence the political questions of
the day, to form opinions of his own
rather than to accept the dictum of
others, to be an intelligent guide to
those whose minds have been less well

prepared to form intellectual judg- '!

ments.

With us a majority controls actions,
and the view of the majority tends to
ueurp the control of public opinion.
Do not fall into the easy habit of tak-
ing your opinion from majorities. You
have been given the equipment and
you now have the duty imposed upon
you of thinking for yourselves,

George Willlam Curtis, in an address
on the leadership of educated men, de-

serihed this duty of leadership in a!

way that is worth your reading.
Doubtless leaders express a sentiment
which is shared by the men and wom-
en around him, he said, but it is the

leaders who form and foster the senti- |

ment. They are not the puppets of
the crowd, light weathercocks which
merely show the shifting gusts of
popular feeling, Educated men do not
follow because they cannot resist nor
muke of their voices the tardy echo
of o thought they do not share. They
should not be dainty and feeble her-
mits because they are educated men.
They are equal citizens with the rest.
They should be men of strong con-
vietions and persuasive speech to show
their brethren what they ought to
think and do.

That is the secret of leadership. It

is not subservience to the mob, It {s,

not giving vehement voice to popular
frenzy that makes the leader. To do
that makes a demagogue Lead-
ership is the power of kindling a feel-
ing of sympathy and trust which*will
inspire eager followers. I[t was not
a mob, an ignorant multitude swayed
by a mysterious impulse; it was a body
of educated men, wise and heroic, who
lifted this country to independence
and laid deep and strong the founda-
