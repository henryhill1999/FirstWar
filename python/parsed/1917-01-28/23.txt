JOYS AWAIT

FINDER

By VIRGINIUS.

Not long ago I attended a dinner given
by several hundred sportsmen. My
right hand neighbor at the table in dis-
cussing the modern sporting magazines
Bald that the readers were given stores
of big came hunts which cost hundreds
of dollars to go on, and are entirely out
of reach of the sverage man.

There articles only make us poor fel-
lows fee} badly by giving us an awfully
keen appetite for such an outing which !
We cannot possibly satisfy. The editor:
of one of the foremost outdoor publica- |
tions made a speech after the dinner on
the fishing, hunting and camping to be
had near our homes—within a few hours
train ride at the most.

I have an idea that if more men and!
Women realized how much really good |
sport was to be had at home it would!

ing them afield much oftener ; second, the |

laws, because sportsmen take a more
Personal interest in the conservation of ;
their “home” wild life than in that of a
far distant place which they may never
gee; and third, the “upkeep” (if I may
use the term) of their own woods and

and streams.

Game Within Fifteen Miles,

Let me tell you how the thing has
worked out in my case. I live within fif-
teen miles of New York city, but within ;
@ short distance of my home there is a
patch of woods perhaps two miles long
by a mile wide. Near one end of this}
“forest” {s a stream which widens into |
almost a pond at one point. T have lived |
within a few miles of this place for |
twenty-five years and only this fall dis- |
covered what the possibilities of it were, |
It harbors woodcock, pheasant, rabbit, |
wood duck, muskrat, an occasional! black |
duck, gray squirrels and I think (and}
hope) mink. I started by taking my dog |
out Saturday afternoons in this little |
wilderness, and now, having discovered |
the muskrats, I go there three mornings |
@ week before breakfast to look at my |
traps. |

By getting up at 5 o'clock I can spend |
about an hour in the woods before going
to business, and I assure you that I feel
better and more wide awake in the office
now than I did when I got a “full night's
rest. I was sleepy tne first few days,
I must admit, but now I am accustomed
to it and would hate to give it up.

T have watched the sun rise in a num-
ber of places, but it is just as beautl-
ful near home as far away. While it is
still dark and every bush is covered with
frost, I hustle along through the woods
Just eating the fresh, snappy air, and get-
ting full of health. Why, just to write
about it makes me want to go to-morrow
morning, although it is not my regular
day, and I think I will go.

Sunrise Tea Good as Alaska,

I really don't see how a fellow could
feel any better if he were doing the same
thing in Alaska! When I get back to}
the house I am ready for a regular |
breakfast, and I feel as though my blood
might have a few red corpuscles in {t
Somewhere.

No one, as far as I know, wad ever
more anxious to shoot woodcock or
pheasant than I am, but after the first
few trips into my wilderness I left my

are more interesting without a gun than

PRESERVE PUBLIC

Pisgah National Forest in
' Western North Carolina

. Open May 15.

 

Asuevi..e, N. C., Jan. 27.—The finest

and largest public trout preserve in the}
| Eastern States will be thrown open May

16 by the United States Forest Service.
Tt is the 85,000 acre Pisgah National
Torest in the western North Carolina
mountains, lying ten miles southwest of
Asheville. It is already available to the
public for camping.

The forest is the greater part of the
land acquired by the late George W
Vanderbilt in connection with

chased from Mrs. Vanderbilt under the
terms of the “Weeks law” providing
for the protection of the sources of

navigable streams, Jt includes the head- |

waters of Davidson and Mills rivers,
which diverge from nearby sources to
the French Broad, and its west slope
drains into the east fork of the Pigeon.

The trout are the speckled mountain |

(brook) and the rainbow banded Cali-
fornia, and for these conditions are ideal.
Pisgah Forest is all mountains and rush-

ing streams, Ridges and spurs rise with |

giant steps to mile high heights cul-
minating in the triangular pyramid of
Mount Pisgah, 5,757 feet above sea level.

Altitude and southern latitude create
a pleasing blend of climates, and with
abundant rainfall produce a
vegetation characteristle of both North
and South. Slopes and narrow valleys
are thickly thatched with trees, birch,
maple, hemlock, pine, hickory, poplar,

growth of the higher heights. There are
tangled masses of rhododendron, orange

| fowered azalea and rosy petalled kalmin,

The springs go far up the moun-

{tains, and clear and cold is the water

that comes down through galax beds
under white flowered dogwood, sour-
wood making a splash of searlet when
the trees turn brown. The streams run
swift over rocky beds, brown in the tree

| shadows, flashing in the sunshine, swirl-

ing deep under gray rock ledges. Car-
cades plate stone tables with silver
veils, and at Looking Glass Fall the
plunge is sixty feet to the poo! where
green-gold bubbles rise.

The fishing should be
good, but no one except a few poachers
can give absolute assurance of this as
the Government has allowed no fishing
at all since it came into control two
years ago, Mr, Vanderbilt wardened it
religiously for twenty years and allowed
only a few people to wet.a hook in
the preserve. There was a twenty-four
inch California in
bedy caught it.

However, there should be many more
of that length because the Californias
fancy the forest waters. The original
stocking increased so fast that they
“hogged” the larger streams and drove
the indigenous speckled brethren to the
headwaters.

3) Protect feeding stations against cats

“Wilderness” Places’ Everywhere,

Now I suppose you will think all this
{g bordering on the ridiculous, but all 1}
ean say is, take @ good look at the |
country around your home and T shall
be surprised if you do not find gome
spot that corresponds to mine,

Get up early and put on your old,
@omfortable duds; go out and wander
around in your “wilderness” before it ts
, Nght and watch the sunrise; woods that
look very tame at noontime can seem
quite wild before sunrise. You will find
that you feel just as I do about “your”
stamping ground before long.

If one lives‘in the city of course it ts
impossible to get to any woods before
breakfast, but there is Saturday after-
noon and all day Sunday, Get on any
train and ride thirty minutes or so; then |
you will not be far from some open
country. Take a frying pan with a few
Other Utensils to be had at the ten cent
store and hide them in the woods tn-
stead of carrying them with you each
trip. The rottenest kind of dough balls
taste good if you are hungry and you
cook them yourself, Just because you
cannot go to Maine or British Columbia

PLUG SPORTSMANLIKE.
So Says “Royal “Coachman,” Who

Advocates Its Use.

Kit Clarke's attack on plugs, in a
recent issue of Tie SuNpay Sun, has
brought a rise from “Royal Coachman,”
who writes as follows:

The black bass gets away on the plug,
but seldom on the hook. That's why
“Rayx," a fly caster, is going to chal-
lenge me the opening of bass season
to see who will be victorious in cateh-
{ng more bass, And just for old time's
sake, to show that there is no frost
on the horizon, I'm going to be there
with a white plug. I'm afraid I'm get-
ting away from the plug (like the bass
does).

This is my plea, This I call a eports-
maniike lure, This then can be pointed
out as fairness, as giving the fish
chance, as the general how! goes, where
his chances of Iiberty are greater than
those of his capture,

Now eince we seck the bass in a true
eportamanlike atmosphere, let us assume
that we are not fooling our own minds;
let us belleve our own selves,

Does not what | have just narrated
found a convincing note?. Don't you see
that when you have hooked your bass it
{s very hard for him to find a loophole
that will mean freedom? He may rise
and flop al over the surface of the water,
but that does not loosen the hook any,
and a man who knows how to handle
the bass will not give him any slack
line to break.

T believe this to he a fair and square
{dea of angling: that the fresh water
advocates who have had the experlence

 

will bear me out and give my expert. |

enced ideas herein explained a just trial,

I may have a barrel of imagination,
but it does not stretch far. When I read
the article In Sunday's Sun a cloud of
fioom approached my brain, It irritated
{t so much-—-ahem! gentiemen, I compli-
ment myself for using the word brain—
I should have said solld ivory. Perhaps
that sounds better to some of you fel-
lows. Anyway I sat me right down
at my “keys and ripped this off a mile
a minute.

You fellows who are against the death
dealing plug Jet those twenty-pound
mauls at home, and as for you, Ki
Clarke, !f we ever meet, and {f you are
® bigger man than 1 am, I'll ask you
“howthehellareyou"” and “wattlyouuave.”

| SATTING DOWN FISH.

Most Important Element Is Cleane
liness, Saya Angler.

F. I, Sherman, replying to “Amateur”
on how to salt down fish, writes to THe
| Sun under yesterday's date -s follows:

‘Amateur’ will have better results If
| he guts, cleans, scrapes, removes back-
| bone, head, tail and fins, carefully re-
' moving every trace of coagulated blood,
| splits his fish, lays them flat, covers
{them with dry salt, adds another layer

of fish and dry salt and so on until his
crock, tub or half barrel ts filled. “No
brine can be made strong enough to in-
sure preserving.
|

 

}

 

“In my method the salt extracts the
water from tho fish and makes its own
strong brine. The most important ele-
ment is cleanliness, and this is not so
apt to be secured if the backbone is left
jn. My method has worked particularly
well with weakfish. So treated, I con-
sider them superior to mackerel.

“Another method recommended by my
friend J. Hal Dangler is to—but I'll let

| him give the Information first hand.”

THE DOGFISH.
| ‘Ab !" I thought, ‘they have maligned
| him,
| Poor, abused, derided fish!
| I shall take him and convert him
To a mighty tempting dish."
| Then I skinned him with a clasp knife
| And he looked:so clean and pink
| That I cried, “Why, holy sailor!
i Dogfish can't be on the blink!"
| First I parbolled, then T fried him
| To a crispy, golden brown
| In the very best of butter
| When 'twas forty-six a pound!
| Then I made for him a cradle
Of tomatoes firm and red,
And parsley sprigs, and lemon slice,
| ‘Twas a most alluring bed!
|
| To the eye he was a picture,
| To each sense he made appeal,
| So IT sat me down, preparing
To enjoy a luscious meal;
Well, his flesh was rich and flaky,
And if smoked he would be fine,
But when parboiled, fried and gar-
nished—

No! I'll have no more for mine!

| I hate to knock the under dog
| Of whatever class he be,
! Tf human, canine or the sort
| That is swimming ‘neath the sea;
| I gave that dogfish every chance,
In that I surpassed many,
But honestly, his flavor was
Just like a copper penay |!

‘TO SILVER KING?

Tarpon Biting in Florida
Waters Month Ahead of
Last Year.

 

Souti Boca Granog, Fla., Jan. 27.-
|Tarpon in mid-January! And_ since

then, January 16, a number of species
of the silver king, fifty and more pounds
| in weight, have been taken in the waters
| of the pass,
taken on February 22 by Louis Bremer

The outlook certainly is promising, the
1917 season being looked forward to with
dread by anglers because of the mortal-
ity among the Florida fishes during Crc-
tober and November when fish from min-

nows to the 200 pound jewfish were
found dead.

Thirty-seven families of fish were rep-
resented among the dead. The cause of
the mortality is believed to have been

an earthquake at sea, but the investiga- :

'
tion of the Bureau of Fisheries is not
| completed yet.

tarpon was the catch of anglers.

Tarpon fishing is one of the most ex-
elting sports in the world, for one can
never tell when the fish are leaping what
they will do. Leaping over the frail
boat js not an unusual stunt of the tar-
pon in its wild
free itself from the hook.

A. W. Dimock, who probably has un-
loosed more tarpon than any other in-
dividual, once hooked a tarpon that in
the first wild shake of its head threw
the balt and hook fifty feet in the air.

How high a tarpon will leap is a ques-
tion not easily settled. But let Mr. LDi-
mock tell his story in his own way:

“T was fishing in the pass with fift,
feet of line,” he says, “and the bait was
directly under the canoe, when a tarpon
struck flercely, quickly carried away a
hundred more feet of line and then swam
so swiftly toward us that I feared, from
the loosened line, that he had escaped,

“Then, fifty feet from the canoe, there
shot into the air a giant tarpon, measur-
ing, we learned afterward, an even

the ribbon which marked twenty-five fee:

the tarpon,

“Once T gave my own estimate of the

height of the jump to a group of friends |

tation he remarked firmly:

“"We fishermen must stand together.
I believe the etory.’"

Already the invasion of northern ang-
lers to Florida has begun and doubtless
when the news is known that tarpon are
biting earlier than usual it will hurry
others along eager to tie up to a tarpon,

hook, universally considered a legitimate
|method for the capture of fish, the only
justifiable method is the seine net, and
this only when used by fishermen whose
living depends upon the amount of fish
sent to market to feed the people.

Among sportsmen the single hook
alone holds any standing, all other
methods and devices being considered
illegitimate.

Only a decade ago gill nets barricaded
our rivers and fish in great quantities
were taken daily until many waters
were depleted and the splendid shad and
salmon disappeared entirely fron the
Connecticut and Hudson rivers. waters
in which vast numbers appesured each
season,

Interior streams were crowded with
set lines, a line extending from bank to
sank loaded with baited hooks and left
dangling over night to attract the fish,
which were removed at daybreak, and

in this manner bushels of black bass and |

pike were carried away,

Iiven explosives caine into use, an ex-
plosion of dynamite stunning the fish,
and big baskets were speedily filled by
merely scooping up the helpless crea-
tures, Finally the hand = fishermen

,and their rigid enforcement and the pun- ;

lishment of many violators caused their

the capture of fish were devised to
escape infringement of the laws, but
none appeared to be quite satisfactory
until a strange device was announced as
‘a “sure killer.”
Tt was made of wood about three
1 inches long, variously colored, and car-
‘ried from a dozen down to tnree or four
big hooks, and soon became known to
fishermen as a “plug.” It was quickly
adopted by pot fishermen, by which ts

the deed ts done, but get them anyway.
So sure of their deadly efficacy were
the inventors of these different styles of
| plugs, all built upon the same lines, that
‘contests for superior killing qualities
were entered into in which large sums
of money were involved, while the ap-
paratus which killed the largest number

Delaware Sport With Fly.

Along came a fisherman who wrote a
letter to THe Stun in which T was
vited to go plug fishing and “learn
something,” which he may consider good
advice, but which I decline to entertain.
I will never do anything of the kind, for
l can go up to the Delaware River and
get all the sport I want and more bass
; than I can use, with a light rod and a

fuzzy bucktail fly, and J refuse to lug

a lump of timber loaded with nuinber-

 

less hooks when I go fishing, for I am
after pleasure and not wanton murder, |

 

 

Some defenders of the plug assert
that they use only three or four hooks,
which of course is below the average,
yet still these are enough to afford any
fish little chance for its life.

The black bass is a sagacious fish and
knows from experience that a_ single
hook is a sort of measly affair any-
way, just a little toy to “monkey” with
