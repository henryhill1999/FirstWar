Peace rumblings at home and abroad
were responsible for sharp advances in
the cott

session, and

contracts for the staple
vould be acquired on the rises only with
difficulty. There were more buyers than
sellers, atid by the closing hour the mar-
ket had worked itself into a technically
ttrong position, with quotations up 10
0 34 points from Friday's close.
’ Although business was comparatively
email at the opening, prices were up 7
fo 11 points. Liverpool purchased March
options as well as October and sold July.
Wali Street, New Orleans houses, the
Southern and Western operators pur-
chased,

The sharp advance caught numerous
stop loss orders, It was rumored that
leading spot interests are heavily long
of the near positions.

With yesterday's advance the market
has made a maximum recovery of 115
points, or $6.75 a bale, from the low
levels established last Monday, when

mm market in yesterday's brief) rumors

 

 

in Chicago on Strength
of Hog Prices.

 

Cuicago, Jan, 27.—Wheat prices col-
lapsed to-day under heavy selling, due
that peace was in sight.
After an extreme break of 74% the mar-
ket reacted, but closed weak, 1% to 6
net lower, with May at 1.75% to 1.7514
and July at 1.47% to 147%. Corn fin-
ished % to 14% and 1% down, and oats
off 4 to 1%. Provisions scored gains
of 5 to 12%.

Notwithstanding that peace talk ap-
peared to have only the flimiest of
backing in the way of specific, new
developments, the wheat market plunged
swiftly downward as soon as trading
opened. Rallies which ensued were
quickly followed by a much greater de-
scent than at first, and it was not
until the last hour of the session that
the flurry was in a measure overcome
by week end evening up of business.

About the most definite ground ad-
vanced for the selling stampede was a
London story purporting to give terms
on which Germany was prepared to ne-
gotlate. In a general way, the peace
talk was also encouraged by Petrograd
advices, which seemed to indicate that
Peace without victory was not wholly
disfavored in Russia.

Bearish sentiment was notably in-
creased by the striking absence of fresh
export demand for wheat and by asser-
tions that railway congestion was again
as bad as ever. Considerable attention
was also given to gossip that Winnipeg
interests were among the heaviest sellers
both here and at Minneapolis.

Corn yielded grudgingly to the influ-
ence of wheat weakness. One of the
reasons was that 800,000 bushels of corn
had been taken for export since late yes-
terday. Besides, country offerings re-
mained light and Argentine news bullish.
Oats followed the downturn of other
grains. Seaboard demand proved slow.

In provisions the chief factor was
strength of hog prices. Peace talk was
likewiwe a deterrent against selling.

Continental Refining Co.

WE are offering subject to withdrawal the above Company’s
&% Convertible Preferred Stock at par, $10.

Those who are contemplating purchase of this stock are
requested to send us their orders without delay.

We recommend the stock as a sound
also for advance in value.

The Preferred Stock ts convertible, after

 

investment, and

|
April 1st, 1917, for

three years, into common at par at the option of the holder. The
Company is earning at the rate of approximately 25°, on the common,
into which the preterred stock is convertible, and when the Company
acquires certain production, which it ow has in view, its net earnings
should be about double what they now are. It is not unreasonable
to anticipate, therefore, that the preferred stock, on account of its
convertibility, will soon be worth several tiines the present price.

|

ape arion to list the stock on the New York Curb will be duly
made by the Company.

The refinery earnings, which have been averaging from $18,000
to $19,000 per month net, increased in December to $23,261.75. On
this basis the Company nearly earns in a single month the preferred
dividend requirements for an entire year.

Investors who are looking for safety of principal combined with
high speculative value are invited to consider these preferred shares.

The capitalization of the Company is
and 30,000 preferred.

The Company’s refinery has a capacity of

100,000 common shares

4,000 barrels daily.

Investors may reserve stock by wire at our expense, pend-
| ing receipt and examination of particulars contained in Cir-
| cular “R," which will be mailed on request.
