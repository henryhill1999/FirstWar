“There seems a danger that America

impression that he is not merely neutral

President Wilson’s message to the Sen- ,

public here, because of his statement!
that an oppressed people under a foreign
rule should be freed, implying the res-4

LEOPOLD GODOWSKY MAKES A REMARKABLE

Mr. Godowsky has recently played a number
of his finest interpretations for recording by the
Duo-Art. When he heard these records repro-
duced for his final criticisms he put the Duo-Art
to an unusually exacting test. For Leopold
Godowsky is not merely a great artist but a great
teacher as well, possessed of the broadest tech-
nical and theoretical knowledge of music. And he
was listening to his personal performances—de-
ciding whether the Duo-Art reproductions were
exact—were deserving of his approval.

Quoting from an interview given after the test :

“It is a truly remarkable experience,” said Mr.
Godowsky, “to hear the Duo-Art mirror every essential
quality of tone and expression...... it would be in
conceivable if I had not actually experienced this marvel
of hearing myself play—if I had not recognized my
touch, my characteristics, my art itself.”
