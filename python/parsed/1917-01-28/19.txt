Startling Slump in Runs

HEYDLER OFFERS REMEDY

By SHORTSTOP.

Bf the owners of ball clubs and their
atriking athletes used a little horse
@enee and settled their dispute with a
little of “give and take” all hands might
then turn to a more important issue and
try to find some means of inflating the
Batting averages. The .300 hitter is be-
foming more scarce each year, and some
method should be devised to prevent this
creature from becoming extinct.

The modern day pitcher appears to
have too much of an advantage on the

, batter. Whether the pitching craft is
Geveloping faster than the batsmen or
whether the game in the last ten years
has produced a higher class of boxmen
‘than the boys that swing the mace, the
Datting averages are getting slimmer
@ach year.

A table of statistics compiled by Paul

n, a Western statistician, tells
Better than words how the batting has
@alien off. Mr. Purman has taken a gen-
eral average of the club batting aver-
ages of the sixteen clubs for the last
@ve years, and finds that from 1911 to
1916 there was a batting decrease of 20
@ercentage points.

The following table shows the com-
@ined major league batting averages for
the iast six years:

A Gradual

Whese figures in themselves also tell
he story of the Federal League war.
That there was a general easing up all
@round after the Feds started to offer a
faven for disgruntled players is shown
by the slump in batting from .261 to
+249 in the first year the Gilmore league
teok the field. It dropped another point
fn 1915, and last season instead of get-
ting better slumped still another point,
te .247.

How this batting slump has left its
mark on the scoring is shown in the
number of runs scored. In 1911 the
sixteen major league teams scored 2,264

* more runs than did the same teams last

coming entirely too common. The aver-
age fan would rather have a good 6 to 5
than a dozen pitchers’ battles.

with pride that it has never been neces-
@ary to amend the rules for so and so
many years, and they would consider it
almost sacrilegious to change any of the

However, there would be no harm in
‘trying anything for a season. Percy
Haughton, one of the advocates of new
rules to put more batting and base run-
ning Into the game, saw the football
rules changed several years in succes-
sion, and the result of these experiments
‘wae a far better and more enjoyable
game than the old “mass formation”
game ever was.

Would Eliminate the Spitball.

President Tener of the National
Yaague believes the elimination of the
spitball will bring about the desired ef-
fect. He said recently he did not think
the joint rules committee would go any
fu r than that. However, it is doubt-
ful if the elimination of the spitball will
be sufficient tonic for the batting fig-
ures. The emery ball, one of the most
deceptive deliveries ever pitched, has
been ruled out of baseball for the last
two years, and batting has gone down
instead of up.

Two suggestions by local baseball
men would help a lot, and it would be
well if oné or both were given a year's
trial. Secretary Heydler of the National
League, whose knowledge and under-
standing of baseball is second to none,
would give a batter his base on three
Belle instead of four. In reccomending
such a change Heydler also presents the
argument that in his opinion it would
not greatly increase the number of bases
on balls, and not only would it help bat-
ting but base running also.

With only three balls required to send
@ batter to first Heydler believes it
would tend to maka the pitcher more
careful in his service and would do away
almost entirely with the custom of pitch-
ing one or two waste balls when the
catcher believes a fast man is about to
steal

A@mother good suggestion, made by Sec-
vetary Foster of the Giants, would call
ealy one foul strike on a bataman, It

has been argued that the rule
makers took too drastic a step when
they made two foul hits go as strikes.
One foul strike would about strike the
Proper balance.

Grimth's Experiment.

An interesting experiment will be tried
by Clark Griffith of the Washington
Senators next spring. Griff intends
using the player he regarded as his
leading 1916 outfield prospect in the
pitcher's box, while one of his most
Promising pitchers of a year ago will
start the season in charge of a regular

 

patrol in the outfield. The players
switched around will be Jamieson and
Sam Rice.

Four years ago Jamieson and Wallie
Schang were considered the star battery
of the Buffalo Internationals, In 1912
Jamieson won 66 per cent. of his games
with a club which did not break even.
Jamieson also was a great asset to his
chub as a pinch hitter. The Buffalo club
Deing raided of all its hitters during the
Federal League war, Jamieson was
shoved into the outfield to give the club
more batting strength, and in 1915 he
was one of the star batters of the league,
batting well above .300. He joined

Washington late that season and did
nicely.

Jamieson started the season as an
outfield regular, but ‘like Joe Judge,

another great smiter in Buffalo in 1915,
he found the America League pitchers
much

tougher. Jamieson finished the
geason on the bench, and there was
much surprise when Griffith sent him
in to pitch a few innings of a game

played on the Polo Grounds last fall,
Jamieson is a left hander.

In 1915 Sam Rice was one of the lead-
ing pitchers in the Virginia League, and
Griffith used him in a few games that
fall. arly last season he appeared in
the box scores mostly as a pinch hitter.

Misinterpretation of ring phraseology
is responsible In a large measure for the
(popular impression as to alleged bru-
| tality in the roped square.
| ‘The word “knockout” as applied to the
ending of many bouts has been the cause
jof much undeserved criticism of the
|glove game, those unfamiliar with the
‘subject being convinced that a boxer
must be beaten to insensibility in order
\to be classed as a victim of knockout.

A misleading pronouncement as to
what constitutes a knockout was recently
put forth as follows:

“Men have been rendered temporarily
hors de combat and have taken the
count, but they were not knocked out in
the real sense of the word.

“The solar plexus blow, such as the
one which Bob Fitzsimmons delivered to
Jim Corbett at Carson City, will knock
| the wind out of a man and render him
|so weak that he cannot stand up, but he
| will be conscious and hear every count
of the referee.

“A blow on the neck may close the
windpipe and send a boxer to the floor,
while a blow to the heart is weakening
to the same extent.

“But the real knockout blow that sends
a boxer into dreamland must land on
either side of the jaw near the point of
the chin, where a branch of the inferior
maxillary nerve crosses the jaw hone.
That is the scientific knockout punch.”

Exception Is the Rule.

The above is a popular misconception
of the manner in which a pugilist ts
stopped or knocked out. Its fatal defect

unconscious in order to be properly
knocked out.
As a matter of fact, unconsciousness

is the exception to the rule in knock-
outs. In ninety-nine cases out of
one hundred the letters “K. ©.” after
a boxer’'s name merety indicate that
he
seconds after a knockdown; that his
seconds throw in the sponge in token
of defeat; that the referee stopped the
bout in order to prevent further pun-
ishment to a beaten man. or that ‘the
boxer himself, deciding he had no
chance, gave up the battle.

The term knockout has no reference
'

re

whatever to unconsciousness, The origi-
nal phrase was “knocked out of time,”
meaning that the contestant failed to
continue the bout for one of the several
reasons given above.

Jim Corbett was knocked out at Car-
son, although conscious and open eyed.

Jack Johnson was by no means un-
conscious at Havana when knocked out
by Willard, for the negro’s knees were
drawn up and one gloved hand was
shading his eyes from the sun's glare.

John & Sullivan was not unconscious
from the blows of Corbett at New
Orleans, yet "We was counted out and
was therefore knocked out.

‘ Quick Recoveries,

In a very large majority of kpock-
outs the victims are dazed by a blow
to the jaw or stomach, but they re-
cover almost immediately. Instances
are numerous of boxers counted out by
the referee and then attempting to
continue the bout as soon as they re-
covered from temporary disability.

Under the humane rules of boxing a
contestant who cannot resume his ring
activities before the referee counts ten
is not permitted to resume at all and
must leave the ring.

In football and other forms of vigor-
ous sport a player, no matter if knocked
unconscious, is permitted to resume play
as soon as sufficiently revived, thus op-
ening the door to danger of collapse
from exertion following injury.

All of which goes to show that boxers
are safeguarded by the most humane
rules that apply to any branch of rough
contests and that much of the prejudice

Welling and the Title.

In making @ claim for the lightweight
title for his crack boxer, Joe Welling,
Jimmy Johnston says:

“Welling is the first top notch Ameri-
can lightweight who can fight at 133
pounds ringside, the legitimate limit, de-
fended by such famous champions of the
past as Jack McAuliffe, Kid Lavigne,
Frank Erne, Joe Gans, Jimmie Britt,
Battling Nelson and Ad Wolgast.

“Willie Ritchle went out of the light-
weight class when he met Freddie Welsh
at 136 pounds at 2 o'clock, which brought
them into the ring around 188 pounds,
or five pounds over the recognized limit.

“Freddie Welsh has proved tn all his
fights in this country since becoming
champion that he cannot make 138
pounds ringside and automatically for-
feits his title,

“Joe Gans, when champion, refused to

Nelson at 183 pounds ringside.”

I will cheerfully concede that Welling
is a formidable contender for the light- '
weight honors, and he may yet win the’
title, but he cannot get the champion- |
ship simply because he can make 133!
pounds ringside.

Precedent Rates.

Without any authoritative scale of!
weights in America, now or in the past, |
the question of weight has been decided |
by the champions, and precedent is the;
only guide, Out of the many times the-
lightweight title has changed hands or:
been defended, the weight was 133
pounds ringside on three occasions.
These were the bouts between Gans;
and Nelson, Nelson and Wolgast and
Wolgust and Ritchie. In all the others
the weight was above 133 pounds. Jack
McAuliffe, the first Queensberry cham-;
pion, in this most important bout (that
with Billy Myers) scaled 137% pounds;
when Lavigne won the world's title
from Burge the weight was 138 pounds;
when Lavigne lost to Erne the weight
was 135 pounds; when Erne lost to
Gans it was 136 pounds; when Ritchie
lost to Welsh the welght was 135
pounds, which is the official lightweight
limit of Europe,

Forfeiture of title on account of
| weight or any other cause has been
unknown since the Queensberry rules
went into effect. Therefore Britt never
got the lightweight title by forfeiture
and Welsh is still the world's light-
weight champion,

In substance 133 pounds ringside is
not the limit of the lightweight class
in America, and the figure in all other
boxing countries is officially 135.

As soon as the men got f the ring
Whitney walked over to Welling’s cor-

perfunctory exchange of good wishes.
Then he seized Welling’s hands and
began examining the tape and bandages,

| Welling, apparently disinterested, was
looking out over the audience, nodding
to friends and smiling at thelr shouts
of encouragement. When Whitney com-
pleted his examination and extended
his own hands Welling didn't turn,

“Don't you want to look at my
bandages?” asked Whitney.

“What's the use,” said Welling, turn-
ing away. “You'll need all you've got

SMITHSON’S MARK STANDS |

 

By SPRINTER. \

Ted Meredith and Binga Dismond, the
only two 47 2-5 second quarter milers in
captivity, with the exception of dear old

|

letic togs in the closet, will clash here
early next month in their first meeting
since the two great double furlongers
hung up the coveted "47 2-5."

The former son of Pennsylvania and
the colored cyclone from the University
of Chicago not only will meet in one race
but they probably will meagure strides in
two. Each of them has entered the Sub- |
urban Quarter, the classic ‘race which |
feature the annual games of the Knights |
of St. Antony in the Thirteenth Regiment ,
Armory on February 12. |

Meredith has entered the Buermeyer
Special, the scratch 500 yard race, which |
will give lustre to the annual indoor)
carnival of the New York A. C. fn the |
Twenty-second Regiment Armory on Feb-
ruary 10. Paul Pilgrim of the New York
A. C. last night said that he had written
Dismond and that the Chicagoan prac- |
tically has assured him his entry for the |
Buermeyer Special would be forthcom-;
ing.

Ted's a Classier Performance. |
Meredith and Dismond each were cred- |
ited with running a quarter mile in the |
remarkable time of 47 2-5 seconds last |
summer. Ted turned in his figures when |
he carried the silks of the University of
Pennsylvania to victory in the 440 yard
event at the I. C. A. A. A. A. champion-
ships in the Harvard stadium. Binga
hung up his “47 2-5" when he brought
the Maroon of Chicago University home
ahead of the field in the Conference
championships on Northwestern Univer- |
sity Field, Evanston, Tl. |
Experts considered Meredith's feat the |
classier, inasmuch as he stepped his
double furlong over a course measured
twelve inches from the border, while Dis-
mond raced over a course measured eigh-
teen inches from the border the same as
was the cinder path at Travers Island
where Maxey Long that memorable Sep- ;
tember afternoon back in 1990 hung up|
the original 47 2-5 performance Mere- |
dith ran several feet further than Long
or Dismond, the different method of track |
measurement being responsible for that.
The respective abilities of Meredith and
Desmond have been debated pro and con. |
All last summer it was the fond hope of |
the experts that Ted and Binga would be!
brought together. Summer waned and
no Meredith-Dismond duel. Fall came |
and went without the longed for athletic |
feast being served. Now that Dame For-
tune has placed it on the bill of fare no
wonder the athletic fans are jubilant.
The meeting between Meredith and
Dismond should be a corker in addition
to going a long way to settle the much
mooted superiority. The twin races will |
give Meredith a chance to settle an old
score. In the Suburban Quarter last)
winter Ted was forced to taste defeat |
at the hands, or rather flying feet, of |
Dismond. In the two coming races the |
great Ted will be out to get ‘‘aweet fo |
venge.’ The twin duels between the
great pair of double furlongers will "|

worth going miles to see.

In Memory of Smithson.

Just how wonderful a hurdler was
Forrest Smithson, the old Multnomah |
A. C. fence flier, can be shown by Bob|
Simpson's failure to equal Smithson's |
world’s 70 yard high hurdle record at
the monster meet of the Millrose A. A. ,
in Madison Square Garden last Wednes- |
day evening. Smithson captured both |
hurdle races, hanging up a new record |
over the low fences but only coming |
within a fifth of a second of Smithson's
figures in the dash over the tall tim-
bers,

 

70 yards with five flights of hurdles, |
The record, § 4-5 seconds, was made by |
Smithson in Madison Square Garden on ;
March 10, 1908. Stmpson, the greatest |
hurdler of all time, pushed to the limit
by worthy rivals only did 9 seconds last
Wednesday evening.

When Simpson hung up his world's
120 yard high hurdle record of 1428-5

Cushion Laurels Next
Wednesday.

CHAMPION IS FAVORITE

 

 

Charles A, MeCourt of Cleveland and
George W. Moore of New York will
engage in a struggle for the champion-
ship of the world at three cushion

which he lost later to Maxey Long, who long since hung his ath-| 4, 57, billiards at Doyle's next Wednes-
j day, Thursday and Friday.

They will
play the regulation championship quota
of 160 points, in three sessons of 50
points each. Stakes of $500, a purse
of $800 added by Doyle and the diamond
challenge trophy, donated by the Bruns-
wick-Balke-Collander Company, will de-
pend on the result, The winner will
have to defend the trophy against
Horace B, Lean of Chicago between
March 5 and 16.

Moore is the holder of the chammplon-
ship trophy, while McCourt is the cham-
pion of the Interstate Three Cushion
League Their cue work presents a
striking contrast. While Moore is a
careful, emooth and accurate executant
and an S!deal taotician, McCourt is a
bold, spectacular and dangerous oppo-
nent,
scoring first and safety last.

Moore was born in Youngstown, Ohio,
October 24, 1869. McCourt was born
in Allegheny city, now part of Pitts-
burg, August 19, 1877. Each developed
his skill in his native city. Moore had
no tutor. MeCourt, according to his
own statements, was a crude performer
at three cushions until Ora Morningstar
taught him the fine points of the game.

Frank Taberski of Schenectady, cham-
pion of continuous pocket billiards, has
accepted the challenge of Louis Kreuter
of New York, the seventeen-year-old
aspirant for the championship, and they
will play about February 22. Taberski
will have to name the date and place for
the match by February 12.

“IT went to San Diego, said he, ‘on

will locate there.

“Yamada and I have been on the road

successful. We played in hotels, bil-

tions appeared to give satisfaction.
