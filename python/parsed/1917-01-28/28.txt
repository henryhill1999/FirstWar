N board the French liner Chi-
cago when sho steamed from
New York upon her most re-

cent voyage Louis Mercanton was a
passenger leaving these shores without

having completed the important mo- |

tion picture deal which had brought
him'to America a short time
ously,

My. Mercanton, who is one of the

most distinguished picture directors in |

Hurope, is also prominently associ-
ated with the Eclipse producing corpo-

ration of Paris, It was for this com-

pany that Mr. Mercanton produced |

“Mothers of France,” the remarkable
drama of the trenches in which Mme.

Sarah Bernhardt acted the chief role |
at the French front, often perilously |

near the German lines and upon two
occasions actually under fire.

The American rights for this photo-
Play were brought over by Mr. Mar-
canton for disposal, but he went away
without concluding the negotiations.

“To tell the truth,” said the French !

director before sailing, “my departure

is somewhat in the nature of a re-|

treat.

had no idea of what was to happen.

My supposition was that I should ar- !
range the details in the ordinary course |

of business, sign the necessary con-
tracts and go my way in peace.

“I did not even get a chance to |

open negotiations. The process was |
*taken out of my hands,

“T had barely settled down in my |
hotel when the telephone began ring- |
ing and one after another of the
leading distributing companies asked
for appointments with a view to taking
over the picture,

calm -during all the time in tho |
trenches was to me an amazing ex- |
hibition of fortitude in a lady of her |
years, after a lifetime of luxury,
pleasant surroundings and at least the |
absence of physical peril.

“When I Jeft Paris the completed
‘Mothers of France' was about to be
shown for the first time, as a great
national event, in the Trocadero, |
|wnien seats 7,000 persons. The Presl- |
dent of the Republic and the heads of
the civil and military departments |
were to be present, and the receipts |
| were destined for the french Wound-
ed Fund. A similar representation |
is shortly to be given in London tn |
the presence of King George and the.
| Government chiefs.”

Importance of a Part in Reality |
“Small” in Words, i
The biggest “bit” that has fallen to/|
the lot of any actor on Broadway this
season is that of Lord Times in the
ballroom scene of Sir J. M. Barrie's “A
Kiss for Cinderella,” in which Maude |
Adams is now appearing at thé Empire
Theatre. Lord Times typifies the in- |
vincible power of publicity in modern |
times, and while the role is conceived |
by many to be Barrie’s good humored |
| patirical shaft at Lord Northcliffe and |
“The Thunderer” there is nevertheless |
an essence of truth in the influence ,
;which this character is pictured as |
having at the ball, the only personage,
by the way, who appears in modern |
evening clothes.

“Briefly the story of ‘Mothers of
France’ is woven about a woman, the
wife of a provincial squire, whose
| husband dina son are in the fighting
| liné and who for her patriotic art |
;in the great struggle volunteérs for
service in the Red Cross, becoming
at matron In a hospital at Rheims, at
| the front. The conflict deprives her
| of husband and son. Both expire from
their wounds while she, having been

informed of their injurtes, is fran-
tically searching for them in the}
trenches.

“The love story concerns the daugh-

ter of a neighbor who engages her-
self to a suitor on the eve of his de-|
parture for the battlefleid, only to
find that she is really in love with an-
other. The man to whom she is be-
trothed is blinded by a fragment of
| shell, realizes the hopelessness of the
future and offers to set his flancee
| free, but she ces duty above heart
| anguish ana uses her liberty. He
is very happy over this act of loyalty,
but by accident learns of her real feel-
| ings and insists not only upon being
released but bringing the lovers to-
gether.
; “It is a story of selfrssacrifice and
nobility of character against the grim)
| background of war—an exalted poem |
jof the sereen.’

Throughout the making of the pie: |
lture Mme. Bernhardt was accom-
| panied by Mr. Mereanton, with whom |

the idea originated and who actively |
|superintended each step of its prog- |
ress, Describing his experiences, he |
| continued: !
| “After securing the consent of Mme. |
Bernhardt, whom T had known very |
well for a number of years, it was
eusy to enlist the interest of Mr. |
Nichepin, who most assuredly would!
not have entertained the thought of!

rives its comic value from the spoken
lines it fs doubtful if the part has its
equal on the modern stage for brevity
/and fun,

So salienten figure is Lord Times in}
this dream ball that few auditors real- |
ize the length of the role, just six!
words and 4 clearing of the throat. But
so effectively do these ‘six words and
cough punctuat#@the biggest situations
of the scene that the character looms |
up Ike a glant among lesser guests at
court.

As to the six words:

Lord Times, to Cinderella's fevered
imagination, is a very distinguished
person possessing power little short of
, that held by the King himself. The
rlavey's ideas on this subject have been
formed as a result of having heard the
artist for whom she worked frequently
{announce his intention of writing to
the Times about all sorts of abuses, |
about abstruse questions of art, war-
|farg and what not. Therefore, when
the King is in the midst of a harangue

ich bids fair to delay the selection
of a mate for the crown prince, what
more natural than that Lord Times
should rise from his gold chair, oppo-
site the throne, stride across the ball- |
room and to the somewhat petulant |
query of the King reply, “Less talk.”
| Whereupon the King subsides with |
| “Certainly.” |

The remainipg four words alloted to
Lord Times are spoken when the
Crown Prince objects to Cinderella's
request that “the little glass thing”
(the “thermo-mometer’”) be put in the |
Prince’s mouth to make sure that he |
is good, just as the beauties, includ. |
ing Cinderella, have been tested.,
The King and Queen are sustaining the
Prince in his objection to the test
when Lord Times again rises calmly,
strides*over to the excited group and |
with quiet superiority announces:

“It mftst be done.”
| All yield, but the King adds “In the
good old threepenny days, sonny, but |
not now,” (meaning, of course, that |

The cough, which is the remaining
audible part of this remarkable acting

bit, comes at the height of the revelry
when refreshments, in the shape of
ice cream cones, are being served from
the golden hokey-pokey eart. The
King commands: “Hold'on! None
touches until one royal lick has been
us four,” (meaning himself,
the Queen, the Prince and Cinderella,
now a twide), but a cough from Lord
Times causes the royal one to amend
his remarks hastily to “FIVE.”

The actor whose dignity, suavity and
fine discretion make this role count for
so much with ita pungent eaatire is
Robert Peyton Curter, who has played
numerous imporant roles with Miss
Adams in past seasons in "The Little
“What Every Woman

Knows,” “Deter Pan” and “The Legend
