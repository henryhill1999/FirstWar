JAPAN'S PRIZE IN THE GREAT WAR, GERMANY'S CHINESE COLONIES < |

 

View of Tsing-Tao from the wireless
‘station, showing the harbor and Kiaochow
Bay.

Typical business street, once bustling but since the Jap-
anese occupation almost deserted, due to cessation of German
commerce.

In the resi-
dence quarter
of Tsing-Tao.
The well paved
streets, electric
lights, terraced
' grounds and
tiled roofs, all
of most mod-

ern design,
make the city
an ideal home.
