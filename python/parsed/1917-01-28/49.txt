Picture

By HARRY ESTY DOUNCE. |

+ HIS is the story of the career of |
a young painter and etcher,!
Salvatore Antonio Guarino |

who at 30 has three several times es- |

tablished himself in a fair way to suc-'
ceed, as the world counts success, the
last times after such a discouragement

as must have flattened once for-all a

man of no ord’nary mettle.

There is no intention to herald Mr.

Guarimo as a genius of the first magni- |

tude. But inasmuch as Mr. Guarino in |

his early twenties attracted the favor-
able attention of no less a judge of be-
ginners’ work than William M. Chase
and within seven yeors after he had all
the evidences of a national reputation
assured in Italy and now, with most of
his stock in trade at the bottom &f the |
sea, he is again asserting himself in|
New York and winning golden opmions
of his promise in high quarters, the
writer thinks him a proper exhibit of
the staying powers of genius through
adversity. '

Mr. Guarino is an American citizen,
born of Italian parentage. He was!
precocious, as so many young Latins
are. At the Adelphi College in Brook-
lyn, under Prof. Whittaker, he showed
promise, as so mamy students do. They
all paint well in the schools; mast of
them vanish later. Guarino seems to
have shown a little more promise than}
the rule. He took a number of medals.

At that stage of the game, too early
for a trustworthy individuality, the
ambitious and_= sensitive youngster
paints or writes or composes like the}
master he feels most keenly. Guarino’s |

candles were burned before Whistler's , °

eltar. He did pretty tricks, simple, |
flat, decorative, and called them “har-
monies” and “arrangements.” He in-
vented a Japanesque signature after!

mergins of his etchings. An older head
