OOF! Make way for me, the
only dog chauffeur in Amer-
ica, in the world! Yes, I,
Rex Bowser Weed of Poughkeepsie,
WN. Y¥., alone and unassisted drove a
high powered touring car down Fifth
venue one day last week, to the won-
@er and admiration of all who saw.
Oh, well, maybe my friend and mas-
ter, Mr. Weed—you know the Weed
woys, automobile dealers in Pough-
fkeepsie—maybe he did ride by my side
and touch the foot gear now and then
with the toe of his boot. Pity my hind
Jegs aren't long enough to reach that

* foot gear, else I'd be the whole thing.

Rut I did look the whole thing, sitting
up there in my goggles and chauffeur's
cap, with my front paws dexteriously

@nd I went the length of the avenue
with never a collision nor an injury
to my car. Two or three! other cam
got their wind shields broken, but that |
was because their chauffeurs were so
®usy rubdbering at me that they forgot
their own jobs and ran into lamp posts
the lubbers!

But allow me to introduce myself
properly. I am the junior partner of
Weed Bros., automobile dealers up- |

that was required of me as a pup was

would know we-weren't the fussy kind
and generally make myself agreeable.

But I was always, if I do say it, a}
@og of an inquiring turn of mind, and
ZI early decided that mem, though un-
questionably inferior to us dogs in
apme ways, are ingenious. They are
worth studying. I began to interest |
myself in my master’s business, to ride |
@own with him im the morning in hi:
far, to study the way he ran it, and
when I saw how simple it was I just
took the whee! out of his paws one day
and said, “Let Rex do it,” or barks to
that effect.

ell, he’s a sensible man; never in-
terfered with the development of my
intelligence—and right here let me

‘Well, from that time on I was
often behind the wheel. I was only
eighteen months old when I first be-
gan to chauffeur, but mature for my

for frisking around with other dogs.
I often hear my master boast that I'm
always on the lookout to see what I

- Bo ever since the day I took the
‘wheel in my paws, which was eighteen
‘months ago, as I'm three years old at
the present date, I have had a regular
job with the firm, demonstrating au-
tomobiles. All my master has to say
is, “Why, a child can run this car. A
chila? A dog can do it. See Rex!”
And then he jumps out and I sit there
with my paws turning the wheel, and |
the car rolls along—well, maybe the}
customer isn't awed! Oh, Rex Bowser
‘Weed earns his dog biscuit all right!

If I do say it, there isn’t a citizen in
Poughkeepsie better known than I, |
Minute I show myself on the street, |
it’s “Hello, Rex!” here, ahd “Hey, old
boy!” and I simply have to wag my |
tall off doing the polite.

And there’s been more things about
me in the newspapers—say, My mas-
ter has a scrapbook filled with clip-
pings about how I ran cars at county
faire, and so on. And I've been pho-
tographed till you'd think I would be
tired of it, but some way I still like to
see a camera pointed at me, and don't
I sit up straight and stiff in my cap
and goggles—for that’s the Way I am

have been in the movies, too—oh, dear,

 

Penny thing is, I'm not a pedigreed
dog. I'm a collie, a very good sort of
collte, but I make no claim to family.
Now and then my master says he
guesses he must look up the lady who
gave me to him when I was a weentsle
lUttle pup, and ask her who my mother
and father were, and my grandparents
and so on, for he is sure there must
be blood in me. But I don't care.
Course, I'd like to see my parents
and share my bones and dog biscuit
with them if they are in need, but I
don’t care what kennels they came
from, or whether it was a kennel or
an alley, for thaf metter. Way I look

Seeking Fame in New York

If He Didn't Find It He at Least

By ROY K. MOULTON.
New Yor«, January 27.
EAR BUDDY—Poverty is no

modern philosophers says, "it |

age to keep up ao fair batting average
of respectability. We receive invita-
tions to all the swell society events
which are given for the benefit of
charity when it is desirable to raise
the largest possible amount of money
from the ticket sale.

‘We are invited to everything that)
everybody is invited to, if you catch
i my drift.

And. to keep up our tone in the}
neighborhood we hang our clothes on
a line down in the basement and
never out in the back yard. Also we
have an egg for breakfast every
Easter.
| An egg is right. We scramble the
egg and serve it to all four members
of our family. I’m not trying to put
‘anything over on you, Buddy, just be-
| cause T am here in New York and you
afte back home there in the livery
stable.

Ordinarily money means very little
to me. Here in New York it means
|nothingatall. If it is true that money |
| talks, the cat haw stolen its tongue. |
But I believe every young man
| should be ambitious. The future hokis |
;a lot for every young man, even if it,
is only @ lot out in Woodlawn.

Some time ago I confided in our
coal dealer back home the fact that I
desired to become famous. I knew Ij
| could never become rich, but I wanted |
to become something so that when my |
great-grandsons began looking up the |
family history for the purpose of join-
| ing the Sons of the American Revolu-
|tion they would not find a yawning
| hiatus in the early years of the twen-
| tieth century.

When he is not dealing in coal my,
friend the coal dealer is quite a
| likable person. He advised me to
| gather my assets and come to New|
| York for the fame. He said: |

“That guy who spun the yarn about
the party manufacturing mousetraps |
out in the impenetrable forest and the |
mob beating a path to his door was!
all wrong. That is one of our most
| insidious myths.” That was quite a|
mouthful for a coal dealer to say, and}

I believed him.

| He said all the fame in New York |
; had not been used up. A little re-|
| mainad. Enough, in fact, to satisfy a!
| moderately amDitious person like my-
| self who couldn't hope to accomplish
;much anyhow.

“You may not find the fame chin
deep,” he said. “You may not have to
swim to keep from drowning in it. It
| may not be even knee deep and it may |
not even dampen the soles of your feet,
but there is some there, take it from
me.”

So I set out to flag fame in New
York with a shoestring. |

A shoestring is a twenty dollar bill}
‘wrapped carefully around a mess of |
}ones and twos and fastened with a/
‘rubber band. A rubber band is @ very |
| accommodating thing. It is automatic. |
;It thrinks coincidentally with the
| shrinking of the roll, It will fit around |
$27 or $27,000.

No matter how small the roll may |
become the rubber band remains faith- |
ful, performing the duties of its office |
| with a loyalty which is quite remark-
able. Its duties may become less and
|less exacting and its responsibilities
‘may shrivel to a minimum, but it re-
j;mains on the job to the end, like the

home until the roof caved in and the
chimney crumbled.

I wag told that I could buy many
things cheaper in New York than
elsewhere. I found this to be true. I
had hardly landed when I ran across
a lady’s genuine Hudson seal coat
which I could have annexed for $240,
and that was dirt cheap. The coat
was really worth at least $250 of any-
body’s money. The same day a man
offered me a diamond ring for $800
which easily was worth $1,000, It has
so happened, unfortunately, that all
the things that have heen cheaper in
New York than elsewhere have been
things which I have not needed to
complete my happiness.

When I have tried to possess my-
self of essentials I have found them
to be qpite as far beyond my reach
as they have been in other parts of the
country. I might mention, for ex-
ample, the item of food. I have not
yet reached the state where I can go
without this item for more than two
or three days at a time, but with long
practice T may. |

Food is one of the real problems
when one is wigwagging fame with
a shoestring.

In New York a person can go to
the theatre, ride in the Fifth avenue
bus and do a thousand other pleasant
albeit unnecessary things without
much high financing. But when it
comes to the plebeian and unregen-
erate custom of eating, we find a task
which can be accomplished success-
fully only by the munition millionaires
or members of the Astor and Vander-
bilt families.

Those are twé habits which you must
overcome. They are insidious and te-
nacious, [ know, but omce you have
strangled them and learned to go with-

out room and board you have got the

problem solved.
After 1 had been here two weeks I

| felt of my bank roll and was impressed

with the fact that there really was @
paper famine.

It had not been brought home to me
so forcibly before, I stood looking ata
$9,000 brooch im Tiffany's show case
when it suddenly dawned upon me

{that I should be about the business |
which had brought me to New York. |

I should hustle and get the fame.

When a person starts out to become
famous he must bid farewell to senti-
ment and illusion. He must be abso-
lutely cold blooded about it. To him
romance is mix. To him Romeo must
be an ordinary porch climber and
Portia an ordinary suffragette.

1 wasn't at all particular where 1
grabbed off the fame. My ambitions
were pliable and fitted in almost any-
where.

I was even willing to become a Rus-
sian dancer or to change my name to
Harold Hairoil and become @ romantic
young actor in the celluloid drama at
$1,200 a week. Being too particular
