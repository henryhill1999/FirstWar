Latest Silver Expression in Touring Car. |

Manager Le Porin of the Rogers Mo-
4 tors Corporation, the Eastern distribu-
ters of the Davis automobile, is en-
thusiastic over the attention this smart
i car is attracting.

“We lave a genuine winner in the
Davis car,” said Manager Le Porin yes-
terday. “TI think that it is going to be
in great demand, Our Springfield sedan
model is one of the most attractive cars
I know of. It is a car of much dig-
nity. The’ appointments are abso-
lutely luxurious, while the beautiful fin-
ish of the car is instantly apparent. It
is a seven passenger car of standard
units. Its powerful s’x cylinder motor
assures exceptional smoothness and
awiftness.

“Among our other popular models are
, the club roadster and touring car. The
; long, sweeping lines of these care give
them an extremely graceful appearance,

“Yes, we look forward to a very suc-
j cessful year for the Davis car in this
tb territory.”
