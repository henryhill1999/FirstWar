had the pleasure of recelying ua brier
call from him, It was such a very
larief call that afterward L wondered if
it had been a pleasure to Fhelps. I
seemed to catch an expression in his
cyes as I was forcibly cjecting him
from my sitting room at the end of |
a fifteen minute conversation that
seemed to indicate that he felt that the +
materializing grind of the great city
had appreciably hardened his former
friend. Possibly it had, Certainly 1}
wag compelled to put the friend whom |
1 had not seen for ten years out of my !
rooms after a quarter of an hour's call,

Critics of art upon metropolitan |
journals dispense with friends. It is
not alone that they cannot have
friends among the artists with whom
their lives are bound—*here are subtle |
but powerful reasons why critics and |
artists cannot be friends that need not
be analyzed here—but friendship in) =
general is denied to them too. The!
task of seeing about thirty exhibitions
of paintings a week, with the subse-
quent weighing and measuring of them
up for the public, uses up all the emo-
tion of which they are capable and
for them the private life is restricted
to several hours of fitful sleep per
diem, Moreover, there is one awful)
day each week when even this slight
respite is a matter o* uncertainty,
when the weather is terribly awry,
inanimate things curse audibly, and,
yes, even the tooting of Gabriel's horn
can be heard by the sensitite critic
sounding above the chaos of the art
world. It is the fa‘al day of “going to
press.” Figurez-vous, Bill, it was upon
such a day Phelps called.

Using one hand to shake his, with
the other I grasped my watch.

“We shall have to talk fast,” I said,
“Iam busy, I am terribly glad to see
you, but I can give you only fifteen
minutes.”

Phelps smiled, thinking it a joke, but
taking his tempo from me he too
talked fast. He told me much. He
told me he was married and had a
family. In ten years, of course, so
much may happen. He told me a
great deal about you. He had come up
to town, he said, to see the Cezanne
exhibition at Montross’s, attracted by
the accounts of this artist that he had
rea@ in THe Sun. That was exactly
like the old Phelps, or perhaps I
should say the young Phelps, to jump
for Cezanne like that. Vhelps always
wag alive to the genuine. But sud-
denly I cut him short.

“The fifteen minutes are up. Don't
laugh, I mean it. The press, like the
railway train, starts on time. I'm
sorry, but you must go. It's been a
great pleasure seeing you after all
these years—but, good-by.” and
through the chink of the closing door
I saw the expression in Phelps’a eyes
already spoken of.

You may not know that I still guard |
two landscapes in pastel that you gave
me years ago in exchange for a gilt
framed mirror or something of the
sort, and that I take great pleasure in
them. They are the work of a stu-
dent, perhaps a little rough and un-
trained, but they are honest and frank, |
and so I much prefer them to the pro- |

Elliot Clark’s Appreciation |
of Alexander Wyant

Eliiet Clark's appreciation of the
;Work of Alexander Wyant has been
| printed by Frederic FPairehild Sherman
in the form and style in which Kenyon
Cox's “Winslow Homer” and Elliott
Daingerfield’s “George Inness” have
;appeared, and that is to say the vol-
jume is handsome as good types,
handmade paper and carefully printed
illustrations can make it,

“Appreciation” is the correct word
for Mr. Clark's ‘essay, for it bears on)
every page the evidence that the}
| writer finds his painter peculiarly sym-
{pathetic, Tle never takes issue with
jhim at any point. The writing is like
;a quiet accompaniment to the pictures, |
but so subdued that the accompanist |
sometimes ultogether escapes from the
students’ attention,

It does not pretend to be constructive |
lwriting. There are no passages in it!
; that throw lightninglike illumination |
; upon pictures that we know, There is |
nothing comparable to Walter Pater’s |
description of the famous “Mona Lisa,” |
but then there is nothing anywhere in
, critical literature to compare with that |
bit of pure inspiration, Mr. Clark |
; speaks of Wyant's relation to his time,

as

!himself, against whieh to place Wyant |
jthe artist. Mr, Clark writes, in fact,)
| not as a fellow artist, not as one who |
|felt himself as mighty in the use of |
words as a painter does with a brush, |
;but rather in the spirit of one who!
jcompiles a catalogue, . |
| Mr, Clark likes all of Wyant, sqme |
}more than others, but he likes them)
Jall, It is not very exciting to read, but

painter, the restraint which he puts |

young man,’ Wyant replied, ‘I think
we had better go into partnership. I
can start them all right, but I have a
great deal of trouble in
them.’"

These are scarcely the sort of anec-
dotes with which one may round out
the corners of a great biography.

Mr. Clark uses the “Karly Morning”

for his frontispiece and puts it at the
top in his list of descriptions. He says:
“It is one of the great landscapes of
the nineteenth century, worthy to
rank with the best work of the Bar-
bizon masters, the tradition of which
it so nobly and rightly continues, The
thought, the sentiment, the feeling of
the artist has been expressed in a
most delicate but compelling manner.
The eternal brooding and mystery of
nature, silence, peace and
speak in illusive but significant lan-
guage. There is no indication of the
presence of man, yet the tree stands
| as a solemn, brooding soul, looking out |
upon time and eternity. It is not
merely the ocular vision which the
painter has portrayed, it is not alone
the beauty of nature with which he
has been inspired, it is that inner com-
| munion and reflection of man, the pen-
sive dreamer, who searches the soul
for the inner meaning and talks in his
own language with the maker of all
things,”

The above is a fair enough illustra-

tion of Mr, Clarke's interpretive power.
He is “appreciative,” it is apparent,
{but not very stylistic. Place the pas-
sage beside extracts from the crystal-
line English of Pater or the French of
| De Stendhal and the candid reader will
be more than ever convinced that all !
comparisons are odious,

 

 

Art of the French
Soldiers on View

THE Scn’s Paris correspondent has
been visiting the Salon des Armees in
{the Tennis Court, Tuileries Gardens,
which he says is now generally called
the Salon des Poilus. The Salon des
'Armees has taken the place of the
Grand Palais for exhibitions now that
that building has become a _ hospital.
He writes:

‘The first thing
entering the salon

that strikes one on
is that there are no
big pictures. Every work has been
executed at the real front, including,
of course, the second lines and repose
lines, so that a big canvas was an}
impossibility. No frequenter of the
old salons regrets the absence of the |
huge works that were so common
there. The general character of the
sketches and pictures shown may be,
‘described as serious but not sad, the
humorous exists and of excellent qual-
ity, but grouped together the light |
hearted pictures only occupy a small!
room, and rather convey the idea that!
they had been made to amuse the peo-
ple of the rear rather than for those
at the front

“M. Benedite, whose position at the
museum of modern art keeps him in

touch with all the schools and their
students, said that the vast majority
of the names were unknown to him
many. he thought, had turned to art
when at the front as a relief and had
tound that they had powers of ex-
pression that they had not been aware
of before.

Notes and Activities
of the World of Art

Marsden Hartley has evoluted into
sporting work. He has been doing
yachting pictures, They are very dif-
ferent from anything that the commo-
dore of the New York Yacht Club
owns. [ haven't seen the commodore's
collection, but I know he has nothing
like Marsden's newest things. There
are nothing like Marsden’'s things any-
where in the world, except the things
and they are all caged
for the present in the tiny galleries of
the Photo-Secession.

I forgot to make notes while under
the thrall of the various pictures in
the collection, and now at this dis-
tance I have a feeling fhat all the
yachting impressions were obtained
from one yacht. It is quite true,
you know, that you may obtain many

impressions from a single cruise in
one small sailboat, especially if the

weather be variable, The general im-
pression that Marsden obtained, or at
least the general impression that Mars-
den gives, is that there was something
awfully compact somewhere and that
it was weighty and solid and that you
wanted it all for yourself with lots of
air around it. There is always all the

air that there is around Marsden's
yachts. One of the yachts is named
Trixie. Bt I think it was always the

same Yacht.

At the exhibition of painting held
by the Macdowell Club, 108 West
Fifty-fifth street, the principal pictures
are these:

Clara Mamre Norton has a portrait
of Capt, Charles A, Adams, U. 8. N.,
that is an unusual study in red, white
and blue.

Isabel Vernon Cook's “Suffrage Pa-
