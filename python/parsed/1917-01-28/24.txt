acer are things to
glory in if the possessor of
them keepe wideawake and
growing.

It is something to be proud
of if one can manage to keep
young while growing older.

* * *

This Store hasalready lived
an average human life-time.
It is now celebrating its 52d
Birthday.

Yet it is more youthful,
more “up and doing” than
ever in its career.

It is giving better service—

It is doing a larger busi-
fess —

—than at any time in its
history.

It is getting to be more and

emore of a Metropolitan—

even a National—Store.

Yet at the same time it
conserves its appeal to its
first and best friends—the
people of Brooklyn.

For The Store Accommo-
dating is primarily, and al-
ways will be, a Brooklyn In-
stitution, intimately involved
with the prosperity, growth
and welfare of this Borough.

* * *
But what of its home town
—Brooklyn?

All’s well, is the reply.

It is the Home Borough
of the City of New York.
It can welcome in its gener-
ous open spaces all the people
tor whom the crowded con-
fines of .Manhattan and the
Bronx have grown irksome
and who want fresh air, sun-
light, health—and low rents.

It provides quick trans-
portation to the business
heart of the City and home
again—minutes instead of
hours in many cases—and
this in a transition period of
transit that is constantly
getting better.

.cause most helpful way to
