DUKE OF SAXE-COBURG-GOTHA,
SON OF THE DUCHESS OF ALBANY.

How the great war has brought two tragedies
into the royal family of England was brought to
acute memory the other day in London when the
Duchess of Albany sold her pearls. The aunt of
King George is in dire want—for royalty—and
sold the Queen Victoria heirloom. Her son-in-
law, Prince Alexander of Teck, is fighting for the
British, but to add to the family troubles the son
of the Duchess, the Duke of Saxe-Coburg-Gothsa
is a German officer and takes every chance to
gloat publicly over British defeats.
