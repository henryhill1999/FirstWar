Birds feed upon all kinds of in- |
bey insects, and it is important |
| therefore that we protect them and!
engourage them to multiply. Birds |
lead active lives and. require much!
food., A single bird often eats more |
than 100 insects at a meal, and some- |
times consumes several thousand |
small insects. On a 200 acre farm in
North Carolina, where scientists kept |
Ja careful record, birds destroyed more |
than a million greenbugs or wheat |
aphids daily. (There are many  lo- |
calities where the birds have saved |

Throughout the country there are a}
cungerous lot of false prophets, men!

WESTERN NEW YORK HORT]I- |

CULTURAL SOCIETY.

 

A Report of Ita Sixty-second An-
nual Mecting.

By CHARLES A. GREEN.

The sixty-second annual meeting of | 8TOWers here and ‘elsewhere should be |

this society was held at Rochester, N.
Y., January 24, 25 and 26. The ab-

sence of the late president, William C. |

Barry, was greatly deplored. He had
served as president for twenty-seven
consecutive years. He was a man of
Notable ability and’ breadth of view.
Much of the success of this veteran as-
sociation is owing to the efforts of Mr.
Barry. Seth J. T. Bush, first vice-
president, acted as temporayy chair-
man. =

Suggestions were made favoring the
merging of the New York State Fruit
Growers with this society. There
seems to be no necessity for two so-
cieties engaged in the same work.

Vice-President Bush {n_ his” address
alluded to the fact that this associa-
tion is the champion of every measure
of law and every honest effort to ele-
vate and dignify the business of—its
members,

“We can point with pride to the ac-
complishments of the past and rejoice
in the knowledge of generations that
have been benefited, but it is to the
future we must turn and, jealous and
proud of the record that has been
made and the high {deals and purposes
that have been cherished and main-

tained, go fprward with courage and|ters’ under the rough bark of apple, | son River fruit district, who conducted | both are of good quality,

determination to make the future more
helpful, more glorious than the past.

“Agriculture and horticulture are
the rocks upon which all true prosper-
ity rests, the very foundation of this
nation or any nation. The great war
that is raging in Europe has demon-
strated this more pointedly than it was
ever demonstrated before.

“A nation can only exist so long as
its agriculture flourishes and its pro-
ductiveness is maintained, and in the
great battles for supremacy among the
nations in time of peace gs well as in
time of war it is upon the man behind
the plough and the spray nozzle, as
much as to his brother behind the
gun, that success and national glory
depend,

“I am proud to say that the day
when life on.the farm was looked upon
as a hardship and misfortune and the
title of farmer one of reproach has
passed and that at last the world has
come to realize that the man who cul-
tivatea the soll and produces that
with which to nourish and sustain
mankind, living and working’ in, touch
with nature and nature's God, in
his heart the music of unseen har-
monies and in his mind and soul the

The New York apple grading law,
| Which has recently been decided in the
courts as non-operative, was discussed.
The restrictions of the law cannot be
' enforced.
| The peach grading law Waa al# dis-
cussed after having been read in full
| by Secretary Hall. It attempts to re-
| Strict the grading, packing and label-
ling of peaches in an arbitrary man-
ner, exacting severe penalties.
| <A freight rate on peaches from this
|the greatest peach growing section of
the world was spoken of. Notable
| Success was secured the past season in
jshipping peaches, far higher prites
having been secured than in previous
;years owing to more systematic ship-
ment and a better knowledge of the
; demands of the various markets and
daily reports as to what localities were
}most desirable for those who were
selling their large crops of this beauti-
ful fruit. The Federal bureau of mar-
kets has’ been of great help the past
season, though conducted with consid-
erable expense.

Attention wae called to the National

 

|} Apple Growers Association, organized |

_last summer at St. Louls, Mo. It was
{claimed that this association would be
a great help to apple growers, and

| urged to join this helpful association.
; One of its aims is to supply full, com-
plete and accurate statistics covering
} crop conditions in all sections of the
;}country and a full report of market
| conditions at home and abroad, and to
strive for uniformity in State laws af-
| fecting the grading, packing and sell-
_ing of apples,
| T. A. Drake, a fr grower of this
j city, gave his experience in growing
dwarf pears, The Duchess pear as a
{dwarf has been a profitable variety
tone him, The Duchess, he says, does
not blight in his orchards. He said
;that cold storage had somewhat
| changed the conditions of pear grow-
jing. Since the Bartlett can be kept so
| iong in cold storage there was Jess de-
| mand for the Duchess, which is a later
! variety.
! The Destractive Pear Psyla,

This insect is doing much injury in
| certain sections of the country,
|Green's Fruit Farms we are not
j troubled with this insect. Its pres-
ence can be detected by drops of a
honeylike substance on the leaves of
the pear tree and on the skin of the

pears, making the pears sticky and re- |

ducing the size of the pears. It win-
peach, pear or other trees and in the
crevices of boards, rails and _ posts.
When in hiding it is reached with dif-
ficulty. It comes out of its hiding
places on warm days late in the fall.
If the trees are sprayed when they
hus make their appearance many of
hem can be destroyed. Whale oil
soap was spoken of as an insecticide
for the pear psylla, also lime and sul-
vhur solution. as
Pear orchards at Hilton, N. Y., were
watched, by specialists under employ-
ment of the State and the owners were
instructed to suray in May at just the
time when the blossoms are opening.
This spray if carefully applied from
all directions, from the east side, from
the west side, from the north side and
the south side, destroys not only many
| insects but many of the eggs of the
| pear paylla,
| Wilbur Chase reported his success
with treatment of the pear psylla, as
above described, during the past sea-
son, thus securing 4 good crop of
pears, whereas the previous year his
pear crop was seriously injured. He
used tobacco soap and sprayed five
times in one season. On May 8 he ap-
plied bordeaux mixture, which held the

{about three acres, mostly Kieffer pears,

, With some Bartletts, Jt was found that |

the Kieffer pear is not so seriously af-

| fected by the pear peylla as other va-
|rieties. The experts claimed that
bout May 5 for this section was the
| best time to spray for pear psylla, the
next time being the warm days in late
| fall.
{in apple orchards it is necessary that
| those near by should be eprayed at the
same time that the pear trees are
sprayed, showing the necessity of con-
certed action in the war against de-
| structive insects.

| Expertence With Dust Spray.

| Prof. V. B. Stewart gave the latest
; ©xperience with dust spray as an in-
| i poe

| Secticide as compared with liquid
| sprays. The dust must be ground ex-
{ ceedingly fine. If not so the particles
; of dust roll off from the leaves with-
; Out having any effect. In many in-
| stances, especially with nursery stock
| srowing in rows only “813 feet apart,
| dust spray Was more easily applied

than liquid sprays, covering four rows ;

;at a time, and was equally effective.
| Ile had more to say about dust sprays
in nursery rows than in orchards. One
| difficulty with all sprays is the lability
|to be washed off by drenching rains.
One thing in favor of the bordeaux
| mixture is that it adheres to the leaves
for a long time. Many will suspect
that any form of dust will be more
|} easily removed by rains than a liquid
{spray like the bordeaux mixture. An-
‘other objection to dust sprays is that
| fruit growers generally have ma-
}chinery for liquid sprays and an ap-
{plication of dust sprays would re-
‘quire a further investment in dust
; spray machinery. A tractor is made
| which runs between rows of nursery
| trees, dust spraying four rows at once.
Prof. Stewart uses for a dust spray
| lime-sulphur one to fifty. He tried a
| spray of one to sixty, which was not
!so effective. He has used the dust
!spray on cherry tree fungus and on
| fungous attacks on the horse chestnut
land on the currant, quince and plum.
| All of these forms of fungus cause the
i lenves to become spotted or turn yel-
low and drop prematurely in late sum-
|mer, stopping growth. He has found

 

| which is a serious drawback to rose
| growers.
The Question Box Opened,
After the reading set several impor-
portant papers the question box was
opened by Mr. Van Buren of the Hud-

| this department with rare skill.

Question 8—What variety can best
be grafted on the Ben Davis apple? A
member recommended the Baldwin,
while others thought that Ben Davis
was a profitable variety and in most
instances should not be regrafted to
j}another variety, claiming that it was
found valuable for a baking apple as
well as for many other purposes and
was salable on account of its color and
freedom from blemishes and on ac-
count of its large yields of fruit.
Others thought it was too low in qual-
ity, discouraging those who purchased
and consumed it,

Question 9—Are many grading ma-
chines used by members of this as-
| sociation? A show of hands was asked
| for, indicating that many were using
apple graders, but there were many
who were grading by: hand. All the
;apple grading machine does is to grade
the size. The machine cannot sort out
defective applies; therefore after the
apples have been run through the ap-
ple grader they must be sorted by
hand for defects, such as fungus,
bruises, worm holes or a lack of color.

others found it cost them 22 cents,
others 20 cents. Several members

aaa

claimed that grading machines were
;not helpful. The grading machines
| grade into four sizés,

Oranges are almost always graded
by machine, but with less difficulty
| than with apples, owing to the more
{regular circular form of oranges.
Sore varieties of apples are long,
others round in shape, ,which affects
| their passage through a grading ma-
chine.

Question 15—Which is the best time
| to plough an orchard? There was a
| division of opinion on this subject.
{One member advised ploughing when-
| ever he could spare the time in spring
or fall. Others preferred to wait until
spring, since they could get over the
sround more easily before it was
ploughed than after. Where the
| ground was inclined to be heavy, if
ploughed in the fall the land would
be almost as hard as ever in April
or May. By ploughing in the fall
many insects and many fungus spores
| could be buried and destroyed. What-
lever the time of ploughing, only shal-
low ploughing should be given. If
| ploughing was deferred until spring
it was found important that it be
| done early since the feeding roots of
the trees begin growth early and are
destroyed if the spring ploughing is
done late.
chard should be given when the soll
is wet and sticky.
as May 15 might be injurious in de-
stroying many feeding roots of the
japple orchard.
| Question 7

7—Can cow peas and soy
(beans be grown with profit in our or-
‘chards at the north? They are suc-
,cessfflly grown in Delaware and other
j midway southern districts, but they
jare extremely sensitive to cold, are
leasily destroyed by* frost and will not
flourish under the shade of apple trees;
| therefore there are objections tp their
| being ueed as u cover crop in the
‘north, and yet are used by some suc-
; cessfully. The best success \was se-
| cured where either of these cover crops
|} were drilled in with sufficient distance
hetween the rows to admit cultivation.
| Where three or four cultivations were
given between the rows successful
growth was secured. It was suggested
; that cover crops can be more profita-
{bly ploughed under when green than
when left to harden on the surface of
the soil. A plant is more quickly con-
verted into humus and fertilizer when
| green than when dry and hard.
Question 27—-Are quinces a profitable
;crop? There did not seem to be many
‘quince growers present, but those who
| Were growing quinces and who gave
{them proper attention reported that
| they were a profitable crop. In order
to grow good quinces Dr any other
‘fruit the foliage must be looked after
,carefully and protected from fungus
| or blight.
Question

 

 

| 28—Which jis the more

| profitable plum, the German prune or!

ithe Freneh prune, which is claimed to
be the same as I’ellemberg? Both of
| these varieties were held in ‘high es-
teem by memPBers. German prune

At’ dust spray effective in rose mildew, | Yields more fruit than Fellemberg, but

| does not sell at quite such high prices,
Fellemberg is thought to be the best
in quality even when fully ripe, but a
member said that he would prefer a
}eanned German prune as_ regards
| quality to the Fellemberg. Both are
productive and profitable varieties and
David Bell,

large Rochester plum and_ pear
| Brower, says that he gets as much
fruit from two German prune trees as
from three Fellemberg trees. He has
found the blossoms of the German
prune more tender than those of Fel-
| lembBerg. German prune makes the
largest tree and is most productive in
his opinion, German prune hangs
well upon the tree and continues to
| improve in quality the longer it hangs.
He considered these two plums the
best of all, He sold the German prune
the past season for four cents a pound
and the Fellemberg for four and a half
cents a pound.

Question 3—Does summer pruning
of apples hasten fruiting? Reply-~
Yous,

Question 5-——Will the or@hards that
were severely affected in 1916 with
| scab fungus be liable to bear full crops
in 1917? Reply--Attacks of seab fun-
gus in 1917 should be anticipated and
unless carefully treaied a lighter crop
of perfect fruit could only be expected
for 1917,

Question 10--Can apple sorting be
\ done so safely by machine as by hand?

can hardly hope ever to secure the |
color on apples that can be secured |
in some of the Western States where |
there is perpetual sunshine, but we)
Jcan produce good apples, well col-
ored, that are of better quality than |

Question 12—Sweet apples; is there
n demand for them? Name the most
desirable kinds. Reply: Pound Sweet,
Bailey Sweet, Sweet Bough, but Sweet
Bough ig often seriously infested with
the railroad worm. The demand for
sweet apples in most markets is lim-
ited,

Question 13--Apple and peach trees |
set alternately are crowding” each |
j other, which would you dig out? Re- |
piy: In most instances I would dig,
out the peach. trees since they are
the shorter lived of the two.

Question 14—-What cause or causes
| were responsible for the 1916 crop of
; apples being so small?” Reply: The |
| season of 1916 was most exceptionally
| unfavorable for the fertilizing of apple

bloss6Ms and for the growth and ma-
| turing of the fruit, and favorable tothe |
increase in fungous attacks, owing to |
the peculiarities of the season.

Question 18— Would you advise
; planting dwarf apple trees as fillers,
fand how should they be pruned? Re-
}ply: There is a difference of opinion
| pt regard to dwarf apple trees, Their

|

 

 

planting is advised by, those who have
small grounds or smal] fruit gardem,
Some do not advise planting dwarf ap-
ples for comu@e¢rcial orchards. The
pruning of dwarf apple trees does not
vary much from the pruning of stand-
|ard apple trees. 3
Question 20—Is it advisable to re-
place Bartlett pear trees, if doing well,
with more thrifty, younger trees? Re-
ply: No. The Bartlett is considered a
stundard market variety of pear.
| more profitably grown now that it can
be kept so long in cold storage.
Question 25—Has anybody had ex-
‘perience with peaches in cold storage?
A member has discovered that peaches
can ‘be kept several weeks in cold
storage, but that they deteriorate in
quality and wil] not keep long after
being taken out of cold storage.
Question 30--Is it not good practice |
to cultivate a Bartlett pear pack |

 

 

until July 1 and then sow to buck-
wheat?

|
One member sees no objec-
jie to the above practice.

Tt is well |
keep the soil covered with some |

to
srowth at least a portion of the sea-
son, otherwise the soil deteriorates, |

Question 34--Is there a better red
| Tagpberry than Cuthbert and the Marl- |
| boro? Reply by a member: Yes, Her- |
| bért and Syracuse. |

Question 61—-Is it advisable to grow
farm crops in an orchard? Reply by |
{@ member: Generally speaking it "|

I not profitable, and yet hoed crops can
be grown in a newly planted orchard
for the first three or four years without
serious injury. |
| Question 53—Should fruit growers |
take more imerest in bees? Reply: |
Bees are the fruit grower's friends,
working for the fruit grower without
Pay so long as the sun shines. Every
fruit grower should be a bee man. |
Question 54—Has any one had ex- |
perience with nuts? Reply: Yes. |
Chestnuts will grow on heavier soil
than ordinary, though they are most
| often found growing wild on sandy
; soil, which leads many to conclude
j that they will not thrive on clayey
loam, but they will. Great interest is
being taken al! over this country in
| nut growing for profit. :

should be sprayed or sprinkled so as
to wet both the upper and under sides
or the leaves daily.

After blooming the plants should be |
thinned ‘by’ pruning out the strag-

in a sandy, peaty soil in a pot one

with water so the ball of earth can

transplanting and continue the daily
sprinkling of the leaves,

As soon asthe danger of frost has

that they make a good growth. Water
should be given as needed, on hot
days morning and_ night. A few
