Buenos Ayres, Jan. 20.—Three small |
submarines are carried by the German |
raider which has wrought such damage |
to allied shipping in Atlantic waters.
| The captain of the captured British ,
; steamer Netherby Hall, who was among |
j the prisoners landed at Pernambuco |
‘from the German prize ship Hudson |
Maru, made this statement to-day.
| “There are three submarines carried |
; by the raider,” he said in an interview |
jat Pernambyeo. ‘They are capable of |
| Operation over a small radius and are!
| equipped with torpedoes, dynamite and |
| ammunition.” |
| Such additional details aa this, indi-
|eating the typical German thoroughness
, With which the raider was prepared and
, equipped, led shipping circles here to
| predict a long chase by allied warships
before the “sea scourge” is cornered.

Certainly the raider had not been def- ,
initely located to-day, so far as was
‘known at South American ports; and
this despite the fact that a big fleet of
warships is now literally raking the
'ocean for her. Wireless despatches re-
| ceived here to-day said that the auxiliary
' British cruisers Macedonia and Orama
; had arrived off Pernambuco,

of country. This is the spirit which our
enemiés regard as terrible.

“Lloyd George, our most dangerous
adversary, has said, ‘What is your little
ego compared to the German all? What
are your little troubles compared with
the misery of all? What is the egg card
compared with the widow's veil, the
bread card against the hero's grave?"

Warned Not to Grumble.

The municipal authorities of Duessel-
dorf have issued the following pronun-
ciamento:

“Are we going to support the authori-
ties, or by our complaining increase their
anxiety about the people's food? Our
comrades in arms, our brothera in the
field, our glorious armies are winning
victories in winter's snows by indescrib-
able efforts, putting their lives in the
balance for the fatherland, while the en-
emy foams with rage as he sees his last
trump snatched from his hand.

“Meanwhile the people here grumble
beside their warm hearths because for
a short time they must eat turnips in-
stead of potatoes! Do the people who
stand the harm they are doing? Do
the traitor to our soldiers and robbing
them of the reward of their glorious
deeds?"

Herr von Batocki, presiding at a
meeting in Berlin, is quoted by the
Tageszeitung as saying:

“The year 1917 will undoubtedly bring
still greater difficulties, but that is no
justification for becoming excited about
grievances, be/they great or small.

“Food sca

overcome by abuse and scolding, nor by |

ties from carrying out their important

safety valve. Personally this has been
my own experience more than once in
the holy of holies of the War Office, but
it must not go too far.” :

Meanwhile the serious consequences
of underfeeding are shown clearly in a
report issued by the health
authorities at Berlin, concerning the ef-
fect of the food difficulties on sick per-
sons,

“It is announced that investigation
has confirmed the belief that consider-
able injuries to health are due to under-

feeding, and that the power of resist- |
, ance of sick persons is diminishing. This

is said to be true particularly of women,
and above all of aenemic or nervous
women.”

general, especially in the towns, but this
emaciation is seldom accompanied by
weakness or the loss of physical ca-

actual situation are found in the follow-

the west may not, perhaps, readily un-
derstand that the measures which have
been adopted are not only in no wise
detrimental to the population from an
economic point of view, but that they
have become, as it were, a social neces-
sity in view of the peculiar conditions
which prevail there,

“Those who wish to comprehend these
facts will first of all have to gain a
clear conception of the extent of unem-
ployment in Belgium and its conse-
quences. The principal cause of this
unemployment is to be found In the ruth-
less application of the British blockade
even as against Belgium. Belgian indus-
tries are dependent on the importation of
raw materials and the exportation of
manufactured goods to such an extent
that the almost complete throttling of
Belgium's foreign trade by England was
bound to lead automatically to the clos
ng down of by far the greater part of
the Belgian factories.

“This is especially true of the impor-
tant iron and steel industry, the textile
and clothing industries, the ceramic and
glass industries, which altogether employ

over 600,000 workmen in peace times;
it is also true of the leather, tobacco,

NEW CLASH FORESEEN.

Germany May Regard Americans
as Prisoners of War.

WASHINGTON, Jan, 20.—The German
Admiralty statement that neutral sub-
jects in the crews of vessels captured

by the German raider in the South At-:

lantic “have been removed ae prisoners
of war” will raise a complicated question
if any Americans are among them. The
whole question turns on whether an
armed merchant ship is a war vessel,
and the gulf between this country and
Germany on that question is still
bridged, Of course, Americans on such
ehips could be considered as prisoners
war only if the vessels were con-
sidered as war vessels.

lt was said at the State Department
that if American diplomatic and con-
sular officials abroad did not ascertain
whether or not Americans are among
the prisoners, an inquiry would be ad-
dressed to the Berlin Governinent.

No indication has been received that
any of the vessels sunk by the raider

were other than defensively armed. The}

State Department has held throughout
that a vessel cannot be classed as a

warehip unless she is under naval orders |

and the naval flag and manned by naval
crews,
