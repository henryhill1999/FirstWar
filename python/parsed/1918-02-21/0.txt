PROBLEMS ALL SOLVED

Many American Machines to
Be Flying Over German
Lines This Spring.

 

e |
Special Despatch to Tum Svvn.

WASHINGTON, @eb. 20.—America's gi-
gantic air programme ts rapidly becom-
ing an accomplished fact. The firat ma-
chine of that enormous fleet of aeriml
battleships whose overwhelming number
is to decide the war on the western
front in the belief of many strategists
are to-day already en route for the
American front in France.

These machines, equipped with the
first Liberty motors turned out by Amer-
ican methods of quantity production
and believed to be the superior of any
machines now in actual operation, will

be flying over the German lines in a
few weeks. They were not scheduled to
reach France unt! July, but American
machine shops and American workmen
have done their bit and to-day the
American aviation programme, calling
for the produatton of 20,000 airplanes, is
practically six months ahead of sched-
ule, Great as have been the triumphs
of machinery, in this country, no such
record as this has ever been made be-
fore.

The fact that American battle planes
were now en route to France in great
numbers and that six months has been
gained on the aviation programme was
disclosed to-day in a review by Secre-
tary Baker of what had been -accom-
plished in this direction. With Germany
greatly reenforced on the western front
it is on America’s capacity for over-
whelming the Germans in the air chat
many hopes are pinned, and from what
was disclosed of the progress made to-
day these hopes would seem to be justi-
fied.

Prodection Steadily Increases.

Mafor-Gen. George O, Squier, Chief
Gigna! Officer, in charge of the American
aviation programme, wanted to put pro-
duation on a so-called quantity produc-
tion basis, which means that once pro-
duction starts it flows freely and with
increasing rapidity. This has now been
done and the stream of airplanes from
American shops has etarted for the
front Responding to the appeal made
for speedy action, the airplane industry
in the United States has already ex-
panded more than twentyfold.

Engine production which began a
month ago Is now ,on a quantity produc-
tion basis and the peak of production
will be reached in a few weeks. Only
the twelve cylinder type is being made,
as developments abroad have made it
wire to concentrate on the high powered
engine instead of the eight cylinder.

The American built battle planes will
be overating against the Germans by
spring, By then the number of ma-
chines flowfhg from the factories to
France will have increased in amazing
Proportions, it is etated. It is not per-
mitted to say how many machines or
how many American aviators are now
ready for service, but it can ‘be stated
that the number of trained American
fliers is now greater than the combined
British and French aviation § forces
operating on any single day on the west-
ern front.

Great DiMiculties Overcome.

The first shipment of battle planes
marks the final overcoming of many
difficulties met in building up this new
and intricate indu@@ry, In explaining the
Situation in the air Secretary Baker's
statement says:

“After three years of warfare the total
number of planes able to take the air at
any time on either side of the western
front has not gbeen cver 2,500. This,
‘ombined with the fact that forty-six
men are required on the ground for every
plane in the alr, gives a truer perspective
of the European aviation situation than
‘s commonly posseseed. ‘

“For every plane in the afr there must
be two replacement planes on the ground
ar®l one training plane for every pilot
who eventually reaches the front, with a
"pare engine for each plane. Moreover,
‘hile the American programme hag been
delayed by difficulties which were im-
possible to foresee when the tentative
Programme was adopted ifn all our lack
of knowledge last epring, it may be said
that American planes are not due in
France under the original schedule. until

are facts which caused William G. Sharp,

siasm and delight at the achievements
of the aviation department of the Amer-

American aviation camp in France a
few days ago.

The Ambassador said he was greatly
{mpressed by the rvs accomplished in
the short space of time, as ground at
the aviation camp was broken only last
August. The boys are working under
{deal conditions, Modern sanitary meth-
ods have been adopted and baths and
swimming pools installed.

The Red Cross and the Young Men's
Christian Association have organized
recreation and. amusement places and
the camp gives one the impression that
it is the campus of a large American
university. A large percentage of the

men were university students before en-!

tering the service.

dress to the members in which he dealt |

at length with the peace treaty signed
by the Central Powers with the Ukraine
and the collapse of the peace negotia-
tions with Russia. Count von Hertling,
the Imperial German Chancellor, and
| Friedrich von Payer, the Vice-Chancel-
| lor, were attentive listeners to the ad-
| dress. '

Dr. Von Kuhlmann asserted that the |

Pacinhe intentions of Russia
longer be credited, but he sald that even
to-day Germany was prepared to con-
clude a peace “which corresponds with
our interests." He instanced the peace
agreement with the Ukraine as an indi-
| cation of the readiness of the Central
| Powers for peace. He referred especial-
ly to the advantages which the Teutonic
‘allies would derive during the present
{year from the economic treaty with the
Ukraine and recommended the approval
of the compact.

Blames Czar for the War.

| Speaking on the first reading of the
| Ukraine treaty, Dr. von Kuhlmann said
{the Ukraine people's republic was a
| young State, reared on the ground of
| the former Russian Empire after the de-
| caying edifice of the Czar's empire, which
shared the principal guilt for kindling
|the world's war, collapsed under the
| blow of the German armies. The
| Ukrainian rae was one of the strongest
elements of the Russian Empire. In
| respect to its minerals, coal and fron
the Ukraine was very rich and also pos-
sessed claments of its own industry,

| The great Russian representatives. of
‘the Bolsheviki, the Foreign Secretary
| continued, maintained friendly relations
| with the Ukraine 80 long as Leon
Trotaky, the Bolshevik Foreign Minister,
could assume that the peoples of the
republic of the Ukraine would primarily
| direct their policies according to, the in-
terests of the Petrograd Cabinet.

When, however, the Ukrainians
realized that the Petrograd Cabinet was
not pursuing a sincere peace policy the
representatives of the Ukraine adopted
the standpoint of ending the war by
peace, 8o they would in no wise be re-
6ponsible for the sins of Czarkkm.

Frontier Not Finally Fixed.

“The negotiations were not quite as
‘easy as in most cases with such young
|peoples,” said Dr. von Kuhlmann,
'“National ideas and desires were not
free from the exuberance of their repre-
sentatives. They made territorial de-
mands which were hardly able of realiza-
tion. The demarkation of the frontier
with Russia had to be left for a later
jpertod after discussions with the Rus-
| sian Government then in power. The
(only thing that concerned us was to lay
down the Weatern frontiers of the new
Gtate, in which the demarkation of the
frontier as regards Poland received the
most attention and experienced the live-
Lest criticism from the Poles,”

Dr. von Kuhlmann said that without
being too sanguine he believed the coun-
try hailed peace with the Ukraine with
rellef and joy “as the first step toward
ithe restoration of a general peace which
we all hope to attain within measurable
| time.”

“As welghty as

 

are the interests in

| question for us," Dr. von Kuhlmann
| continued, “they are considerably
{weightier for the Dual Monarchy. In

{our case the interests are chiefly exter-
| nal, in theirs in addition to the exter-
nal there are momentous interests of
an internal political nature,

‘The fact that the settlement took
the form it did arose from the consid-
eration which Dr. von Seydler (the
Austrian Premier) pointed out yester-
|day, namely, the fear that the further
screwing back of their claims to the
'Cholm frontier would have resulted tn
| the wreckage of the treaty. The over-
whelming majority of the German peo-
| ple would not have understood such an
action, They would have disapproved
most severely, and, IT think rightly, an
action entailing the sacrifice of a peace
so much desired.

Polish Interests Considered,

| “That we gave very much considera-
‘tion Indeed to Polish interests is clear
from the form of stipulations detailing
frontier Hines, only in a general way re-
serving detailed demarkation for a com-
; mission, Further, the negotiations
which the Austro-Hungarian Govern-
iment, in accord with the German Govy-
| conducted with the Ukraine
| resulted in making it clear that the
| paragraph about the definitive demarka-
tion of frontier lines can be interpreted
in a much more ample inanner and that
in this way the ethnographigal situation
|}and the desires of the population can
' receive most far reaching consideration,
| “& projected commission will include
|not only the representatives of the
allies (Teutonic), but also Polish dele-
gates.
‘sible to attain
frontiers.”

The President
opening the proceedings made loyal
reference to the golden wedding anniver-
sary of the Bavarian royal couple, at
which the members of the House arose
and applauded loudly. The President
was authorized to send a telegram of
congratulation to King Louis and his
| Queen.

Treaty With Ukraine in

Feb, 20.—The =:

 

AMSTERDAM,
Premier, Dr. von Seydler, speaking in
the Reichsrat to-day, entered into a
long defence of the original treaty of
peace with the Ukraine and announced
a subsequent treaty appointing a com-
mission to define the frontiers of Ukraine
and Cholm. ,

“The Petrograd Government,” he
sald, “has declared the state of war be-
tween Russia and, Austria-Hungary at
an end, and, so far as human judgment
can foresee, a state of war will not
ag&in arise between these two countries.

“Responding to German cries for help
from Eethonia and Livonia Germany
resolved to march further into the in-
terior in order to save from certain

destruction those unhappy nationals liv.
ing in those provinces. In full accord

ticipate in this military action Our
aim, therefore, remains what it was
‘before—to bring help as speedily as pos-
sible to the Austro-FMungarian nationals
still on Rufsian soil.”

Dr. von Seydler announced that 20,-
000 prisoners had already arrived from
Russia and that negotiations would be
resumed with the FKetrograd Govern-
ment for the exchange of prisoners.

Fatare of Cholin,

In explaining the appointment of the
commiesion the Premier declared that
thg future of Cholm would depend upon
race principles arffl the desires of the

population. Russia, he said, had de-
ntanded for {ta territories the right of all
peoples to self-determination, even to the

 

extent of complete severance.

“We accepted this 6tandpoint for the
occupied territories," he continued, “and
all the negotiations at Brest-Litovsk |
were conducted on this basis. We recog-
nized this right for the peoples of
Lithuania, Courland and Poland, and no
logical or moral ground could be dis- |
covered for depriving the Ukrainians of |
the right granted to other Russian |
peoples.

“The members of the Polish Club can-
not deny the existence of a large Ukrain-

 

fan population in Cholm and that
this nation has the right to be heard.
I go even further and say it was the

duty of the Austro-Hungarian Govern-
ment to conclude peace with the Ukrain-
jans.

“What was secured at Brest-Litovsk
was peace for the people, and the Aus-
tro-Hungarian peoples would never have
understood if we had réjected this peace,
or rejected the possibility of obtaining
wheat merely in order that Cholm in ita
entirety and unconditionally should fal
to Poland. What would the emp're'a
reply have been if the Foreign Minister
had returned and admitted that he had
spoiled the chances of peace because he
refused to the Ukrainian population of
holm the same right to be heard as is
possessed by the Pollfsh part?’

Quotes Wilson's Phrase.

Dr. von Seydler here quoted President
Wilson's @hrase that peoples and prov-
inces must not be transferred from one
state of authority to another merely as
pawns in a game, and continued :

‘Had we acted as the gentlemen of
the Polish Club demand, we should net
only have failed to conclude peace with
Ukraine, but should have severed the
delicate threads which may perhaps
lead to a general peace, and the voices
raised in defence of such a policy would
have been drowned under a raging hur-
ricane of indignation from all the Aus-
trian races,

“In view of these various considera-
tions, I must also emphatically reject
certain ineéinuations which have been
made concerning the relations between
Austria-Hungary and Germany.”

The Premier's speech was recelved
throughout with unusual demonstrations |
of approval, except from the Poles, who,

Brain, Keb. 20.—The forward move-
ment of the German troops eastward
into Russia continues, according to the
official communication issued this eve-
ning. The text of the communication
says:

The forward movement continues in
the east. German troops have en-
tered Fsthonia. Werder has been
passed through in an easterly direc-
tion.

(The town of Werder, Esthonia, te
situated on the coast of Bol Sound. It
is probable that the forces landing there
came from Moon or Oese! Islands, which

| te off the Esthonian coast and which

for a jong time have been occupied by
the Germans. Werder {ts about sixty-
five miles southwest of the important
Gulf of Finland port, Reval.)

An earlier statement to-day reads.

On both sides of the Riga-Petrograd
railway the Russian positions were
crossed a we advanced twenty
kilometers beyond the line which had
been our front. Feeble resistance on
the part of the enemy near Inzeen,
north of the railway, soon was broken.

Our divisions pushed on from Dvinsk
to the northeast and to the east.

Between Dvinsk and Lutsk they
advanced on wide sectors. Divisions
which pressed forward beyond the
Lutsk are marching on Rovno.
Prisoners to the number of 2,500,
several hundred guns and a great
amount of roiling stock fell into our
hands,

Menace to Petrograd.

Apparently the German invasion of
Russia is being pressed with an energy
and determination in keeping with all
Germany's war efforts, Despite the fact
Many divisions were supposed to
have been transferred from the east te
the west front a sufficiently strong Teu-
ton fighting machine seems to have been
retained along the Russian lina to In-
sure the discomfiture of the demoralized
Boisheviki,

There is no indication that the inya-
sion hag met much resistance. The in-
vasion of Esthonia constitutes a grave
menace to Petrograd. Apparently it was
accomplished by troops from warships ju
the Guk of Riga and Moon Sound, re-
enforced perhaps by German garrisons
which have been holding several of tha
islands in that region. The landing at
Werder and elsewhere in that region af-
fords ai strong bise fer operations
against Reyal, one of the leading north-
ern Russian ports,

Northeast and east of Minsk the Gere
Mans are proceeding steadily toward
Smolensk and Petrograd. The total line
is more than 500 miles In length. Al-
though their objectives are not clear at
all points, the Germans apparently have
determined to exert pressure at practi-
cally every part of this extended fight-
ing front. In the south the operations
have the added objective of putting Rua-
manta definitely out of the war.

Special Cable Deapatch to Tue Sus from thea

Copynioht, 1918; all righta reserved

Lonpon, Feb. 20.—A batch of be-
lated Russian despatches, sent from
February 6 to February 14, reached Lou -
don to-night. They bear, to a great ex-
tent, the stamp of the Bolshevik official
press agent. A_ Petrograd cablegrani
tells of the theft of $20,000 from a
newspaper on the Neva. A messenger
who carried the money was murdered
and subsequently the two robbers were
killed.

Outrages, street firing and drunken

An interview given in Petrograd on
February 8 by Count Katserlin warns
the Russians not to count upon a revo.
lution in Germany and says that Ger-
many is fighting to keep order, while all
her enemies seem to be struggling in be-
half of anarchy.

A group of Russian grand dukes and
duchesses is said to have petitioned the
Bolshevik authorities for permission te
have former Emperor Nicholas removed
to France. They disclaim any conspiracy
to restore the monarchy and say the
former sovereign will relinquish all
rights to the throne.
