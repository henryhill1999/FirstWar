‘AMERICANS FIGHTING HARD ABOVE SOISSONS

FOR BONE DRY
NATION JULY 4

Also Authorizes President
to Establish Prohibition
Zones About War Plants.

DODGES RECORD VOTE

House Expected to Take Simi-
lar Action Promptly—Effec-
tive Till Demobilization.

Special Despatch to Tur Ses.

WasnHincton, Aug. 29.—A bone dry
nation after June 30, 1919, for the re-
mainder of the war and the period of.
demobilization to follow is guaranteed
under the rider to the food production
stimulation bill, which passed the Sen-
ate late to-day without a record vote.

This action by the Senate followed
five hours of debate, which by reason
of the fact that the success of the
measure was a foregone conclusion
held little interest for the floor, al-
though the galleries were well filled.

House to Welcome Action.

To-day’s action by the Senate is ex-
pected to find a prompt and enthusi-
astic echo in the House, where the pres-
ent movement for war time prohibition
was initiated in the adoption of the
Randall amendment. The House, it
{s known, is practically ready to accept
any prohibition law which will provide
the opportunity for the legisiators from
dry communities to go back to the
autumnal huskings and answer in the
affirmative the question frem the heck-
lers, “Did you vote for prohibition?” —

The neglect of the Senate to puf it-
self on record by a roll call was predi-
cated, it is alleged, upon a tacit agree-
ment not to force the legislators to
“stand up and be counted.” No one
could be found who was willing to
charge that the Senate had actually
dodged the issue in this fashion, but it
was only through a protracted season
of agreements and counter agreements
that a bitter fight was avoided.

As a corollary to the amendment the
fenate to-day accepted a further amend-
ment giving the President complete
power to decree prohibition zones of such
width as he might deem necessary around
all munition plants, coal mines, ship-
yards and plants where essential war
industries were in progress, This goes
into effect immediately. It is expected
the President will avail himself of it
at once to make dry many areas.

Text of the Amendment.

The complete text of the bone dry
amendment was as follows:

That after June 30, 1919, until the
conclusion of the» present war and
thereafter until the termination of
demobilization, the date of which shall
be determined and proclaimed by the
President of the United States, for the
purpose of conserving the man power
of the nation and to increase effi-
ciency in the production of arms,
munitions, ships, food and clothing for
the army and navy, it shall be un-
lawful to sell for beverage purposes
any distilled spirits, and during said
time no distilled spirits held in bond
shall be removed therefrom for bev-
erage purposes except for export.

After May 1, 1919, until the con-
clusion of the present war and there-
after until the termination of demobil-
ization, the date of which shall be
determined and proclaimed by the
President of the United States, no
grains, cereals, fruit or other food
product shall be used in the manu-
facture or production of beer, wine
or other intoxicating malt or vinous
liquor for beverage purposes.

efter until the termination of de-

‘The Japanese bore the brunt of the

According to a wounded Czech the

After a discussion

lasting an hour

the Council of Commanders presented
an ultimatum to the troops in revolt,

AMSTERDAM, Aug. 29.—While a Mos-

of August 26, deny that the American

The little operation carried out yester-
day by the French and Americans had
been merely preparatory to the attack
which began at seven o'clock this morn-
ing. The kink had been taken out of
the line yesterday, but no determined
effort was made to advance to any ex-
tent.

Late this afternoon the Americans
held positions in the Aghting line in
the Goissons region extending in a north-
erly direction from Chavigny.

from the menace they would be under

tending further toward the east.

effort to check the movement. Equally

the attack is in progress indicate that
the Americans are confronted by what
is believed by many to be one of the
most determined stands yet taken by
the Germans, who realize that a break
at any point would probably be followed
by disaster.

The rapidity with which the gains
were made by the Americans and French
early in the day was not duplicated in
the afternoon, when the battle settled
in which
the guns of both sides fired often at

| direct targets and at unusually close

range.

The firing was continuous throughout
the night on both sides, the German
guns being especially active. The rains
of the early evening ceased before the
ground had been converted into mud, s0,
when the orders were given to-day, the
men moved forward unimpeded.

Guns Fire Almost Point Blank.

The German positions were shelled
most vigorously by heavy guns, mortars
and light pieces, firing almost point-
blank, as well as by long range naval
guns, which searched the positions far
and near, and then the infantry ad-

WITH THE BritisH ARMY IN FRANCE,
Aug. 29.—The Germans seem definitely
to have abandoned all pretence of at-
tempting to hold the ground south and
west of the Somme. We hoped that our
offensive of August 8 assureg a German
retirement beyond the river and that
the rear guard actions at varous points:
were intended to protect the withdrawal,
So it has proved.

We declined to rush headlong against
prepared positions where we knew we
would have been welcomed, but pro-
ceeded methodically and dealt with
caution with each point of resistance.
Meanwhile our guns and airplanes made
the main German retreat an extremely
costly process, especially at the river
crossings, which have been subjected
to a constant fire. ’

Now the only point of German resist-
ance this side of the river seems to be:
in the angle where the river turns south |
before Peronne. This morning our aa- |
vanced positions practically made a
chord reaching from Feuilieres on the
north to Brie on the south. The French
are even further forward, being actu-
ally on the heights above the river

WITH THE AMERICAN ARMY IN FRANCE,
Aug. 29.—American troops took part in
the French advance to-day, and fighting
in splendid style made considerable
progress in the region of Juvigny.
Their attack began at 5:20 o'clock
in the morning, which was damp and
slightly misty. Despite stern resist-
ance the Americans quickly gained
ground along the railway running west
from Juvigny. At Couronne the Ger-
cr machine gun nests temporarily
held up the advance, but with the as-
sistance of French whippet tanks these
nests were quickly cleaned out and the
Americans then moved forward again

| Lonpon, Aug. 20.—British troops
under Field Marshal Haig reached
the west bank of the Somme River,
south of Peronne, as far as Brie to-
day, thus flanking the Germans in
that important elty. :

On the southern end of the line
Gen. Mangin’s army has advanced
beyond Noyon on the east and south-
east, capturing Morlincourt and mov-
ing up to the west bank of the Canal
du Nord, which they occupy for al-
most its entire lengih. They have
crossed the Ailette at several places,
thus threatening the German posi-
tions on the Chemin des Dames and
making probable a withdrawal of the
Germans to the Crozat Canal.

Gen. Mangin also has captured
Juvigny, in the capture of which
American troops participated, ‘taking
f prominent part.

In the north the British are now in
possession of Bapaume nnd are clos-
