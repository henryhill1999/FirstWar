Special Cable Despatch to THE SUN

HAVANA, Nov, 26. ‘There was a near riot
here to-day over the baseball game he-
tween the New York Giants and the
Almaderes, which the latter won by the
score of B6to 4

The Almaderes questioned a decision
of Umpire Rigler in the eighth inning
allowing Doyle to score after Fletcher
had flied out. The Cubans claimed that
Doyle did not touch third after the ball
had caught. The Cuban catcher
called Manager John MeGraw an insulting
name, whereupon the New Yorker
manded the Cuban's expulsion from the
field. Rigler ordered the catcher to leave
the grounds, but the Cuban players made
a strong kick and the public angrily in-
vaded the field and threatened the New
York players with violence. MeGraw
then ordered his men to withdraw and they
had started to obey when the Cuban
catcher withdrew and the game was re-
sumed,

IRISH WOMAN SINGER
DléS OF POISON HERE

Mrs. Alice Tristram Shanks
Victim of Carbolic Acid
at a Dinner.

Daughter of Canon Tristram of
Dublin, She Told Friends
on This Side.

Mrs. Alice ‘Tristram Shanks, a singer
Who came to this country from jreland
this fall in the hope of securing an en-
gagmement, died at 2.45 o'clock yesterday
morning ono oen ambulance which wae
taking her from the Van Cortlandt Park
Hotel, near the golf links in Ven Cort
landt Park,to Fordham Hospital. Death
was caused by earbolie acid poiconing
The police reported the death to the
Coroner's office et &R o'clock vesierday
morning as a sticids 1) oroner made
aM investizaiion rday and last night
said that he was: ‘ing al present
to say that the case one of suicide,
He ordered tus physician, Dr. Thomas
Curtin, fo nake an aut ps this taorping.

The Ceroner thought some of the eit
cumstances of the death strange Mira

Shanks apparently drank the poison trom
a vermouth bottle with only the vermouth
label

Although she was thought to have come
to the hotel alone no purse was found after
her death nor so

Further,

much as a niekel for

carfare, when a search Was
made last night for two trunks and seven
begs which Miss Tristram had brought
to America and had taken with her from
one place to another, they couldn't be
found anywhere

at about last

night. She was with Mre.
of the hotel, and finding Mrs.
was not feeling well and was in her room
Miss Tristram went upstairs to see her.
She returned downstairs after a few
minutes, and meeting a party of six or
eight men, some of whom she apparently
knew, she sat down with them ai 4 table
in an alcove off the dining room. The
party had supper and something to drink,

A little after midnight, according to
Mr. O'Connell, from
the table, took a few steps and collapsed
Dr. Paul Dolan of Willett
avenue and 216th street was sitting at
another table talking with Mr. O'Connell,

Miss Tristram

rose

on the floor.

Dolan ran to Miss Tristram and with
ot men who had sitting
around the table and the proprietor of
the hotel worked over her for two hours.
Finding his efforts fruitless, he advised
that an ambulance be summoned Di
Hos-

a group been

ambulance could return to the hospital.
The body was taken to the Fordham
Inorgue.

The police report, which was made to
Coroner Shongut stated that the policemen
had found a vermouth bottle containing
a solution of earbolic acid and lysol in
Mr. O'Conne!l says that
the bottle was not found in the dining
room, but that when the policemen found
no battle they asked him if he had any
carbolic acid in the house, and he sent a
waiter down stairs to get the only bottle
of such a solution he knew of. This
bottle, he says, he then turned over to tha
police. Mr. O'Connell does not recall
whether the woman left the table in the
course of the evening or not. The bottle

in the basement which it is unlikely Miss
would visit, and the Coroner

that such a hottle was kept in the base-

| ment,

This bottle had contained Ltalian ver-
mouth. It still bore its original labels
and there was nothing on the outside to
show that its contents were other than
vermouth. Jt is possible that one of the
diners found the bottle in the basement
and brought it up not knowing the nature

lof its contents and that it was mistaken
for drink

An inquest will be held on Friday. The
only names which the police got from
the party of men who were at the table
with Miss Tristram were William Lappe,
florist, of 250th street and Albany Post
road, and Joseph KE. Crimmins of 245th
street and Broadway. Mr. Lappe was not
at home last night when the Coroner
sought to question him, and his, wife said
that she did not know what time he would
be in. She said that her husband had
returned home at about 4:80 o'clock yes-
terday morning. The Coroner was unable
to tind Mr, Crimmins and there appeared
to be a mistake in the address, Mr. O'Con-
told the Coroner that he thought
some of the others in the party were
two brothers of the name of Cotten, real

} estate dealers in The Bronx, and a man

Keeper Jones lof the name of Gallagher in the Comp-

troller's office.

Miss Tristram was about 36 years old
She told her acquaintances in this councry
that she was a daughter of Canon Tristram
of Dublin and that she was a distant rela-
tive of the Coats family. She said that
one of the members of this family had
been sending her remittances since she
came to America.

Among Mies ‘Tristram's effects was

der that could not cause death unless! found a letter from the Rey. Dr. Hugh

taken internally

The postal authorities probably will
go no further with the case.
