Throngs of women and children accompanied their hus-
bands, sons and fathers to the enrolling centres and affecting
scenes were repeated constantly all over the city and all over
‘the empire. Priests mingled with the crowds at the stations,
blessing the reservists as they marched away singing hymns.

All means of communication are in the hands of the Gove
ernment and only such messages are allowed to pass out as are
approved by the Gcvernment.

Despatches from Moscow say that the municipal council
there has voted a million rubles ($500,000) for the Red Cross
of Russia and her allies.

report that Great Britain, through her Ambassador at
Paris, had notified President Poincare of Great Britain’s |
support of France in any course she may take. The matter |
will be decided at a meeting of the Cabinet to-day. Both
army and navy, however, are on a war footing. The Bank
of England has raised its discount rate to 10 per cent. Con-
tinental banks have also increased their rates materially.
Bank of England notes are being refused at the largest |
London hotels and restaurants.
German Ambassador was notified that Italy |
would remain neutral, though perhaps not until the end of
the war. Five hundred thousand men are under arms and
the fleet has assumed a defensive position. Italy’s neu-}
trality may mean her withdrawal from the Triple Alliance
in the threatened test of strength with the Triple Entente.
