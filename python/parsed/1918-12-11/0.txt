Lonpon, Dec. 10.—The latest re-
ports from Berlin state that the cap!-
tal Is in a state of nervousness,
Thousands of persons are crowding
the streets and discussing excitedly
the events of the last few days, dur-
ing which, according to these reports,
twenty-eight persons were killed in
the street fighting.

The extreme elements are said to
be preparing some sort of action. Dr.
Karl Liebknecht, leader of the Rad-
ieale, agnin is making inflammatory
speeches and machine guns lave been
placed at various points in the city.
The police have made preparations
to meet any new disorders.

clared Philipp Scheidemann, a mem-

himself against the attacks of the
Spartacus group. Scheidemann de-
clared that the Government had 90
per cent. of the German population
behind {it “but nevertheless, it is sit-

Herr Scheidemann added that Georg
Ledebour, a Radical leader, had ob-
structed the formation of a cabinet
for thirty-six hours. After the rev-
olution Dr. Karl Liebknecht, the Rad-
ical leader, wanted to join the cabinet,

of the Germans’ guilt. In many places,
notably in St. Quentin, the scenes of
destruction have been kept intact,
even the mines laid by the Germana/in
