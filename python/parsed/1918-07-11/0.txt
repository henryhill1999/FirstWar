The bell in the clock tower of the
City Hall sounded yesterday after a
Hlence of a year and a month.

In the late afternoon, precisely at 6
o'clock, It began to toll heavily, sorrow-
fully, voicing the lamentation of a city
with its regular,repeated strokes.

Far below this bell the body of the

fine young man who was Mayor of New
York from 1914 until 1918 was being

earried up the steps of the hall to lle
in slate where the bodies of Henry Clay,
of Abraham Incoln, of Ulysses S. Grant
and of Willlam J. Gaynor had received
their due of public respect.

The coffin, of bronze, which was borne
upon the sturdy shoulders of American
irfantrymen, wes caressed by the flag
for which this young man gave his life.
Bien by step the young soldiers accom-
plished the journey from funeral oar to
the rotunda of the hall, and at every
step the great bell overhead spoke with
heavy resonance, while the membefs of
the government of the city, many men
of note in the olty’s affairs and thou-
sands of undistinguished, though no less
mournful, men gaged in alilence, their
heads uncovered, and the notse of
traffic all about the City Hali ceased to
nothing. s

The Old and New Bells.

The last time the bell of the City
Hall rang out John Purroy Mitchel, with
his vibrant earnestness, was presiding
over the welfare of the 5,000,000. He
had just said to Marshal Joffre and
Rene Viviani worde, 80 gracefully and

RESULT

 

IS A SURPRISE

 

Chamber Must Vote on Merits
of Bill—Its Passage Still
Remote.

Special Despatch to Tax Scx

WASHINGTON, July 10.—War time pro-
hibition won a signal and unexpected
victory in the Senate to-day. On a test
vote brought about through an appeal
from tha decision of the President pro
tem, that the proh{bition amendment to
the pending food production stimulation
bill was out of order the clair was over-
ruJed by a vote of 36 to 33.

The triumph surprised no one more
than the proponents of the prohibition
measure. Up to the moment of the vote
it had been ‘expected that Senator Sauls-
bury’s ruling that the prohibition amend-
ment had no rightful place in a general
appropriation measure would be sus-
tained by a comfortable margin.

Throughout the debate, which avoided
the merits of the question of prohibition
and dwelt upon the rules of the Senate
and the interpretation of trem, it became
more and more evident that the decision
of the Senate would come only after an
exceedingly close vote.

Must Vote on Merits.

The announcement of the result of the
roll call caused discomfiture to the wets
and gratification to the drys, for it
brings squarely before tte Senate for
the first time the necessity of veting on
tae merits of the question.

The prohibition amendment included
in the food production stimulation bill
as <n Integral part thereof is still open
to ar dment by to-day’s action. The
chances of its immediate paggage ar@
remote because of the impending clast

Kaiser, Still Praying,
Admits War Not Won

AMSTERDAM, July 10.—The

German Emperor has replied
to a congratulatory telegram
from the University of Cologne
as follows:

The invincible bravery and
unlimited self-sacrifice of the
German nation shine brightly
out of the darkness of the
mightiest war of all times.
Our victorious arms have not
yet succeeded in_ entirely
breaking our enemies’ will to
destruction, but Germany’s
sons with unshakable confi-
dence are rallying round their
supreme war lord and their
trusty military leaders to win
for the Fatherland life, happi-
ness and freedom to create a
free path for the development
of its intellectual and economic
forces. God will be with us
and our just cause.

the French have made additional gains
{in the sector southwest of Soissons, cap-

the outskirts of Longpont, and pene-

There were heavy artillery duela north

of Montdidier and south of the Aisne, |

near Chavigny farm.

There was similar activity in the Brit-
ish sectors, particularly in the region
east of Amiens from near Villers-Bre-
tonneux to the Ancre. Attacks by the
Germans in this cegion were repulsed

Further north, on the Fianders front,
the British attacked near Merris, north-
east of Nieppe Wood on the western
side of the Lys salient, and were very
successful, capturing nine machine guns
and two trench mortars, besides some
prisoners. Additional captives were
brought in during the day from other
parts of the front.

The Aseociated Press correspondent
with the British army says that last
night’s enemy assault in the Villers-
Bretonneux region was preceded by an
intense enemy bombardment of the town
and the neighboring territory.

Germans Thrown Back.

Between 8 and 9 o'clock the Germans
made a rush for the defensive positions,
but were easily thrown back all along

Copyright, 1918; all rights reserved.

Lonpon, July 10.-—The resignation ef
Dr. Richard von Kuehimann, the Ger-
man Foreign Minister, which accord-
ing to a despatch from Copenhagen
was announced to the Reichstag yes-
terday following his return from Ger-
man army headquarters, means that
the Pan-Germans and the Prussian
militarists still have the German pol-
icy in their grip and will not permit
the Kaliser or the Government to
make any departure from the mest
extreme war aims.

Much depends upon the choice of the
successor to Dr. von Kuehlmann. His
resignation has been accepted by the
Kaiser, and the Socialist members of
the Reichstag already are out with a
threat to start a filibuster against the
war budget bill unless they are in-
formed who is to succeed him and the
new man makes a statement of his péli-
cies. Evidently the Socialists will itn-
sist that the new Foreign Minister be
acceptable to them and that some of his

ings of the present Government.

Action on Budget Delayed.

Consideration of tne budget in the
Reichstag has been delayed by the new
threat of Socialists, who uged obstruction
tactics a year ago on a similar measure
but finally were defeated by the Junk-
ers, but only after they had caused much
uneasiness in the = circles of Ger-
