Cardinal Gibbons of Baltimore ia to say
the mass at the funeral to-morrow of Arch-
bishop Corrigan.

According to the original plans for the
wervices, as announced at the See House
on Tuesday, Bishop McQuaid of Rochester,
the senior Bishop of the Province of New
York, was to be the celebrant, but the
change of plan made at Bishop
McQuaid's own request.

He arrived here from Rochester late on
Tuesday night. In a long conference with
Vicar-General Mooney and the priests of
the Cathedral staff yesterday he expressed
the wish that the requiem high mass be
said by either Cardinal Gibbons or Arche
bishop Williams of Boston.

The invitation was first sent to the Cardi-
nal and a message to the effect that he would
officiate came late last night. So the final
arrangements for the funeral are as fol-
lows

The translation of the despatch is as
follows
The Holy Father with the greatest sorrow
earns that the eminent Archbishop whom he
roped to see in Rome very soon has been

ous merits of the dead Archbishop, expresses

the Chureh of New York and he praye God
earnestly to give to that well deserving soul

the repose and reward of the just
RAMPOLLA,
Pontifical Secretary of State,
A message of condolence was also re-
ceived from Cardinal Vaughan of London.
Forty thousand persons filed through
St. Patrick's Cathedral, yesterday, and
looked upon the body of Archbishop Corri-
an. Fromthe moment that the Fifth avenue
doors were opened to the public at 1 o'clock
in the afternoon until 10 o'clock last night,
there was an unbroken procession of men,
women and children passing the catafalque,
most of them praying and erossing thern-
selves as they moved slowly down the
broad centre aisle to where the body lay
in front of the altar.
The crush was great during the first
hour and again in the evening after working
hours, when the long line of mourners
was made up very largely of laboring men
with their wives and children
There were many pathetio incidents.
An old man and his wife went up the aisle
mu bling their prayers. The old man
had his hat in one hand and his cane, with-
out which the walk through the Cathedral
would have been impossible for him, in
the other. When they reached the bier
the man handed the hat to his wife to hold.
Then he reached up and touched the cinct-
ure which was wound about the dead
prelate's body and which signified purity
of heart. The body wae high up, almost
above the heads of the peopie and it was
a hard reach, but the old man's wife put
her arm about his waist to help support
him while he paid this mute tribute to the
dead Archbishop
There were so many others after that who
tried to touch the alb or the sandals or
some other part of the body as they passed
that there were many halts in the long
line and the police on guard, a ing under
instructions from the priests finally told
all who hesitated at the catafaique to move
along more quickly
The ceremonies for the day began at 11
o'clock when the body was carried with
reat ecclesiastical pomp and solemnity

Cathedral

DEVERY CAPTAINS MAY GO.

SEVEN SERGEANTS TO BE PRO-
MOTED WITHIN TWO WEEKS.

 

This Expected to Furnish the Occasion for
Transfers of Men Allied With the Old
Regime Who Have Been Undisturbed.

A shake-up is threatened in the Police
Department. It was reported yesterday
that within two weeks Police Commissioner
Partridge would transfer seven or more
captains who, he thinks, have not broken
off their affiliations with Devery.

TheCommissioner made the announcement
yesterday that it was his intention to ap-
point seven new police captains and sent for
a list of eligible sergeants from the Civil
Service Commission. Under the law the
list must contain at least thirteen names.
Commissioner Partridge was informed by
the Civil Service Commission that it would
be at least a week before the list would be
in proper shape. Commissioner Partridge
said that the appointments would be made
within two weeks.

Asked if he would take the names from
the list in order, he explained that this
would be impossible as he was obliged to
appoint veterans first and there were five
of these. The veterans are: Sergeants
Michael Smith, Joseph Nally, Patrick
Byrnes, James Donovan and John Wormel
the latter being in Brooklyn. At the top
of the list as it now etands is Sergt. Thomas
Maude of Brooklyn whose standing is 90.3.
His appointment is regarded as sure. The
two men next to him on the list are also
Brooklyn men eo that if the Commissioner
decides to take the names in order on the
list after the veterans, three of the seven
appointments will go to Brooklyn.

These new captains, it is understood
will be put in command of the precincts
which have been under the command of
the men who are known as Devery's friends.

All along Commissioner Partridge has
said that he would not make any transfers
until he got to know the men and what they
were doing. He has been advised by
District Attorney Jerome not to meddle
with captains who are suspected of wrong-
doing, but let them remain in their pre-
cincts and give them a chanoe, either to
turn over a new leaf or get into trouble.

For several days it has been common
report in Mulberry street that four cap-
tains besides Foody are to be tried. The
cases of two of them, Churchill and Gan-
non, will come up for trial just as soon
as the Foody case has been disposed of.
The evidence has been gathered not only
by District Attorney Jerome's county
detectives, but by men selected by Col.
Partridge.

Speculation has been rife as to the cap-
tains who will be transferred and a num-
ber of names have been mentioned. When
Col. Partridge was told of these rumors
he refused to commit himself as to
his plans or to name the captains who will
be shifted. He has made no big shake-
up since he has been in office.

Within the last few days Col. Partridge
has been holding long sessions with his
two deputies, Col. Thurston and Major
Ebstein, and when the shake-up comes
it is thought that not only Manhattan but
Brooklyn will be affected.

Rumors that several captains would
retire have been current in Mulberry etreet
fora week or more, It is stated that Senior
Inspector Cortright will retire inside of
two months.

 

AUTO TIMING TABLE.

30 Seconds to One Short Block Is 6 Miles
an Hour and Soe On.

Some of the members of the Automobile
Club of America who have been trying
to get the city to increase the limit of speed
of vehicles in the street have worked out
the following table, by which it is poasible
for any one with a watch to time any moving
object that he thinks ts violating the speed
ordinances—or that he thinks is not violat-
ing the ordinances, if he wante to. The
table was Compiled for use in Manhattan
and that part of the rest of the city where
the blocks run twenty to the mile, and
shows the time that a vehicle is making
when it passes a block at the rate given in
the table:

YALE'S CRIMINAL CLUB.

The Members Have a Dinner and Confer
Mock Degrees.

New Haven, Conn., May 7.—What is
known as Yale's Criminal! Club had mock
graduation exercises and conferring of
degrees to-night at Mory's, the well-known
Yale student reaort. There was a banquet,
also, at which E; Lyttleton Fox, ‘02, pre-
sided. Toasts were responded to in which
the New Haven police force was lam-
pooned.

Some of the degrees conferred were:
D. D. (Drunk and Disorderly), 8. T. (Sneak
Thief), and B.S. (Burglary and Stealing).
After the banquet the fifty membersof the
club paraded to the campus in close lock-
step, each carrying a lantern, the members
loudly singing “fie burgiar leads a jolly
life—jolly life.”

At the campus the club eurrounded
Campus Policeman Wiser and demanded
a speech. The club next danced around
the sun dial on the new campus, after which
it dispersed, giving a long Yale cheer for
“Crime.” ;

The by-laws of the club are said to be as
follows:

The object of the Yale Criminal Club shall
be to promote a knowledge of crime and the
perchological basis of criine among its mem-

ers and a contempt for the New Haven
Police Department :

No person shall be eligible for membership
who is not a member of Yale University and
who has not been arrested for some offence

Upon a vote of two-thirds of the members
already admitted, however, any studert
may be admitted to honorary membership
who has shown unusual boldness in the com-
mission of crime and in escaping the conse-
quences thereof ‘

‘he officers shall consist of a President,
Secretary, Treasurer and Roard of Receivers
It shall bethe duty of the Board of Receivers
to care for signs and other articles secured by
the club and to furnish bail for all students
who may be arrested. It shall be the duty
of the President to instruct students how to
conceal their identity when arrested by giv-
ing fictitious names and in other ways

from time to time it shall be the duty of
the President to assemble the club for social
occasions at which the dignity of crime shall
be pointed out and suitable degrees conferred
upon members whose achievements in com-
mitting crime or avoiding punishment de-
@erves such reward, which shall be given upon
the vote of a majority of the members present
and entitled to vote, not including honorary
members

The Insignia of membership shall be a pair
of «mall handcuffs made of solid gold, which
shall be worn as a watch fob as a sign by which
fellow criminals may know each other.

EX-STAR BOARDER SHOWS FIGHT.

Rival Who'd Stolen a March on Him De-
fends the Widow Kelty —Both Locked Up.

There was trouble yesterday in the third
flat at 154 West Thirty-fifth street, kept
by Mrs. Lillian Kelty. Mrs. Kelty, who
appears to be a widow of the grass variety,
finds time in conducting her household
affairs to keep a couple of boarders. She
kept two all last winter and everything
went peacably until one of them, Daniel
Griswold, who says he is a clerk,went South
for his health. The remaining boarder
was a young man who says he is Dr. Robert
B. Haggard.

Griswold, it is admitted by the widow
Kelty, was her star boarder before he went
South. When he went away Dr. Haggard
supplanted him. A week ago Griswold
notified the widow that he was returning
ready to resume the place of honor in her
household

The widow told Dr. Haggard and they
decided to leave town for a few days. The
day they went away Griswold appeared
and took charge of the flat. Yesterday
afternoon the widow and Haggard came
back expecting to find that Griswold had

one. Instead they found him awaiting
them with a revolver

According to the widow and her neigh-
bors who heard her screams, Griswold
threatened to kill her. Dr. Haggard loudly
declared he would be her champion and
drew another and larger revolver.

The men were sizing each other up when
four Tenderloin policemen appeared. Gris-
wold Cropped his revolver, but Haggard
pocketed his weapon.

Followed by a!) the other tenants in the
house and a crowd from the street the two
men and the Widow Kelty were taken to the
Tenderloin station. There the widow made
a charge of attempted assault against
Griawold. Haggard, she said, was the
hero, but the police found his weapon in
his pocket and he was locked up for not
having a pistol permit. Mrs. Kelty hurried
away to get a bondsman for him.

YOUNG GIRLS ACCUSE KELLOCK.

 

 

 

 

 

Former Yonkers Fire Commissioner and a
Woman Arrested for Abduction.

Yonxenrs, May 7.—Robert Kellock, a for-
mer Yonkers Fire Commissioner and a well-
known builder, was arraigned in the Court
of Special Sessions charged with abduct-
ing Maggie Messerschmidt, aged 15, and

ters of a local merchant. Carrie E. Samp-
gon was charged with being an accessory

About four months ago Kellock's wife

dren. Some time later Kellock became

‘MAY ASK FOR CONFISCATION.

 

WAR ON MEAT PACK-
ERS TO BE RIGOROUS,

Bill Asking for Ipjunction Will Probably
Re Filed To-morrow —Rumor That It
Will Ask for Confiscation of Goods
Under Shipment—Notice of Fight.

Cnicaco, May 7.—Immediate request
for a temporary restraining bill and the
possibility that the Government may ask
that goods under shipment be confiscated
is the proogramme to be followed by the
Federal authorities in their assault upon
the beef packers. A semi-official state-
ment was made at the office of the United
States District Attorney to-day that the
bill would likely be filed early on Friday

The confiscation clause which, it is hinted
has been incorporated in the bill, grows
out of the mysterious relations existing
between the packers and the railroads.
The intimation that the Attorney-General
purposes to force the issue on the con-
fiscation clause of the Sherman Anti-Trust
act has caused alarm among the packers.

United States Attorney Bethea returned
from Washington to-day. He declined to
say what changes had been made in the
bill as originally prepared in Chicago, and
he evaded answering queries as to the pos-
sibilities of criminal prosecutions growing
out of the filing of the injunction against
the alleged Beef Trust.

The packers are not holding conferences.
Their attorneys say the case is one in which
no man cen prepare a deferce until the
Feieral bill is filed and it is known what it
contains. Jolin 8. Miller is busily engaged
in preparing to enter the fray,and is backed
by counsel for Armour, Morris, Swift,
Hammond and others. They will all ap-
pear in court assoon asthe billis filed. Mr.
Bethea has announced that he will notify
them of the day and hour, so that they can
fight the Government's request for an im-
mediate injunction if they so desire.

INDIANAPOLIS, May 7.—The meat dealers
throughout the mining districts in south-
western Indiana have nearly all quit hand-
ling beef owing to the refueal of the miners,
who are their leading customers, to buy
any beef at present high prices.

MISSOURI BEEF INQUIRY ENDS,

Attorney-General Says He Is Satisfied —Tes-
tmeny About Combine and Bad Meat.
JEFFERSON CiTrr, Mo., May 7.—The taking

of testimony in the Beef Trust investigation

closed this afternoon. Attorney-General

Crow says he is satisfied with the result.

He says that he did not need the testimony

of the packers, none of whom appeared.

The inquiry to-day brought out the follow-

ing testimony:

First, ‘a combine controls the trade and
fixes prices in St. Louis; second, meat from
diseased cattle and meat that has spoiled
in coolers is largely sold in St. Louis; third,
only West End butchers receive good beef
from the combine; fourth, the City Meat

 

Inspector only inspects meat sold to public |

institutions, the general public not being
srotected; fifth, butchers who do not buy
rom the trust are forced out of business.

Thomas L. O'Sullivan, for forty-two
years a butcher in St. Louis, testified that
