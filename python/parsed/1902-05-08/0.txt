he was very busy studying a huge volume
on his desk and did not pay the slightest
attention to the South Carolina Senator.
The Democrats said afterward that they
were disgusted with Mr. Tillman's speech
and desired to show their disapproval of
it. Althougha few hot heads on the Demo-
cratic side still say that they iatend to
resort to filibustering, if necessary, to
defeat the pending Philippine bill, it is
well known that they will not be supported

ALLIANCE.

TO RENEW TRIPLE
Austre-Huongarian Minister Announces That
Agreement Is Made.

Special Cable Despatch to Tur Sun

Buparesi, May 7.—Count Goluchowski,
Austro-Hungarian Minister of Foreign Af-
fairs, made his annual! statement before the
Budget Committee to-day. He said that
the Triple Alliance, which expires in May |
1908, is now approaching a renewal, the three |
Cabinets

 

 

 

concerned having exchanged |
formal assurances of a firm intention to
uphold the treaty in its full value and to
proceed in due course to sign the neces-
sary instruments.

This league, Count Goluchowski added
was founded on mutually coinciding inter-
ests, and was free from an aggressive ten-
dency. It would continue to pursue its
sublime pacific aims and with greater con-
fidanee since the repeated declarations re-
garding the peaceful objects of the Dual
Alliance confronting it show that the latter
combination isa valuable complement of
the Triple Alliance, promoting the same
ends,

The Minister then drew an analogy be-
tween these alliances and the Anglo-Jap-
anese alliance

Count Goluchowski referred to the rais-
ing of the Austro-Hungarian legation at
Washington to an embassy in consequence |
of the colossal development and daily |
increasing importance of the United States |
in the sphere of international politics and |
the growing interests of the monarchy in |
that country.

MINERS DEFER
CISION AT
Report That an Informal Vote Resulted
in Favor of a Strike by 16 to 12—Two
Sessions of the Committee Held —The
Conference to Be Continued To-day.

MAKING A DE-
SCRANTON.

 

SCRANTON, Pa., May 7.—The Executive
Committee of the United Mine Workers
summoned to pass upon the question of
strike or no strike in the anthracite coal
mining region, held two sessions here to-
day, and when the members adjournad at
5 o'clock this afternoon President Mitchell
Gave out this statement

“The Executive Committee is canvass-
ing the entire situation very carefully
No decision has been reached yet and the
committes will meet again to-morrow
morning at 9 o'clock.”

Pressed for an expression opinion
as to the outcome of the deliberations
of the convention, President Mitchell said
that he had heard nothing from any one
about alleged concessions made to the
miners by the operators

The great interest felt in the result of the
deliberations of the committee was shown
by the tremendous crowds that
about Carpenter's Hail, where the com-
mittee is meeting, while the members re-
mained in seasion. Noi an inkling of what
was going on inside found its way out of
the committee rooma

In the afternoon President Mitchell was
called from the committee room to hold a
long distance telephone conversation with
one in Chicago. The conversa‘ion

of

stood

 

some

was long and it was imagined that Mr
Mitchell was at last hearing of concessions
from the operators to the miners. Mr

Mitchell said, however, that he was merely
conversing with the labor leaders in Chicago
relative to a strike among the soft coal
miners in Lilinois

Arumor gained wide circulation this after.
noon that a test vote had been taken in the
committee, an informal vote by the way,
tosee how the members stood upon the ques-
tion of a strike. The story runs that the
vote showed 16 to 12 in favor of a strike
Mitchell was questioned this evening
relative to this test vote and evaded the
suibject by saying that he had notning fur-
ther to give out for publication

An important statement made during
the day that the firemen and pump
runners had finally decided to cast in their
Jot with the miners in case of a strike

was

There has been some doubt with regard
to this. These men have organizations |
of their own and owing to some trouble

last fall have not been too friendly toward

flooding of their mines

It seems to be the general belief here
| to-night

that the danger of a strike has

incidentally affiliated with the miners

private pressure is being exerted to pre-
ven! a strike, | it is feared that it will
not be sufficient to ward off the trouble

 

PHILADELP SIA, May 7.- Members of the
Philadelphia Stock Exchange seem to be
confident that there will no general
strike in the anthracite coal region. The
steadiness of Reading stock seems to lend
oolor to their belief President Baer, of the
Reading, in the face of repeated rumors
that he had consented to a compromise
and that an increase in wages from &

te

 

of

| to 7's per cent would be given to the miners,

declined to say a word, and he requested

 

 

 

other Reading officials to be silent
Coal operators ve think that John
Mitchell, Preaident of the Mine Workera, |
is in an tinpleasant position One of the
beat-known operators, conversant with
the aituation on both sides, said: *There
is little possitility of a strike of any 7
portion. The minersare murmuring ag

MOCK MARRIAGES BIND 200,

Purtm Ball Prank Results Serteusly for a
Hundred Couples,

Yongens, May 7

 

 

There is consternation

| in Jewish circ!es in this city over the serious
outeome of the mock marriage of fully

100 couples of the 200 that attended the
recent Purim ball at McCann's Hall, this
city. In the course of the ball somebody
suggested that each man select a partner
and go through a mock marriage. The
suggestion pleased many young persons
and fully 200, some of them said to have
been alreaiy married, went through the
Jewish marriage ceremony, including the
placing of a ring on the finger of the bride

Several days later a New York rabbi
informed several of the young persons that
according to the Hebraic law every Jone
of the marriages was valid. The matter
then eeased to be a joke. Several other
rabbis were consulted, and every one of
them pronounced the marriages valid,
because the mockere had not only used
rings, but had so faithfully repeated the
marriage pledges that it met all the re-
quirements of the Jewish religion

It is said that fully three-fourths of the
young will apply to
the courts to have the marriages annulled,
while the remainder wil! abide by the result,
A majority of those thus married are resi-

of this city, and are

MEYER HAD NO AUTHORITY TO
BRING HIS NAME IN.

Not Interested in Meyer's Speculations
~ His Connection With Dominion Se-
curi(ies and the Cape Breton Rallway

Fresh Reports of a Settlement.

Dr. William Seward Webb gave out last
night for publication the following state-
ment:

In view of the many conflicting rumors
which have been circulated in regard to the
relations existing between the Dominion
Securities Company, the Cape Breton Railway
Company, Mr A. L. Mever and myself, I
desire to say that there is not now, and there
never has been, any such thing as a “We bb-
Meyer Syndicate." I have been President
of the Dominion Securities Company and of
the Cape Breton Railway Company, in both
of which companies Mr. Meyer is a director,
being treasurer of the Dominion
Securities Company

My connection with

also

these companies has

been solely on account of my interest in the
building of the railroad which the Cape
Breton Railway Company was chartered

to construct, for the financing of which the
Dominion Securities Company became re-
sponsible The road is now in process of
construction. In this my entire attention
has been given to the supervision of the
physical construction of the railroad 1
have never had one dollar invested in the
Cape Breton Railway Company, either in
its stocks or bonds I simply agreed, for a
consideration, to supervise the construction
and building of that railway and act as Presi-
dent

Never, either before or since IT sold the
St. Lawrence.and Adirondack Railway to Mr
Meyer, have I bought or sold or traded in the
stock of that company, on the Stock Exchange
or anywhere else

I have never had any interest whatsoever
in a share of the Hackensack Meadows Com-
“ny, or the North American lumber and
Pulp Company, in fact, I never knew of the
existence of the latter company until last
Saturday

1 have never bought or traded in the shares
of the Dominion Securities Comnpany,

I have never had any interest whatsoever

in either the Quebec Southern Railway. or
South Shore Railway, both of which Mr
Meyer and his associates own

Last January I sold to Mr. Meyer 12.500

shares of the preferred stock of the Rutland
Railroad Company, whieh stock many weeks
ago 1 offered to take back at a higher price
than that at which | sold it to him

Ihave had no other dealings whatsoever with

Mr. Meyer, or any of his associates, so far as
I know them, nor has Mr. Meyer, nor any one
else, at any time, had any authority to repre-

nt that | was otherwise directly or indi-
rectly connected with any of his operations

Muller had attempted suicide a short time

All Want Him to Be the Next Archbishop,
Bishop MeqQuaid Sa

Bishop McQuaid of Rochester told his
friends among the clergy of this city yes-
terday that practically all of the Bishops
throughout the Province of New York
want Bishop Farley to succeed Archbishop
Corrigan, The consulters of the arch-
diocese are also unanimous in their support
of Bishop Farley

An intimate friend of Bishop McQuaid
said last night

“We want home rule in this archdiocese
and province, It is not at all necessary
to look beyond our own territory for a
successor to the Archbishop

“Bishop Farley, the Auxfiary Bishop of

| che archdiocese, is the natural successor,
and he will have the support of the entire
body of clergy. It would be abnormal to
transfer this archdiocese a man from
outside as has been suggested

“Bishop Farley was for years secretary
to Cardinal McCloskey and he is thorouglily
familiar with all the affairs of the arch-

 

lo

diocese. He has endeared himself to all
Catholics by his efforts in clearing the
seminary at Dunwoodie of its debt of

$400,000,”

SHE HUNTED HIM WITH AUTO.

Snatched Him From ‘That’ Hussy and
Bore Him Home.

As people were going into the American
Theatre last evening an automobile runa-
bout let a woman out at the Eighth avenue
entrance, She walked overtoa man who

was standing near the door talking to a

woman whose hair was very golden.

“Is that the way you are supposed to be |

working,” the woman who had alighted
from the automobile demanded of the man.
“Who is that hussy with you?”

The man didn't seem to be able to answer
on the spur of the moment and the woman
gave him a punch on the nose that drew
the blood. At that the golden-haired
woman ran for a hansom, jumped in and

told the driver to “drive like hell down
Righth avenue.” He did
crowd surrounded the man and the

| A
other woman and the police told them they
must move on. They got on the auto-
mobile and departed, the woman still talking
at the top of her voice.

On the back of the automobile were the
initials C. L. T

MAJOR STEPS DOWN TO CAPTAIN,

Cc, W. Smith of the 18th Voluntarily Takes
Lower Rank to Help His Old Company.
| Major Clarence Wilbur Smith, com-
manding the Third Battalion of the Thir-
; teenth Regiment, Heavy Artillery, an-
nounced Monday night that he would
probably relinquish his present rank and

 

take the Captaincy of Company E, his
old command. By doing so the Major
will create a precedent in the National

Guard of the State

It is understood Major Smith's reason
for returning to his former command is
his desire to see it retain its high place in
the regiment

Stealing and offering for sale plans of
Holland torpedo under con-
struction at the Union IronWorks, San Frane
cisco, is the charge against George H. Peterss
who has been employed by the torpedo
boat company. Peters was arrested yee
terday with John Graham, who said he
lived at the Rossmore Hotel, and had cards
was an agent for mines
and real estate, with offices in Montgomery
street, San Francisco, and at 49 Broadway,
New York

Peters employed by the torpedo
boat company at Suffolk and Elizabethport,
and finally at San Francisco, where he
worked as a stenographer and clerk. On
April 18 last he left the company of his own
accord, he says, and he had in his pocket

a letter of recommendation froin Marley _P.
Hay, superintendent of construction for

boats now

he

was

| the Holland company in San Franciaco,

About three weeks ago, according to the
complainant, T. W. Brady of the torpedo
boat company, advertisements were printed
in the papers here offering for sale plans
for tor ~ boats. The Holland company
didn't know then that any of its plans had
been stolen, but thought it would be worth
while to investigate, Brady communicated
with the advertiser and as a result: met
Graham at the Rossmore Hotel. Grahan
the police say, told Brady that he had a tue
set of torpedo boat plans, wanted money
badly and would dispose of them for cash.
After two further meetings Graham met
Brady at the Metropole Hotel yesterday
afternoon and exhibited a part of the come
ete set of plans for the Holland torpedo
wats Nos. 3 to 8, now being built on the
Pacific Coast

Graham, according to Brady, agreed to
sell the plans he showed for $3,000. Brady
offered to give him a check for that amount.
Graham protested, saying that he was not
known here and would have to be identified
at the bank. After some argument, Brady
agreed to take him to the Bank of New
Amsterdam at Thirty-ninth street and
Broadway and get the cash

Detectives O'Connell and Pepperted, who
had been notified of yesterday's meeting,
followed Brady and Graham to the bank,
In front of the bank Brady recognized
Peters, who was walking up and down,
pointed him out and had the detectives
Then Graham was arrested.

At Headquarters the police say Peters
confessed that he had stolen the plans
because he needed money and that he
hoped to sell them for from $10,000 to $15,000.
The rest of the plans, Peters said, were in
a storage house at Thirty-fourth street
and Eighth avenue. He gave an order to
Detective O'Connell, who got them there.

The plans are marked “United States
Submarine Boats 3 to § inclusive,” and also
“Holland Torpedo Boat Company.”

Peters said that he came to this $7
three weeks ago, went to Montreal to t
relatives and while there was notified by
Graham that he had a buyer for the plans.
Graham, he said, was innocent of any
knowledge that the plans had been stolen,
