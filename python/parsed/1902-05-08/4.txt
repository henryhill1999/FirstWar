POLICEMEN CANNOT RIDE FREE

NOR FIREMEN—NOR CAN THEY
USE TELEPHONES GRATIS.

 

 

pemovable From Office if They Do—Law
on the Back of Their Certificates of
Appointment Declared Unconstita-
tional—They Are Public Officers.

ALBANY, May 7.—The Appellate Division
handed down a decision to-day to the effect
that policemen and firemen are public
officers so far as the Constitutional pro-
vision which prohibits public officers from
using passes is concerned. The case came
up as a result of the Mayor of Albany en-
deavoring to compel the local traction
company to carry free members of the
Albany Police and Fire departments who
preeented certificates from the Mayor <f
employment by the city either as firemen
or policemen, The Mayor held that the
firemen and policemen were public servants
as distinguished from public officers. The
court denies this contention,

The court also says that the act of 1895
js unconstitutional, beause in compelling
the transportation companies to give police-
men free rides it deprives the companies
of their property without due process of
law and takes private property for public
use without compensation

 

The firemen and policemen of this city
have been riding on the street and
rurface care on passes issued under the
special law enacted for their benefit in 1805,
which it appears is now declared to be un-
constitutional There are at present sev-
eral thousand passes in use by members of
the Police Department, although it has been
the rule among policemen in uniform to
ride on street cars free. Similar privileges
have been granted to uniformed firemen.

A copy of the special iow of 1895, passed
to er she firemen and policemen to ride
free is printed upon the back of each cer-
tificate of appointment issued to firemen
and policemen, It says

It shall be the duty of every street, sur-
face and elevated railroad company carry-
ing on business within such city or village
of this State to transport every policeman
or fireman free of charge while he is travel-
ling in the course of the performance of the
duties of his office,

The law further save that every telephone
or telegraph company shall afford to every
policeman or fireman the use of its wires
to make and receive reports and commurt-
cations in the course of the performance
of his official duties. Section & of Article
XIII, of the State Constitution says:

No public officer or person elected or ap-
pointed to a public office, under the laws
of this State, shall directly or indirectly
ask, demand, accept, receive or consent
to receive for his own use or benefit, or for
the use or benefit of another, any free pass,
free transportation or franking privilege
or discrimination in telegraph or telephone
rates, from any person or cor rvoration, or
make use of the same himself or in con-
junction with another 4 person who vio-
Jates any provision of this section shall
be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor, and
shall forfeit his office at the suit of the
Attorney General Any corporation, or offl-
cer, or agent thereof, who shall offer, or
promise to a public officer any such free
yass, free transportation, franking — privi-
tone or transportation shall also be deemed
lity of a misdemeanor and liable to pun-
ishment except as herein provided

When asked for an opinion on the sub-
ject yesterday Corporation Counsel Rives
rail the law of 1895 was undoubtedly un-
constitutional, and that the question who
were public officers had been decided long
ago. In 1895 the courts held that even a raii-
road policeman had no right to use a free
piss, and that @ notary public was a pur _>
« ffleer.

Police Inspectors and Captains have
been in the habit of distributing books
of railroad tickets to policemen on special
duty and those who do plain-clothes duty
in the various precincts. These books
are received from the railroad companies.
Each book is good for a hundred free rides.
Some of the officers of the Fire Department
are similarly equipped.

  

 

 

DO ONE THING WELL.

Dr. Rainsford Advises St. George's School-
boys to Beware of Shiftiness.

Commencement exercises of St. George's
Evening Trade School were held last even-
ing at 207 East Sixteenth street. Twenty-
one boys were graduated. The Rey. Dr
W.S. Rainsford in addressing the school
said i

“Boys, I just want to say one thing to
you. We want you to learn to do some-
thigg—some one thing—thoroughly well
It's harder to-day to get a man to do first-rate
carpentering than it was when I was a boy.
There are plenty of carpenters, but that is
another thing

“The weakness of the East Side boy is
that he changes around too much. One
fellow came to me not long ago. He had

been in six trades or occupations in five
or six years. He had been a policeman,
4 fireman, an engineer and other things
Well, I'm sorry for the man who had to
give him the seventh job, for he hadn't
put his whole energy into anything.”

President John H. Patterson of the Na-
tional Cash Kegister Company of Dayton,
Ohio, told the boya that he had tried, when
a boy, to induce his father to buy wagons
and things for him, but that his father nad
refused to do eo and had insisted that he
make them for himself because he wanted
the boy to know how to work,

Mr. Patterson then told of having met out

DADY WILL RESIGN TO-NIGHT.

 

 

Not His 835,000 Job as Election Commis

sioner, but as First Assembly Leader.

Michael J, Dady's resignation as Republi-
can Executive Committeeman from the
First Assembly district in Brooklyn is to
be considered to-night, at a meeting of the
Assombiy district committée and the dele-
gates to the county committee

The meeting was called at Dady's request
and he declared yesterday that he would
insist that bis resignation be accepted
At the same time he announced that he had
no intention whatever to give up his $5,000
a year official job as Election Commissioner,
in #pite of the fact that his private affairs
compelled him to make frequent trips to
Cuba and elsewhere

About fifty political opponents of Dady
met last night at the Brooklyn Anthenwum
and took steps looking to a reorganization
of the enrolled Republican voters of the
First Assembly district. Plans were
adopted for the appointment of several
committees, which are to act with the
General Reform Committee of 250 in the
work of political purification,

$753,000 TO CHURCH AND PASTOR.

Judgment Taken Against the Slow-Paying
Splite-House Richardson Estate.

The Rev. Harry M. Warren, pastor of
the Central Park Baptist Church, obtained
two judgments in the Supreme Court yes-
terday against Emma J, Richardson as
administratrix and Benjamin Nicoll as
administrator of the estate of Joseph Rich-
ardson, together for $74,947 50

By the provisions of the will of Richard-
son of “Spite House” fame Dr. Warren was
to have $50,000 individually and a further
bequest of $17,500 to pay off the obligations
on the church

Ineffectual efforts have been made by the
clergyman to obtain the legacies through
the Surrogate’s Court

The representatives of the estate urged
that claims against the estate by the testa-
tor's daughter, Della Richardson, and his
niece, Emily Emmett, exceed the amount
of the estate

The judgments were taken on default.

Alfred R. Goslin, the bucket-shop man,

is in the penitentiary to serve six months

 

 

 

for circulating false rumors about the
Brooklyn Rapid Transit Company. His
sentence was affirmed recently by the

Court of Appeals

When the case was called yesterday morn-
ing in the criminal branch of the Supreme
Court he did not appear and Justice Scott

But in a few minutes Goslin came in, ac-
companied by his counsel, Abraham Gruber.
Mr. Gruber explained that he thought the
case was to be called later in the day
Justice Scott cancelled the bond and com-
mitted Goslin to the Tombs. In the after-

KINGS INSISTS ON RENOMINA-
TING THE LIEUT.-GOVERNOR.

 

Intimation That the state Machine Will
Roll Over the County Machine Hard
if «That Isn't Dropped — Senator
Higgins of Olean Is on the Slate.

Lieut.-Gov. Timothy Lester Woodruff of
Kings has sailed away to Europe to be gone
for a ceuple of months, and with Gov. Odell
out of the State and Senator Timothy E
Ellsworth, President pro tem. of the Senate,
also absent, Speaker S. Frederick Nixon
of Westfield, Chautauqua county, is acting
Governor. Gov. Odell expects to return
to Albany on May 23. Meanwhile Speaker
Nixon will rustle around in the executive
chair at Albany and ascertain how it feels
to be Governor.

Mr. Woodruff desires to be nominated
for the fourth time for Lieutenant-Gov-
ernor by the Republican State Convention
this fall. There is no mistake about this,
for it comes directly from Mr. Woodraff
and his personal friends. The propo-
sition for several months has been to nomi-
nate for Lieutenant-Covernor this fall
Senator Frank Wayland Higgins of Olean,
Cattaraugus county. Indeed, Senator Platt
and others of the Republican leader's friends
have spoken up for Senator Higgins, and
in view of this situation Senator Horace
White of Syracuse has definitely withdrawn
himself as a candidate for Lieutenant-
Governor.

The personal friendship bet ween Senator
Higgins and Senator White is so strong

/

that either would give way to the other |

in political matters, While nothing hes
been settled concerning Senator Higgins
and the Lieutenant-Governorship, it has
been all along considered that Mr. Higgins
was to get the nomination,

Now, however, Mr. Woodruff speaks up
and saya that he wants to be nominated
for the fourth time, and his friends in Kings
county declare that he must receive this
extraordinary honor or there will be acircus
in the Republican State convention, Mr
Woodruff and his friends believe that he
should be nominated again in order to keep
him in Republican State politics; that Mr.
Woodruff cannot afford to drop out for a
year or two, as he has not the personal or
political strength to stand such a hiatus

Things from a Republican standpoint
are pretty well tangled upin Kings county
and the organization in the Heavenly
Borough is not regarded with particularly
high favor just at the moment, Still Mr
Woodruff's friends declare that he must
be nominated for Lieutenant-Governor
or they will know the reason why, and it
looks now, from all that can be ascertained,
as if the Kepublican State Convention
would roll over Mr. Woodruff and his lieu-
tenants if they are not mighty careful.

WINNERS OF THE INTERCOLLEGI-

Hitcheock Makes a 76, an Amateur Record
Equaticd Only by Travis on the Links
Walter Egan and Murdock the Only
Successful Players for Cambridge.

There was a splendid finish in the team final
of the Intercollegiate Golf Association yes-
terday at the Garden City Golf Club. Hiteh-
cock of Yale made a 75, a record unbeaten
over the links by any amateur except Walter
J Travis. The joy of the Yale players over
the achievement of their captain was sur-
passed only by their joy over the defeat of
Harvard for the championship, the first time
this has happened since the spring tourney
of 1808 Under the system of counting in
use by the collegians the score was 13 to 6 for
Yale, the regular way it would have been 18
to 6 The Hitcheock and Brown match at-
tracted all the disengaged golfers and the
onlookers who had come down from the city,
Fo that the crowd in its wake was a notable
on Although hazy, the day was delightful

In the morning the only player to score
for Harvard was Walter Egan, and every
collegian who had ever said a disparaging
thing about the claimsof the runner-up to
Travis to the honor, promptly took it back
The Litcheock and Brown match, the latter
champion at Harvard, was halved, and it was
not apparent on the morning play that Hiteh-
cock had a surprise in store for the public
In the other matches the leads of the Yalen-
siansranged from one up to three up. The

REPANS

A workman in the Dennison Mfg,
Co. of Boston had been obliged to
work evenings, and the hurry with
his meals had caused indigestion
and constipation, causing him much
trouble.

Hearing of Ripans Tabules
he bought some to try, and states
that they have done him much good.
He can now work extra time with-
out the bad feeling he had in his
stomach before using the Tabules.

ordinary occasion, The family boitle,

Paine’s Celery Compound

Banishes
Nervous Prostration, Hysteria,

and Sleeplessness.

Any intelligent man or woman can easily
detect victims of nervous troubles by taking
a ten minute walk on any of the crowded
streets of our cities or towns. The ob-
server will note countenances full of feverish
anxiety, harassed looks, unsteady handa,
faltering steps, twitching muscles, pallid
faces, and startled, anxious looks when

unusual noises are made. Such people
are, without doubt, victims of nervous
prostration, hysteria, or insomnia. The

whole system suffers--the brain, the spinal
cord, and the sympathetic system.

It is unnecessary to dilate minutely on
the causes of nervousness. Business cares
and disappointments, haste after riches
and honors, social and household worries,
sexual and alcoholic excesses, watching
and anxiety, and loss of near and dear
ones, all contribute to the breaking down
of the nervous organism of men and women.

In earnest words we set before this af-
flicted class the truth that Paine's Celety
Compound affords a speedy and sure cure
for all forms of nervous diseases, The
great medicine is a perfect restorer of
nerve foree and power; a sure builder and
etrengthener of the weak and debilitated
syetemn

Paine's Celery Compound has enabled
thousands in every city and town of our
land to renew and invigorate their health
and keep their places in business and in
In all large centres where nervous
diseases are common, the best physicians
prercribe Paine's Celery Compound with
continued success

A few bottles of nature's health restorer
used during the month of May will com-
pletely banish all nervous disorders, by
giving new nerve force, purer blood, better
digestion, normal appetite, and refreshing
sleep. In a word, Paine's Celery Com-
pound will give you the full powers of
robust manhood and true womanhood.

The Sunday Sun
Carries Sunshine
With Ii.

Here is a violation of
confidence. It comes from a
man's letter to a girl who
loves him and who proves it
by sending the Sunday Sun
way up beyond Winnipeg
to him every week:

“What bothers me now,
dear, is@vondering how I ever
failed to understand why you
and your mother were Sunday
Sun cranks. I used to think
I was too busy to read newspapers,
There is no such superstition
hanging around me now, so, nature
ally, I have had a chance to
see what here was in THE Sun,

It is home, club, business and
town for me here. Don't ever
stop sending it unless you are
to come in its place youreelf,
unless you want me to die of
loneliness and gloom

“No, you needn't send any more
of the others, thanks. Every room tf
the shack is papered now and we
haven't any more use for them,”

This is quoted to show that
sometimes a little deprivation
teaches us a lot about the comparas
tive value of things.
