SAVINGS BANKS IN FINE SHAP

And Still Have #200,000,000 Left Over
—Good Report to the State Bankers
at Their Annual Meeting —-Congress
man Hill Speaks Out for the Fowler Bill

Andrew Mills, President of the Dry Dock
Bavings Bank, and retiring President of
the Savings Banks’
Btate, in calling the annual meeting of the
association to order yesterday said in the
course of his address:

“It is interesting to note that to-day the
depositors of the banks of this State could
pay the entire national debt of $1,931,000,-
000 and still have $200,000,000 remaining.”

The meeting was held in the rooms of the
Chamber of Commerce.

equalize the rates of interest throughout
the country, and further amend the National
Banking laws.”

Prior to the delivery of the address a
resolution was passed pledging the associa-
tion to make no public expression of opinion
except through the Executive Committee
or after a general meeting of the associa-
tion had considered the matter at issue.
This resolution was adopted because of the
action of certain of the members of the
association, who, under a misapprehension
signed a petition to Gov. Odell requesting
him to sign the bill authorizing the pur-
chase by savings banks of the bonds of the
city of Los Angeles, Cal., although the
Executive Committee had disapproved of
the proposition.

Congressman Hill said in the course of
his address:

1 take the position here to-day that the
United States has no more right to put in
clreulation any form of legal tender money
Which it will not redeem in the money of the
standard which it has itself

some Democrats, who were driven by public
sentiment to cast a like vote then, now gay

How Northern Securities Co. Raised It Not
Stated—No Bonds Sold.

Officers of the Northern Securities Com-
pany were asked yesterday about the
statement made in the answer vo United
States Attorney-General Knox's suit, that
$49,000,000 in cash had been expeneded by
this company in the purchase of Great
Northern and Northern Pacific shares.

Col. Clough, Vice-President of the North-
ern Securities Company, said that it was
found necessary to pay cash for some of
the lots of stock purchased by the holding
company, and that the $40,000,000 was
applied for such purchases.

The manner in which this $40,900,000
was raised by the $409,000,000 corporation
will not be disclosed for the present. The
statement is authoritatively made, how-
ever, that no bonded indebtedness has
been created. All of the shares of the
Great Northern and the Northern Pacific
companiea, it is asserted, were acquired
by direct purchase. Some of the former
holders of stocks in the two railroad com-
panies demanded cash and received it,
and others took their payment part in cash
and part in stock of the Northern Securities
Company. No fixed price governed in
these transactions. Some holders received
more than others, and the figures varied

 

considerably from the basis agreed upon |
later for an exchange of the stock of the |

Northern Securities Company for the
shares of the two railroad companies

The fact that $40,000,000 in cash had been |

expended by the Northern Securities Com-

pany for the stocks of the Great Northern |
and the Northern Pacific companies was |
stated in the holding company’s answer |

to Attorney-General Knox's complaint,
avowedly for the purpose of making the
point that the Northern Securities Com-
pany had acquired the stocks of the two
railroad companies by actual purchase
and not merely in the way of a general
exchange of securities.

L. & N. SHORTS SQUEEZED.

John W. Gates Credited With the Pinch
That Sent the Stock to 146.

There was a squeeze of the “shorts” in
Louisville and Nashville stock on the New
York Stock Exchange yesterday, with the
price of the stock rushing up to 146, a
new high record. It closed at 143, or 1%
points above Tuesday's closing price. The
total sales were 44,700 shares.

The upward movement was credited
to John W. Gates. Some of the foreign
arbitrage houses are thought to have been
caught short, pending the arrival of stock
from Europe for delivery against their
sales. Certain Englishmen are said to
have sold calls upon a large amount of the
stock last month and are now finding it
necessary to make delivery.

The $6,000,000 of new stock, whose delay
in listing threatened a corner a month ago,
was listed in the Stock Exchange yesterday.
This appears to remove the possibility of a
serious squeeze to local interests.

Werpwnespar, May 7.

The possibility of a strike of the ‘nited
Mine Workers and the activity in the money
market were the overshadowing influences
affecting values
responded quickly to every rumor of
favorable or unfavorable developments
at the conference of the Executive Com-
mittee of the miners’ organizations, but
at this writing no news of a definite charac-
ter has been received. The prevailing
opinion during the day seemed to be, as it
Was yesterday, that a strike would be
averted; nevertheless, the anxiety and
uncertainity regarding the situation were
reflected in the irregular movements in
socurities. Money rates were somewhat
easier, up to the last hour, than for the
last day or two, but more or less urgent
demands by borrowers late in the day
resulted in a maximum rate of 15 per cent.

The opening was a trifle uncertain, there
apparently being an inclination to await
further news from the coal regions, but the
market shortly developed strength and up

corded for it, and at a reaction of 8 per
cent., closed 1% points higher than last
night; and Southern Railway, after having
sold at 88%, closed with a net gain of one-
The activity in these
stocks is ascribed to the clique of Western
operators that has been working in them for
some time past, and rumors of closer re-
lations between the two roads were in-
dustriously circulated as has been the case
heretofore when operations in these stocks
have been in progress.
note that, although the 50,000 shares of
stock recently issued by the Louisville and
Nashville Company were admitted to deal-
ings on the Stock Exchange to-day, the
new stock was not sufficient to meet the

Bid. Asked,

operations of the corporation for the fiscal
vear ending March 31 last, presented to the
directors yesterday afternoon, makes an
excellent showing, and it is estimated that
the earnings for the months of April and
May will be remarkably large.
port of the Tennessee Coal, Iron and Rail-
road Company was made public to-day,
and it induced considerable selling of the
stock of that company
ever, seems to be a careful statement of
the company's condition, and the manage-
