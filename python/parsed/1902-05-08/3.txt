REFUTES CHARGES OF CRUELTY
SECRETARY fO0OT'S REPLY TO A

 

 

He Says Orders Issued by Gens. Bell and
Smith Were in Strict Conformity With
General Order 100, Which Was Ap-
proved by Abraham Lincoln —These
Orders Have Resulted in Putting an
End to Assassination and in the Vol-
untary Surrender of Men and Arms.

Wasurnaron, May 7.—Secretary Root
sent to the Senate to-day a reply to the
resolution calling for copies of ordera sent
to Gen. Bell and Gen. Smith, or of orders
issued by them
copy of an order issued by Gen. Bell at
Batangas, in December, declaring that
whérever prisoners of war or unarmed or
defencelesa Americans or natives friencly

The reply opens with a | ferred Omnibus Statehood bill, to admit

to the United States are murdered or ase |

sassinated for political reasons, and this
fact can be established, it was his purpose
to execute a prisoner of war, who would be
selected by lot from officers or prominent
eltizens held as prisoners--this, under
the law authorizing retaliation. Secretary
Root says this order is based on General
Order 100, which was approved by Abra-
ham Lincoln. He adds

“The orders mentioned in the resolution
and the above quoted order of Dec. 13,
received at the same time, were in strict
Oonformity both with the letter and the
spirit of these instructions. The instruc-
tions themselves were a contribution to
civilization of great and universally recog-
nized value and authority.

“Within the present month the War De-
partment has received a report of the con-
dition of the natives collected in the con-
centration camps provided for by Gen.
Rell's order of Dec. 8, 1901, shown by an
inspection made by Col, Arthur L. Wagner
of the Adjutant-General's office, by which
{t appears that natives collected in these
camps were well-fed, healthful and con-
tented. From the fact that the report
was forwarded by Gen. Chaffee with the
following indorsements, I infer that
orders referred to in the resolution had that
officer's approval.”

Secretary Root appends the
ment of Gen. Wheaton as follows

This report Ulustrates the conditions ex-
isting in the towns where the inhabitants
have been assembled. This concentration
was made for the purpose of protecting
the natives from the guerrilla bands in the
provinces of Laguna and Batangas

After more than two years’ occupation
of these provinces !t has been found im-
possible to exterminate these bands or capture
their leadera, owing to the relgn of terror
which they exercised over the inhabitants
Their systematic assassination—sometimes
by burying allve—of natives who refused
to contribute to the support of the insur-
rection, enabled them to wring a steady
war revenue from people presumably en-
Joying the privileges of free government
and the protection of the United States
This has now terminated; nearly all the arms
in the hands of guerriilas have been captured
or have been surrendered, and there is a
prospect of an early termination of disturbed
conditions in provinces under wilitary con-
trol. It is expected that within sixty days
people assembled in the towns can be ree
turned to their former places of abode

Secretary Root also gives Gen. Chaffee’s
indorsemeuat as follows

It is useless for me to make an attempt to
show the necessity for the course adopted
in the third and sixth orders to put an end
to the active insurrection existing there in
such a way that all persons will agree that

indorse-

right action has been taken; [t is impossible, |

for me to do this. I will state,
however, sonal contact with the
people, a knowledge of their methods and
sentiments, a personal acquaintance with
the terrain and what may be done by an
enemy as by troops, ere all essential to de-
termine what should be done before con-
demnuing what has been done It is also
necessary that some other method be sug-
ested and positive proof submitted that,
nad it been followed, more success corre-
spondingly would have followed ita adoption
than has been secured by the present course
I don't understand that the authority of
the United States tn these islands can be
indefinitely disputed by armed forces without
efforts to terminate the resistance to that
authority
that all means that
of war are to be applied ir
t

of course,

  
 

e justified by the laws
such form as will

 

 
 

 

meet and dete the method of warfare
adopted by the enemy If Goaperate in the
last case, more desperate must be the attuck
to end it

Every care has been taken that people

required to remain under military surveillance
shall not unduly suffer for food, shelter or
medical attendance If needed

Secretary Root adds: “The War Denart-
ment aaw no reason to doubt that the policy
embodied in the
Was at once the most effective and the
most humane which could possibly be fol-
lowed, and so it has proved. Within a
comparatively few weeks after this policy
was inaugurated the guerrilla warfare in
Batangas and Laguna and the adjacent
regions, with all accompaniments of
long-continued suffering, destruction and

-The Interment in Arlington Cemetery |

WasHINnotoN, May 7.—-The funeral of
Rear Admiral Sampson, which will take
place on Friday next, will bo one of the
most imposing spectacles ever seen in
Washington, a city that has had many |
notable military parades. It will equal, |
if not exceed, in mournful impressiveness
the display of marching soldiers and dis-
tinguished public men when Major-Gen. ;
Henry Lawton was borne to his last rest-
ing place. Asin Lawton's case, the funeral
services wil! be held at the Presbyterian +
Church of the Covenant, au! tie inter- |
ment at Arlington National Cemetery,
the former baronial estate of Robert E.
Lee, where rest the remains of Sheridan
and other distinguished Civil War mili-
tary leaders, countless numbers of sol-
diers and sailors who fell in the battles
of that great conflict, the Maine dead,
and hundrede of men of the army, the |
navy and the marine corps, who lost their
lives in Cuba, the Philippines and China
within the past four years.

The body of the dead naval officer lay
all day at his late residence, at the cor-
ner of New Hampshire avenue and Cor-
coran street, where it was viewed by many
of his former comrades in arms, who had
known him intimately in life. In defer-
ence to the wishes of the naval contingent,
by whom Admiral Sampson was regarded
as one of the greatest men the nary had
ever produced, Mrs. Sampson agreed
to-day that the interment should be at
Arlington, instead of at his boyhood home
in Palmyra, N. Y., where Mrs. Sampson
resided also when she and the Admiral
were married

Capt. French E. Chadwick, who com-
manded Admiral Sampson's flagship, the
armored cruiser New York, and was his
chief of staff throughout the trying days
of the West Indian nava! campaign, arrived
in town to-day from an official visit to the
North Atlantic squadron, off the Virginia
capes, and assumed general charge of the
arrangements for the funeral. In this he
is being assisted by Lieutenant -Com-
mander Cameron McK. Winslow and

|
'
|

Lieut. Walter S Crosley of the Navy
Department. At the end of the day
most of the arrangements had been

made, but the programme will not be com-
pleted until to-morrow, when Secretary
of the Navy Moody will issue a genera! order
giving the details and prowiding for appro- |
priate tribute to Admiral Sampson's memory |
on ships of war and at navy yards and
nava) stations

The tentative programme arranged to-
day provides for the removal of the Ad-
miral’s remains from his late residence on
Friday morning to the Church of the Coven-
ant, corner of Eighteenth and N streets,
where religious services will be held at
10:30 o'cloc The body will then be es-
corted to Arlington for interment. The
Rev. Teunis 8. Hamlin, the pastor will offic-
jate at the services. It is expected that
the congregation will be one of the most
distinguished ever seen in the national
capital, and that there will be a greater at-
tendance of naval officers than ever before
on a public oceasion

Secretary Moody has issued invitations
to the church services to President Roose-
velt, the members of the Cabinet, the Chief
Justice and the Associate Justices of the
Supreme Court, and other men of high
official standing, and the President pro
tem. of the Senate and the Speaker of the
House will be asked to-morrow to send
special delegations from the bodies over
which they preside.

Although the naval regulations require
only four battalions of marines and seamen
as a funeral escort for a senior Rear Ad-
miral, the Navy Department, as a mark of
special honor to the notable services per-
formed by Admiral Sampson in the Spanish-
American War, will endeavor to assemble
@ greater nuinber of men for the occasion
The tentative programme provides for an
escort consisting of the entire battalion of
cadeta from the United States Naval Acad-
emy at Annapolis, two battalions of sea
men form the veasels of the North Atlantic
squadron and the despatch boat Dolphin,
two and perhaps three battalions of marines
and a battery of field artillery furnished |
by the army. The body will be borne to
the grave on an artillery caisaon

Lieutenant-Commander Winslow and
Lieut. Crosley have been busy al! day send-
ing celearanhie orders to Rear Admiral

| Higginson, commanding the North Atlantic

@yuadron, and to the Commandants of
navy yards and stations, in regard to send-
ing seamen and marines to Washington,
and in making arrangements with the
railroad companies for their transportation
The battalions from the North Atlantic
equadron will be landed at Norfolk and
brought here by rai

The list of pallbearers haa not been com-
pleted. It is headed with the name of
Admiral Dewey, who to-nigh! consented t
serve. There was some talk of asking
Lieut -Gen. Miles to be a pallbearer, but the
suggestion was not carried out, the

reason assigned being that the list would
be confined to naval men The naval
regulations provide that there shall be
eix pallbearers for a Rear Admiral, but
there will probably be a greater number
for Admiral Sampson It ie the desire of
the Navy Department and Mra, Sampaon

The general order to be issued by Secre-

SAMPSON'S HEART BROKEN.

Former Secretary Long Says Abuse Mid It
~His Great Ability.

HincnaM, Mass., May 7.~The Hon. John
D. Long, former Secretary of the Navy,
was deeply affected by the news of the
death of Admiral Sampson. He said

“Iam much pained to hear of the death
of Admiral Sampson, though it isnot un-
expected. He stood very high in the navy,
having filled many of its most responsible
positions. His career as commander-in-
chief of the Atlantic squadron during the
recent war was especially creditable

“He was in charge of all the vessels—a
great number; had charge of thewhole block-
ade; codperated with the army in its land-
ing and gavethe ordera and made the pre-
parations which resulted in the great
naval victory off Santiago.

“He was very modest and unassuming;
had none of the arte of popularity; knew
only his duty.

“I am sure, however, that history will do
him justice. There is nothing so pathetio
as that such a man deemved antl praise
and gratitude,and yet has probably died
of a heart broken by abuse and misrepre-
sentation.”

COMMENCEMENT SEASON OPENS.

Presentation Day at the National College
for Deaf Mutes.

Wasnrtnoton, May 7.—-The Commence-
ment season of 1902 was initiated in Wash-
ington this afternoon with the thirty-eighth
anniversary of presentation day at the
National College for Deaf Mutes at Kendall
Green, the only institution of its kind
in the world. Many distinguished people
were present. Justice Brewer of the
United States Supreme Court, who ad-
dressed the twenty-seven members of the
graduating class, gave them some practical
advice. Several of the graduates made
oral addresses, showing remarkable pro-
ficiency

Among those who received degrees
were a number of young men and young
women who are not deaf mutes, but have
taken a course at the college to fit them-
selves for teaching in deaf-mute schools.
A design submitted in the Grant monument
competition by Douglas Tilden, the deaf-
mure seulptor of California, was exhibited
in the museum

THRICE ROBRED BY SERVANTS,

 

Mrs. Freewald Is Losing Confidence tn

Butlers and Police.

There were lively times yesterday morn-
ing at the breakfast hour in the boarding-
house of Mrs. Sarah Freewald at 125 West
117th street. A butler who said his name
was Mark Bruno, left the house earifer inthe
day taking all the table silverware. Bruno
came to the boardinghouse mistress two
days ago with several letters of recommen-
dation. She engaged him and he said he
liked the place very much

Mre. Freewald says that she has been
robbed three times within six months and
that the police have done nothing but take
of the stolen goods. The first robbery
was committed by a woman servant, who
said it wus the best place to work she had
ever had. A few days later she disap-
peared with $600 worth of silverware and
About six weeks ago a butler
she had engaged went away taking some
more silverware and whatever else he
could find

The last butler she engaged made a still
better job of it. He stripped the parlor
of bric-A-brac and then carried away
what was left of the silver,

Mrs. Freewald telephoned to Police
Headquarters and told them of the rob-
bery Che police of the West 125th atreet
station were called up and told to investi-

lists

ate the robbery. A few minutes later
letective Connolly came around, took
stock of what had been stolen and said

that he would start to work on the case

“Perhaps if | gave you $100 as the man
did who jost his diamond pin, vou would
do something for me,” said Mre. Freewald
to the detective, Connolly got mad and
said she had no right to make such an in-
sinuation

ANOTHER BIG RUSH IN PHILA-

DELPHIA CIGAR FACTORY.

Eight Girls Lost Their Lives There Last
Week—Girl Had Hysierice Yesterday
Over the Antics cf a Mosician and
It Started a Panic Immediately.

 

PHILADMLPAIA, May 7.—For the second
ti within a week the girl cigarmakers
in the American Cigar Company's factory,
Tenth street and Washington avenue,
became panic stricken and made a wild
rush to escape from the building. Only
the coolness of Thomas J. Lappin, a fac-

| tory inspector, who happened to be present,

and one of the foremen, prevented a repe-
tition of the disaster of last Wednesday,
when eight girls lost their lives in a similar
rush for supposed safety.

The antics of the musician employed
by the company to amuse the girls at a
plano, yesterday caused one to laugh 80
heartily that she went into hysterics. This
girl's actions and cries caused the several
hundred other girls to arise from their

seats in terror as though impelled by one |
my restoration to health
| ful.

common impulse. Forgetting the result
of last week's panic, which happened in
the same room, the girls made a dash for
the door leading to the tower stairway.

Inspector Lappin was standing in the
room and shouted that there was ee
the matter and ordered all to be seated.
This order was translated into Italian
immediately, A few hesitated, then obeyed
the order. Inspector Lappin then hurried
as fast as he dared under the circumstances
to the doorway, but some fifty or sixty
girls had escaped.

“(’U kill the first girl who tries to get by,
yelled Mr. Lappin. “Go back to your seats.”

The foremen moved about among the
frightened women, and the musician played
some lively tunes. Mr. Lappin’s action and
the words of the foremen finally quieted the

irl’s and those headed for the door realized
their fears were undless. The girls took
their seats, and those who fled to the street
returned to work.

It seems that @ rumor had gained ground
among the girls that an attempt to yi w
up the factory with dynamite was (0 be
made by Italians, because most of those
kUed and injured last week belonged to
that nationality. While the girls put no
credence in the report, it is said they had
talked it over and became nervous. Half
an hour after the panic four girls fainted,

The girl supposed to have led the rush
was suspended, The superintendent says
that any girl who leaves her seat hereafter
under @imilar circumstances will be dis-

charged.
GAVE $30 FOR A BAD $100 BILL.

Newly-Landed Italian Tricked and Com-
plains to the Police.

An Italian immigrant gave $30 to a
stranger yesterday morning as his share
of a hundred-dollar bill which they had
discovered simultaneously in a West street
gutter. The bill was worthless and the
Italian complained to the police.

Yesterday evening Detective Shaeffler
saw “Monk” Peterson of 262 First avenue
in West street and caught him after a chase
to Watts and Washington streets. Shaef-
fler said that Peterson had worked the
discovered-bill game before. At the station
house nothing was discovered on Peterson
more dangerous than some false jewelry,
which he said was intended as a present
for his wife

He couldn't explain his filght except as
caueed by “natural timidity” and was
locked up as a suspicious character.

 

MOST'S LANGUAGE SAVED HIM.

Police Didn't Know German, So He Goes
Free Will Serve His Sentence.

John Moet, who was arrested at the Anar-
chist meeting Sunday night in New Irving
Hall in Broome street was discharged yes-
terday in the Essex Market police court
because the detectives who arrested him
did not understand German and could not
swear to what Moet said in his speech.

When Most went outside he was cheered
by his admirers. He said he was going
downtown to give himself up and com-
mence serving his sentence of a year in the
pe iitentiary for distributing incendiary
iterature

I now weigh 158 pounds, eleep well
and have a good appetite. I never felt
better in all my life. I have recommended
your whiskey to several of my friends, and
they have used it with like results.

Nature does
most
things

She grows wheat
and when people ext
. " wheat it keeps then,
alive. No living man can tell why,

Nature grows the poppy, and from the
poppy comes opium, and when people ea:
it they die. Again the unanswerable ques
tion, “Why?”

Nature grows rhubarb, and everybody
knows that rhubarb loosens the bowels
& ony man able to tell “why?” :

Nature grows the blackbe: and
you take the juice of this berry it Checks
se bowels. Still again the question,
a is another product of Na-
ture, and it puts people to sleep. *Why?"*

Nature makes the vegetable things that
are put into Omega Oil, and Omega (i!
cures Rheumatism, Neuralgia, Stiff Joints
tore Feet and Muscles. ‘

{ stops pains and aches in f
bodies. , ars

All the professors, scientists, doctors
and philosophers that ever drew breath
of life cannot tell why F
wn it really doesn't matter ff they can't

What good would it do if they could tell?

So long as suffering is overcome, that is
all we need to know.—Aadr.
