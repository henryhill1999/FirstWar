DR. HAMILTON WILLIAMS OUT
Resigns as Coroner's Physician-—A Bit of a

Discussion, Report Says.

Hamilton Williams, Coroner's physician,
has sent his resignation to Coroner Brown
and the Board of Coroners has accepted it,

Dr. Williams was appointed by former
Coroner Zucea. He is a strong Sheehan
man. He said last night that he wanted al]
his time for his private practice and this is
the official explanation.

There is a report that Dr. Williams had a
decided diflerence of opinion with one of the
Coroners recentiy about the scope of a
Coroner's physician's functions and that this
hastened the resignation, which Coroner
Brown says he regrets very much.

The present Board of Coroners has been
contending that the post of Coroner's
physician is confidential and not subject to
civil service reguiations. It is at present
awaiting an opinion on that matter from

No Yielding Now in Terms, Says the British

Deplores the Attack on Party Lines

~His Hope for Future in South Africa.

Special Cable Despatch to THE SUN.

Lonpon, May 7.--Addressing a great
demonstration of the Primrose League at
the Albert Hail to-day, the Marquis of Salis-
bury said that during the past seventeen
a
troublesome time in its political history.
In Egypt the British were now supreme

| In Ireland they, at all events, no longer were

opposed by the insane and suicidal projects
of imperial disruption advocated by many
statesmen in the past. (Cheers.)

But they must not expect that the ashes
of past conflicts would be extinguished at
once, he said. In recent years they had
had a great and serious war, and, while
not forgetting the misery and suffering
entaile?, they had to recognize other con-
siderations. Among these was the fact
that the power, prestige and influence
of their great kmpire were more potent,
more efficient and more admirable than
ever before,

They had suffered, but they had greatly
won, and it was impossible not to feel that
the efforts made by the people of the United
Kingdom had not, in some cases, been
worthily recognized by those for whom
80 much had been sacrificed. It was im-
Possible not to feel that they had not en-
tirely enjoyed a judicial treatment in refer-
ence to the war

The other day Mr. John Morley had asked
in a speech: “Suppose some preternatural
power had, by virtue of some magic crystal,
allowed the Cabinet of 1890 to see the results
of the policy upon which they were launch-
ing their country, do you believe there was
one of them who would not then have
checked that diplomacy which was leading
pretty straight to these deplorable results ?”

Asa member of the Cabinet concerned, he
(Lord Salisbury) wished to meet that state-
ment with a most indignant denial, (Cheers.)
He had hoped that the war would have been
kept outside party conflict, but it had been
used by some politicians for the rather
squalid purpose of injuring their political
opponents

When a neighboring Power or tribe in-
vaded his Majesty's dominions and made an
attack which was a gross and flagrant out-
rage, it could only be met as they had met it,
by fighting in their own country those who
had despised the rights and sovereignty of
the British sovereign.

Referring to the question of the peace
negotiations, Lord Salisbury repudiated
the assertion that Great Britain had
ceded one inch from her position in regard
to the rights she had claimed and the policy
she intended to carry through. They were

 

exactly where they had been all along
(Cheers.) They could not afford to submit
to the idea that they were to allow things

to slide back into the position they had
been. If they did, it would bein the power
of the enemy, when the opporttmnity suited
him, to renew the issues for which they had
fought for the last three vears

The Prime Minister said that when the
present conflict was over all that could be
done would be done to mould the present
opponents into a portion of the Empire
which had conferred 80 many blessings on
the human race

Lord Salisbury then touched on the ques-
tion of imperial federation. He exhorted
those who were anxious to secure that end
to consider carefully the steps they were
poing to take and the results which they
expected. They could not

He looked with apprehension at anv attempt

result which was in store for them.

WOULD KILL ANTI-TRADE RULE.

But Merchants Think That 2nd street
Foiks Will Do the Job on Time.
Adozen merchants who told their opinions
to a reporter for THE SUN yesterday are
solidly in favor of the repeal of the ordin-
ance which shuts business traffic off Seven-

 

ty-eecond street after 11 o'clock in the
morning

“It is impossible for us to make our de-
liveries in the morning,” said the head
of a big Sixth avenue drygoods house
“Women who live in Seventy-second

street don't do their shopping in the early
hours of the morning. We in the dry-
goods trade learned long ago that a woman
insists, as a matter of principle and of
curiosity, that her purchases shall be de-
livered on the day they are made. She
may not need the stuff for a week, but
she’s certain to want it right away

“It's probably true that residents
who are most insistent that Seventy-second
street shall not be used for business traffic
after 11 A. M. are the families to whom the
merchant, the grocer and the butcher
must deliver in the afternoon. Our appli-
cation for a permit to deliver in the after-
noon was denied, as I have no doubt many
others have been. I can understand that
heavy trucks are not desirable on any resi-
dence street. Our delivery wagons are
lighter than any brougham that travels
through the streets, they are rubber tired
and we think they are handsome. From
my obrervation I should eay that the de-
livery wagons of most of the drygoods
houses are neither noisy nor unsightly. |
The people on Seventy-first and Seventy-
third streets don't object to them, I don’t
see why they should be obnoxious to the
people of Seventy-second street |

the

THURSDAY, MAY §&, 190%.

 

“One drygoods house now delivers by
brougham. We send our wagons to the
corner iearest to the residence of the con-
signee and deliver the goods from there |
by hand.”

Another large drygoods merchant said: |
“We have made application for permission
to deliver during a certain half hour in |
the afternoon when we can run a@ speedy |
wagon through the street

“Naturally the people who live in Seventy- |
second street are most concerned in this
matter. If they could educate themse|y™s

to the point of buying in time so that all |

deliveries might be made before noon the
question would be solved. But you know
women are the principal buyers. If
can please them at the counters we're satis-
fied. Weshan't try to discipline them
“The grocer and the butcher are subject
to more inconvenience than we are. While
the ordinance is enforced we shall have to
continue to deliver by hand from the near-
est corner. But from what a great

we |

many |

of our customers have told us the majority |

of residents in the street would be satis-
fled to have the ordinance repealed. We
don’t complain of the Park Commissioner
for enforcing the ordinanee, But it would
be plain common sense to wipe out such
a law.” . an
A third merchant, whose business is in
Sixth avenue said: “Until Jan. 1 we did
not know of the existence of this ordinance,
f has caused us

Since then its enforcement
much annoyance. Our customers did not
bject to our wagons last year The elee-
trie stages run through the street and
make a great noise while all the dry goods
houses have rubber tired wagons. It
would not be policy for us to start a move-
ment for the repeal of the ordinance, how-
ever. The residents of the street will in

time ask for such action, we feel sure.

SOME IMPROVEMENT IN HER

CONDITION YESTERDAY.

 

 

Doctors Still in Close Attendance and the

Danger Is Not Believed to Be Over
—Secrecy of Telegrams Sent From

the Castie Causes Some Anxiety.

Spectal Cable Despatch to THE SUN.

Tur Haore, May 7.—Queen Wilhelmina
sleeps at intervals. She took a little
nourishment this afternoon. There has
been recurrence of the fever as yet.
The doctors are able to take more
rest. There seems to bea general relaxa-
tion of the painful suspense that has pre-
vailed since Sunday

The following official bulletin in re-
gard to Queen Wilhelmina’s condition
was issued at Het Loo this morning:

“Last evening there was a very slight
increase in teraperature. Her Majesty had
a good night. This morning there is a
complete absence of fever. Her Majesty's
general condition is satisfactory.”

It was said at Castle Loo at noon to-day,
that there was less fear of a fatal issue
of the Queen's illness. The absence of
fever enabled her Majesty to sleep peace-
fully. The doctors were satisfied as to
her condition for the moment.

The bulletin issued from Castle Loo this
afternoon ssid: “The Queen's condition
upto the present time gives reason for satis-
faction.”

The secrecy with which the contents of
telegrams leaving Het Loo are guarded
causes great anxiety and leads to the belief

no

| that the situation is more critical than the

 

bulletins state, Contrary to the report
that Dr. Rossingh left the palace yesterday,
it is now said that he has not left the Queen's
room, save for necessary rest, since Sun-
day. The Queen till to-day had taken no
nourishment since Saturday, and her
strength was necessarily diminishing. The
report that no operation was performed
on Sunday is merely a misunderstanding,
“abortus provocatus” being termed by the
physicians “artificial accouchement,” and

| not an operation.
