ONCE THEY CONTRIBUTED

Ckambake at Westbury, L. I.,
Friday Evening Offers a
Varied Programme.

 

 

A remarkable letter, bearing twenty-
bne signatures and testifying to the hap-
piness which the receipt of American
emokes gives our soldiers in France, has
just been received by Tus Sun Tobacco
Fund. It comes from the regimental
eupply sergeant and a group including
®ergeant-majors, sergeants, corporals,
privates, a cook, a bugler and a wagoner
of Headquarters Detachment, Horsed
Mattalion, 302d A. T.

Some of the men contribyted to the
fund before being sent abroad, but they
confess that in making their small dona-

tions they were building far better than | Posted on the shop bulletin boards.”

they knew, for not until they reached the
front had they any conception of the
worth of the project. In their letter
they ask the fund to express their thanks
to all those now in the list of donors.
‘ne soldiers in the fund army will be
eratified doubtless to know that formet
comrades are sharing the joy which re-
e.ults from thetr giving.

The Letter.

The letter follows:

“ast thy bread upon the waters and
vo chall find it after many days.’ Little
did the truth of this quotation impress
itself upon the men who have signed
their names below. To-day it was
forcibly brought to mind.

“A year ago many of us had gladly
contributed our mite to THe Sun Tobacco
Yund, never thinking that there might
come a time when we should be benefi-
ciartes of the same. (Neither did we
realize the importance of the fund nor
have a conception of the happiness it
was bringing to the boys over there.

“This afternoon we are in a position
to appreciate the greatness of the pur-
yose you had in originating the tobacco
fund. We are in the neck of a woods
close to the line in a busy sector, In
epite of the wonderful and efficient ef-
forts of the Y. M. C. A, K. of C. and
the U. S. Commissary, garettes and
tobacco are seldom procurable. Any one
who has been ‘smokeless’ over here
knows what a relief and corhfort is de-
rived from a puff and pull at the weed.
One becomes accustomed to shell fire,
bombs, &c., and during their being in
the air smoking is not thought of.

“It is at the time of reaction that a
min needs his smoke. It was just at
such a time that a carton of cigarettes
and matches sent through your fund by
the Schulte stores reached our battalion,

“An attempt to describe the reception
this IMttle box of joy received is futile.
aces, bored, gloomy and with a bit of
homesickness in the eye, changed as if
by magic. Smiles and more smiles on
everybody's face, and bmiles are worth
a lot over here. You cannot imagine
what the smokes meant to us and we
cannot tell you in a way which would
give an adequate conception of our joy.

Gladdened Half a Regiment.

“You have gladdened the hearts and
lightened the work of half a regiment,
and the men of headquarters detachmen'
wish by this letter’to express their
thanks. Kindly convey to the~&chulte
stores and the: other contributors our
appreciation. To you we would express
our gratitude, which, if suitable for
your columns, will express to your read-
ers just how we feel about the job we
ore at over here. Gratefully yours,

The further expression of the grati-
tude of these soldiers, to which reference
is made in the letter, is thie poem by
Bergeant-Major Arthur F. [Eeger:
America, oh land of mine,
Far from thy distant shores

Thy sons, impaticit, bide their time
When they may close the doors

Of hell upon its earthly breed,
Upon the bru Hun,

Who knowa no mercy, law or creed,
Whos friendship devils ehun,

Until that day, oh land of mine,
Far from thy shores we'll be,

Forever in our hearts will shine
Thy love for Liberty.

RECEIPTS AT LEAST $1,350

 

Readers have observed recently that] Buyer of Georgia’s First 1918

a weekly contribution is being received
regularly from the Nickel Smoke Fund
in the Kennedy Valve Manufacturing
Company's plant at Elmira. The origin
and.aim of this Nickel Fund is de-
scribed as follows in the current issue
of Shop Stuff, the company’s news pub-
lication:

“The girls in the office have planned
to aid the men at the front by starting
a Nickel Smoke Fund. Every pay day
the men and women of the shop are
asked to contribute the nickels received
in their pay envelopes. There is never
more than one nickel in an envelope and
many pay envelopes do not include a
nickel. The total amount of nickels
Paid out weekly is between $9 and $10,
which will buy a large supply of to-
bacco and wiil bring contentment to
many men in the trenches, The money
will be forwarded to one of the big
smoke funds and receipts for it will be

 

The receipt of $21.70 from the Nickel
Fund last week indicates that the Ken-
nedy workers not only are giving all
the nickels from their pay envelopes,
but some of the dimes as well.

Start the week by placing your
tobacco certificates and coupons fin the
fund box in a United or a Schulte cigar
store. Then some of the soldiers over
there will smoke with you. There is
twice as much pleasure in smoking, you
know, if somebody else is doing@the
same thing.

DEBS TRIAL TO-DAY;
MAY GET 60 YEARS

Noted Socialist Leader to Face
Sedition Charge in
Cleveland.

 

 

 

 

CLEVELAND, Sept. 8.—Pugene V. Debs,
four times Socialist candidate for Pres.
dent, will go on trial here to-morrow
morning, charged with violation of the
espionage act.

Debs was secretly indicted by the
Federal Grand Jury on June 29 on an
indictment of ten counts and was ar-
rested June 30 as he was about to ad-
dress a meeting of Cleveland Socialists.
The charge against him fs based on a
speech delivered at the State convention
of the Ohio Socialist party at Canton
June 16,

In the Canton speech Debs is alleged
to have declared the purpose of the
Allies in the war to be the same as that |
of the Central Powers; he urged his

hearers to know “they were fit for some-
thing better than cannon fodder,” he de-
clared himself as guilty as Mrs, Rose
Pastor Stokes, who was recently found
guilty of violation of the espionage law,
he praised the Bolsheviki and the I. W.
W., and counseed his hearers not to
worry over the charge of “treason to
their masters.”

A motion by attorneys for Debs to
quash the indictment on the ground that
the espionage law is unconstitutfonal |
was overruled by Federal Judge D. C. |
Westenhaver on September 3. }

In denying the motion the court disre- |
garded four of the ten counts in the in-
dictment, as the Government's brief an- |
nounced its intention to enter a nolle in
each of the four counts, and reserved de-
cision regarding three of the remaining
six counts, leaving counts Nos. 3, 4 and
10 of the indictment stand. These
counts are as follows: i

3. Attempting to cause insubordina-j|
tion, disloyalty, mutiny or refusal of
duty in the military or naval forces.

4. Attempting to obstruct the recruit-
ing or enlistment service of the United
States. ¢

10. Opposing the cause of the United
States by words.

If found guilty Debs faces a sentence
of twenty years imprisonment and a
$10,000 fine on each count.

A letter found by the police in the

Cotton Bale Gives It Back
to the fund.

 

When Miss Blanche Duffield wasn't
singing ‘The Star Spangled Banner” or
Miss Kathryn Lee wasn't chanting “La
Marselllaise’ or Enrico Caruso, through
the medium of a phonograph, wasn’t
caroling “Over Thage,” there was always
something else carrying on to bring to
its feet the big audience on the roof
of the Waldorf Saturday night or in-
spire it to some other sort of patriotic
demonstration.

Tangible evidence of the crowd's en-
thusiasm and its devotion to the cause
of America and her allies was given
whenever opportunity was afforded to
make contributions to Tap Sun Tobacco

When the evening came to a

ight—the fund was in the neighbor-
hood of $1,350 to the good, with some
belated receipts yet to be counted.

Fund,
bse Saturday it was a short

New Song Stirs Audience.

Miss Blanche Ring furnished one of
the thrillers, a brand new song written
spectally for her, in which are such
Ilting lines as these:

We'll hit Berlin like a rocket,
Get “The Watch on Rhine’ and hock it’

If the Kaiser thinks he's tricky
He's just common Bolshevik

Tf the Kaiser takes a bracer
Uncle Sam will be the chaser.

Mrs. Hazel Warren made a stirring
patriotic address and drove her points
home by displaying her Tour starred ser-
vice pin, showing that she has given her
husband and three brothers to the cause.
And Capt. Stanley G, Saulmier of the
Fifth Machine Gun Battalion was there
and Private Bunt Cohen of the Engi-
neers, who was captured at Cambrai but
escaped, and when the two soldiers
clasped hands a young civillan was s0
moved that he left his table and hurried
up to the little group shouting, “I've got
to join. Where is the nearest recruiting
office?”

As the names of these persons and the
mention of these incidents attest it was
a wonderful party, one of the very best
Broadway or Fifth avenue ever saw.
To begin with, a remarkable programme
had been provided. Miss Margaret
Weaver, a delightful singer, started it
with Oley Speaks’'s “When the Boys
Come Home,” responding to an enthu-
silastic demand for an encore and later
singing the aria from “Samson und De-
liah.” She was accompanted on the
piano by Miss Emily Harford.

Miss Duffield’s contribution, desides
the national anthem, was Leo’ Stern’s
“Printemps.” Miss Duffield, as every-
body knows, was-the popular prina
donna in “Princess Pat."

With a fine display of generous coop-
eration Gus Edwards, who ig to be one
of the hosts at a party for the fund in
the Martinique next Saturday, brought
four of his stars, Mercedes Lorenze,
Kathleen Hitchens and George Price,
singers, and Arthur Gutman, pianist.
When the wasn't directing thelr num-
bers Edwards qualified as a Pooh Bah,
demonstrating that he is as capable at
the auction block as he is in singing or
composing. .

Many Widely Known Vocalists.

Solly Cohn was there with some of his
very best song hits, Harty Jentes accom-
panied htm. Both appeared through the
courtesy of Leo Stein. Other vocalists
who delighted the audlence were Miss
Georgina MacMullen, Phillas Goulet,
barytone, who sang Bruno Huhn's “In-
victus”; Miss Patricia Ryan, Miss June
Kerley, Lyla McNames Wilson, who
sang Marie Walters Kennedy's “Yankee
Maid,” with words by Mrs, Charles H.
John Steel, who is just back
after singing to the boye at ths front,
and Miss Ella Krause.

From the Palace came George White,
bringing Tot Qualters, Lois Leigh and

{Ethel Delmar, the quartet appearing in

their dancing specialty. Frisco was on
hand with his marvelous assortment of
dance steps.

Arthur Tyson Soper, who is etopping
at the Waldorf, bought in for $500 the
first bale of this year's Georgia cotton
crop, donated to the fund by Samuel
Newburger. Having acquired it Mr.
Soper generously gave !t back to be dls-
posed of again at a future entertainment.

Mrs. W. J, East, whose husband is in
command at Mitchel Aviation Field, at
Hempstead, L. I., became the proud pos-
sessor of the fine pedigreed collie pre-
sented by Irving P. Favor. F. F.
Georger of the University Club bought
the cutrassier's helmet, which Sandy
Sanderson of the “Princess Pat'’ took
from a Hun itn the first battle of the
Somme.

Caruso to Autograph Records,

Phonographic records of “Over There,”
sung by Bridegroom Caruso and to be
autographed by the tenor, were pur-
hased by Mr. Soper, Mrs, M. B. Koon

and R. G. Erner of Chicago, A copy of
Private Charles Divine's poems, given
by Moffat, Yard & Co., was bought for

the private IMbrary of Walter Con-

GREAT SLACKER RAID
AT DEBS’S MEETING

Is Ready for Prison.
Dernroir, Sept. 8.——Eugene V. Debs ap-
peared unannounced at the final meeting
of the Socialist State Convention here
to-day, as the principal speaker. The
meeting was the occasion for the great-
est slacker raid ever conducted in De-
troit, the police subjecting each of the
8,000 men in attendance to a careful
«wamination, Many were held for fur-
ther ex&€mination,

Tebs in his address called former
President Roosevelt and Emperor Will-
iam of Germany “chums,” but made only
slight reference to the war, confining
himself to an exhortation to working
men to “rise against industrial au-
tocracy.”

Alluding to the charges of violation of
the espionage act on which he will go
to trial in Cleveland Manday, Debs said:

“TIT may be sent to prison by the pow-
era of militarism, but they have not the

 

power to conquer the pewer you now
possess, My message from béhind prison
bara will be all ihe more powerful, I

would much rather be a man In jafl then
a coward outside of it.”

PRODIGAL PARABLE
ACTED FOR NEGROES

Preacher Quarles Gives Realis-
tic Scene at Camp Meeting
in Kentucky.

 

 

 

Spectal Despatch to Tue Sux.

LEXINGTON, Ky., Sept. §.—The greatest
annual religious event among negroes of
the central West occurred here this after-
noon. It was a reproduction of the
parable of the Prodigal Son, and although
given at an amusement park, leased for
the day by the negroes, {t was full of the
utmost solemnity for the thousands who
attended. Many white persons were
among the spectators,

The Rev. R. Quarles was master of
ceremonies. It was his annual camp
meeting day and after doing his level
best to bring souls to the mourning bench
and appealing for a little help flancially
he read the lesson of the Prodigal Son.
Then he announced that he would give
a reproduction of this matchless story
of forgiveness. As everybody had ex-
pected to see this representation excite-

ment at the announcement was intense.
The Rev. Mr. Quarles then wiggled a

white flag that stood at one side of the
preaching ground. Away across the level
field there came into view a form. As
it approached it was resolved into that

of a young negro puck, ragged and ap-
parently very miserable. Mr. Quarles,
impersonating the father, lifted up his
eyes and saw his wandering boy and set
out to meet him, while a calf bleated
back in the distance, where the boy, who
had spent his money in riotous living,
could not hear it.

As the Rev. Mr. Quarles started across
the field toward the boy he picked up a
very new and modern suit case and took
it with him. When the repentant youth,
who rejoiced in the name of Isaac Carr,
saw his substitute father he seemed to
become frightened, for he turned and
streaked it back across the fleld in the
direction from which he had started.
But the Rev. Mr. Quarles did not intend
that his object lesson should be broken
up In that way. So he yelled out at
Isaac to “come back,” and Isaac re-
versed his steps.

The two met tn the centre of the field.
The Rev. Mr. Quarles ran to the boy and
they threw their arms about each other
Then the preacher opened the suit case
while he held the boy with one hand and
took out a pair of new shoes, a new hat
and an old dressing gown, At the same
time he unearthed a pair of white gloves,
which he pressed upon the returned
prodigal.

Then from the bushes was led the
fatted calf, whieh had been borrowed for
the day from a neighboring farm. The
preacher held a small hammer in his
hand and lifted it as though he was go-
ing to slay the calf, but he didn’t, as
calves sell at high prices here this year

The dissatisfied son in the meantime
sulked in the background, but after the
younger negro had accepted the clothing,
that being all he wanted,
was declared to have been well

' trated and the Rev. Mr. Quarles, with his
| assistants and his thousands of auditors,
called it a day.

Federal Trade Commission that he has
threatened to resign if the measure be-
comes a law.

Not merely as a war emergency meas
ure has the Federal Trade Commission
framed its conversion bill. According to
the draft now ready for introduction the
commission designs to break up forever
the monopoly, which they denounce as
obnoxious. It proposes taking over the
packing concerns and the stockyards of
Chicago, Kansas City and the other great
meat packing centres and administer the
entire business throughout the nation by
a commission.

Those interested In the question of the
control and distribution of the national
meat supply are watching with profound
interest to see which side in the impend-
ing combat will win the support of the
President. The present understanding is
that the President's disposition is to take
the Hoover side of the argument.

Hoover's Influence Strong.

For thirteen months the President has
had practically all the necessary power
to grab the entire industry if dissatisfied
with the way private interests are con-

ducting it and he has not seen fit to use|

it, Mr. Hoover's influence is given the
credit for this alleged attitude of the
Chief Executive.

Mr. Hoover takes the position that
while Federal control in normal times
might prove a desirable corrective for
the existing evils, the assumption of con-
trol in the midst of war might disrupt
the industry fatally.

Senator Borah (Idaho) is expected to
sponsor the bill of the Trade Commis-
sion when it makes its appearance in
the Senate. He belleves the packing in-
dustry {s a monopoly which ought to be
broken up.

The measure will recelve the support
of a dozen or more Senators on the Re-
rublican side of the Chamber and of a
considerable number of Democrats,
headed by Senator te (Okla) and
Senator Kendrick (Wyd.), the latter a
cattleman,

Thousands of pounds of bullets already
have been poured into it from students’ |
guns.

A tiny wooden reproduction of an|
enemy plane is the object of this prac-
tice. The target is an unindicated spot |
on a nearby white sheet before which
the plane, flying at a given speed, would |
be passing when the Anferican plane's |
shots reached it. The student figures |
out the speed and the angle of ascension
and distance of the enemy, adjusts his|
gun and aims at the tiny plane. Then
if he is accurate in his shooting and
his valeulations the bullet should pierce
the spot marked on the back side of the
white sheet.

Students also are carefully’ drilled in
the strategy of manoeuvring into the
one spot in the rear of the enemy plane
whence he cannot shoot. From this
position they can pour thefr own shots
into the enemy.

ducing newspapers or periodicals which
are entered at the post office as second
class matter, plants preserving, drying,
curing, packing and storing tobacco, but
not for manufacturing and marketing.

To-day’s list Is the most important
division of the industries of the country
yet made and is designed not only as
a master key for purposes of the draft,
but for future flow of all the basic in-
dustrial elements into industries essen-
tial to the war programme.

Every plant coming within this classt-
fication must file not later than the 15th
of each month with the secretary of the
Priorities Board, Washington, D. C., &
report covering its activities during the
preceding month. Any plant falling to
file such report will be dropped from the
preference list.

It is explained by the War Industries
Board that between Classes 2, 8 and 4
there is no complete or absolute prefer-
ence. Class 1, however, stands alone tn
that all its requirements as to botn
labof and material must be fully satie-
fled before preference is given to the
other classes.

j Factors Involved.

| In deciding the relative fmportance
| of industries considerattom was given to
| all of these factors:

| 1, The intrinsic importance of a man-
}ufactured product, and the urgency of
| its need for war or other essential pur-
| poses.

2. The necessity of maintaining, stim-
ulating or increasing the quality of
production of an essential commodity or
product.

3. The proportion of the capacity of a
factory or plant which is devoted to the
manufacture of essential products as
recognized by the list.

“A high priority classification does
not always mean,” it is explained, “that
the product of the industry or plant so

| classified is of greater intrinsic im-

portance than those of tndustries and
plants in a lower classification, or not
appearing at all on the preference list,
but that taking into account the urgency
of the demand, and the relation of the
supply to dernand, it is {n the public tn-
terest that the artificial stimulus of
| priority should be applied. All priority
{is relative and implies purposeful dis-
crimination.”

In grouping the tndustries on the

preference list, many plants were found
which were entitled to preference treat-
}ment, Mr. Parker explained, although
the industres to which they belonged
were not entitled to a place on the list
In other instances, an Industry was put
on the Hat, but a higher classification
was given to particular plants. * This
arrangement, he said further, was due
} to the Intrinsic value, or urgency of the
{products and commodities which the in-
dividual factory was turning out

“Thie list 1s made up of industries and
\plants which tn the public interest are
, deemed entitled to preferential treat-
ment," he declared.

 

 

Industrial Standpoint.

In explaining further the purposes o!
the ist from an industrial standpoint,
Mr. Parker sai!d:

‘Where it is impossibie not only to
maintain but to stimulate and increase
| production to satisfy abnormal demands
‘created by war’ requirements a high

rating is necessary even though the in-

trinsic importance of the product may
, be less than that of other products
| placed {tn a lower classiffeation due to
the fact that the supply of such other
| products equals the demand without the
| stimulus of high priority. Where it
necessary to speed the production of a
particular product required at
ticular time to carry into effect an !m-
| portant programme a high priority !s
| given, although changing conditions may
| thereafter suggest and demand a re-
classification.

| “Certaln plants produce commodities
of great relative Importance, but at the
same time produce other commodities
of leas relative importance, and under
such circumstances consideration

tion between the more important
less important commodities
“Instances occassionally

and

arise where

j individual plants are given preference

so long as they are rendering and so

they should render,

even though, taking the country as a

“No distinction has been mada he-
tween any of the industries or plants |
within any one class and no significance |
attaches to the order in which indus- |
tries and plants are listed within any |
class.”

allied Governments fopeless conflict and
confusion would follow efforts to carry
on the war from this side of the ocean.
‘The list is expected to serve as the rule
of action to the War Industries Board
in performing this function.

“The administration of priorities is
calculated to bring order out of chads
and to develop an'evenly balanced in-
4ustrial programme to meet the require-
ments of the military programme,” he
eald, “and at the samo time supply the
emsential requirements of the civilian
population. Now that it !s understood
that priority and preference cannot be
purchased the tendency is for prices to
assume more nearly the normal level.
Tt is now the public interest rather than
the dollars of the purchaser that deter-

 

 

mine precedence in production and
delivery.” ‘ Y
TRAINING CORPS FOR RUTGERS,

 

Men Will Receive Pay of Privates
and Board and Lodging.

President W. H. 8. Demarest an-
nounced yesterday that Rutgers College,
New Brunswick, N. J., will establish a
students’ army training oorps in accor-
dance with the suggestion of the War
Department.

Students will have their tuition, board |
and room rent paid by the Government, |
; will recetve full equipment and aa pri-
vates In active service will receive $30
a month. The dormitories and frater-
nity houses will probably be turned over
to the members of the training corps,
which w'll number between 300 and 400
