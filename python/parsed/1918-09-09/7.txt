EXCELLENT SHOWING
BY SAVINGS BANKS

Total Resources $2,169,877,-
864, Largest Ever Reported,
Except for One Year.

 

 

 

Axtsany, Sept. 8.—Despite the heavy
demands made upon investment institu-
tions in connection with the placing of
IAberty Loan bonds by the National
Government, and the increased cost of
living, the 141 savings banks of New
York State made an excellent showing
fn their reports ‘to Superintendent of
Banks George I. Skinner, as of July 1

* last.

Figures submitted by these institu-
tions show that their total resources on
that date were $2,169,877,364, with one
exception the largest total resources ever
A reported. As compared with the total
; Tesources reported on July 1, 1917, there

was a loss of approximately $3,000,000.

Notwithstanding the large withdraw-
als for the purchase of Liberty Loan
‘bonds, there was an actual increase in
the amount due depositors, including
dividends credited to depositons on the
books of the institutions and not with-
drawn, from July 1, 1917, to July 1,
1918, of more than $260,000, the total
amount due depositors on the latter date
being $1,991,720,349.

The deposits with savings banks dur-
ing the year ending July 1, 1918, ex-
cluding dividends credited, amounted to
$448,768,201, which was $54,280,743 less
than the amount deposited during the
previous year. The total amount with-
drawn during the 1918 period was $521,-
298,363, or $55,447,605 more than the
amount withdrawn during the preceding

~ year.

Par value surplus of the institutions,
upon which taxation is based, July 1,
1918, was $217,313,648, an increase dut-
ing the year of $15,694,056. The total
number of open accounts on July 1, 1918,
was 3,446,899, a net loss of 5,222 ac-
counts during the year.

ia The dividends either paid or credited
i. by these institutions during the year
’ ended July 1, 1918, amounted to $72,-
905,918, an increase of $1,883,557 over
the preceding year,

OPTIMISM IN SECURITY :

MARKET SEEMS JUSTIFIED

 

Only Restriction on Loans Prévented

Pen Reviews Last Week’s Rise in Prices—Says| Transactions for week. 2,440,537
| Big Bull Market.

 

By WILLIAM JUSTUS BOIES,.

Wall Street would have a full fledged
bull market on its hands to-day®had not
the money pool committee last weok
wisely given notice that the New York
barks would not finance such a venture.

The market's enthusiasm was difficult
to hold in check, as the continued suc-
cesses of the allied forcega together
with the important buying of American
eecurities by traders in Amsterdam and
other foreign markets created the most
favorable situation that has arisen for
starting a bull campaign since the
United States joined the list of belliger-
ent nations seventeen months ago. As it
was the stock market showed a suffi-
clently strong undertone to advance the
average price of forty or fifty represen-
tative stocka to much the highest level
of the year.

The sharp reaction which followed this
advance was due to the announcement
that Gov. Strong of the New York Fed-

/ \eral Reserve Bank had asked the Stock

Exchange authorities to furnish daily

Santa Cecilia Sugar reports to the money pool committee cov-

ering the amounts borrowed each-day
on call and on time by brokerage firms.

"| Following the warning issued last week
Phone Rector 6340. 74 Broadway, New York by the same committee against any at-

tempt to start a bull campaign at this
time, this further move wae taken to

D mean that all hope of securing accommo-

financing.
The Next War Loan,

The setting ts right for the beginning
of the fourth Liberty Loan canvass and
the probability is that the intensive
campaign of three weeks will be tore
productive than any previous campaign
of four weeks. The country knows what
it {s fighting for and the people may be
trusted to do every thing possible to
make the forthcoming Government toan
in every sense a victory loan.”

During the last canvass subscriptions
for $4,176,516,8650 bonds were recetved,
17% per cent. of which came from for-
eign born American citizens, The prob-
ability is that the response from these
classes will be even larger in this in-
stance, since the new draft law has
brought a great many new people into
the war enterprise, while the réassur-
ing news from the front has affected
sentiment in a remarkable way.

Until the Treasury announces the de-
tails of the loan it will not be known
just what especial inducements the Gov-
ernment holds out to insure the success
of the record Jssue. As a straight-out
investment proposition a 4% per cent.
loan only partially tax exempt and with-
out a valuable conversion feature would

dation to finance a lively speculation instant success of a $6,000,000,000 issue.

Investment Buying.

But the really noteworthy develop-
ment of the last few days and one which
the bankers at no time discouraged war

jthe revival of genuine investment buy-

ing. This was reflected in the outright.

purchaee of seasoned dividend stocks and
high grade bonds by that shrewdest of
all buyers, the little investor, He comes
into the market when he feels Iike it and
can never be induced to buy stocks be-
cause they are cheap, if he believes they |
will be cheaper, .«

But he acts on generally good news
and although his operations are small,
he often displays better judgment than
the larger buyer, whose resources are 80
great as to expose him to the thousand
or more influences to which the very rich
man ia often subjected.
| The overshadowing factor, however,
was the publication of the new revenue
bill which ts to touch the pocketbook of
every man, woman and child in the
country. The bill is eo full of incon-
gruities that it is certain to be picked to
pieces in the Senate, where it is likely
to be changed in {mportant particulars.

Everybody expects to pay the largest
taxes that he has ever paid and every
corporation management—which repre-

 

But Secretary McAdoo and his advis-
ers are resourceful enough to make a
414 per cent, loan attractive by making
the tax exempt feature more generous,
or by including some proviaion not pre-
sented in any of the previous issues,
The Treasury experts appreciate the im-
portance of making the loan go through
with a rush and in obtaining eo far as
possible a house to house distribution of
the bonds. °

So far, therefore, the banks have been

These de-|

mands are inevitable, for if war expenses |

and loans to the Allies footed up the rec-
ord sum of $1,805,513,000 last month,
the chances are that this total soon will)
be exceeded, as the expense ratio of in-|

to the people. These Government loan
sales have been splendidly handled and
because of the more perfect organiza-
tion the probability {is that the forth-
coming issue will be more widely dis-
tributed than any of the others.

If the war should last a year or two
the Government might have to consider
the advisability of making continuous
offerings of short term loans in order to
attract the public. This system has
been highly successful 47 Great Britain,
where the war outlays are being largely
financed through successive sales of
short term Treasury obligations,

The interest rate is a trifle higher, but
the markets are saved the strain Incident
to a nation wide canvass to put through
a tremendous loan in a short space of
time. We have not resorted to temporary
financing in the same way and nearly
all of the $1,000,000,000 of Treasury cer-
tificates outstanding in this market are
held by banks and investment institu-

These funds should be invested in the 4| available for rediscount at the Federal

per cent. Treasury certificates of
debtedness which are available in de-
nominations as low as $500, and which
will be accepted in payment for taxes.

These certificates will be of great
wervice in financing the heavy tax pay-
ments, for no such sum as $8,000,000,000
could be withdrawn from the banks at
one tlme without crippligg the money
market. The Treasury has just made a
epecial issue of these certificates dated
August 20, and since they carry as high
an interest rate as the savinge banks
pay, they ought to be quickly absorbed
by the public,

Notwithstanding the broadening de-
mand for money ¢rom mercantile and
corporation borrowers, the Federal Re-
sorve Board does not contemplate rals-
tng discount rates at this time. To do so
would interfere seriously with the Gov-
ernment financing and in the judgment
of Gov. Harding of the Federal Reserve
Board a drastic advance in discount
rates would not reduce the requirements
of industrial concerns engaged on wur
work, but would only impose new bur-
dens upon the people.

The Governor in the course of his ad-
dress before the Ohio Bankers’ Associa-
tion in Columbus last week took oc-
easion to anawer those critics who con-
tended that the regerve banks ought to
increase discount rates forthwith, since
the present demand for money justified
higher quotations.

Imperilling Government Finan-

cing.

Those who urge this action, however,
take a narrow view of the situation, for
any general advance in discount rates
at this time might imperil the success of
the whole scheme of Government finan-
cing. This is a war market and it is
imperative not only that the fourth
Liberty Loan should succeed, but that
the fifth, sixth, seventh and other Lib-
erty loans, if required, should be heartily
supported by the people,

Any sharp risé in interest rates would
lead to a further advance in the cost of
living and impose serious burdens upon
a people who already are having to bear
a prodigious amount of extra expense.
For the Goverrtment, therefore, to in-
crease this burden needlessly would be
shortsighted to say the least, since the
siguation can be better controlled by re-
stricting new financing to cever essen-
tial requirements and by curtailing ad-
vances upon speculative collateral,

Thevcountry is adjusting itself to these
conditions and large borrowers generally
are shaping their demands to conform
to the policy of the Federal Reserve
Board in getting the banks to cut out
unnecessary loans during tne war perlod.
It is a difficult matter, however, to
change the credit methods of a great
commercial nation, but the movement
has been so far highly encouraging.
Every successful business man can al-
ways be appealed to in a situation of
this kind and the readiness with which
applications for thousands of loans have
been withdrawn as soon as the bankers
explained the stand taken by the Federal
Reserve Board shows that the borrow-
ing public is alive to the situation and
willing to cooperate with the Govern-
ment in safeguarding the money market

—— eee

The Federal Reserve
Board has exerted gf Its influence to
get the member banks to keep themselves
as liquid as possible and to confine their
loans to commercial paper issued for
essential purposes,

The development of the acceptance
system has given the banks an additiona?
supply of liquid paper in which to in-
vest. The banks generally have been
careful to avoid fixed investments and
have declined very attractive rates of-
fered for large loans by promoters of
speculative enterprises. The result is
that banking conditions are sound and
the Government can be accommodated
with the largest loans ever applied for
in this country,

The Public Utilities,

Various communities have granted ad-
vances to street railway companies that
have been hard hit by the readjustment
forced upon them by war conditions.
More than one-quarter of the urban pop-
ulation of the United States and Canada
is. now paying more than the traditional
five cent fare. This relief work must be
carried further, however, if the street
railway companies are to be saved from
receiveship.

eeveral large corporations are in a
bad way, being forced to advance wages
and without the means of increasing
fares or financing their proper require-
ments. The War Finance Corporation
has come to the rescue of some of these
companies, but a more ambitious scheme
of relief must be undertaken if the nec-
essary assistance is to be given.

In view of the conservative policy pur-
eued by the directors o
Corporation, the violen riticism which
greeted the proposal to férm this relief
organization is interesting to recall. .In-
stead of becoming an instrument of dan-
gerous inflation, the curporation has as-
sumed virtually the role of a rediscount-
ing inetitution, confining its investrfients
for the most part to paper, containing a
bank’s guarantee. This action is the
more significant, when it {s remembered
that the law gives the corporation the
right to make direct loans in specific in-
stances. But the directors have resisted
all entreaties to have them resort to this
form of direct lending, except in urgent
relief cases.

It is evident, however, that this great
relief agency will be of service in help-
ing the bi 8s finance the harvest re-
quirements. “It has already taken means
to grant liberal loans to farmers where
the need is apparent and the paper
bears a proper indorsement. But these
requirements hardly will be sufficient to
employ any large portion of the corpora-
tion’e resourcé&\ unless the crop damage
area should be greatly extended.

RAief Loans,

The War Finance Corporation has an
important future before it. These are
war times and the readjustment of bus!-
ness and financial conditions has given
rise to various demands which can
scarcely be financed by the ordinary
commercial banks.

It would be of great service If the cor-
poration uld increase its fleld of ac-
tivity to take in the other public utility
companies which require assistance, It
has granted loans to a few of them, but
the need is urgent and should be satis-
