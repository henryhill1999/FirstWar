Canadian Chums Veterans of
Many Fights.

‘WITH THe CANADIAN FORCES IN THE
Fievp, Sept. 7 (delayed).—A story is
told of the gallantry of two signallers
ef a Manitoba field battery which has
ught since the battle of the Ypres
fent in 1916, through the Somme,
Vimy Ridge, Lens, Hill 70, Passchen-
daele and the recent battle. They are
chums, one coming from London, Eng-
Jand, and the other from Winnipeg.

It was just before the opening of an
fmportant operation when it was vitally
important that telephone connection be-
tween the battery and brigade head-
Quarters should be maintained at all
costs.

They discovered that the line was
down and, though the enemy was strafing
with a deadly shell fire they went to
Work to find and repair the break. This
done, they discovered that other bat-
teries on the line were cut off, and they

|. Tales of individual heroism are legion,
but none is more notable than the gal-
antry of the Colonel of a Canadian
jScottish battalion, who, when his unit
was in an exceedingly tight place last
|Monday, owing to its flank being in the
air for lack of support, personally led it
to the assault, leading his front rank
by a hundred yards in the charge against
the enemy machine gun position and
thus snatching victory from what seemed
disastrous defeat. . : .

“He bore a charmed life,” remarked
one of hie staff. His piper was wounded.

Remarkable too in the fighting of last
‘week was the work of a northern Al-
berta battalion, which, when the whole

munication trench to the centre of the
main enemy trench line. Dividing here,
a company worked to the left and an-
other to the right, bombing as they went
until the trenches were cleareé\and the
Machine gun position and “whiz-bang”

occupied a tremendous rifle fire, aug-

“It was like plugging into a herd of
buffalo in the days before the rail hit

Plainsman. “The Boche got out of that

GERMAN SOLDIERS
DENIED ANY REST

Divisions Kept Constantly in
Action.

Lonpon, Sept. 8.—The fighting line
from the region southwest of Cambrai
southward now runs through the Havrin-
court Wood to Heudecourt, Villers-
Faucan, Roisel, Bernes, Poeuilly, Ville-
veque and Vaux, along the can»! to
‘Terginer and thence by the western edge
of Servate.

The most important event of the fight-
ing has been the crossing of the St.
Croszat Canal at St. Simon, because the
canal might have been used as a bastion
for this part of the Hindenburg line. It
no longer offers the Germans a reason-
able defensive position.

Rolsel is the junction of two lines, to

Cambrai and 8t. Quentin. Hence the
importance of its capture to the British
who, when they advance further, will be
able to utilize these lines. The British
now hold virtually all the Havrincourt
Wood,
. Between the Oise and the Ailette the
French are up against the so-called Al-
Werich line, which is a continuation of
the Hindenburg line.

It has just been discovered that three
German divisions have thrice been put in
the fighting since August 8 and thirty-
two divisions twice out of the 107 di-
visions engaged since that date. Alto-
gether north and south of the Somme
142 divisions of the enemy have been
counted of a total rifle strength of 1,250,-
000. On the whole front from the sea
to Switzerland the total strength of the
enemy probably does not exceed two and
one-half million men.

MOSCOW REFUGEES
REACH STOCKHOLM

Americans Report Atarving
Conditions Prevailing in
Bolshevik Capital.

 

 

JOURNEY TAKES 12 DAYS

Russia’s Grain Crops Not Bad,
but Peasants Refuse to
Feed the Cities.

 

By the Assoctated Press.
SrockHonm, Sept. 7 (delayed).—The
American refugees from Moscow reached |
aon ae to-day—twelve days after |
their departure from the Bolshevik cap-
ital. They were met by Sheldon White-
house, the American Charge d’Affaires,
and a party of Americans and Euro-
peans who were anxious to learn the lot

of friends and relatives in Russia.
Immediately after crossing into Fin-
land the Americans were impressed by
the orderly conditions prevailing. There
was no shooting at the railway stations;
the trains were clean and the car win-
dows not broken, and hoodiums were not
causing the breaking down of passenger
and freight trains by overloading them.
The Finns near the border had sufficient |
food, except flour and sugar. |
Conditions improved as the special
train approached Tornea, opposite the
Swedish border, and en. the Swedish side
they were almost unbelievabie, for there
they found many refugees from Soviet
Russia, which is staggering on, hungry

and miserable, toward a hopeless win-
ter.

 

Flour Is 61.25, Sugar $3 a Pound.

When the Americans left Russia they
say flour sold at $1.25 a pound and that
{t was seldom obtainable at any price.
The 'price of sugar was $3 a pound—and
the staple was scarce at that.

The refugees say that starvation had
become so prevalent in Moscow that late
in August the Food.Commission was
forced to remove all regulations on citi-
zens and permitted them to enter the
city with -sixty pounds of food each.
| This step, it was asserted, was an ad-
{mission of the absolute failure of the
Food Commission, which had no bread
and was forced, through the pressure
of the rebelling citizens, to let the peo-
ple take the food supply into thelr own
hands.

Wheat and other grains were not!
available, as the peasants in the grain|
sections etill under Soviet control re-|
fused to feed the cities. Potatoes and}
other vegetables were selling at 25
cents a pound. They are the chief food
supply of Moscow and Petrograd.

Advised to Shoulder Rifles.

The workmen of Moscow and Petro-
grad factories cannot obtain food from
the commissions, which have advised
them to shoulder rifles and take the
grain away from the peasants. This
advice has seldom been heeded, as a
majority of the workmen regard the
peasants as brothers.

Wholesale charges of the Bolshevik ,
newspapers that the bourgeoisie are}
wholly responsible for the food stortage
no longer quiet the hungry laborers, |
whose faith in the Bolsheviki is waning |
appreciably. The promises of Leon!
Trotzky, the Bolshavik ‘War Minister, to
quell the Czecho-Slovak rising and tap
the supply of wheat no longer are geii-
erally credited.

Russia, the refugees say, has a bum-
per wheat and rye crop tn virtually all
the grain sections. Much of the grain
has already been harvested, but the
Bolshevik! have neither the organiza-
ticn nor the transportation facilities to|
obtain bread for the starving cities,
which scarcely can be expected to drag
through a  breadless winter without
turning against a Government whose
policy has lost the wheat districts.

Emperor recently entertained at lunch- |

Ukraine, and both generously expressed |
their admiration for each other.

The Emperor, according to a telegram
from Berlin, said he had offered the
helping hand to afflicted Ukraine, which |
had suffered by the war “brought upon |
the world by the machinations of the |
Entente and continued by them with |
criminal madness, in spite of the recog- |
nized unattainable nature of their aims.
of domination.”

Germany had furnished Ukraine with
a basis for existence as a State and, he
asserted, ‘henceforth a citizen can fol-
low his vocation undisturbed and a
peasant can cultivate the soil in safety
and enjoy the fruits of his labor. There}
still remains much to do, but under the |
direction of your Highness, Ukraine al-
ready has made considerable progress
in internal consol'dation and has there- |
by assured to itself a basis for future |
development.” |

He proposed the toast: “His Highness }
the Hetman of Ukraine. Hurrah, hur-/|
rah, hurrah!” |

Gen. Skoropadski said: “The very
graciqus reception which your imperial
Majesty has granted me will be re-
garded by the entire Ukrainian people
as a sign of your Majesty's good will;
toward young Ukraine, and {it will lend
strength to carry through the heavy
tasks which are still awaiting.” |

He offered the toast: “His Majesty}
the German Kaiser, Hoch, hoch, hoch!" |

HERTLING’S SPEECH!

SATISFIES NOBODY MOURN FOR OUR BOYS |
| Both Electoral Reformers and|Adopt Them in Death and

Conservatives Critical.

By the Associated Press,

CoPENHAGEN, Sept. 8.—The attempt of | slope of Mount Valerian are buried the} ¢ ,qamental character of a

Count von Hertling, Imperial German
Chancellor, to ride two horses simultane-
ously in hls House of Lords speech re-
cently appears, judging by press com-

ments, to have resulted in his falling |

hard between them.
That portion of the press favoring real
reform is disap-

cellor’s ambiguous warning that the
Lords could avoid too far reaching con-
cessions by accepting reform measures
now, and the conservative press is up in
arms over his appeal for acceptance of
reforms as “protection and maintenance
of the crown and dynasty.”

The Agrarian Deutsche Tages Zeitung
calls Hertling “the Prussian monarch’'s
grave digger.”

The Kreuz Zettung attacks Count von
the Crown's
deserts and exaggerating the Socialists’
services, and darkly warns him that
monarchies do not crumble because they
resist the unjustified demands of the
masses, but ause they “let
selves be forced down to the dangerous
level of compromises.”

The Pan-German Deutsche Zeitung de-
clares that equal suffrage would be an
undisguized surrender to the anti-mon-
archists’ will, which would endanger the
dynasty and the crown.

So far as has been noted only Ger-
mana, Count von Hertling’s organ, is
satisfied with his speech.

They gained additional ground on the Ver-
mand-Epehy front of about fifteen miles,
apparently about three miles further.

of Austrians.

Special Cable Despatch to Tne Srx
Copyright. 1918; all rights reserved

Paris, Sept. &§.—America’'s recognition
of the Czecho-Slovaks is the tople of
numerous discussions in political circles
and in the French press. Paris, the seat
of the de facto Czecho-Slovak Govern-
(ment, sees in the declaration of the
{ United States the fina: proof of its de-
} sire to afd in the dissolution of the Haps-
| burg monarchy.
| A leading editorial article in the Jour-
nal des Debats devoted to the declaration
; concludes that it marks “the disappear-
ance forever of Washington's early com-
| platsance in regard to the gentlemen of
| Vienna.”
; Accompanying the general appreba-
| tlon of the attitude of President Wilson
| is the expression of the belfef that {t will
| have a tremendous influence in fortify-
‘ing the ardor of the Czecho-Slovaks for
; the cause which, it is observed, they
| have elected to make their own, and will
| contribute to an overwhelming extent to
| the success of the operations in Siberia.
| M. Borsky, just arrived here from Bo-
| hemla, who for many years was a con-
| spicuous Parliamentary figure among
the Czechs in the Reichstrath in Vienna
and now is performing the high func-
tions of a member of the de facto Gov-
ernment, said to the correspondent of
| Tae Sun:
| “First of all the declaration of the
| United States was a judicial recognition
,of the justice of the Czech claims to
national existence. On the other hand

 

is the acceptance of our military co-
operation as that tendered by an ally
whose enemy is the common foe. We
see in this declaration that the United
} States does not accept the Austrian
| point of view, namely, that the (Czecho-
Slovak nation possesses neither terri-
tory nor government, thus lacking the
State,

“We are grateful to America for

ignoring this claim and by its action

{confirming the ownership of the soil by
jour nation, even though it be tempo
rarily occupled by the enemy, as is the
;case in Belgium and Siberia. For its
liberation from the German-Magyar
j yoke the Czecho-Slovak nation can best
express its appreciation by continuing
ithe battle for the martyred peoples en-
{slaved by its enemy.

“The Czecho-Slovak army will give
evidence of its gratitude to President
Wilson, who pursues only his highly
moral policy in recognizing the right-
eousness of our fight, by new acts of
heroism on all the battlefields by the
jside of the great democracies of the
| world.”

From @ staf! correspondent of Tan Scx.

Toxio, Aug. 14.—~The rice famine riot-
ing is growing in violence all over the
country.

In Kamikyeku, a suburb of Kyoto,
which is a twelve hour railroad journey
from Tokio, I saw night before last a
mob of hundreds charge into the city
proper and wreck dozens of rica snopes
and warehouses in short order. An o'her
big mob from the Shikadani-machi sec-
tion did some promiscuous looting after
destroying tha police boxes and cutting
telephone, telegraph and electric Iight
wires. At 11 P. M. there was no tele-
phonic communication and the shouta of
the vast crowds in the streets was no
pleasant thing to hear.

A force of cavalry and 200 infantry,
in charge of officers of the Kyoto Di-
vision of the Imperial Troops, entered
the city in the morning. The people
seemingly were in no way intimidated
by the armed forces and asked:

“Why harm us, your countrymen, who
only seek food because we are starving?”

The fighting was heavy in places, but
at dawn the scrimmages in the streets
became less severe. Hundreds of ar-
rests were made. ‘

‘

Chief Streets Barricaded.

When I left preparations were being
made to barricade the principal thor-
oughfares and to station quick firing
guns. The damage to the city has been
considerable.

At Nagoya, one of the largest com-
mercial centres of Japan, rioting took
place on Sunday night and Monday
morning, and some people were kifed.
They were crushed to death in the mobs.
On Monday I saw a yelling aggregation
of 4,000 hungry men and women march
from Tsurumai Park, Nagoya, where
they had gathered, to the district of the
rice warehouses and rice dealers. The
latter had been warned of the coming of
the mob and fled with their families.
The crowds were received instead by a
heavy force of foot soldiers.

Again the fighting was severe, but
the crowds broke through, and I saw
some forty warehouses that had been
smashed and looted. Fires were burn-
ing in several places and the fire bri-
gades had the hardest kind of work to
keep the flames from spreading, owine

to the unwillingness of the crowds to
let them save the property. Stones,
brickbats, clubs and long poles were

the chief weapons in the hands of the
rioters, but these were sufficient to
Kive the police and military a very hot
time of It

Mob After the Hoarders,

Last night I was notified that there
were great troubles in and about Hi!-
blya Park, ‘Tokio, a charming spot in
the newer section of the capital, about
three times the size of our own Bryant
Park I found a mob of 10,000 per-
sons swarming over the flower beds,
falling into ponds, fighting with the
police and soldiery, and yelling, “Down
with the rice hoarders! Kill them!”

As usual the police were entirely
helpless and the restaurants, because
of some well dressed patrons being
within, were stoned. Windows were
broken, railings were torn up, fiagstaffs
felled and general havoc was made of
the places.

The mob filled the wide streets from
side to side, much as a swollen river
overfiows its banks, and the sound of
crashing windows was to be heard
every where I was caught in an on-
rushing crowd, the police at its heels,
and got a severe jolting, but the excite-
ment of the thing was immense.

barracks of the city and quiet was
fairly restored by 4 o’clock this morn-
ing, though the poor were still breath-
ing vengeance.

There has been terrific rioting at the
port of Kobe, four hours to the south of
Tokto by rail. The fine office building of
Suzuki & Co., rice dealers, was burned,
and the police were repulsed in many
parts of the city.

Posters Tell of Indignation.

Posters are up bearing the inscription
“Curse the price of rice,” and the crowds
are bearing banners on which these
words are painted. Inspector Fujimoto,
chief of police, has been seriously in-
jured, together with a number of his
men. Troops have rushed to the port
by train. The office of the Kobe Shim-
buna, owned by a rich rice merchant,
was destroyed by fire. The flames
spread and a dozen office buildings were
burned. A large go-down, owned by the
Kobe Steel Company, was burned to the
ground and several men were Killed.

Rioting continues in Tokio and riot
orders have been issued that the popu*
lace must stay indoors after sunset.

A reliable newspaper says many hun-
drede of rioters took charge of the town
of Hiroshima, far south of here, night
before last, raided all the rice shops and
pillaged and destroyed much property.
The same extra carries the news of out-
breaks of a similar character.

There are two reasons for th hort-
age of rice and consequent highy prices,
which are responsible for the rioting.
The first is that the Government permite
rice brokers—veritable food sharks they
are too—to corner a large percentage of
the available rice supply. The second is
that the same manufacturers have
bought up everything in sight and in
“futures” for the brewing of the vile
spirit that {is the damnation of the
Japanese laboring classes and the curse
of the farming district.

 

  

 

 

A Drink With a “Kick.”

Sake is brewed and distilled from only
the best quality of rice, and as a bev-
erage it has a kick like that of an army
mule, The lower grades of it are sold
as cheaply as 15 cents a quart, and as
half a tumbler full will reasonably “tank
up” a white man, its effect on the mind

| workman can be imagined.

There are two large anti-alcoho! so-
cleties here doing the best they can, but
their progress is slow. It was not until
last year, after efforts over a period of
ten years, that the societies were able
to get a bill through the Diet prohibiting
the sale of sake to minors. Previous to
that time I have seen youngsters of 12
; and 15 drunk as lords, clutching bottles
of the beastly tasting but efficient stuff
and tumbling about the streets in the
poorer quarters.

A prominent rice broker informs me
that the situation was most acute, as the
Government seems powerless to put a
stop to the tremendous inflation of rice
prices caused by speculators and also be-
cause the sake brewers and distillers
think that they see a big market for
thelr wares with the army in Russia and
are buying up everything they can lay
bag to for the purpose of making In-
toxicants.

WAR REVENUE BILL
WILL BR DISSECTED

Republicans of Ways and
Means Committee Begin
Their Attacks To-day.

 

 

ONLY ONE WITH KITCHIN

Fordney Is, Expected to Show
Chairman’s Assurance Is
Not Well Based.

 

Spectal Despatch to Tur &cN.
WAsHINGTON, Sept. 8.—Clearer light
will be thrown on the thousands of items
in the $8,000,000,000 revenue bill to-
morrow, when Republican members of
the Ways and Means Committee will
begin their explanation why 60 many

taxes now under fire were included !n
the revenue bill. Representative Ford-

ney (Mich.), ranking Republican on the
committee, will be the first to speak.

The general understanding is that
while all of the members of the com-
mittee signed the report which accom-
panied the bill some Republicans have
mental reservations In regard to some
of the taxation theories to which ap-
parently they have comnfitted them-
selves.

As a matter of fact only one Repub-
lican committee member is understood
to stand with Chairman Kitchin ifn his
insistence on an 18 per cent. tax on un-
distributed corporate income, while dis-
tributed corporate income is taxed but
12 per cent.

Excess Profits Tax.

Another point in to-morrow's debate
by Republicans will be tn regard to the
excess profits tax, championed by Mr.
Kitchin and his cohorts, and opposed by
the Secretary of the Treasury and tax
experts. The statements which will be
made on this subpect to-morrow are not
expected to agree very well with Mr.
Kitchin’s assurance to the House yes-
terday that the bill in its present form
is fairly acceptable to the Treasury De-
partment and the Administration gen-
erally.

When the last revenue bill was before
the House Representative Longworth
(Ohio) expressed the Republican view
when he informed the House that he
never, except under the plea of actual
war necessity, would vote for a tax im-
posed on the excess profits theory. This
line of thought may be pursued by the
minority members still further now that
the war profits tax is in the bill, while
the excess profits tax, with higher rates
than ever, is included as a sop to the
members of Congress who believe as Mr.
Kitchin does about tax legislation.

Hope in Senate Committee.

As there is a Democratic majority in
the House, efforts to place the business
profits tax on a sound economical basis
may fail there, and the Administration
and the industry of the country will
probably have to look to the Senate
Finance Committee eventually for relief.

Representative Fordney (Mich.) has
paid close attention to Mr, Kitchin's two
day dissertation, particularly his efforts
to defend the corporate income tax dif-
ferential and the excess profits taxes.
His speech to-morrow is expected to re-
veal a number of inaccuracies in the
declamation of the Democratic leader

A meeting of the Ways and Means
Committee {n advance of the session of
the House each day is expected as a re-
sult of the necessity of raising more rev-
enue through the loss from cutting off
the manufacture of beer. ‘axes which
will raise at least $20,000,000 a month
must be provided.

DIVIDE PRISONERS WITH VU. S.

 

 

Sept. 8.—Further slight advances by the| French to Allot Number in Pro-

Portion to Strength ef Force.

Special Cable Despatch to Taw Sux
Copyright, 1918; all rights reserved
Paris, Sept. 8.—An agreement has been

disposition of prisoners taken by Amer-
ican and French units intermixed ji
action, whereby the proportion of pris-
oners captured to be given to the Amer-
ieans will be determined by the propor-
tion of American troops to the total
engaged.

A bulletin explains thus: If 800
French and 200 Americans capture 70)
prisoners 560 of these become French
prisoners and 140 American. The same
rule will be applied to material cap-
tured. So far as practicable prisopers
taken by the Americans will be set aside
for them ;
