RIGHT JERSEYMEN
IN RACE FOR SENATE

Opinion Is Growing That a Re-
publican Will Win Full
Term Seat.

EDGE HAS AN ADVANTAGE

 

 

Record’s Tent
Campaign Arouses Much

Interest.

Spectacular

 

In New Jersey, where politics is never
adjourned between general elections, Re-
Dublicans and Democrats are getting a
Wt of fun and excitement out of their
party primary campaigns for the nom!-
nation on September 24 of candidates
for United States Senators for a full
a@nd a short term.

Whatever the outcome of the primaries
may be, the idea seems to be growing
that the Republican who lands the long
term nomination will be UWhited States
Senator Frelinghuysen’s colleague from
New Jersey beginning March 4.

The short term Senator to be elected
will fill the unexpired term of the late
William Hughes from Noverhber until
March 4. David Baird, long the Repub-
Mean leader of south Jersey, was ap-

inted early this year by Gov. Walter

LXige to fill this vacancy until his suc-

“cessor could be chosen at the next gen-

@ral election. The long term Senator
will be elected for the full term of six
years.

Short Tern’ Candidates.

The short term nominations appar-
ently had but little attraction for the
ambitious fn either party, and there wi!!
be no contests. David Baird is the lone
Republican candidate and Charles O’Con-
mor Hennessy, ex-Assemblyman of Ber-
gen county, has the Democratic fie'd to
himeelf. Both, therefore, are sure to ba
nominated. .As Mr. Baird is the most
conservative of Republicans and Hen-
nessy is the most radical of Democrats,
there is bound to be a most interesting
campaign prior to the general election.

There are three candidates for the Re-
publican and four for the Democratic
momination for the long term. The Re-
publican rivals are Gov. Edge, Edward
‘W. Gray of Newark, who resigned from
the House to make the run, and George
L. Record of Jersey City, who represents
the radical wing of the party.

Folk who make a practice of betting
a@re backing the Governor, as he is be-
ing supported in the main by the Repub-
Nican organizations in a majority of the

counties. His friends declare that he

jhas made a good Governor and assert

that he will win, There are sore spots
in several counties, notably Essex and
Hudson, that no one has been able to
heal.

Mr. Gray is making a hard fight and
has never hesitated for, a minute to
make attacks on Gov. Edge's official
acts. It is believed he will receive the
votes of many friends of Col. Austen
Colgate of Essex, who withdrew from
the Senatorial race after

been anxious to go to the United States
®enate. Mr. Gray takes considerable
pride in the fact that he 1s against pro-
hibition and woman suffrage.

Record’s Spectacular Campaign.

George L. Record, the candidate of
the radicals, has done more to inject
life into the campaign than any other
candidate. Since the first of June he
has been pitching a fifty foot tent al-
most every night, except Sundays, some-
where in the State and preaching in it
the doctrine of public ownership of coal
mines, railroads and all public utilities;
making the rich pay a larger share of
the cost of war, the single tax, woman
suffrage and natidnal prohibition. Thus
far he has covered all the counties in
the State twice.

The tent and 500 camp chairs ar®8
taken from town to town in a big van,
the sides of which are generously plas-
tered with Record’s literature. When
home folks go to their front doors on the
morning preceding a meeting they find
cards hanging by strings from the door
knobs urging them to visit the tent that
night. The van also parades through
the towns and men in motor cars shout
through megaphones what's going on.

Jameg G. Blativelt, ex-Assemblyman
of Patéson, generally does the mega-
phoning. O. B. Close, an Essex Assem-
blyman, and Mr. Blauvelt do the spell-
binding with Mn Record in the tent.
Mr. Record’s advertising methods have
been very successfyl in getting crowds
and much Interest has been shown in his
campaign.

“Thty cajl our tent the ‘circus tent,’”
Mr. Record recently said to some friends,
“Tt is a circus tent, but next year I
suppose they'll call it @ canvas audito-
rium.”

Democrats in Muddle.

The Democrats gre in as big a muddle
as ever and their factions are scrapping
in a manner that !s warming the cockles
of the hearts of the regular Republicans.
The candidates who have filed petitions
of nomination for the full term are
State Senator Charleg O'’Conor
Hennessy, who doesn't have to worry
about the short term nomination; As-
semblyman Alexander Simpson of Hud-
gon county, George M. La Monte, former
State Banking and Insurance Commis-
sioner, and Frank McDermit of Essex,
who has had quite a fad for running in
the open primaries.

Mr. La Monte is the candidate of
James EB. Nugent of Essex and others
who got together in a so-called ‘confer-
ence.” Because the rumor was spread
that Mr. La Monte enjoyed the favor of
President Wilson Mr. Hennessy wrote to
the President, asking if this was true.
The President's secretary, Joseph P.
Tumulty, replied thatthe President “asked
him to explain that it is his invariable
practice to refrain from expressing any
preference at all as between candidates
equally devoted in purpose to the suc-
cessful prosecution of the measures now
eo necessary for the nation and for 3
world.”

The letter was accepted as proof that
“politics is adjourned” as far as é

}

former

Jersey is concerned and the friends of
each candidate are trying to make the
Democratic voters believe he is a little
more loyal Wilson man than the other
fellows.

The Hague machine in Hudson county
is out for Mr. Simpson just now, the
organization men in Essex are with Mr.
La Monte and there !s a merry scramble
all around, The best prophets in the
Democratic ranks, who keep their ears
glued to the ground, deelare that Mr.
Hennessy of Bergen, who has long fought
the reactionary crowd and is a progres-
give of progressives, hag the best chance
of getting the nomination.

Special Despatch to Tum Sven.

WILKESRARRE, Pa., Sept. §.—‘‘Work or
fight,” the war phrase adopted to disci-
pline American labor into etrenuous es»
pousal of ‘the cause of world freedom,
was borrowed to-day asa strike slogan
by 600 free lance delegates of the an-
thracite coal miners. j

In bitter defiance of the refusal of Dr.
Harry Garfield to submit to a ‘demand
for an immediate increase in the wage
echedules the delegates unanimously
adopted a resolution favoring a general
Strike in the hard coal fields and sub-
mission to the war order of induction
into the army through the new draft.

A patriotic tone was given to the reso-
lution as it was presented to the miners
and no cognizance was made of the fact
that Dr. Baldwin, statistical chief, and
eight other members of the United States
Department of Labor have already ar-
rived in the Wyoming Valley for an
intimate eurvey of coal profits and living
conditions.

This is the resolution: “Resolved,
that we, the miners of the anthracite
region, unable to make a living for our-
selves and families, do hereby ask the
right to be inducted into the army, where
we shall be recognized as willing to do
our bit for God and country.”

 

 

MINERS DEMAND TO

SCRANTON, Pa., Sept. 8.—After a meet-
ing last night of 400 anthracite mine
workers, said to represent every local
in district No. 1 and held independently
of the officers of the union, a commit-
tee met here to-day and drew up a
resolution calling for an increase in
wages and asking for a definite answer
by September 22. The resolution ‘was
sent to President Wilson, Fuel Admin-
istrator Garfield and Secretary Wilson.

A meeting of the district executive
board of the union has been called for
to-morrow, at which President John Ty

Dempsey will take steps to head off the
movement.

ANTHRACITE MINING GAIN.

WASHINGTON, Sept. 8.— Bituminous
coal production for the week ending
August 31 was 12,642,000 net tonsa, the
Fuel Administration announced to-day,
and was approximately the same ton-
nage mined the preceding week.

Anthracite production for the same
period showed an increase of 125,716
tons over the week before, with a total
of 2,259,716 tons. ,

LIGHT ON ANTI-WAR
VOTES IN CONGRESS

Representatives Explain Posi-
tions to Security League’s
Campaign Committee.

 

 

 

 

 

The National Security League Con-
gressional campaign committee made

election and new nominees tn different
parts of the country. Among them were
the following:

Representative Morgan of the Eighth
Oklahoma district, who according to the
league has voted wrong on six of the
eight prepareduess and war measures in
the Sixty-fourthk and Sixty-fifth Con-
gresses, sald:

“T have been a member of Congress
since March 4, 1909, and prior to July,
1914, always voted for a big navy and
believed in adequate preparedness, but
between July, 1914, and our entrance
into the war I was somewhat conserva-
tive as compared with those who were
extreme in their views on so-called pre-
paredness.

“The entrance of the United States
into the war changed the whole situation.
It made self-evident and imperative that
which before our entrance into the war
was a matter of conjecture and opinion,
My view is that for an indefinite time
after the war it will be absolutely neces-
sary for the United States to kcep itself
in a high state of military preparedness.”

Representative Shouse of the Seventh
Kansas district, who according to the
league did not vote for all of the war
and preparedness measures, wrote:

“T have been a consistent and persist-
ent advocate of preparedness. In the
summer and autumn of 1915 preceding |
the convening of the Sixty- fourth Con: |
gress, I made a tour over the Seventh;
Kansas district in order to talk to the
people about it. That was not a cam-
paign year, but I knew that 75 per cent. !
or more of the people of my district irt!
common with the whole people of the
State of Kansas were opposed to any
measures of preparedness."

Representative McClintick of the Sev-
enth Oklahoma district, another of the
men who failed to vote for all of the war
measures, stated that he has been “for”
1914,

preparedness since July,
still for it.
Representatives Kreider and Crago of
Pennsylvania both replied that they were
Vv.

and is

in favor of preparedness,
Ball of Warren, Pa., replied:
“Believe as President Wilson
that military preparedness
guarantee

while M.

did—

is not

a
against war.”

 

 

VERMONT CLAIMED
BY PROHIBITIONISTS

Majority of Senate Candidates |

at To-morrow's Primaries |
Favor Dry Issue.

MONTPELIER, Vt., Sept. 8.—The ques-
tion of national prohibition will be re-
flected in the three cornered contest for!
the Republican nomination for <iovernor

at the State primaries next Tuesday.
The nomination is considered equivalent
to an election. .

The next Governor will not have the
power of veto if the Legislature ratifles
the proposed amendment to the Consti-
tution, and according to the figures of
the Vermont Anti-Saloon League a ma-
jority of the Republican candidates for

the thirty seats in the State Senate,
which is’expected to be as usual solidly
Republican, are in favor of prohibition

Nevertheless each of the gubernatorial
candidates has declared himself on the }
issue, which has been given prominence
throughout the campaign.

Of the three candidates Judge Charles '
H. Darling of Burlington, who was As- |
sistant Secretary of State in the Roose-,
velt Administration and later United)
States Collector of Customs for Ver- |
mont, and former Lieutenant-Governor |
Frank E. Howe of Bennington have an-
nounced themselves in favor of ratifica- |
tion of the prohibition amendment. Per- |
cival W. Clement of Rutland is the |
president of the Vermont Local Option
League and has maliatained that the |
question of prohibition might be better |
left for the voters of the State to decide

All of. the candidates have advocated
the fullest use of the State's maaaurene |
toward an energetic prosecition of ma

WASHINGTON, Sept. 8.— Government
control and operation of the rafiroads of
the country,have brought increased econ-
omy and higher efficiency than was
shown by private operation, according to
a report on the first seven months of

Stafford of Milwaukee has had himself!Govyernment control made by Director-
elected to the House after getting the j General McAdoo to the President. The
Republican nomination and then forc! ng | | Director-denerat Bays:

Democratic indorsement of his endo

dacy to keep a Socialist from winning
the seat.

Mr. Stafford hae once more succeeded
in getting the Republican nomination.
He was one of the self-appointed ‘“volun-
teer leaders” on the Republican side be-
fore an interim successor, ‘Jim’’ Mann,
was chosen. In the role of a volunteer
leader Stafford made himself so thor-
oughly objectionable to the Democrats
that his indorsement by that party's
Milwaukee organization is out of the
question, and-there are not, many Re-
Publican tears being shed over the pros-
pect of his early and complete political!
demise.

Along with Mr. Staffordjs prospective
retirement to private life bobs up the
question of his successor. No Democrat
has the slightest chance in the district
from which he hails. Victor Berger, the
Socialists’ nominee who ts under indict-
ment for seditious utterances, is the man
conceded by every one to be able to beat
Stafford hands down.

The question has already arisen in
the House whether Mr. Berger with the
country white hot with win the war en-
thusiasm can persuade the Representa-
tives to seat him as a member of the
House. The chamber does not like to be
put into the position of having to reject
any one duly elected.

Some chance of a solution is seen in
the fact that Berger will come to trial
September 24. However, the case may
drag so long that his guilt or innocence
may be still hanging in the balance by
the time it is necessary to get the next
Congress together in the spring.

It is conceded that at least one So-
clalist will come to the House in place
of Representative Cary (Wis.) to keep
Meyer London, the New York Socialist,
from dyi from ennui. Yet Mr. Lon-
don ht may by that time have taken
the primrose path to the obscurity of
Private life, as the majority of New
York Representatives think the Gold-
fogle cure for Socialism in London's
district will prove efficacious.

POLISH ARMY FROM
U.S. IN BATTLE LINE

A. H. Gurney, Y. M. C.
Worker in France, me
of New Force.

 

 

 

For the first time
Polish flag is flying «.. the head of a na-
tional army, and that army was re-
cruited in America, largely through the
activities of Jan Ignace Paderewski.

In a letter from A. H. Gurney, one of
the organization's workers in France,
and made public yesterday by the Na-
tional War Council of the Y. M. C. A,
something of the new Polish army of
freedom as it appears on the front is
told. The letter ran:

“Shoulder to shoulder with the Allies
in meeting the latest smash of the
Germans is a small, new army which
wears the blue gray of France, speaks
English with considerable fluency and
carries the flag of Poland.

“It ig the first tlme in a hundred
and fifty years that the Polish flag is
flying at the head of a national army.
But it is by no means the first time
that the Poles have rallied to the sup-
port for freedom and democracy.

“Less than a month before the Ger-
mans started their July offensive, the
new army received its colors and be-
came a part of the fighting line. For)
months it had been in training, first in |
Canada and then in various camps and |

in 150 years the

billets all the way from the south of
France pp to within range of the battle
guns.

“With the exception of perhaps

two thousand mer from South America
and several hundreds from other cour
tries, the whole army was recruited in
America. Every reader undoubtedly |
knows how active Ignace Paderewski
has been in the recruiting, and how he
arl his ‘committee have worked to see
that the Amarenth flag of Poland with
its silver eagles shall fly once more in
common with the banners of freedom

an able American substitute.

“His is the spirit of most of his cam-
rades, They are eager to fight, ever re-
membering the words of President Wil-
son that after this war Poland shall be

/a free and independent country

“They come from nearly all parts of

“Most of the new soldiers were in-
eligible for the American army because

they were not naturalized. Others are
well above draft age. A few have been
| fighting with the French almost since

“A daily increase in facility and effi-

that the railroads will shortly be in a
condition to meet any demands that
may be made of them if needed motive
power already ordered can be secured
and if the necessary skilled labor is not
withdrawn for military and other pur-

poses. These are very serious phases of
the railroad problem.”

The Director-General is making stren-
uous efforts to prevent the further with-
drawal of skilled railroad operatives by
the draft, and the question of exemption
of such men is now before the President.

Denies Coal Mines Lack Cars.

The Director-General challenges state-
ments that have been made from the

Fuel Administration, the National Coal
Association and other sources that coal
production was limited by transporta-
tion. He said: “The country has been
led to helieve that coal production is
limited entirely by transportation and
that any shortage is due to the rail-
roads. This is error. The maintenance
of an adequate coal supply depends in
the first instance upon production, which
in turn fs restricted by shortage of labor
and other causes aside from transporta-
tion."*

One of the principal economies effected
in Government operation, it is pointed
out, is a saving of $4,614,889 in the ag-
gregate of the salaries paid to the more
responsible officials of the railroads.
Under Government control the highest
salaries paid are those given the re-
gional directors, each of whom ts draw-
ing from $40,000 to $50,000 a year.
Though other salaries are not specifically
mentioned, it is understood they are In
proportion. Separation of a number of
highly paid executives from the operat-
ing end of the railroads and consolida-
tlon of offices brought these economies,

Despite the fact that men like A. H.
Smith, regional director: Hale Holden
and others euffered a cut in income, the
railroad salaries paid are regarded us
attractive.” The Director-General, who
is running all of the lines under Gov-
ernment control, !9 receiving $12,000 a
year as Secretary of the Treasury, and
nothing as Director-General of Rail-
roads. His advisers and assistants !n
the Railroad Administration are recety-
ing In many instances higher salaries
than he is. The division heads of the
Railroad Administration are receiving
$25,000 a year. The report atates:

“The reorganization of the operating
force has been made without any fm-
palrment of efficlency and with a re-
duction in the number of officers re-
quired and in the aggregate of the
salaries paid them.

$4,614,889 Salary Saving.

“This shows that under private con-
trol of the railroads 2,325 officers draw-
ing salaries of $5,000 a year or more
were employed, with aggregate salaries
of $21,320,187. Under Government con-
trol 1,925 officials (a reduction of 400)
are doing the same work, and the aggre-
gate of their salaries is $16,705,298—a
saving of $4,614,889 per annum Thts
total includes the officers of the various
regional districts as well as those of
the central administration in Washtng-
ton, except the Director-General himself,
who receives no salary.

“The reduction of $4,614,889 per
annum in the aggregate of the salartes
paid to the more responsible officials
has not been effected by forcing the ex-
perienced men appointed by the United
States Raltlroad Administration to ac-
cept salaries incommensurate with thelr
responsibilities, although in numerous
instances these salaries are substantially

secured, the Director-General says:

“These comprise some of the more
important reforms already applied or
under immediate consideration. Their
effect in increasing the efficiency of the
service and enlarging the capacity of

the existing facilities cannot be defin- |

itely @tated or approximated as yet.
Many of the changes made have been
effected within the last two months, and
under private ownership at least sixty
days have been required for the compila-
tion of Informing rallroad statistics. Ar-

rangements are being made to collate |

and publish them more promptly.
“Speaking generally there is good
ground for believing that substantial
progress has been made in accelerating
the movement of traffic, employing the
available equipment more intensively,
running trains more nearly on time.

Increase in Revenue Ton Miles.

“The number of tons of revenue freight
carried ons mile, commonly known as
revenue ton miles, is the utlimate meas-
ure of service in railroading. Applying
this measure we find that the revenue

roads (i, @, those having an operating

income in excess of $1,000,000 per an- \!

is equal to 8.9 per cent. The average

being 14.4 per cent., the average carload | his suggestion to secure complete co-

in April, 1918, being 29.4 tons, as against
25.7 tons in April, 1917. The revenue

an increase of 7.9 per cent., being 1,125,-
875 in April, 1918, as against 1,045,921
in April, 1917.

“Other evidence that the rolling sock
is now more intensively employed is to
be found in the report of loaded cars
arriving at Philadelphia and Pittsburg
during the first four weeks of July. This

report is as follows: .

“These figures siiow an increase of

of 7
number of tons per car in July this year
is 30.2, as against 25.7 tone in the same
period last year, The increase of 18 per
cent, If it were general throughout the

country would be the equivalent of an,

addition of about 432,900 cars to the
freight car equipment of the railroads.

The Coal Movement,

“These figures all show encouraging
progress. Just at present strenuous
efforts are being made to speed up tho
movement of coal so as to preclude the

recurrence of the distressing experience |
In both the production and}

of last year.
transportation of coal 1917 was a record |
year. Including bituminous, lignite and
anthracite, the production was 650,000,-
900 tons. Of this some 11,563,056 cars,

containing about 558,090,000 tons, were}

transported by the railways, The bal-
ance was either consumed or converted
into coke at the mines or near by. For

the last six months the increase in coal |
carried by the railways has been 437,976 |
ears of coal—equal to about 21,998,800)

tons.

“One of the great advantages of gov-
ernmental control is that the transporta-
tion facilities of the country can

concentrated upon the quick performance |

of an urgent duty. The energies of the
Railroad Administration are now being
largely devoted to moving the coal mined
as rapidly as the Fuel Administration
can deliver {t. Of late cars have fre-
quently been supplied to the coal mines
more rapidly than they have been able
to load them.”

Francis Hendricks,
Special Despatch to Tue Svv.
Syracuse, Sept. &.-—— Assemblyman
George R. Fearon, through his selection
as Republican county chaiman of Onon-

daga county, has succeeded Francis
Hendricks as leader of the organization
forces.

Ernest I. Edgecomb and Charles A. |

Smith have been named as treasurerand
secretary respectively of the committee.
All these men defiled Hendricks tn the re-
cent primary when the aged leader,
after signing the nominating petition for
Congressman Walter W. Magee, repudi-
ated him in the final stages of the cam-
paign and supported Giles H. Stillwell,
“dry” candidate.

District Governors to Control.
The new administrative organization
{and the reasons for its creation were
outlined in a memorandum submitted by
Mr. Vanderlip as follows;

“It is suggested that the war savings
organizations be reorganized to conform
|to Federal reserve district lines, the
governor of the Federal Reserve Bank
in each district to have general: super-
vision over ali War Savings activities,
occupying the same relatfon to the War
Savings organization that he now does
to the Liberty Loan organization.
| "It is belleved that by placing the
War Savings organization under the
supervision of the Federal Reserve
bank the activities of the War Sav-
ings and Liberty Loan committees can
be coordinated and eventually con-
solidated into one war loan organiza-
tion, thus eliminating existing duplica-
tion of effort and perhaps decreasing
the expense incident to operation.

“The appointment by the governor
of each Federal Reserve bank of a
| director of war savings for the district
lin suggested, this director to ,have
supervision under the governor of all
war savings activities of the district.
He will pass upon matters of policy,
publicity, expenditures and _ routine
management.”

¢These suggestions, Mr. McAdoo wrote,
had his hearty approval. Acknowlede-
ment of Mr. Vanderlip’s services in or-
ganizing a war savings campaign was
made as follows:

above outlined will be quite completed, I
cannot omit to say to you how pro-

you have rendered to your country and
to the Treasury Department in creating
and directing the War Savings organiza-
tion.

Apprectates His Sacrifice.

“T have not been unconscious of the
sacrifice of your personal interest which
this involved, more particularly in recent
months, since the death of Mr. Stillman
and later of Mr. Sterling have made in-
dispensable your attention to the affairs
of the National City, Bank, and I want to
express to you, for myself and my Treas-
ury staff, our apprectation of the spirit

district of The Mayor of Filbert, an absorbing,

Must know how to deal with local com-

One man—if he is big enough and fast enough
