Ten Thousand.

We have not the means of verifying
the estimate of the brewers that
10,000 saloons in this city will go
out of business next month because
of the Executive ban on beer, but
the figure is round and fascinating
and suggestive.

Ten thousand bartenders would be
welcome in essential industry, if not
in the army.

Ten thousand hardwood bars could
be turned into gun stocks, ship's fur-
niture and peace conference tables.

Ten thousand sets of mirrors,
placed in the eantonments, would add
to the joy of the man putting on
his first suit of olive drab.

Ten thousand brass footrails would
bo re. cived by the shell factories with
loud cheers.

Ten thousand groups of “private
stock” bottles could be used as
ketchup containers.

‘Ten thousand bungstarters could be
adapted to shipyard use for the driv-
ing home of wooden keys. One of
these interesting weapcns might be
seat to the Historical Society.

Ten thousand slates, after careful
washing, could be used in schools.

Ten thousand vacated saloons—
what would be the Increased value,
in money alone, of the buildings in
which they now nestle?

 

The Great American Army.

The announcement that nearly all
of the American troops hitherto bri-
gaded with the French and English
have been withdrawn for assembly into
one great army is among the most
cheering features of a season rich in
good news. This is not because our
national pride is flattered by the sepa-
ration of the Americans fivm their
allies, for it was an honor for our
soldiers to fight side by side with the
men who have stood four years of
‘etruggle in magnificent fashion.

The news is great because It indi-
eates that at last, considerably
through America’s effort, the resources
of the Allies are so large that General
Focu is able to set aside from the
pursuit of the retreating Germans a
surplus so powerful.. The United
States has sent abroad more than a
million and a half soldiers. The for-
‘mation of 90 per cent. of these into
a distinctively American army under
General Preagsnine will give to the
. unified command a complete army not
only impressive in its numbers but
tremendously important from the fact
that, as General Marcu recently re-
marked, the freshness and vigor of
the America\s troops are the greatest
single possession of the Allies.

It has been driven into the head of
the German soldier within the past
few weeks that, as well as being beat-
able, he is being beaten. More impor-
tant than Focn'’s recovery of territory
is his forcible feeding of the German
with the bread of dismay. To add to
this physical and moral victory the
banking of a huge army of the best
fighters in the world is an Allied tri-
umph, “Best” is here used advisediy |
and not merely through the pride that |
the accomplishments of the Americans
abroad have stirred in every Yankee
breast. Our men are now the best inj;
Europe because they have not only)
the courage, the equipment and the
food, but also because they have a
physical and moral strength un-
touched by the attrition of weary
years of war. They are looking for-
ward; the Germans are looking back
and seeing nothing but shame and the |
failure of a great, immoral scheme. |
Our men are young; the Germans,
have been aged by the fight of years
and of hope.

The ability of Prussia to avail her-
self of the last pound of man power
in Germany has never been underes-
timated by Tue Sun, but now it is}

beyond human possibility for Berlin's |
dragnets to bring forward a sufficient ,

number of men to compare with the |
man power that the United States
summons next Thursday to add to
Persnine'’s forces. Germany knows
this. She knows, or will know, of the
concentration of the million or more
fighting Americans in one grand,
fresh, vigorous army. She knows
that this army will not be reduced
but rather added to constantly and in
evhatever numbers are necessary to
peat her. Her submarines have failed

her undersea power, the day to stop

couple of years ago, the epitome of
regretful despair:' “Too late!” It

What Focn will do with the great
American army only a hardened mili-
tary critic would dare to say, and
after he said it it is possible that the
Generalissimo would do something
qQnite the contrary. It is likely that
the commander of all the forces en-
gaged against Germany has given the
matter more than passing thought.
It is only a few weeks ago that an-
other question, ‘‘\Why doesn’t Focr do
something?” was answered, ag it is
still being answered, in a most prac-
tical and positive manner. What
Foch wishes done with the American
army, and where and when he will
politely ask Persuine to do it, are in-
teresting problems for the speculator.
The one thing we are sure of {s that,
whatever the job, Peasuine and his
men will do it well. On this point we
are confident that our belief, if not
our mood, is shared by a man named

The Senate Debate on the Admin-
istration’s Mysterious Edu-
cational Plan.

After much discussion in and out
of Congress of the educational pro- |
vision for the new junior class of
draft registrants the Senate is as
much at sea as ever as to the purpose |
of the Government In working out an |
educational scheme under the powers |
granted—or to be taken as granted, |
The latest discussion of the subject |
was started when Senator Wareor |
succeeded in having read into the
Record an article written by Davi |
Lawrence, the Washington * corre-
spondent of the Evening Post.

The paragraph in the article which
was most commented upon and ques-
tioned reads as follows:

a

“If a boy of 18 can pass an exami-
nation set before him he may concelv-
ably have spent six months as a pri-
vate in the army and be sent as a re-
sult of an examination to enter Yale,
Harvard or Princeton or any of the
numorous colleges with which the Gov-
ernment will have contracted for stu-
dent instruction.”

Senator Watson wanted the chair-
man of the Military Affairs Committee
to inform him what tiie article meant ;
is the Government to take over the}
education of all youths between 18)
and 21 for general education, or is it
proposed by the provision of the man |
power bill to give education in en-|
gineering, chemistry and medicine to
those junior registrants who give;
promise to relieve the army and navy:
shortage in engineers, chemists and |
doctors? Senator CHAMBERLAIN re- |
gretted that he could not give the|
information asked for. “I do not!
know,” he said, “from whence this |
article emanated, whether {t was au-
thoritative as having come from the

 

 
 

 

 

its kind which has gone out from Wash-
ington.”

Senator Krany offered direct test!-
mony that !t was not the original pur-
pose of the War Department to pro-
vide academic training for every boy
in the country. He had written to
the Provost Marshal General on the
subject, and reported his answer to
the Senate, thus: “General Crowprr
wrote me a letter In which he sald
that it was not expected that-any boy
would have an opportunity to com-
plete his education except those f{u
the engineering, chemistry and medi-
cal departments.” 5

Senator Jounson of California
saw nhelther socialism nor _pater-
nalism in the Government's policy if
faithfully reported by Mr. Lawrence.
He saw Absolutism! He thought that
Senator Watson had started a foolish
discussion. “The Senator from In-
diana,” sald the Californian, “Just
like all the rest of us, has contributed
to the creation in the nation to-day
of an absolutism. I do not know if
the article which has been read is
true or not. If the salvage of a
smashed Democracy, Mr. President,
shall be the education of our 18 year
boys I shall gladly welcome it.”

Senator SnerMan thought the lat-
ter part of the article (printed above),
‘4s, to use the vernacular of the street,
a mere feeler on public sentiment.”
He was very cross because the Admin-
istration stole this and other ideas
of Congress and adopted them for tts
own purposes. He fearlessly said:

“However, there is little eee
made between the quick and the dead
by Cabinet officers, because they pos-
sess the vital power of resurrection. I
have seen it done, not once, not twice,
but by actual count I can enumerate
over eleven of those cases in which use-
ful ideas have been delivered in this
body, killed by the Executive frown,
and afterward resurrected by the Excu-
tive favor.”

And the mystery remains unsolved

 

 

A Fallacy About Birthdays.

About eighteen years ago a con-
siderable number of ordinarily intel-
ligent persons insisted that the nine-
teenth century would come to an end
at 12 o'clock on the night of De-
cember 81, 1899. They stormed and
raged and would not be comforted
when a majority of the world de-
cided to wait a full year longer before
celebrating. ‘The obstinate minority
may still live; and it may be they
or their children who come forward
with the amazing proposition that
a man reaches his forty-sixth birth-
day when he is 45 years old. The
appended letter is not the only one
of the kind that THe Sun has re-
ceived since the man power law was
enacted :

“To THe Evrror oF THs SuN—Sir:

that if the Chicago secret service
officers have in their possession an
authentic document printed in the
Austrian language they have the only
one in existence, the only one ever
produced in the entire history of the
Austrian Empire,

What oa deal of inconvenience it
would have saved, to be sure, had
the Austrian language been in use
at the time of that Panslavie Con-
gress held In Prague seventy years
ago, when the chair was addressed in
some twenty different tongues, with
such Babel results that the business
of the congress was seriously handi-
capped, until it was decided to adopt
German as the official language of
the assemblage. Of course a large
number of the delegates did not un-
derstand a word of German, but on
the whole it was found that fewer
representatives were thus inconve-
nienced than would have been the
ease had any other of the twenty
languages present been selected as
the vehicle of thought.

Poles, Croats and Serbs, Ruthenians,

of the Austrian Empire. That fs all
going to be changed a little later on,
but for the moment that {s the ex-
isting status of this polyglot assem-
blage. Now, how many among all
these different races are able to rend,
write and speak that Austrian lan-
guage just discovered in Chicago?
At a venture, not one of them. Ata

some degree of error concerning this
Chicago contribution to the world's

TRAINING FATHER ‘FOR WAR.

Simple Home Exercise That Is Also
Good for the Exempt.

Father is going to become a part of
the fighting force, He is to take his
place on the roll of military resources
and get ready to answer the call of the
President for service in any capacity
that a universal service country may
demand. With the most notable de-
velopment that American social life
has ever known has come a grave
problem for father. Soldiers must be
physically right, and the limbs that
once took hurdles on the campus or
the back lots have been stiffened by
years of age and Inactivity as their
possessors have struggled to earn their

question for the military officers who
have cut their instruction and training
to fit young men and who are very
apt, without warning, to make the
fatal mistake of trying to put dad
through the same paces that John,
aged 20, went to get his commission as
a Second Lieutenant.

father either in the hospital or the
grave.

But there is no reason why the man
of middle age, carefully handled, should
not harden to field work. Some of us,
impelled by both studious interest and
aecessity, have experimented with the
?ype, picked its weak points and found
means to combat the {IIs of inactive
years. What is here written is in-
tended as an elementary guide to the
man from 35 to 46 in the task of get-
ting fit. There is no question that ob-
servance of the ideas will add years
to the lives of men in advance of the
draft age and remedy many of the
| chronic physical troubles to which men
permit themselves to become heirs.

“It Is a tangible adaptation of the
dream of Ponce de eon,” said a promi-

nent man to whom the subject was
mentioned. “Why don't you take it

BERLAIN, With a faith simple and al-|
most pathetie in statutory language |
as a monitor and guide for adminis- |
trative performance, read the educa- |
tional section of the bill, and once |
more the Senate was informed that the |
expressed purpose of Congress was
“that the Secretary of War be au-
thorized to assign to educational in-
stitutions for special and scientific
training’ junior registrants in such
number and under such regulations
as he may preseribe.

Thus enlightened several Senators |
insisted that that provision does not!
authorize the Government to take |
over 400 colleges and universities be- |
ginning the first of next month, as |
promised in the quoted article, and |
fill them with junior registrants, tui- |
tion and board free, to receive aca- |

Senator Watson |

universities could give educational fa-

the community.

It worked so well that the same

a five days trial.

A soldier without wind {s as helpless
as a Big Bertha unsupported by in-
| fantry. The short wind of the man
|} of middle age has come through in-
action. It can be cured by reversing
| the ordinary course and making exer-
| cise count, The work should begin
with steady, brisk walking over a dis-
tance that {is approximately known.
The regulation army gait calls for 120
steps a minute, each step being thirty
inches long. Striking this pace the
walker will cover a mile in about
seventeen minutes. Take your watch
and time a mile and see if you can
make it at the regulation rate without
fatigue. The walker ought to begin
his work carefully, making every step
a careful part of his training, holding
the head erect, the chest out, the
stomach in, as much as good living
will permit, and swinging the arms
gently.

Take a couple of miles the first day.
Then cut to one mile on the second,
and go back to a full two miles on the
third. As the walking brings an easy
swing and the distance can be in-
creased without undue fatigue, in-
crease {t. And then, when the lungs
no longer complain at the two miles or
more of walking, break into a dog trot
for twenty-five yards or so at inter-
vals, stopping when the wind shows
strain and resuming the walk until
nature gives the signal for a little
sprint.

The time will come when the man

has won back the precious wind from
which he had been divorced for many
years, And with the winning he will
have made a big, long start toward
being born again as a physical person,

form of the simple ‘setting up’’ exer-

those which especially apply to the
stomach muscles,

Around nearly every forty-year-old
Waist there is a belt of fat, and more
‘fat has lovingly nestled around the
intestines and formed an arch under

floor, and day by day he is coming |
closer, until at length he can nego-

consc*ipt father places his heels to-

hips and then bends forward as far
as possible, after which he will circle
to the right, bending as far in that
direction as possible, repeating rear-
| ward and to the left until he comes to
| the original position in front.

By taking a dozen of each of these
exercises immediately upon arising
and varying them with arm and leg
movements, that belt will disappear
and activity will come back.

In the
,arm exercises the simplest must be

‘with the arms horizontally in front of
the body, then raised vertically and
forced back laterally to the sides as
a breathing exercise. Any store which

Manual of Physical Training for a
very small price, and a novice can

{t. But, better still, any soldier will be
| wiaa to mark for you such exercises as
fit the case.

The legs require suppling more than
anything else. Walking and a little
running will attend to the stamina,
but there will be creaky knee joints
and feet that do not readily work in
their hinges, which only persistent,
regular use of the elementary setting
up exercises will cure. But rest as-
sured that they will cure it, and trust
to time to show you the value of your
investment. :

The young “old” man ought to
start with five minutes of exercising
and then increase it to fifteen, and
finally to thirty. Thirty minutes of
setting up exercises a day will keep a
prizefighter fit, and the time that is
; thus spent will multiply itself by
| months and years to be added to use-
ful life. :

The importance of this work for
the men who are left behind is being

FRANCE’S GIRLS AND OURS.

A Defence of the American, in the
Kitchen or the Parlor.

To Tus Eviror or THe Sun—Sir: As

a constant reader of Tus Sun it would

give me much pleasure to enlighten the

writer of the letter concerning the aver-

sion of the average. American girl to
cooking,

City bred girls appreciate from their
mother’s experience in pre-war days that
it was an excellent plan to patronize the
canned goods department of our large
stores and delicatessens here, They do
the same in French cities.

Often there {s a snobbish reluctance
on the part of the American girl to ad-
mit her ability to cook or sew, as is the
case with the average boy to-day, who
hesitates to commence a business career
in the historical grocery store.

The answer to this attitude is not

 

For the man between 35 and 46 years | he will continue the bending exercise | ping py undermining or criticising or

| ble beginnings now have through the in-

flux of the thrifty, sagacious European
peasant.

A French girl has as little to do in
normal days in the household as the
American; I might say less, for the

vices can be secured at the extraordi-
nary price of five to elght cents an

France's social system ts entirely dlf-
ferent from ours. It is safe to say there
are no freedom loving girls roaming at
large in France to-day, of the American
school or college variety, who can cook
better than we. Our girls will adapt
themselves to the exigencies of war, just
as our soldiers have, even though they
were not born to cook.

This annihilation of the purest, most
wholesome, incomparable companion of
father, son and brother at this time has
its dangers.

It behooves the American girl to cul-
tivate the classic art of eye rolling, fan
manipulating and intrigue if she would
compete with the p‘casure loving women
of bygone days in France.

A Bachelor Who Would Be Willing
to Cook.

To THR Epitor or THE Sun—Sir: I
was much Interested in the letter headed
“Will Our Heroes Marry French Girls?”
I also have travelled abroad and am
familiar with the situation there, but
I by no means have lost faith in the
American woman. I have so much re-
spect for her that if I were fortunate
enough to capture one of them, or have
her “capture” me, even if she were
averse to or unable to cook, do you
know that I wouwd even be willing to do
the cooking myself!

Life is in a measure, and happiness
too, made up of sacrifices, and this
would be a most enjoyable sacrifice.
And I do (so my friends say) know
how to cook some dishes very well. I
have the record of coffee brewing, and
my friends tell me that the cup is sim-
ply delicious after my personal manipu-
lations. And I am far from being
ashamed of my accomplishments in this
respect, although this {fs not by any
means a sole accomplishment. I would
play the violin to her, and if she tired
of that the piano, and also would exer-
cise my vocal cords. Then I would con-
verse with her in Spanish, French and
Italian,

No, I cannot believe that any other
country excels in womanhood, The
‘American product is ne plus ultra. The
American bachelor man will not seek
abroad for his soul mate,

AN ADDICT’S CONFESSION,

In Spite of Hatirbreadth Escapes He
Cannot Stop Smoking.

To THe Epitor or THE SuN—Sir; A
correspondent suggests that we quit
smoking tobacco and convert the money
thus saved into War Savings certificates.
But you can't smoke war savings cert!fi-
cates. And we must smoke,

Observe the manner in which the sol-
diers crave smokes. They can't fight
without them. Thus the worldwide pop-
ularity of THs Sun Tobacco Fund.

The average man can quit anything
but tobacco. Convinced that use of the
weed is dangerous to health and highly
expensive, he still smokes. He knows
that Jt shortens Jife, but that doesn't in-
duce him to give up cigarettes or cigars.

I knew a learned physician who had

!atobacco heart, His professional friends |

told him that cigars would kill him.
He admitted it, but he sald that he
intended to smoke until he died. When
he sensed the heart attack coming on

MIRACLE IN MAINE
POLITICAL CAMPAIGN

 

Nary a Word Spoken About
Rum for First Time in
64 Years.

 

LIGHT VOTE LOOKED FOR

 

Gov. Milliken, Opposed by
State Assessor MacIntire,

Faces Cut in Plurality.

 

Banoor, Sept. 8.—Whatever the result
of the State election to-morrow, it can be
recorded that at last, after sixty-four
years of ringing the alcoholic changes,
Maine finally has accomplished the mir-~
acle of conducting a political campaign
without a word on rum. It hasn't
seemed at all like old times, when every-
body fought and slandered everybody
else for the love of “temperance.” In

, respects the campaigning has been

rather trifling, often it has been silly,
and always dry.

Maine ts to elect a Governor, Legisla-
ture, county officers, State Auditor, four
Representatives in Congress and one
United States Senator. A new ballot ‘s
to be used, arranged somewhat after the
fashion of that in Massachusetts, by
means of which splitting will be much
easier than formerly.

Draft to Make Vote Light.

The vote will be much lighter than In
1916, perhaps the smallest in many
years, for a great many young men have
gone to the war, and other thousands
have left the State to engage in various
forms of war work in the great indus-
trial centres. The question is: Which
party has suffered the greater loss from
these causes? And no one has the an-
swer. Probably there is no great differ-
ence between the two.

“Gov. Carl E. Milliken, who won
over Oakley C. Curtis, Democrat, by 13,-
330 votes in 1916, is opposed this year
by Bertrand G. MaclIntire of East
Waterford, one of the Oxford bear style
of Democrats, a successful business
man, a clever politician and something
of a Prohibitionist. He is the soul of
respectability and conservatism, and
through his .extensive travels as State
Assessor has formed a wide acquaint-
anco in all parts of Maine.

As for issugs in the Gubernatorial con-
test, there are none worth mentioning,
although a few have been brought out.
The Republicans have conducted no
speaking campaign, save for scattered
local rallies, not a single big man having
been brought into the State, where for-
merly illustrious spellbinders came in
flocks. They haven't found @ word of
fault with Mr, MacIntire—as, indeed, no
one truthfully could—nor have they pald
much serious attention to the attacks
made by Democrats upon Gov. Milliken.

The Democrats charge Milliken with
having made, or caused to be made, Fome
rulings concerning the draft classifica-
tion as applied to married men with
dependent families, and relating to the
dispensing of State aid to “aged” de-
pendents of soldiers, which they declare
to be unjust and even cruel.

Snys Rulinge Were Washington's.

To this the Republicans reply that the
Governor had no authority or discretion
in the matter of draft classification, but
merely followed orders from Washing-
ton, and that he is in no way responsible
for the interpretation of the term “aged”
as meaning at least 60 years, the Legis-
lature having incorporated the word in
the law and the interpretation being
made, properly, by the State's chief law
officer, the Attorney-General.

The Democrats also charge the Gover-
with

of

fanatical zeal in the enforce-
ment “blue laws,’ to which he
torts: ‘There are the laws-—I didn't
make them, but I have sworn to enforce
all laws. If your laws don't suit, get a
new set. Don't blame me for them i"
for respecting my oath of office.” And
that's the whole Gubernatorial campaign
in a nutshell.

| In the matter of the State's delega-
tion in Congress, however, there is a
more substantial basis of appeal. It
i isn't an issue, for every one is agreed

nor

 

|upon it. The only question is which
party, if either, has exclusive proprietor-
ship in it. The battle cry, started by the

and answefed in at least

| cans,

Democrats argue that

is: “Support the President in the

harmony and

progress {n war legislation would he
}served best hy the election of a Demo.
[cratic majority. To this the Republicans
lreply by ix to the record of votes
jin Cong! which, they say, shows that

Republican members have far outdons
their Democratic associates in support
of Mr. Wilson's war measures, and tha‘,
in fact, the Administration would haa
been in @ sorry plight on more than one
eritical occasion had not the Repw-
licans come to the rescue.
