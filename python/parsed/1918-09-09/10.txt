orld’s Series Scene Shifts to Boston With Red Sox Holding Advantage Over Cubs by Two Victories to. One

F
WILL PITCH TO-DAY

Expect Barrow to Use Him
Rather Than Ruth in Open-
ing Game in Boston.

Boston, Sept, 8.—When the Chicago |

Nationals and the Boston Americans ar-
rived here late to-night to resume the
world's serfes at Fenway Park to-mor-
row afternoon they found a rather
chilly and gloomy Boston awaiting them.
Showers all day and skies that prom-

jsed more dampness made the outlook ,

for the game to-morrow very dubious.

The Red Sox,
games to one, were confident of main-
taining the club's prestige of. winning
every world’s series in which it has been
entered. As they have been only a
mediocre road team thés year and have

ed themselves almost invincible on
their home grounds with anything at
stake their confidence was shared. by
thousands of supporters.

No gloom could be detected, however,
fn the Jair of the Cubs, They were full
of the same fight and dash that enabled
them to pull down the long lead of the
@ants and romp home the winners in
the National League. The one run mar-
gin in both the Red Sox victories was

too small for the Cube to concede any |

euperiority to their opponents.

ter declared his team was in better posi-

one game and also was favored by play-
ing at home, adding that his club ap-

and hitting. He would not divulge the
name of his pitcher for to-morrow's
game, but it was believed he would
start Ruth.

Mitchell asserted that he had not de+!

Big Series Players May
Strike for More Money

—_
B°&sTon, Sept. 8.—On their arrival
here late to-night the Red Sox
and the Cubs learned that owing to
the reduced price of tickets they
would not receive as much money
from the series as had been an-
nounced. Their share now is a trifle
over $53,000, and after to-morrow’'s
game they will have about $75,000—
oe of the players’ share last
This means the players winning the
world's championship will each get
about $1,200, while the losers are not
likely to get more than $300. This
will be the lowest amount yet paid
to players in a world’s series.

The players got together on the
train and appointed a committee to
interview the National Commission
and to voice dissatisfaction over the
small sums to be given them. The
committee was instructed to assist
upon the carrying out of what the
Mayers declare was the commission's
guarantee that the division for the
world series participants would be
$2,000 and $1,400 respectively. Leslie
Mann and Bill Kfllefer represent the
cn on the committee, and the Red

x menrbers are Ha:
