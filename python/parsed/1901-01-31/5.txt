The Proposition of the ‘* Angto-( ath-

olles

The proposition to unite the forces
the ~ Cathole party
Church in this country with the so-called
“ritualista” of England, as made a! a
meeting here on Tuesday, does not seem
to be of much importance, for the suggested
bond of union is only the common publica

of

tion in the two countries of an Fing)ish
ritualistic paper already established,
Of more interes f not significance, is the

expression of opinion by The Frnglish repre
sentative of this paper that the new King
the rit

 

will lgok more favorably on
{stic " movement than did Queen Vierorta
and that consequentiy the change of sov-
ereigns will be to i's advantage
Ir is not probable, however, that
Catholi party will find its hopes
fled under Powarp, though English
representative seea reason for encourages
ment in the circumstance that at San-
ecringham, which is the private chapel of
Prince and of Warra, the
service has always been of a good order,
that is, good in the eyes of the ritnalista.”
The new King is not likely to embarrass hia
reign by stirring up the hornet’s nest of
religious and ecclesiastical controversy
which would be proveked surely by any
roval stimulation of the “ Catholic " move-
ment in the Church of England. To say
nothing of the bitter resentment he would
excite among the Dissenters, he would
exasperate the hardly less violent oppo-
sition to it in the Establishment itself and
hasten the disruption of the union between
Chureh and The continuance of
that union is only made possible by the
Crowns refusal to take sides in the contro-
and resolutely keeping hands off,
for otherwise the Establishment would
soon be torn fo pieces by the radically
conflicting elements

The distinction between the * Catholic”
party of the Episeopal Church in both
Vngland and this country and the Protes-
tant party, with its various divisions, is
really broader than that which existe
hetween any two sections of Protestantism,
Lacept in the matter of the recognition of
the Papal sovereignty, that party is in
substantial agreement with the Chureh of
Rome. so much 80 that representatives
sought vainly, a few years ago, to get from
the Pope recognition of the validity of the
Anghean clencal ordera. Meanwhile the

Low Chureh " party is Proteatant tn its
and impulses, and to the last
degree of any encroachment of
the distinctively Roman Catholic doctrine
an! spirit, and the * Broad Chureh ” party
lends to an extreme about as far from the
one as from the other

In this country the Episcopal Church,
borrowing the Fnelish policy, Keeps these

and it appears in all the considerable dio-

practice are churches so troad ” that
they almost verge on agnosticism
“Moreover, the Episcopal Church in this
country is now largely reeruited from
members of other Protestant denomina-
tions in whom the old tenacity of specific
religious conviction has been weakened

Mr. Finck and the Doom of Women.

In the Independent our Wagnerian and
anthropological friend, Mr. Henry THE-
ormines Fyxck, asks with proper solem-
“Are Womanly Women Doomed?"
There are millions of women working In
employments A

other than domestic
great many women are educated; and
many of them are eco-educated in achoola

and colleges with men There are a good
many woman voters, and there are some
woman politicians and political agitators,
What is going to happen? Are women
to lose theif essential charm and become
a sort of poor affectation of the former
tyrant man? Is Woman's Spear, as Mr
A. Warp used to call it, to be enlarged
until the womanly {s lost in the mannish?
Indeed, one might ¢o further, and ask if
the asubiection of woman, about which
there used to beso much disquisition, isto be
succeeded by the subjection of man? Pre-
sumably the period, if ever it comes, of the
inwomaniiness of woman, will be the period
of the unmantiness of man. Also he wil!
have to stir his stumps to make a living
and to protect his rights from the encroach-
ing creature of the other aex

The prospect might be dismal if looked
at ina dismal! spirit, but as yet there seems
no ground for alarm, Mr. Finck gives a
good deal of space to thumping woman
suffrage, hia old aversion: but there is no
good reason for becoming excited abont
woman suffrage. The majority of Amen-
can women seem to be absolutely apathetic
as to the privilege or responsibility. which

Is the automobile about to aoqulre the un-
enviable reputation for death dealing which
he has belonged conspicuously to
the bieyele, the cable and the trolley? Re-
cent reports indicate that only extraordinary
precautions on the part of chauffeurs can
save their vehicles from that distinction
With a record of but twoor three secidents
weekly, automobiles were regarded as com-

of ore

 

paratively harmless. but with their increase
in number has come, unhappilr, a corre-
sponding increase of recklessness among

their drivers On Monday of this week
automobiles were involved in two serious
mishaps in this city A man Was run down

as he stepped from a street car, and suffered
a severe injury of the foot, while another,
in attempting to cross the street, was atrock
by an automobile and hurled into the air,
having escaped with a broken leg and
@ther injuries more or less serious.

wrested from their possession by the mighty
power of the North This, then, const
tutes the true cause of the solidity of the
South When the whites look upon their
estates gone (oO destruction and see negroes
installed as masters and overseers {n some
of the most aristocratic plantation mansions
in the South, there arises in them a senti-
ment which is a subsidiary cause of the solid-
itv of the South

The “poor whites” constitute another factor
When they see negroes in possession of
comfortable residences, with thetr aons and
daughters educated, driving their own teams
and engaging in all branches of business,
and when they notice negro lawyers, surgeons,
physicians, dentists, bank presidents and
cashiers, authors, editors, inventors, theolog-
fans, insurance managers and presidents,
college professors and presidents, electr.-
cians, Machinista and skilled mechanies, race
prejudice grows bitterer and the Routh is
made more solid Remember that the value
of negroes’ property in Virginia alone for
the fiscal year ending Sept. 89, 1900, according
to the report of the Hon Morton Marve,
Auditor of Publio Acoounta, was $15,856.570,
aa ageinet $12,000,000 the year before, and
these same negroes now own 093,541 acres
of land, when you seek for a motive for the

| race prejudice and incidentally the solidity

of thesouth Couple with this the fact that
the negroes of the United Statea own over
$500,000,000 worth of property and you get
another

Possibly it will be needless for me to ex-
plain that Tama negro and therefore do not
believe that the enfranchisement of tho
negroes was a mistake, Dut wasa right earned
upon the plantation and won upon the battle-
field. A man who will not question the right
to vote of a foreiener who has lust left Castle
Garden should hardly be permitted to pn«s
upon the qualifcation of a citizen who has
for nore than 280 vears added to the material
wealth of the Republic

] need hardly add that the North t« «em.
bolized in the Republican party of the nation
It in held by the South responsible, notably
hy Alabama, for the abolition of slavery, the
launchire of the Ciel] War, and virtually all
of the evile to that section which has followed
in ite wake

In further proof of the fect that the elimi-
nation of the negroes from politica will not
cause a brenkinge up of the wold Sonth, |
have but to call attention to Mise asippi and
Touisiana, two States which led in the dis
franchising movement They have prac.
tically blotted out the negro franchise Who
eharwes that the Republican party has gained
a footheld in thone States’ Recall the protests
of a New Orleans post of Confederate veter-
ane against the action of the locol committes
in inviting President MeKinley to the Con-

rederate reunion in ‘Tennessee In that

State the negroes have been practically
