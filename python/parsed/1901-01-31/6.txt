Supreme Court Justice Dickey In Brook-

 

Ivn declined to grant @ decreas of absolute
divorcee to Clara L. Van Bloehm from Paul
H. Van Bloehin yesterday, on the ground
that there had been an arrangement be-
tween the parties and that the evidenoe
was manufactured The « le were mar-
| ried in iket and haveone child The alleged

 

acts complained of took place in the United
States Hotel, Manhattan, on Deo 24
M. Belden testified that he saw the defend-
ant and a woman not the plaintiff in a roon

(ieorge

   

 

 

 

 

They had registered as man and wife liv
anda friend knocked at the door of the room
and when the door was opened the woman wr
yartiy undressed Helden said that wh
1@ had done was purely for the sake of friet
ehip He said that Mrs Van hi 1 Wanted
| afriend to help her secure evide and that
he went to the hotel at the request of her
lawyer In his opinion istioa Diekey said
“f arm in doubt whether any aduitery waa
committed at ail It is plain to me that the
parties desire a divorce, and the defendant
went through the form and wave the ap
earance of adultery. in t wht of two

gram was probably sent by the husband,
as no one knew better than he did the time ,
when he would be there with a feinale te

have achieved otherwise. It is said to have
been furthest from Mr. Bheldon’s wish to}

idd in the slightest measure to the mystery
Hf the case, yet his refusal, with the fact that
he consulted a lawyer and pern itted no
newspaper interviewer to discuss the tragic
event with Miss Sheldon gave rise to the bellef
that possibly the young womans knowledge
of the affair extended beyoud the printed
account

On Wednesday the girl's mother gave a
conelse account of everything Bertha knew
concerning the affair,and to-day Mra Shedon

said the family desires that nothing should |

be held back. She expressed the hope that

the house)oid would be put to ho additional |

annoyance and Ineconvenlence, It is suid

that Mr. Sheldon was inspired, when he de- |

clined to send Miss Bertha to the Pittsfield
inquest, by a father’s desire for tie well
of hia child. He realized that @ revisit
tion to the soene of the tragedy might en-

danger her health, owing to the fact par- |

Miss Bertha was of & her-
vous disposition, | Sinee the event in August
everything has been done to banish the
sublect from the girl's thoughts and muob
success has attended the parental efforts
For weeks after May Fosburgh's death
the voung woman could not sleep without
the preaegce of her mother or the adminis-
o

ticularly that

tration sleeping potiona, This may be
read with surprise by her friends, who had
often remarked how, dispassionately and

without the hint of nervousness she talked
of the afiair, Mra, Sheldon told THe BUN
reporter that during the day time Bertha
was not Wrought up, but eat night ft waa
diferent, For weeks the crime preyed on
her mind, banishing restful, natural sleep
The family were so solicitious for her happi-
ness that the case was rarely mentioned
in the home circle; papers containing hewe
of the late developments, police or Judicial,
were kept from her to the extent possible

Miss Sheldon's etory of the Fosburgh
family relations {s that they were of the
pleasantest kind while she remained a guest
at the house, and her ouly knowledge of the
tragedy can ‘be sumtued up in thie statement
made by her mother

“Hertha was awakened by the revolver
allots
room door and saw outside on the floor the
yroatrate form of her friend, whose brother

 

Cas beside her She quickly olosed the door
and pr ceeded to dress The pest day and.
intil her departure for home at noon she

 

refrained from que@
the famuiy ”

Mias Sheldon has concealed nothing from
her girl friends) She has told them time and
again the story of the tragedy, as much of
it as ehe knew from persuna experience
Those who know her aoout the very idea of
mystery eo far as she te concerned

Robert 1, Fosburgh, the contactor whore
eon, Robert 1, Fosbureh, Jr, is under indlet
ment for manslaughter at Pittatield
charged with shooting his sister, May LL
Yosbural, was atthe Astor Ho yesterday
accompanied by his wife His purpose in
coming here was to see a relative off to Europe
He talked freely with reporters about the
yavetery concerning his daughter's death,

 

and said that he could not at present advance |

any theories for the action of Chief of Police
Nicholson in arresting young Fosburgh
There is much that ts strange connected
with the way in which the case has been
handled,” said Mr. Fosburgh “Members of
two families across the street from cur house
heard the ehota and heard me shout when the
burglars were there Within five minutes
feven or eight persons were In my house and
heard my wife sav that Mary was dead — But
none of these persons was called to testify at
the inquest or before the Grand Jury, When
ny eon waa struck down by one of buralare

veard that tures bur@lara had been arrested
in Taunton my son went there and visited
the jal. The face of one of the men seened
farnfliar to him and he said t© the man: ‘What
ere you d sing here?’ The man replied
‘Oh, I'm not the man you are looking for
