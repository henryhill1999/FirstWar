Reid and Moore Not Blamed |
in Hearing Before Com-
ineree Board,

 

Wasnineton, June 4.—The recent |
Rock Island incident in the stock
market was aired before the Interstate
Commerce Commission to-day,

Samuel Untermyer, counsel for N. |
M, Amster of Boston, one of the Rock
Island directors supposed to be oppos-
ing the Reid-Moore group, tried to
show that the market for Rock Island |
was rigged by insiders, the price being
boosted from 20 to 39 in a few days,
only to collapse with the filing of an |
application for a receivership.

The plain intimation conveyed by
Mr. Untermyer'’s questions was that
the insiders manipulated the market |
with the full knowledge that a re-
ceivership application was about to be
filed.

This charge was emphatically de-
nied by the witnesses to-day, some of
whom—as did Ogden Mills—plainly |
acknowledged that the market had}
been artificially inflated.

did not believe that Daniel G. Reid and

Facts verging on the sensational were

ship application. It developed

that this action affecting this great
railroad system was taken without even

Wanamaker Advises Federation to
Use Newspaper Ads Only.

Hartrorp, Conn, June 4.—John
Wanamaker shook up the members of
the Church Clubs of the United States
in a letter read at the annual conven-
tion here to-day, saying he favored daily
newspaper advertising for churches and
not spectacular billboards. He recom-
mended that churchmen clean house so

that their advertising of churches might
be substantiated if visited by a stranger.

Officers were elected as follows:
President, Dr. E. R. Gould, New York;
vice-presidents, H. H, Heminway,
Watertown, Conn.; W. S. Sterling, Cin-
cinnatl, and Charles 8S. Shoemaker, Pitts-
burg; secretary and treasurer, Charles
F, Chase, New Britain.

“I have always been averse to any
other church advertising than a modest
placard on the church grounds and an
advertiwement in the daily newspapers,”
wrote Mr. Wanamaker.

WHITMAN, JR., HAS LUSTY CRY.

 

Governor, in San Francisco, Hears
Son 3,000 Miles Away,

ALBANY, June 4.—Gov, Whitman in
San Francisco this evening heard

Charles 8, Whitman, Jr., crying in the
Executive Mansion in Albany, 3,000

miles away. The baby's voice was car- |

ried over the new transcontinental tele-
phone lines,

The party here were grouped about
long tables in the Executive Mansion.
Receivers for all had been set up and
every one heard distinctly when the
Governor talked with acting Governor
Schoeneck,

The Grovernor was told that his small
son wanted to speak with him and he
intently while two nurses held
the baby near the telephone and tried
to get him to yell, For a few moments
the infant discouraged all efforts. One
nurse squeezed him vainly in the effort
to get him to cry, while the other tickled
the baby's toes and wiggled his arms
beseeching him to “ery, Charlle,"”) much
to the amusement of the guests,

“If he won't talk he isn't a Whitman,”
commented the Governor at the other
end of the line

At inst the efforts of the nurses were
rewarded, and a loud yell went over the
wires to San Irancisco,

“Oh, there you ure,” laughed the Gov-
ernor, adding that he heard the ory
plainly.

GERMANY EXPRESSES REGRET

FOR ATTACK ON

THE GULFLIGHT

AND PROMISES REPARATION

WasHinoton, June 4.—The following is the text of a note received
from the German Foreign Office relative to the attacks upon the American

ships ,Gulflight and Cushing:

Referring to the note of May
28, the undersigned has the honor
to inform his Excellency the Am-
bassador of the United States of
America, Mr. James W. Gerard,
that the examination undertaken
on the part of the German Gov-
ernment concerning the American
Steamers, Gulfiight and Cushing
has led to the following conclu-
sions:

In regard to the attack on the
steamer Gulflight the commander
of a German submarine saw on
the afternoon of May 1, in the
vicinity of the Seflly Islands, a
large merchant steamer coming
in his direction, which was ac-
companied by two smaller ves-
sels. These latter took such posi-
tion in relation to the steamer
that they formed a regulation
safeguard against submarines;
moreover, one of them had a wire-
less apparatus, which {s not usual
with small vessels.

From this {t evidently was a
ease of English convoy vessels.
Since such vessels are regularly
armed the submarine could not
approach the steamer on the eur-
face of the water without running
the danger of destruction. It was,
on the other hand, to be assumed
that the steamer was of consid-
erable value to the British Gov-
ernment since it was so guarded.

The commander could see no
neutral markings on it of any
kind; that is, distinctive marks
painted on the freeboard, recog-
nizable at a distance, such as
are now usual on neutral ships in
the English zone of naval war-
fare,

In consequence he arrived at
the conclusiun from all the cir-
cumstances that he had to deal
with an English steamer, sub-
merged and attacked.

The torpedo came in the im-
mediate neighborhood of one of
the convoy ships, which at once
rapidly approached the point of
firing, so that the submarine was
forced to go to a great depth to
avoid being rammed; the conclu-
sion of the commander that an
English convey ship was con-
cerned was !n this way confirmed.

That the attacked steamer car-
ried the American flag was first
observed at the moment of firing
the shot, The fact that the steam-
ship was pursuing a course which
led neither to nor from America

MONTHLY FOR BRITAIN

 

was a further reason why it did
not occur to the commander of
the submarine that he was dealing
with an American steamship.

Upon scrutiny of the time and
place of the occurrence described
the German Government has been
convinced that the attacked
steamship was actually the Amer-
{ean steamship Gulflight. There
can be no doubt, according to the
attendant circumstances, that the
attack Is to be attributed to an
unfortunate accident and not to
the fault of the commander

The German Government ex-
presses its regrets to the Govern-
ment of the United States con-
cerning this incident and declares
itself ready to furnish ful! recom-
pense for the damage thereby
sustained by American citizens.

It ts left to the discretion of
the American Government to pre-
sent a statement of this damage,
or, if doubt may arise over indi-
vidual points, to designate an ex-
pert who would have to determine,
together with a German expert,
the amount of the damage.

It has not yet been possible by
means of an inquiry to clear up
fully the case of the
ship Cushing. Official reports
avallable .eport only one merchant
steamship attacked by a German
flying machine in the vicinity of
Nordhind lightship.

The German aViator was forced
to consider as hostile
because !t carried no flag and
further because of no recognizable
neutral markings. The attack of
four bombs was, of course, not
aimed at any American ship.

However, that the ship attacked
was the American steamer Cush-
ing is possible, considering the
time and place of the occurrence;
nevertheless, the German Govern-
ment accordingly requests from
the American Government that it
communicate to the German Gov-
ernment the material which was
submitted for judgment in order
that with this as u basis a further
position can be taken in the mat-
ter

The tndersigned leeves it to
the Ambassador to bring the fore-
going to the immediate attention
of his Government and tak.s this
opportunity to renew to him the
assurance of his most dis-
tinguished consideration.

The peace strength of the Prussian
the Prussian losses to date are given
as nearly three times the entire peace
strength of the Prussian army.

The peace strength of the Ravarian
army is three army corps, 120,000 men,
that of the Saxon army 80,000 men and
of the Wuerttemberg army 40,000 men.
Assuming that the war strength of these
kingdoms bears a similar ratio to the
Peace strength to the ratio prevatiing
in Prussia and that the losses in these
armies in proportion to their strength
@re similar to those of the Prussian
army the figures would indicate that
the losees of these three armies to date
are roughly 720,000 men, which, added
to the 1,388,000 men lost by Prussia,
gives a total German loss of 2,108,000
men,

The total war strength of the German
fleld army before the present war began
was estimated at 1,550,000 men, behind
which was an estimated strength of
1,500,000 men, wholly or partially
trained, to supply the waste of war,
making a total paper strength = of
3,350,000 men, not including the garri-
gon unite or the Landsturm.

It would appear therefore that
equivalent of two-thirds of the entire
paper strength of the trained German
army already has been wiped out. The
total losses estimated, however, must
be reduced by the considerable number
of wounded who have recovered and
returned to the front.

A request for a direct expression
from Germany as to whether or not
she intends to abide by the principles

A statement that the facts set forth
in the President's first note in regard
to the character of the Lusitania and
her cargo are accurate.
