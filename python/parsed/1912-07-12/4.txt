te opinion that for the United States to
allow American ships to pass through

Innes's note, would consider that. the
treaty wos Violated whether tolls were
not collected from American ships or
whether they were collected and then

that the British Government believed
that asto discrimination in favor of ships

Mr. Innes added that a more extended

ROYALISTS SUFFER HEAVILY.

Routed Portugese Republican
Troopa—Preparations for War.

by

Taispon, July 11.—Definite news of a

|decided reverse sustained by the royal-—

jist revolutionists near Fafe was re-
celfved here to-night. According to the
despatch a well armed force of royal-
{sts attempted to ambush a column of
republfecan cavalry. The cavalrymen

| routed the attackers with a loss of four-

teen killed and many wounded,

The royalists fled, but were pursued
iby the Republican troops, who turned
\ the retreat into a complete rout, killing,
'wounding or taking prisoner nearly all
of the royalists.

Another band of royaists was at-
tacked near Cabeciras by republican
troops and completely dispersed with
heavy loss.

The republican government began ex-
tensive war preparations to-day, evi-
dently convinced that the royalist rising

|
|

in northern Portugal means a serious
campaign.
Though the royalists are avoiding

regular battles they have thousands
of guerrillas in the field, burning villages,
picking off detached parties of republican
|troopa and steadily adding to their
(strength from among the northern pro-
{royalist peasantry. The republican
‘leaders here say they do not consider
the situation dangerous yet, but admit
|

vigorously. They are
forcements to the north.

Many arrests of royalists are being
made here to-dav.
