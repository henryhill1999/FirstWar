Turns on Roosevelt,

The production of the new affidavits
was the sensation of the Lorimer speech.
It was toward the close of a three hour
effort that the Illinois Senator turned to
Roosevelt. He was almost ex-
hausted. His collar was wilted flat, his

; hair Was wet with perspiration and his
| voice was husky.

There was hardly a
Senator in the chamber whose sympathy

| Was not going out to him in this final

struggle. Lorimer himself had been on

| the verge of a breakdown two or three

times in his speech, but when he turned
to Roosevelt the bitterness and rancor
in his soul fired him with new energy.

“Mr. Roosevelt,” yelled Lorimer, “has
declared that my election was corrupt
on what H. H. Kohlsaat had told him.
He never read a line of this record in his
life. Yet he says he wants to get rid of
the bosses,”

It was at this point that the Illinois
Senator paused and sent to the desk cere
tain affidavits, These were documents
from Mississippi delegates to the Chicago

‘convention, who alleged that efforts had

been made to bribe them to vote for Roose-
velt. These affidavits had been made pub-

‘lie in Chicago and they did not cause very

mnuch excitement in the Senate,

It was only a second or two later, how-
ever, that Senator Lorimer again stepped
down the centre aisle and sent to the desk
additional affidavits taken since the Chi-
cago convention and not heretofore pub-
lished, One of these aMidavits was by
hi. A. Holland, a Georgia delegate.

Silence Impressive,

The silence on the floor of the Senate
and in the crowded galleries was im-
pressive as the clerk read the Holland
aftidavit. Here is the affidavit;

On this 27th day of June, 1912, before me,
J A. Fouche, Clerk Superior Court, ap-
peired ROA. Holland, who after being duly
sworn deposea and says that he was a delac
srute to the national Republican convention
from the State of Georgia; that on the 2ist
day of June, 1912, while in attendance at
suid convention in the eity of Chicago he
Was approached by Dr. L. Brinson at Chi-
cugo, IL, who carried him to the Roosevelt
headquarters, where he was met by Senator
Dixon, MeHarg and Kincaid. Dixon went
McHarg introduced Kincaid as a mile
lionaire, who said: “We are here to repre-
sent Mr. Roosevelt: are ready to do busi-
ness, and whatever you boys want we are
ready to give it to vou. If you will vote
with us to-morrow for the nomination of
Mr. Roosevelt, whatever you want I’ will
see that vou get it I refused to name

any amount or to accept one cent from
him.
Further this deponent sayeth not.

RK. A. Honuann,
Subseribed and sworn to before me this
oTth day of June, 1912
J. 4) Fovene, Clerk Su perior Court

Other AMidavita,

R. 2. Butts and William James were
the other Georgia delegates instructed
for Taft who had signed affidavits. Butts
swears that on dune 19, while in Chicago,
he was sent for by Dr. L, Brison, Ha
went to Brinson's room and Brinson, he
deposes, said to him:

We want vou to vote with us to-day, to-
morrow and the next dav, and if vou will
there will be $500 in it for vou each dav, and
if the convention lasts another day there will
he another $500 for vou

The Butts affidavit adds

Peoonent further saves that he spurned
the offer and turned and left the room when
he was adeeosted by Chirk Guire, who said

You ate a damnder fool than I
you Were

Willbam James, who signa the third
affidavit, is primeipal of the Statesboro
Industrial High School for the training
of colored boys. His statement says:

ention from the Firat distdect of Georgta
