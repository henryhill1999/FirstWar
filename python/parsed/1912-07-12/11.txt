There was more of a two sided market
in cotton yesterday and sentiment probably
je not quite ao bullish as it has been. This
8 due more to the technical market position
for the immediate future than to any change
ns to the ultimate course of prices or altera-
tion in crop ideas. The market has had an
advance of more than $4 a bale in the last
week and for three days it has opened strong
and buoyant only to meet with ensrmous
‘sélling on each bulee

A great deal of long cotton held by strong
interests has been distributed and some
of the market judges believe this has passed
into weaker hands and that further pressure
might result in scattered liquidation, More-
over, vesterday’s crop news was of a more
favorable character, as there was a sprink-
ling of messages claiming that damage had
been exaggerated Vor instance, several
Georgia telegrams stated that the crop
in that State was making good progress in
apite of the rains. Arkansas advices re-
ported an improvement, while some Texas
wires said that the crop in that State could
stand two or even three weeks of warm,
dry weather without injury. Color is lent
to this view by the fact that Texas has been
complaining of cool nights and low minimum
temperatures,

Yesterday's market opened strong and
excited under the influence of almost sensa-
tional cables reporting a 12 point advance
in spots at Liverpool, with sales of 14,000
bales. All options in the English market
were at the high point of the present move-
ment and quotations for actual cotton were

athe highest since early last fall. Opening
prices in the local market, however, were
the highest of the day and there was a de-
cline of 17 to 20 points in the first two hours
of trading.

It was rutnered yesterday that the
strength in Liverpool was duo to buying
by one of the American houses that had
“been a prominent seller recently. This |
interest was said to have become oversold |
and an effort was made to protect short |
gales by purchases in Liverpool.

‘Futures closed steady, with prices 1 to 3
points lower. Estimated sales, 500,000 bales,

COTTON NOTES,

Augusta, Ga., wired: “Half inch of rain
fell in ten minutes. Two inches at Calhoun
Falls. Augusta now cold and raining
steadily.”

Mission, Tex., wired: “Boll weevil doing
serious damage in southwest Texas.” °

Eufaula, Ala., wired: “Cotton crop fully
four weeks late. Very spotted and none

good as last year. Majority very email
or time of year. Farmers on sandy lands
have very poor etand. Cold weather dur-
ing June caused lote of the plants to die,
Complaints of army worms are being heard
and Paria green is in demand. Couldn't
make over 75 per cent. crop with favorable
weather from now on."

Liverpool cabled: “Jobbers buying in
their early sales. Bullish houses bidding
to sustain market. ‘Irade buying.”

Suwanee, (ia., writes: “The prospects for
cotton do not look to be good for more than
one-half crop. It is late, smalland grassy.
Too much rain. Had rainagain last night.”

THE GRAIN MARKETS,

Prices Irregalar—Weather and Crop
News Mainly Favorable.

 

 

Whent was again frregular, ending lower
at Chicago and ‘4c. lower to 4c. higher here.
During much of the time, however, the
tendency was downward. The weather
and crop news was in the main of a bearish
tinge, Atthe Northwest beneficial showers
were reported and the prevailing tempera-
tures were favorable, At the Southweat
the weather was favorable for field work.
Reports from some sections are to the effect
that the yield is turning out better than
expected. The new crop movement is
increasing. St. Louls received the firat
of Missourt wheat, It graded No. 2 red
and weighed 60', pounds. The total pri-
mary movement, though much smaller than
Inet year, wis larger than last week. fe
Atnounted to 822,000 bush., which compared
with 170.000 @ week ago and 1,152,000 a year

io oVit tpaders hammered freely and
there was scattered liquidation, Also aome
hedge selling was nottcentle

Yet at one time a sharp rally occurred,
Ut wae due to reports of black rust tn parts |
of the spring wheat belt It is true that

later on the rust did not seem to be as black
an it at first appeared. In fact it proved
t@"he of an entirely different hue. It was
nothing more deadly than red rust, which
is always present toa greater or lesa degree.
| But for a time the talk of black rust caused
we use of shorts. There was also
r less buying for long account by

nome “whe think that conditions in the
apring wheat belt are such that black rust |
is likely to develop later on. Minneapolis |
again reported a good de:nand for the real
article. The atock there in five days, more-
over, has decreased 925,000 bush. The

 

enbles were better than had been expected |

in view of the decline here on Wednesday.
Liverpool was unchanged to ‘3d. higher |
and Paria unchanged to 4c. up, while Buda
i declined only %%e., “and Berlin '@ to

Antwerp closed and Buenos Ayres
opened at unchanged prices. The exsti-

mated Argentine shipments for the week |

were only 1,600,000 bush., againat 3,134,000
last week and 1,544,000 last year. Before
the close, however, the pressure to cover
relaxed and prices reacted,

Corn declined early and then rallied.
Temperatures at a few pointa were too
high, but as a rule they were of the desired
forcing hind without being excessive, The
crop is believed to be making up the lost

 

ground. Beneficial rains occurred in some
sections, The receipts were comparatively
larcve, amounting at the primary points to

 

against 272,000 last week and
year. Later on prices rallied

} 401,000 bush.

Oats declined, though part of the lose waa
recovered before the close on the rally in

weather news was generally favorable, how-
ever, and nota few think the crop is going
to be a heavy one. The primary receipts
