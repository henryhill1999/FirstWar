GOSSIP OF WALL STREET. |

Vnited States Rubber common has de-
clined slightly on every day since a week
ago the stock was quoted ex the quarterly
dividend of $1 and also the zo per cent.
dividend in stock. Yesterday afternoon
the movement was accelerated and the!
stock dropped 2!5 points to 50, making only |
a small recovery before the close

The only notable net changes in prices
at the close of yesterday's market were in
the specialties, The action of American |
Can common attracted a good deal of
attention by an exhibition of pronounced
strength when the market was weakeat.
The movement here was remarked upon
in view of the fact that the individual who
has recently been apoken of as the sole
influence in the market fluctuations of the
stock is now on the ocean on his way to;
Europe. Other stocks which assumed a |
divergent course were all the Tobacco issues,
which recovered from 2'; to 47% points.

In the railroad list St. Paul went to 1092's, |
or within \@ of the low level of the vear,
made last month, which was also the lowest
price touched since 1907.

 

James Speyer joined in the general exo-
dus from the financial district yesterday,
sailing for Furope on the Amerika, George
4. Gould is to leave on the Lusitania nest
week, These gentlemen with three other
directors of the Missouri Pacific were re-
cently appointed to consider what action
should be taken in connection with the
Missouri Pacifie’s’ heavy investment in
Wabash Railroad securities, The reor-
ganization plan of the Wabash is now exs|
pected to be made public daily and Wall|
Street has received pretty definite ae
tions that it will be a drastic one, probably
calling for an aasessment of $40 a share on
hoth classes of stock, The Missouri Pacific
With the Tron Mountain owns $15,565,600 par
value of Wabash securities, of which $2,826,-
“00 is common, $9,826,200 preferred and
$2,826,200 refunding 4 per cent. bonds. In
the case of any such heavy asseasment as
now seenis likely the Missouri Pacific would
have to raise something like $4,500,000 to
protect its investment, Wall Street is nota
little interested in the course that the Mis-
souri Pacitic will decide to take.

 

There was a sharp rise in British-Ameri-

Was apparently in response to buying on
the part of people who wished to avail
themselves of the opportunity of subserib-
Jng tothe new issue of capital stock, whieh
is expected to be announced at the special

meeting of the stockholders in London
July 22 nest The company proposes to
issue 2.980.000 shares, par value of £1,
present holders to subscribe to the extent
of 50 per cent. of their holdings, Stock
must be shipped by Saturday's steamer in
order to arive in time for the meeting
It was originally announced that stock
must arrive by July 18, but cables from the
company’s offfees in’ Londen announeed
that athoueh tt was a great inconvenience
thedate for the acceptance of transfers had
been shifted to Juty 22 in order to allow
American stock holders to participate. ‘Trad.
ing in the atock to-day, therefore, except for
cash, must be settled by delivery of stock
with due bill attached for the right to sub-
scribe to the new stock,

The low price for Steel common on thea
Stock Exchange yesterday was 67's. On
the Consolidated Stock Kachange it was re-
ported that the price there did not go to 47',,
at which price there was a etrong demand
The matter was explained on the ground
that there was a large short interest on the
floor attempting to cover its commiiments.

As bearing upon the prosperity of the
farming classes in this country
partment of Agriculture has published
some interesting flgures comparing the
prices paid farmers for their produce on
July 1 this year and in 1911. The average
of prices of the principal crops representing
about three-fourths of the valne of all
crops declined 4.9 during June, whereas
in June, tt. it advanced 67 per
On July tit was about 17.5 per cent
than July 1, 1911. The price of corn ine
from 60 to St? cents, wh
ow cents, Oats from Seents and hay
trom @1y.00 to Bi Cotton and flasseed
were the only crops which brought a lower
price this vear. Higher prices are the rule
in all other farm products as well, the ad-
vanee being especially pronounced in the
