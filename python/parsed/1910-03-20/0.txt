‘The words were bardiy out of Burleson’s

ment to make him eee that he was doing
the very thing that the Speaker and the
tegular Republicans had hoped that sone-
bedy on the minority side woulda be
idiotic enough to do »

Mr Shirley punched Burleson itn the
ribs and waved his arm over toward the
Republican side of the chamber. He
was evidently trying to demonstrate
to Mr. Burleson that only a glance over
there was necessary to show how joyously
the Republicans received the Democratic
proposition. They were grinning like
besbire cate, every one of the old guard,
and slapping one another on the back
and whispering the good tidings from
eur ‘o ear

BURLEGON WOULDN'T SEE

But Mr Burleson would not see. He
shook the Kentuckian off, waved his
arms defiantly lo scatter the score or
more of Democrats who had crowded
around him to endeavor to induce him
to withdraw his motion to vacate the chair
and continued to baw! for recogni tivn
and for action on his proposition.

The Democrats who were opposed to
the introduction of the Burleson resolu-
tion feared that ite passage would mean
the elimination of the Cannon
issue in the present fight next fall
were more Democrats, however, who
favored the introduction of the resolution
than were opposed to it.

CANNON RECEIVES CONGRATULATIONS ,

The House soon adjourned and
came the most interesting scene of
entire afternoon. The Democrats and
the insurgents filed out of the chamber

some of them glum, some of them profage.
