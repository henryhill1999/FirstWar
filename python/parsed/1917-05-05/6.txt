CLUBWOMEN LISTEN
10 BILLY SUNDAY =:

City Federation Convention
Hears Non-Slangy Talk
by Evangelist.

 

MEETING IS WARLIKE ONE:

 

Prohibition and Universal!
Training Favored—Dr. Brady
Speaker of Day.

 

Riily Sunday took the cream off the
milk committee at the convention of the
New York City Federation of Women's
Cinbs, at the Hotel Astor festerday. He
and Ma Sunday arrived right in thé
middie of Mrs. A. M, Palmer's report
and received such a rattling reception
from the women in the grand ballroom
that the milk report faded, and those
ciibwomen will never know what Mra,
Palmer had to tell about King Baby's
favorite food. .

Billy was on his best behavior—seri-
ous, subdued, highly proper. All his
picturesque slang was left in the Taber-
nacie, and he didn't try to cHmb on the
speaker's table once. He came mighty
near it tWo or three times When he got
warmed up about woman's virtues and
her faults, but then he'd take a look at
the frail structure covered with flowers,
ewallow his Adam's apple convulsively,
restrain himself and go quietly on. Only
toward the last did he strike his usual
gait, and then he let off some Sunday-
@eque phrases about patching Husband's
pants, &c., and his audience laughed and
@ecided it was the real Billy after ell.

Ma Sunday was all dolled up in a ne
Diue silk’ dress, 80 becoming and stylis!
that she took out whatever sting there
might have been for the clubwomen in
Mr. Sunday's arraignment of some mem-
bers of the sex as “fashionable frames
te hang fashionable clothes on.” When
the audience heard that it just ked
down at its own silk draperies and then
up at Ma's silk draperies and smiled in
a chummy kind of way. When Ma as-
cended the platform she said she had
come to the convention—which, by the
way, was the biggest convention the
“Fed has ever held, at least 1,800
women being squeezed into the ballroom
—out of love for their charming presi-
dent, Mrs. John Francis Yawger.” Billy
declared that he came because hé had a
soft spot in his heart for all clubwomen
on account of his daughter in Michigan
Deing president of a club.

His speech celebrated the new era of
Woman. The time had passed, he said,
when all she could do was to “bake
Beans, patch pants and darn socks, rut
bazaars and rummage sales and keep the
church steeples from falling off.” He
Gelivered a wealth of statistics about
the number of wage earning women, &c.,
which sounded as if he had been hav-
ing a heart to heart talk with the suffs
end wound up by giving the sex a good
@endoff as posaible army genérals.

“When the Lord need some one to
fead in battle He chore Deborah,” said
Billy, “and Deborah showed that women
tnow something about military tactics.”

The convention was a real patriotic
rally. Huge fiags were dta above
the platform, and at each side hung a
oliken “Old Glory.” When the women
sang “America” and “The Star Spangled
Banner” electric fans were turned on
Behind these flags, making them flutter
and wave in the spotlight, all the rest
of the room being dark.

Most of the resolutions related to war.
One, introduced by Mrs. Ella Boole fort
the Woman's Chrietian Temperance
Union, appealed to the Government to
prohibit the manufacture and sale of
alcoholic liquors during the war. A
telegram was sent to President Wilson
indorsing universal military training.
Telegrams were also sent to Albany de-
Nouncing the bills pending in the Legis-
lature which would reduce the age limit
for factory workers.

The Rev. Cyrus Townsend Brady,
érator of the afternoon, praised Presi-
dent Wilson for his patience.

“America isn't fighting for revenge,”

Dr. Brady sald. “She jan't fighting be-

ner at the Hotel McAlpin last night to

formed two complete units of the Ameri-
can Ambulance Field Service.

telegram from the Secretary of War:
“Say to the forty-four Dartmouth men

called Dartmouth’s glorious record in the
revolution and the civil war and told
of a letter he nad recently received
from the present Eafl of Dartmouth,

“I know that you will be glad to hear
that the house of Dartmouth {as doing al!

Hopkins said, for out of 1,300 students
it has 1,097 In the college training
corps, more than 100 in the naval re-
rerve and nearly fifty in the ambulance
service.

Charled R. Miller, ‘72, editor of the
New York Times, sald he was gtad to
see that at Dartmouth at any rate there
was no délusion as to the issue at stake,
as there seemed to be in some parts of
the country, and Judge William N.
Cohéh, '78; E. K. Hall, '92, and Emery
Pottle, secretary of the American am-
bulance, wished the boys godspeed.

Every member of the unit received a
silvér watch engraved with his name and
the single word “Dartmouth.” Paul Gan-
nett Osborn, '17, a member of one of the
units, thanked the alumni.

BRISBANE ARGUES FOR BEER.

Woald Prohibit Use of Grain, How-
ever, for Whiskey.

Wasninaton, May 4.—Prohibition of
the use of grain in the manufacture of
whiskey but not for beer was urged to-
day as an emergency measure by Arthur
Brisbane of New York before the Senate
Agriculture Committee,

| Mr. Brisbane said prohibition In the
use of grain for beer making might
| drive workers to whiskey, as the supply
of beer in the United States will Jast for
{ only a few months if production is
stopped, he said, and the supply of
whiskey is sufficient for several years.

SATO MOVIE GUEST

OF JAPAN SOCIETY

Ambassador and Many Guests

 

See Views on Sereen at
, Acolian Hall.

 

“The Land of the Rising Sun,’ a mo-
tion ‘Picture melange, Was privately pre-
sented last night in Aeolian Hall by the
Japan Society. The exhibition indicated
that the Japanese entertain the most
cordial feelings toward the United States.
The applause of the native born sons
and daughters of Nippon when Premier
Terauchi’s now famous pledge of Jap-
anese-American friendship was flashed
on the screen—firet in its original char-
acters, then tn plain New York-—gave
ample proof of that sentiment. An
in a box bedisened with the entwined
colors of the two nations Aimaro Sato,
Japanese Ambassador to Washington, in
whose honor the society's fete was given,
nodded approval,

But the present and former subjects
of the Mikado who attended last even-
ifg—and they conetituted a good fifth
of an audience of 1,000—did not confine
their appreciation of their new ally to
that one demonstration. They applauded
the screen sight of the American flag
flying over the consulate at Yokohama.
They banzaled Old Glory as it streamed
from the Empress of Asia as she
ploughed her way, moviewise, over the
Pacific. And they chered ‘**The Star
Spangled Ranner,” sonorbusly played on
the Aeolian organ.

An informal and spontaneous recep-
tion was accorded the picture of the
venerable Count Okuma, former I're-
mier, one obliging young Nipponese
from Columbia explaining to an inter-
viewer, “The Count is what you might
call the Chauncey Depew of Japan.”

Judge Elbert H. Gary, who not so
long ago was royally received in Japan,
was not able to be present, as he had
become suddenly iIndisposed. His fel-
low members of last night's reception
committee of the society included Union
N. Bethell, Henry Clews (who proudly
wears the Order of the Rising Sun),
Robert W. Doe Forest, William North
Duane, Gilbert H. Grosvenor, 1. Ha-
maoka, A. Barton Hepburn, Herbert H.
Houston, Darwin FP. Kingsley, Dwight
MacDonald, J. B. Millet, Jacob H. Schiff,
Willard D. Straight, Dr. Jokich! Taka-
mine, Frank A. Vanderlip and Consul
General Yada.

SEEKS TO PROVE VAWTER SANE.

Prosccation tuthedacts Expert Tea-
timony at Marder Trial.

Curistranerstna, Va. May 4 -—-The
prosecution in the trial of Prof. Charies
FP. Vawter for the murder df Storkton
Heth, Jr., devoted itself largely to-day
to efforts to prove that Vawter was sane
when he wrote Heth asking that a whis-
key bill be paid and telling him that he
“now could love Mrs, Vawter with less
fear.” Yesterday the defence submitted
evidence apparently intended to show in-
Banity.

Dr. J, A. Knoblin of Radford, fn an-
swer to a hypothetical question, to-day
said he considered Vawter sane when
he wrote to Heth. Pr. J. C. Dowman of
Past Radford, also declared the writer
of the letter was sane. Dr. W. A. Wil-
gon of Radford said the writer was a
degenerate.

The defence rested to-day without re-
calling Mrs. Vawter,

 

 

HETTY GREEN CASE FOUGHT.

State Files Appeal
gate'’s Decision on Tax Residence.

” Prem Sarro-

Indication that the State Comptroller
would carry his fight to have a transfer
tax levied on the £190.000,000 estate of
Hetty Green to the highest court was
made yesterday when notice of an
appeal from Surrogate Fowler's recent
decision holding Mrs. Green to have been
a resident of Vermont was filed in the
Surrogates’ Court

If the Court of appeals upholds
Surrogate the State coffers will jose
from $4,000,009 to $8,000,000. The in-
heritance imposition in Vermont, where
Mrs, Green had a home at Bellows Falls,
{gs much less.
