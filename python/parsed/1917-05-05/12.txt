BROOKLYN VICTORY

tets Braves Down With Four!
Hits and Drives In Two
Dodger Runs.

ROSTON BEATEN, 3 TO 1

 

 

Boston, May 4.—TIt looks as if it is
up to Brooklyn fans to take Leon Cadore_
to their breasts and cuddle up a home

hero. Leon, be It known, was born and)
raised in Brooklyn, although he now!
spends his winters in Muskegon, Mich. !
And the aforementioned Teon promises |
to fill the vacancy dn the Brooklyn pitch-;
corps left by the departure of Nap |
Rucker. Filling Nap,Rucker's brogans |
js some feat!

On opening day at Brooklyn Cadore,
after the Phillies had pounded Wheezer
Dell all over the lot, went on the mound
and blanked the Clan Moran in the last;
four inuings. A week later in Philadel- |
phia he held the Phillies in the hollow
of his hand, Brooklyn winning 3 to 1.
To-day at Braves Field Leon let Boston!
down with four hits and pitched the |
Superbas to a 3 to 1 triumph, ‘

Not only did Cadore mystify the
Braves with his baffling slants, but with.
his own big bludgeon carved out two,
Brookivn runs. His long double in the!
third inning scored Chief Meyers from!
first and his sacrifice fly in the seventh,
sent home Cutshaw. He flelded his posi-
tion superbly taking care of his four
chances faultlessly. Bostons® lone run
was unearned, being ushered in on the,
error platter, Fabrique’s fumble of}
Smith's drive with Twombly

 

on thira |
and two out in the fourth robbed Cadore |
of a shutout. i

}
Knock Out Allen. i

Stallings picked Frank Allen, the |
former Dodger, to conquer his old team-/
mates, but the task was too much for the.
former Brooklyn southpaw. The Su-
perbas took kindly to Mobile Frank's
slants and after getting to him rather

promiscuously from the start finally
knocked him out of the box in the |
seventy inning. They also hammered}

Barnes, his rescuer, hard, |

At the start of the game Johnston ,
drew a pass, but after Daubert flied out!
to Wilhoit was caught off first and run,
down. Massey walked with one out!
on Boston's half of the first, but died}
stealing on Chief Meyers's rifle bullet:
peg to Fabrique. Wheat scratched a)
hit through Konetehy in the second only |
to have Fabrique smash into a double
play. In the last half of that frame
Smith singled with two down, but was
left when Cadore tossed out Wilhoit, '

With one down in the third inning |
Chief Meyers waited out Allen and drew |
four balls. With the redskin prancing ;
on first Cadore lashed a long double to
right, sending home Meyers, but get- |
tng caught stretching it himself, Wil-
hoit to Maranville to Smith. Johnston
singled to centre, but was Marooned |

when Daubert flied out to Twombly. |

Braves Tie the Score. |

|

Mowrey walked and took second on)
Meyers's single in the fifth. On;
Cadore's long fiy to Wilhoit Mike raced

to third, but on an attempted double i,
steal Mowrey was late in leaving third | ®

and was ‘nailed, Gowdy to Massey to!
Smith. Cadore’s nifty flelding of Ma-/
gee’s drive spiked a Brave rally in the!
sixth. ;

Cutshaw launched the Dodgers off on
a victorious rally. in the seventh with a
screaming single to centre, Mowrey
beat out a hit to deep short, George
taking second. Meyers sacrificed him to
third and Stallings derricked Allen and
rushed Barnes to the rescue, Cadore
sent a long sacrifice fly to Twombly,
Cutshaw racing home. Massey let
Johnston's drive go through him int
right fleld, Mowrey scoring and Jimmy
Betting a life. Daubert beat out a bunt
in front of the plate and when Gowdy
made a wild throw to second Johnston |
raced to third, Daubert stole second.
Myers flied to Twombly
