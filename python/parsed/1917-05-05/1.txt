ing of national wealth in the history of
the world was foreshadowed by the first
day's test of the response to the offering.

Telegrams came from every section of
the country. They steadily increased in
volume until the high tide was reached

ury Department offictally closes for tie)

Counsels Against Rash Action.

; .M. Tcheldse, president of the Council
,of Workmen's and Soldiers’ Delegates,

Jin opening the meeting, said that im- |

jnediately after the close of the seasion
the executive committee would confer
with the temporary Government and
that the result of the conference would
be made known to the oouncil at Fri-

that one c:@ deduce anything he wants

M. Stankevich, Social Democrat,
followed M. Teheidse, said:

‘was a mistake to send recruits to fill
the gaps in the ranks at the front, be-
cause these men were needed in Petro-
grad. The speaker proposed the forma-
tion of a coalition committee to exert
the same influence on foreign policy that |
the present council wields over home|
politics.
: “If the recent declar:‘ion of the Gov-
ernment is not retracted it will be con-
sidered a counter revolutionary attempt,”
said this speaker in conclusion.

M. Voytineky, the last speaker, said:

“Every soldier must know he is not}
i fighting for the ideas of Milyukoff, or for
Constantinople and the Dardanelles, but
for the new freedom.”
