It may be that some of the party will |
have to give up certain things that the
British may regard as not entitled to |
go through to Vienna, but it is Iikely
that, as a whole, the diplomatic party
will not be seriously hampered.

Had Happy Vacation.

Count Tarnowski and his family have
spent a happy vacation here, without
interference from «nruffed Americans,
and the Count declared that he had no
hard feelings; in fact that he was sorry
he had to leave us and that he hoped
to return to represent his Government |
under more auspicious circumstances, |
wlfch may be regarded as the for: ita |
expression of diplomacy. He gave out
this official statement before he dodged
the questions of interviewers at the pier: |

“Please convey to my countrymen my |
farewell greetings. During my sojourn
I did not come into contact with them,
T’ know from previous experience
that they are sober, industrious and law
abiding. I take with me the firm con- !
viction that my countrymen will con- |
tinue to honor this land whose hosp!t- |
tality they enjoy and that they will |
readily obey its laws to the fullest ex-
tent.”

“Anchor to Windward.”

It is inferred from this official address
that the Count appreciates that there
are days coming when it will he well
for his country to cultivate friendship!
with America; that it is not a bad idea ,
in stress, as another diplomat once said, |
to “drop an anchor to windward.”

held under the auspices of the College!

 

{Men's Training Corps and the chairman)ton {n the Marine Corps armored car
jwas Francis R. Appleton, president of

the Harvard Club.
Not an Easy Task Ahead. {

Mr. Stimson first explained what the
officers’ training camps are for and con-
tinued: ‘The big idea of this plan {ts to
provide officers for the new army which
is to be raised under the principle of uni-
versal training, upon which, I truly be-
lieve, depends the regeneration of the
republic. The principle has been ac-
knowledged. We are up against the first
step. If these camps are not a success,
if tie type of officers turned out is not
fitted for the work, then a tremendous
setback will have been given to the
whole idea.

“There is no optimism in the War De-
partment. The leaders are not proceed-
ing with the ‘easy job’ idea or with the
idea that the batuUe ts already won.
They realize that the war is to be a grim
and serious business for the American
people.’’

Then Mr. Stimson explained the ad-
Vantages which will accrue to the first
men enlisting for the training camp. He
pointed out the probable promotion and
the certain honor that will tome to these
men for being the first to offer them-
Selves, “But,” he went on, “don't go tn
With a false spirit, asking for commis-
sions before you prove to the officers in
charge of the camps that you are able to
take care of men.”

Roosevelt Backs Move.

Presently the simple announcement
was made, “Gentlemen, the Colonel,’
and Mr. Roosevelt stepped forward with
upraised forefinger :

“Tt wish,” he said. “to back up as em-
phatically as I can what Mr. Stimson
has said. |! have heard various objec-
tions ratsed to this volunteer plan for

We are asking you men who have had

to-day, said that the submarines dived
almost as soon as they were observed |
and that the ship was torpedoed a few)
minutes later, while the guns were!
trained on the spots where the peris-!|
copes were expected to appear. |
“I was on the bridge,’ said Capt. Ed-)
wards. “Five minutes before the tor-!
pedoing I noticed through the haze two

bow and the other on the starboard bow
T immediately called the attention of the
guruners, who were at their posts fore
and aft, and they ¢rained their guns in
the directions Indicated. The visit¥lity
was so bad !t was impossible for any of
us to say whether they were submarines)
or small patrol boats,
“While all eyes were

straining to

| penetrate the haze, both the specks dis-
| appeared. Then we knew they were sub-

marines which had been awash. We
were already steering a zigzag course
and the gunners were ready at the sight
of any target to turn a murderous fire
on the enemy. Nobody sighted anything,
however, but suddenly there came a ter-
rifie explosion, the results of which made
ft impossible to handle the guns.

“The torpedo had hit us fn the engine
foom on the etarboard side. The ship
sank quickly by the stern, going down)
in leas than twenty minutes, One of our
lifeboats was shattered, The three others
were hed safely. Naturally our
great regret is that we didn’t get an op-
portunity to use the guns, We had a’
picked gun crew who had proved their
markmanship repeatedly in practice on
the way over so there is no doubt we
could have sent both the l’-boats straight
to Davy Jones's locker if we had been
able to identify them.

“The ehip’a boats got separated after
leaving the scene of the sinking. Myr
boat had been in the water six hours
when we were picked up.”

Accounts of other survivors agree with
that of Capt. Edwards that the men at
the stern gun were unable to use it as
the force of the explosion ripped up the
deck plates. After the boats left the
einking steamer the submarines came to
the surface and asked the name of the
fteamer, her cargo and her destination.
