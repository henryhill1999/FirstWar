The Morgan firm, it is under-

task and believes it would be of benefit
to the Entente Allies In so far as tke
United States Government might obtain
More favorable prices.

Owing to the entrance of the United! tions between the Clearing House insti-

The Morgan house is estimated to have

+ Although we must continue to tok | §

wpon the “war hasard” as the chief in-
fluence to reckon with in considering the
outlook for securities, there appears to
jbe no reason why any man should feel
alarmed regarding the powition of high
grade investment issues, Furthermore,
‘at present prices the greater number of
| ateonotive investments do not measure
their actual worth, and it is believed
that irrespective of the changes that
may come to this country incident to
;the war the intrinsic merit of those is-
| sues will not be weakened and that buy-
‘ers who are able to increase their hold-
ings at prevailing levels will find them-
selves. in the possession of permanent
| substantial income yields. In yester-
day's market moderate accumulation of)
high grade investment stocks was re- |

ported for the account of important in- 120"

terests, but so far as the general public
was concerned buying was Iimited to ex-
jceedingly small totals.

The decline in prices in Thursday's op-
erations failed to attract outside buying
in the five hours of business yesterday.
And even the larger spequiative inter-
ests in Wall Street were not active in
taking stocks, except in a few of the
more popular issues, such as United
States Steel and some of the railroad
shares, which were considered cheap, es-
pecially in the afternoon dealings, when
renewed bear pressure and commission
house liquidation drove market values
to a lower range. Bearish traders, and
there are many of them, are not favor-
ably disposed toward the rails for the

————-| roaxon that they believe the high rate of

earning power reported in 1916 cannot
be maintained and that even with an in-
‘crease in rates conditions developed by

ithe war will interfere withenet earnings
| notwithstanding the large traffic which
the roads must handle along special
lines, as for instance, food products,
coal, steel and iron.

! ‘While bearishly inclined operators do
pa approve of the rails, it is interest-
ng to note that there are influential

wenhees in the financial district who

have been impressed with the work s0
far accomplished by the practical unifi-
cation of the railroads in the interests
of the Government. and who are looking

ward to material amd lasting bene-

a to the transportation industry in
consequence of the present scheme of
working the railroads as a unit. Of
course, if we are to assume that general
business gn the country is to be con-
tracted because of the war, we might
be entitled to the opinion of a long
period of declining railroad earnings.

But there is no good argument for the
suggestion that business is to contract.
On the other hand, it appears more
than probable that our {ndustrial ac-
tivities will expand along safe and con-
servative lines, although we should con-
stantly watch the item of costs.

GOSSIP OF WALL STREET.

To America’s Credit Men.

 

upon which we have embarked. You

are to be called upon for the exercise of |
your highest skill. Remember that your |

most effective response will be to main-|
tain poise and steadiness and to refrain
from all forms of hysteria. The nation

needs wise business action just as it needs |

gallant and noble leadership in the vari-

ous fighting arms. It is for us to bear

this in mind, suppressing first all tend-
encies to gamble in commodities, prices
and credits, both in our own work and
in the practices of our customers, and

then doing nothing that will unsettle
confidence. aa aha and self-contain- | Ai goatentoy

Closing prices of stocks In which there were |
no transactions yesterday:

The Traction Issues,

So far as may be learned there has!
been no investment selling, either in|
Brooklyn Rapid Transit shares or in!

Interborough Consolidated preferred,
which with the rest of the local traction
group have been under pressure from
professional sources in recent days.
And there is no good reason why actual |

holders of the high class traction se. |} in England,

curities should part with their certifi-

model for the other companies. Even,

bears would have the Street believe, and
although the company may find it neces-
gary in the best interests of the prop-
erty not to pay the interest on the ad-

justment bonds in October, the bankers

identified with the company assert that

there is no reason for uneasiness over

the future of the property. It is, under-
stood that there has been some friction

between two powerful Wall Street)
groups who are interested in the trac-
tion companies and that the chief basis
for the selling of the shares by the pro-
fessional element may be found in that |

situation.

 

Steel Versus Wooden Ships.

Even the war has not wiped out the,
lines of that commercial jealousy which |
is raging just now between the makers
of steel and of wooden ships. In great | AmakRDE 12) My 118%
part, however, !t has been confined to! ae 3

articles in trade journals and in testi-

mony before various commissions, It !s | 4m
vitter warfare even at that. Tho buiid-|
ers of steel vessels declare that wooden
ships are antiquated ; that they lack re-
sistance power, speed and durability, and
that the newly appointed Shipping Board

is dominated by men from the Pacific

coast who are vitally interested in the
revival of the wooden ship. The wooden.
ship supporters counter with the argu-
ment that the vessels may be turned
out much more quickly and that tke sup-
ply of raw material is practically limit-
less. In the meanwhile Gen. Goethals,
who has charge of the construction, is.
saying nothing, but is rapidly sawing
wood into cargo carriers. Some of the
long winded arguments now cluttering
up the trade journals would be decidedly
amusing to him—if he ever gets the time

to read them.

 

Banks Lose 8109,000,000,

do

According to the known movement of | EC
currency in the week the local banks | ©
have lost a greater amount of cash than
in any preceding week in the history of]

the New York Clearing House Associa-

tion, It is estimated that there has been |
an actual reduction of more than $109,-
000,000, due of course to the transfer of

funds to the Federal reserve’ bank,

chiefly on account of payments incident
to the interchange of Federal certificates
of indebtedness preparatory to the offer- |
ing of the liberty loan. The Federal re-
serve bank had a credit balance at the!
Clearing House of more than $90,000,000. | |:
The Federal reserve bank now exercises |
the paramount influence in local mone-/|
tary operations, and in consequence
there must be discrepancies hetween the |,
results of the compilation of the trace-
able movement of funds cach week and

the actual bank statement.

 

Not Following New Haven.

Those in close touch with Delaware
and Hudson affairs denied yesterday the
rumors that this read ts following the |
course which marked the New Haven be-

fore the present excellent management

took charge of the big New England
property. They asserted that the

slump in earnings last year was
due to Migher expenses resulting
from ,congestion, but that the peak
in this connection may be considered

to have been reached. Operating of-

ficials expect a better showing of earn-
ings owing to the gradual improvement

in traffle conditions. The stock, which

has declined shasply since publication
of the annual report, was extremely

weak yesterday and changed hands as |

low as 106, commared with 1517, the
high of the year tn January. Ac-
companying the decline, was ai tru-
mor that the dividend would be re-
duced to 6 per cent. annually, but this

was denied by important interests identi-

fled with the property. An official of the
company attributes the decline to sac-
tivity by professional stock market
traders. The transfer books do not

New Waven's Earnings Up.

New York, New Haven and Hartford
is slowly but surely strengthening Its
financial position, a reflection of which
{s found in the company’s report for
March, which shows net corporate in-
come, including that of the properties
separately operated, of $189,489, as com-
pared with a deficit of $229,357 in the
corresponding month last year. Execlud-
ing the earnings of the allied companies,
the New Haven alone showed net cor-
porate income of $155,002, against a
deficit of $68,605 In March a year ago,
while for the three months it presented
an income account of $88,220, as com-
pared with a deficit of $892,226 in the
same time in 1916. Ratiway operating
revenues of the New Haven alone to-
talled in March $6,923,847, an increase
of $826,221, and net operating revenues
were $1,647,490, an increase of $309,269.
Gross income, however, was somewhat
smaller than in 1916 ‘because of tho
falling off in non-operating incoine, but,
on the other hand, deductions from gross
income of interest, rentals, &c., were
substantially smaller than in March Inst
year. For the three months gross oper-
ating revenues were $19,260,413, against
$17,904,860 in 1916, and net operating
