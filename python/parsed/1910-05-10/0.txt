PROCLAMATION AT ST. JAMES'A.

The firet proclamation ceremony took
lock in Friary Court of the
ancient Todor palace of St. James, where
for centimes the Kings of England have
been proclaimed, just as George V. was
proclaimed on this wintry May morning

The court was filled with guardemen
with their officers and colors. The officers
of all the regiments wore crape bands
on their left arms and the colors were
drawn with crape streamers. The royal

faithful day's work had fifty names to
the petition, most of them of Democrate.

This, however, is only a beginning
of the work that she is determined to

Mrs. Morse was accompanied to-day
by a sister of the convicted banker and
by Cotter T. Bride, who is William Jen-
pings Bryan's most intimate friend in
Washington. It was through Mr. Bride's
efforts that Mrs. Morse got her start
among the Democrats of the House.

Many members of the House admitted
that they had signed the petition chiefly
because they admired the spirit shown
by Mrs. Morse. The wife of the convicted

Morse declined to-night to make public

she will take the petition to the peni-
