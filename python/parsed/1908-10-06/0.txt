ARMY OFFICERS’ LONG HIKB'
ait ce tes

 

And Finish Nearty an Hour Ahead of |
Schedule and So Strong That They Go |
Nearly a Mile Further—Mules {More |

Fatigued Than They--More To-tlay.

Walking is being generally indulged
in these days by the officers of the line
in the Department of the East, United
States Army. Everybody votes it just |
the finest exorcise possible these perfect |

fall days. Besides, the Secretary of War |
has ordered it. According to edict, the |
mounted officers of the army have been |
riding ninety miles, and now the line,
officers are walking fifty. Not all in one |

day, though. The department is not

be walked in three consecutive days.

Yesterday was the first of the three
days and a pleasant time was had by a
group of seven officers whose headquarters
is at Governors Island. The Depart-
ment order takes no account of weather.
It merely says that walking must be in-
dulged in on Ootober §,6and 7. However,
the pedestrians in this neighborhood
unanimously voted that ‘they couldn't
have picked out a better day if the seleo-
tion had been left to them.

The first day’s programme for the
Governors Island group called for a spin |
of seventeen miles, and the seven offiders
of the group were finishing so strong
that they threw in’an extra two-t’ ‘rds of
a mile at the windup justfor gooa .neas-
ure. -More than this, the schedule called
for seventeen miles in six hours, but the
Governors Island contingent did their
seventeen and two-thirds miles in just
about five hours.

The Governors Island group did their
walking in Brooklyn. Lieut.-Col. Louis
Brechemin, as senior officer of this
contingent, directed operations. Col.
Brechemin is 56 years old, but the other
pedestrians averaged something like 43
years They included Major George T.
Holloway, Pay Department; Major D:
Skerrett, Pay Department; Major A. W.
Kimball, Quartermaster’s Department;
Major R. M. Edwards, Commissary De-
partment; Major Wirt Robinson, Coast
Artillery, and Major Archibald Campbell,
Coast Artillery. ye

The officers gathered at the Bowlin
Green station of the subway at 7 o'clock |
in the morning and went to the Nevins |
street station in Brooklyn, where the hike
began. Each officer wore the field scabs
form, consisting of campaign hat, khaki
coat and breeches, olive flannel shirt,
leggings and russet shoes The walk
began at half past 7, the line of march
taking the officers up through Prospect
Park, over the Ocean Boulevard to Coney
Island, where a stop of about fifteen min-
utes was made. From the island the
officers retraced their steps to the “start-
ing point, but when they got there they
felt so spry that they plugged right along
to the Borough Hall, where they arrived
at half past 12, just five hours after they
had started.

On the way-to Coney Island the pedes-
trians hit up a pace that was pretty near
to four miles an hour, but on starting on
the return trip they found themselves so
far ahead of their schedule that they took
things more easily. Nobody took any-
thing to eat until the journey was finished,
and water was the only drink and very
little of that. Nobody shed his blouse
except Col. Brechemin, who carried his
over his arm fora part of the trip. Every
one of the seven appeared to be an excel-
lent walker and all of them stepped along
jauntily and with every appearance of
ease. Roll call at the finish showed that
no blisters were present and all hands
hurried away for luncheon and baths,
confident that the second day of the three
would be quite as enjoyable as the first.

“We could easily have done twenty-five
miles to-day,” said one, of the officers,
“but as we've got two days more walking
ahead of us and nobody can tell what the
weather is likely to be it seemed just as
well to save ourselves for what’s coming.
We walk to-morrow and the next day,
even if it's hurricane weather, you know.”

The military pedestrians were trailed
on their hike by an army ambulance drawn
by a pair of mules and containing the
ponchos and overcoats of the officers,
in case a shower should come up. It)
would be pleasant to say that the mules |
finished the walk in as good condition as
the officers, but it wouldn't be true. Asa
matter of fact the mules showed distinct
signs of fatigue and it wouldn't be strange
if they were shortly ordered before a
retiring board. |

Before the test began all the officers
concerned were put through a medical |
examination by Lieut.-Col. Charles Rich-
ard of the Medical Corps and Lieut, Adair
of the Medical Reserye Corps, All of |
them passed it with flying colors. After

be over practically the same course, but
seven hours will be allowed the seventeen
miles instead of six allowed for the first
dey. The order calls for 50 miles in |
twenty hours, inclusive of stops, and if |
all the pedestrians are as fit as the Gov- |
ernors Island contingent the conditions
will be voted rather soft.

stantly killed late yesterday afternoon
in a runaway on the Hudson Boulevard
at Weehawken Heights, .

teenth street whén the driver tried to
pass between a steam roller engaged in
repairing the pavement and an auto-~-
mobile. The horses bolted and ran down
tbe hill, throwing the driver.

but her strength was insufficient, and be-
fore her son could take the reins from her

son picked up the fallen reins, but the
carriage lurched from side to side, and
when opposite Heighwood Terrace the
maid, who bad jumped to her feet in her
fright, was thrown out. The horses had
run a mile then. ‘

reins until the team got to Hudson avenue,
and then hé too was thrown out The
horses ran on through lower Weekawken
and finally were caught at Twelfth street
in Hoboken.

DE WOLF HOPPER HAS A FALL.
It Was at the End of the First Act of His
New Piay—The Audience Dismissed.

Synacvar, Oct. 5.—Just before the our-
tain was to have been rung down at the
end of the first act of De Wolf Hopper's
new play “What Happened Then” at
the Wieting Opera House to-night Mr.
Hopper met with an accident which made
it necessary to dismiss the audience, The
accident occurred in the part where as
Mr. Hopper sneezes he disappears into
the flies by means of a strap fastened
about his waist. To, this strap is attached
a hook and the hook broke.

Instead of a dummy falling to the stage
a comedian weighing 240 pounds fell
eight feet and landed on the stage on his
head in full view of the audience. Mem-

ra of the company danced about him on
the stage to obscure the vision of the
audience, A member of the company then
came before the curtain and asked for a
physician, Dr. Mark Heiman responded.

He found the actor unconscious from
concussion. He had a hemorrhage of

FOR SCHOOLS, 33 MILLIONS.

Mayor Asks Why the Cost Per Pupil
Vartes So Among the Higher Schools, |
The Board of Education asked the |

Board of Estimate yesterday for $38,031,-

484 for next year, an increase of more

than $6000,000. President Egerton lL..

Winthrop said that the mandatory in-

crease of teachers’ salaries would amount

to $3,273,000 and that the budget called
for $2,222,000 for new schools

Supt. Maxwell stated that the cost
in the high schools was £90.97 a pupil.
and when President Finley of the College
of the City of New York asked for an
increased appropriation the Mayor did
some figuring and then remarked that
the boys in the City College cost $129
per capita. He asked why there should
be so wide a difference.

“We prefer tq have our own way in
this work,” said.Dr. Finley.

A few moments later when Chairman
Sherman of the executive committee |
of the Normal College said that_ there
it was $53.13 per capita the Mayor threw |
up his hands and confessed that he was |

N.Y. U. CELEBRATES UNWISELY.

Some Law Students Get Inte Difficulties
With the Pojice®

A crowd of forty or fifty students of
the New York University law school
were holding some sort of a celebration
last night in the basement of 106 Waverley
place. In the celebration some of the
students managed to get their part of
the event as far as the sidewalk, At the
time that the students reached the curb
William L. Schwartz of 817 Second avenue
came along. He said one of the students
struck him in the eye and broke his glasses.

Schwartz went to the Mercer street
precinct and made a complaint and act-
ing Capt. Henry sent Detective Keleher
around to the house with Mr. Schwartz.
Keleher found about forty students in
the basement of the house and when the
students saw that Keleher was an officer
they began to dive out of the windows |
and run through doors.

Schwartz pointed out John Mason,
who lived in the house, as his assailant,
and Keleher pulled Mason out from under
a bed. When Mason was put under
arrest the others came back in the room
and tried to get Mason away from Keleher. |
Schwartz ran outside the house and noti-
fied Capt. Henry, who sent around a patrol
wagon load of the reserves.

The reserves captured Henry Lawton
of 106 Waverley place and John McGuire
of 265 St. Nicholas avenue. The latter
was being sat upon by Keleher while he
held ‘on to Mason with his free hands.
Lawton and McGuire were charged with
interfering with an esr and Mason
with felonoious ». All three got
bail later.

STANDARD OIL FOR ROOSEVELT.

Judge Parker Says Company Subscribed
$100,000 to His Campaign Fund.

BaLTIMONF, Oct. 5.—In a speech at
Richmond Market Hall to-night, which
was listened to by a great crowd of cheer-
ing Democrats.ex-Judge Alton B. Parker
discussed campaign contributions. He
quoted the Roosevelt-Harriman  ocorre-
spondence and said that when Harriman
contributed to the Republigan campaign
funds Roosevelt considered him all right,
but that when his aid in this direction
was not forthcoming the !President placed
him—but not until then ~in the list of un-
desirable citizens.

“When Roosevelt,” he went on, “go
sweepingly condemned Haskell for his
alleged connection with the Standard
Oil Company he perhaps forgot that in
1904 his own committee received $100,000
from the Standard Oil Company for the
campaign fund and used it. And when |
Treasurer George B. Cortelyou of the
national committee in that year went
to the Standard Oil Company by ap-
pointment to ask for money for the cam-
paign fund he was not satisfled with
$100,000, but wanted more.

“It may be true that Roosevelt wrote
to Cortelyou. telling him to send that
$100,000 back to the Standard Oi) Com-
pany, but it is equally true that Cor-
telyou did not send it back but used it.
And it is also true that he was never
punished by Roosevelt for not sending
the money back. Cn the contrary, he
was rewarded by being made Postmaster-
Generfil of the United States and after-
ward Secretary of the Treasury.”

POSSIBLY A BRONX PLOT.

The Gronx, or at least that part of it
which sends ita children to Public School

AUSTRIA’S ACT WHOLLY EVIL

DEADLY BLOW TO ALL EURO-
PEAN RELATIONSHIPS.

 

Mystery as to Its True Motive Orentes
Panic tn Political and Financial
Circies—Bulgarian Issue Easily Set-
tled—Kaiser's Revenge Suspected,

Spectal Cables Despatch to Tam Sun.

Lonpon, Oot. 5.—The most evil thing
that has happened in Europe during the
present generation is Austria’s announce-
ment of her intention to violate the prin-
cipal treaty existing between the great
Powers. , ‘ :

Bulgaria's declaration of independence
is a comparatively unimportant
and could have been dealt with in all
probability without disturbing Euro-
pean peace, Austria's action in pro-
posing to annex Bosnia and Herzegovina,
however, is of such a sinister and mys-
terious character that European con~
fidence is shaken as it has not been
since the Turko-Russian war. It strikes
at the foundation of all international
relationship. It is , gratuitously machia-
vellian. It seems on its face to bea
deliberate attempt to render abortive
Turkey/s efforts at regeneration.

A ‘s sovereignty over the two
provinces is complete in everything but
name, When Emperor Francis Joseph
was informed at the close of the Berlin
conference in 1878 that the administra-
tion of Bosnia and Herzegovina had been
assigned to Austria he exclaimed: “Why
didn't they say annex them?” He has
governed them now for thirty years, and
the moment their titular suzerain begins
to set its house in order he violates his
trust and seizes full title to their posses-
sion,

But this is not all, The real question
is what lies behind, and it is this mystery
which has upset the markets to-day and
sent a thrill of alarm through Europe.

It has been repeatedly asserted in the
despatches to Tur Sun during the organ-
ization of King Edward's great league of
peace that Germany would seize the
earliest opportunity for a great stroke of
revenge for what she regarded asa policy
designed for her isolation. Now we are
witnessing her first moves in this direc-
tion. That is the interpretation which
England and France and even Russia
have put upon the extraordinary develop-
ments which startled the world this
morning.

The British Foreign Office frankly
confesses that it had no inkling of what
was brewing untila few hoursago. France
was entirely ignorant until the Austrian
Ambassador called on President Falliéres
on Saturday. King Edward received his
first news in a similar fashion at Bal-
moral to-day. ,

Fortunately the worst feature of last
night’s despatches proves to be un-
founded. It was asserted in Paris that
Ruesia and Italy were privy to the deal
and had been bribed to acquiesce. This
is flatly denied, so far as Russia is con-
cerned, by her Foreign Minister, who is
now in Paris. It appears therefore that
the principal secret object of the German
and Austrian mancuvres, namely, to
break up the new ententes which King
Edward has created, has not yet been
accomplished. On the contrary, there is
reason to believe that Russia, France and
Great Britain will be driven into closer
cooperation than ever.

So long as this triumvirate exists there
is a strong probability of the maintenance
of peace outside the Balkans. Turkey
and Bulgaria may fight a bit, but even
this is doubtful. Turkey will not if she
can keep control of her domestic situation.
It is a crue! string to put upon the new
administration, whose problems were al-
reedy sufficiently serious.

The Constantinople correspondent of
THe Sun telegraphs that if war comes
reaction will set in and the regeneration
of the Ottoman Empire willbe over. On
the other hand the new spirit of patriot-
ism which is especially strong among
the Young Turks themselves makes it
extremely difficult for them to refrain
from resenting the high handed and
illegal action of both Bulgaria and Aus-
tria. English, French and Russian in-
fluence will all be used to the fullest ex-
tent with the Porte to induce Turkey to
hold her hand, and it is expected that
France will take the initiative in sum-
moning a new European conference to
deal with the whole situation,

This will be a dangerous proceeding,
for it is apprehended that Germany may

to seriously complicate conflicting in-
terests. Turkey will have much to fear.
It is hardly probable chat she would re-
gain even her shadowy title to Bulgaria,
Bosnia and Herzegovina, whereas if the
Bulgarian and Austrian claims were
recognized Russia might legitimately
demand the opening of the Dardanelles.
It is too early, however, to speculate
with any oopfidence on future deveiop-
ments. The situation is heavily veiled,
and Germany has not shown her hand.
Berlin is the real centre of disturbance,
and the blandly correct but cynical semi-
official communiques from that capital
to-day excite more suspicion and appre-
hension than all else. H. R. C.

DIETRICH KILLING HIS DEER,

But te Get Them to Market He Has to
Conform to the Law the Same as & Hanter

Povankerpsir, N. Y., Oct. 5.—Under
a special act of the Legislature power ‘is
given to Charles F, Dietrich, a rich
resident of Millbrook, to deplete his
big herd of deer by slaying the animals.
To get them to market in New ‘ ork city |
each carcass must be accompanied by
one person. To comply with the law Mr
Dietrich is organizing free excursions to
New York. Today he killed twenty-five
deer and fifty Millbrook people traveled
to New York with them. All their ex-
pensos were paid by Mr. Dietrich.
Their names were written on express re- |
ceipts covering the shipment.

Several other large consignments of |
deer will be sent to New York by Mr. |
Dietrich before the season ends and the |
same plan will be followed. Only by
shooting may deer be killed when the
flesh is to be eaten, and the gamekeeper
at Dietrich’s park is having more sport
than any man in the country, He is shoot-
ing deer by the soore. The drawback is
that some of them are so tame that they
trot up to the gunner to-be killed.
