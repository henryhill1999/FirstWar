An outline of the terme under which the

el end one-half common

RULING IN SWOKE CASES.

The Law Deesn't Intend to Close Every
Furnace, Says Justice Tierney.

In the Second Mistrict Municipal Court
of the borough of The Bronx, Justice Tier-
ney yesterday dismissed the complaint
of the Board of Health against the Ebling |
Rrewing Company, which was charged |
with violating the amoke section of the
Sanitary Code in its brewery at 154th «treet
and St Ann's avenue. The Justice says

It cannot be supposed that the Leeislature |
intended to require the impossible or to |
close every furnace in our city To give
thie section a reasonable and working appli-
cation the attempt to construe it literally
must be abandoned and something further
looked to

Justice Tierney decides that since the
brewi company had installed a amoke
consuming furnace and constructed a high
chimney to carry off the smoke, it was
enti to a reasonable inter,éetation of
the ordinance
