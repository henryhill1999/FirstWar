The Pian of a Virginia Philosopher.

4 friend in Richmond calls our atten-
tion to a letter printed in the Times of
that town recently as “throwing light
on the conditions under which the negro
must live and struggle toward a higher
civilization"

This letter is from Mr. Jerry Mon-
TAGUR and it is dated from Deep Run
Hunt Club.” Its writer is evidently a
man of much intelligence, and his argu-
ment proves, at least, that he has thought
very earnestly on the subject of which
he treats. But it is not a convincing

TAGVE contends that the new agri

capacity of the negro.” But what signs
are there that thie now essential negro
labor will be displaced by any other or
better? If the negroes were relativels
few, as they are here at the North, his
theory that. naturally. they would be
overwhelmed by competing and
vemptuous white labor might be sus
tained by expenence, but at the South
where, under present conditions. the
white laborers are few and the negroes
many. it would work The imm

As the Hon. OLEY Orb SvuTTON
of Sutton wrote to Mr Cook under date
of June 11, * no man is @ greater factor
in polities than is the man in the editorial
chair.” He might have added that there
is no more engaging figure in the edi-
torial chair anvwhere than Hon
PicHarp MoxtooMery Cook. " You de
serve to be rewarded in Clay county,”
Mr Stuvrron went on, “ for the great
amount of work devoted to the interests

The same idea had occurred to Mr
Cook. and in the number of the Hoot-
Owl which contained Mr SurTon’s letter,
the editor asked for his reward and
showed additional proof of his fitness
therefor He flung to the breeze and

Shangbal Report as te Our Attitude tn
Indemnity Net True.
Wasutnotow, July 80.--A report from
Shanghai that the United States and Great
Britain had abandoned their efforts to get
the Powers to agree to accept payment of
China's indemnity in eflver at the value
of the silver tael prevailing when the in-
demnity protocol became effective is pro-
| nounced on authority to be untrue so far
| as this Government is concerned. Contrary
to the report, the United States are @ ill in-
sisting that the proper interpretation of the
protocol ia that the then tael value should
continue to be recognized for the entire
period of payment. The tael then rated at
742 cents and the protocol provided that
payments should be made in gold with the
tael recognized as being of that value
Owing to the depreciation of the tael,
China will be obliged, if a majority of the
Powers insist on their contention, to pay
a greater rate for the gold with which to
repay her creditors It is estimated that
payment under the rule insisted upon by a
majority of the Powers will compel China
to 0,000,000 more than the amount of
total indemnity fixed in the protocol.

Mr. Wolf ia « Russian subject. Owing to
the fact that the office pays only about
$00 a vear in fees, it has been impossible,
except on one cocasion, to get an American
citizen to take it. The exception was
Angue Campbell of Massachusetts, who
waa appointed last December, but owing
to feeling against him in Warsaw over his
elopement with a young woman of that
place and the failure of the Russian Govern-
ment to grant him an exequatur, his ap-
pointment Was cancelled
