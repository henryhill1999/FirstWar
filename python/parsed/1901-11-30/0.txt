WastineTon, Nov. 29.—Time was when
hyetie, bustle and excitement marked the
canvass for the Speakership nominations
of the two great parties in the House of
tatives, and when the headquart-

Represe
ers of the various’ candidates would be
crowded for days and nights before the

nominating caucuses with statesmen, wire-
pullers, newspaper men, office-seekers and
general strikers, ready to support the proper
ididate for a consideration
In recent years, however, Speakership
caucuses have come to be tame affairs,
the outeome having been decided upon
months in advance, and &o it is that in Wash-
ington to-night there are few, if any, indi-
rations that the opposing teams of the
Fifty-eeventh Congress are lining up for
lav
' No candidate is keeping open house, or
» is he is doing nothing particular to
hake things pleasant for his callers, and
vhody knows now as well as he will

r the caucuses adjourn that David
Henderson of Iowa will be the
candidate and James Daniel
Tennessee the candidate
of the Democrats

Henderson will be nominated by acclama-
tien, and so it is not necessary for him to
make promises as to the organization of
the committees in order to secure votes
and there is not the same chance for fine
political work on the part of the ambitious
member as there was in the good old days
vhen half a dozen of the leading Repub-
leans of the House were wont to be en-
giged in a desperate struggle for the party
nomimnauon

Ou one occasion when Reed, McKinley,
Burrows and one or two more of the party
war horses had pitched their camps early
in the fight and were conducting an active
campaign, a newly elected member from
Massachusetts who had become known to
fame as a manufacturer of stove polish,
wrote to each of the candidates, naming
the committees on which he would like to
serve and indicating that he would vote for
that candidate who would most thoroughly
gratify his desires

But there are no such interesting incidents
of the present ante-caucus situation. It
is prosaic in the extreme. The only bit
of color in it is the self-suggested offer
of a young Democratic member from the
lone Star State, who bas stepped lightly

into the arena and without anagerinng
any of the captains, dares to criticise them
gently and to offer himself as the proper
one to lead his party out of the wilderness
and restore it to the proud place it once

Albert Sydney Burleson of Austin
He is not nearly #0 old as Presidant
velt, having been born in 1863, but has
already served one term in Congress and
thinks he knows just what is the matter
with the Democratic party. He does not
hesitate to tell, either, for he boldly says
that there is no unity of mind or pu
on the part of men calling themselves
Democrats

To show the faith that is in him Mr. Burle-
ton will present the following resolutions

at to-morrow’s caucus, 60 that the country |

hen the Fifty-sixth Congress ended
the Missouri delegation announced that
their candidate, who is really about the
ablest Democrat now in Congress, and
avho has a voice that under some circum-
stances would wake the dead, would con-
test the empty honor with the member
from ‘Tennessee, and endeavor to rattle
the ory bones of the Democratic party
in the House. But fate was against DeAr-
mond and in favor of Richardson, as it
has ever been, and when the caucus meets
to-morrow the Missouri Democrats will
be lifeless, because leaderlesa, and Long
James will again be put forward as the
so called leader of his party in the House
of Representatives in the Fifty-seventh
Congress.

But the party has become so srfall that
it can do little mischief, whoever is its
spokesman, so that the Republicans are

CABINET DISCUSSES FOOTBALL,

President Roosevelt. Favors West Point
in To-day's Game.
| Wasurtnaton, Nov, 20.—The President,
| having completed his message to Congress,
and the members of the Cabinet their annual
reports, Mr. Roosevelt and his official
family were in fine spirits at the Cabinet
meetingto-day. They all enjoyed a holiday
yesterday and are looking forward to
another one to-morrow. Few serious
subjects were talked about at the meeting,
but the coming Annapolis-West Point
football game was discussed with great
earnestness. The President set the ball
rolling, and he did not stop talking about
it when the Cabinet meeting adjourned,
but made numerous comments on the
game to the visitors that he received after
the Secretaries had gone. The secrets of
the Cabinet chamber were violated by one
member, who quoted the President as say-
ing that West Point will surely win.

‘he President said he had decided to
avoid the appearance of favoritismn by
sitting on the Annapolis side of the field

| during the first half and on the West Point
| side arene the last half.

“The only fault with that decision,” said
| Secretary Long, “is that if you want to be
on the winning side at the end of the game
| you ought to occupy the Annapolis box
, during the last half.”

“Well, I don't know about that,” re-
torted Secretary Root, peering up for
the army, “the fact is West Point will
have a walkover. The betting in New
York is 8 to 1 on West Point.”

“Up in New England,” replied Secretary
Long, “we don't believe in making bets,
but I think I can convince the Secretary of
War that the chances of Annapolis are
better than 3 to 1. I am told that there

was a prizefight yesterday and that the
betting was3to1. Yet the men who placed
the lost. Se there is no certainty in

*"The Hresident met some friends in the
big reception room after the Cabinet meet-

Oh, West Point will win,” he “They
have vy on the team. I you Daly
is a wonder.”

The President and Mrs. Roosevelt will
go to Philadelphia in a private car to-mor-
| row to see the game. hey will be accom-
| genes by Secretary and Mrs. Cortelyou,
Yr. and Mrs. Rixey, Commander and Mrs.
Cowles and Col. Bingham. The car will be
attached to the special train which will be oc-
cupied by theSecretary of War,the Secret ary
of the Navy and the members of the Cabinet
and other distinguished guests who have

CRISIS NEAR IN VENEZUELA.

—-

CASTRO STEERING HIS COUNTRY
INTO TROUBLE.
President's Disregard of Foreigners’ Rights
and His Discourtesy Resented by This
Government and Others—Colombia’s
Refusal to Resume Diplomatic Rela-
tions—-Germany May Use Force.

 

WasuiInaton, Nov. 29.—The contemptu-
ous disregard by the present Radical Gov-
ernment of Venezuela of the rights of for-
eigners in that country and its defiant atti-
tude in diplomatic intercourse with other
nations are steadily leading up to a crisis
which, in Ahe opinion of well-informed
persons here, cannot be long delayed.
The United States, Germany and Colombia
have scores to settle with Gen. Castro,
the President of the republic, who gained
his present office by force of arms and is
apparently seeking to reunite all factions
in his country through an appeal to their
patriotism to stand firm against alleged
foreign aggression,

In refusing at this critical period in her
affairs to resume diplomatic relations with
Venezuela, the Government of Colombia
has thrown down the challenge which may
precipitate a conflict that will mean either
Castro's overthrow or his assumption of
greater power than he now holds. Men
here, who have been observing the situa-
tion carefully with a better knowledge of
what is going on than is possessed by the
press and people of the United States
look to a clash at an early day that will mark
the turning point in the fortunes of Castro.

The difficulties between the United
States and Venezuela were practically
coincident with the assumption of the
Presidency by Castro. His attitude to-
ward this Government in the asphalt con-
troversy was regarded by the United States
as defiant and almost insulting. What-
ever may be the merite of Castro's course
in conenang the pitch lake concession
of the New York and Bermudez Company,
he is said to have shown an utter disregard
for international courtesy in his dealings
with the Administration at
and its diplomatic representatives at Carac-
as. ‘The course of the United States in
rescinding the order for gunboats to gape
ceed to the port nearest the pitch lake
region for the understood purpose of pre-
venting the Venezuelan authorities from
dispossessing the New York and Bermudez
Company, was regarded by Castro as an
indication of the fear of this Government
to engage in hostilities with him, and his
position among the Venezuelans was un-
doubtedly strengthened by his defiance
of a great nation.

Although the transfer of the asphalt
controversy to the Venezuelan courts
for adjudication was believed to have
forestalled, any prospect of a clash, the
friction stilk exists and new causes have
arisen to bring about a resumption of the
former uncertain tuation. Castro's
treatment of Francis B. Loomis, the United
States Minister to Veneguela, was deeply
resented by the W Administra-
tion, whose action in . Mr. Loomis,
however, was regarded by as an-
other tribute to the fear of his strength
which he believed he had inmared a que
minds of those controlling American affairs.

That Castro has been encouraging the
efforts to overthrow the present Conserva-
tive Government of Colombia is generally
believed here. Filibusteri ex itions
against Colombia were fitted out in Vene-
zuela and every effort was made, appar-
ently, to bring about a war between the
two countries. It was only by the merest
ebance that hostilities were not precipi-
tated. Colombia's notice to Venezuela
that she will not resume diplomatic re-
lations has been confirmed to the State

Turned Over to Colombian Forces After a
Few Hours.
Spectal Cable Despatch to THER SUN,

Coron, Nov. 29.—The Liberal force
here surrendered this morning to the United
States force under Capt, Perry of the battle-
ship Iowa. This was done in accordance
with the agreement made yesterday at
the conference on the American gunboat
Marietta

Gen, Alban, commander of the Govern-
ment forces, entered the city this after-
noon with 850 men. Capt, Perry handed
the town over to him as the representative
of the Colombian Government. Gen.
Delarosa, the Liberal chief, subsequently
surrendered his sword to Gen, Alban.

The American marines, who were oc-
cupying the cuartel, were then withdrawn,
with the exception of a detachment, which
remains to guard the property of the Pana-
ma Railroad Company. The Iowa's men
have returned to Panama.

It is estimated that the losses on both
sides in the various fights were 400 men
killed and wounded.

French troops now occupy Christophe
Colon.

ANTWERP, Nov, 20.—The steamer Ban
Righ, which arrived here yesterday with a
quantity of arms and ammunition on board,
sailed to-day, ostensibly for Colon. The

CLUB MAY DROP HALL CAINE,

Objection to His Speech at a Roman
Catholic Bazaar.
Special Cable Despatch to Tuk Sun.

London, Nov. 380.--According. to the
Daily Mail the National Club of London,
one of whose rules obliges its members
to support and promote Protestantism
as embodied in the articles of the Church
of England, has fallen foul of Hall Caine,
the novelist and member of the House of
Keys of the Tale of Man, who is a member
of the club, for opening a Roman Catholic
bazaar on the Isle of Man and making a
speech in which he spoke approvingly of
the Roman Catholic Church and referred
to the Pope as his Holiness and Holy Father,

The commitiee of the club was sum-
moned to consider the matter, and a reao-
lution was passed denouncing Mr. Caine's
conduct and demanding an explanation
from him. If the explanation is unsatis-
factory the rules prescribe resignation
or expulsion

OVERTURES FOR HARMONY ARE
REJECTED WITH SCORN.

The Greater New York Democracy Meets
and Takes Steps to Make Its Organ-
{vation More Compact and Effective
—Outlines Its Plans for the Future.

The Greater New York Democracy
through its Executive Committee served
notice last evening on Richard Croker
that his plea for harmony would not be
listened to by it and began the work of
making its organization more compact
and better able to handle the political
matters that it will have to deal with in
the next year. Among those at the meet-
ing were Sheriff-clect William J. O'Brien
and Register-elect J. H. J. Ronner. Chair-
man William Hepburn Russell,who presided,
said that there were present delegates
from the organizations in the counties
of Queens and Richmond, and that at the
next meeting of the committee there would
be delegates present from the borough
of Brooklyn, duly elected and accredited.

Matthew J. Breen of The Bronx, one
of the organizers of the pariy, offered
a resolution congratylating the voters
of the city on the outcome of the election
and telling Mr. Croker that no harmony
that included him would be tolerable to
the Democrats who voted against his ticket
this year. In the resolutions were these
passages: ;

The_ Executive Committee of the Greater
New York Democracy in tendering its con-
gratulationa to the citizens of New York on
the overthrow of the corrupt and licentious
administration which robbed and degraded
this metropolis Spring the last four years,
feels called upon briefly to recite the events
that led to the arousing of the public senti-
ment that found expression at the polls on
the Sth of November

The Executive Committee, while cognizant
of the fact that @ just analysis of the vote
fairly showa that 56,000 Democrats in the
borsaghe of Manhattan and The Bronx gave
their support to the fusion ticket, declines
on the one hand ‘ie be drawn into any discus-
sion as to the real voting strength of any one
of the three allies represented by party em-
blems at the recent election and on the other
to give answer é the appeal for so-called
harmony of the discredited boas of a debased
and repudiated faction of Democracy, for
the reason that in the opinion of this commit-
tee the paramount duty of the hour Is to ren-
der all possible aid to the adininistration
about to assume the reins of government,
and to take such steps as may be necessary
for the reorganization of the Democratic
party of the city of New York

The resolutions were adopted enthusi-
astically and it was the sentiinent of the
members of the committee that all hands
ought to go out and begin the hunt for
delegates to the next State convention,
s that they will be able te, prevent the
Crokerites from sending a solid delegation
from this county to the convention as they
have for the last few years.

After adopting this resolution the com-
mittee began the discussion of the various
plans for reorganization that have been
submitted to during the last month,
A resolution offered by John C. Sheehan

was finally adopted in which the plan was
provided which will be followed, It _pro-
vides that there shall an Assembly
district in the
city to the only qualifications
necessary shall be that a man is a Demo-
crat. There are to be county committees

in each of the four counties of the city, each
to consist of one delegate for every twent y-
five votes cast for the Dermocratic candi-
date for Governor at the last preceding gen-
eral election, and as many others as the
members of the committee may elect
Each County Committee is to have a Presi-
dent, two Vice-Presidents, a District Vice-
President for each Assembly district, Cor-
responding, Recording and Reading Se: re-
taries, a Treasurer and a Sergeant-al-Arms.
Kach district will have an organization,
with permanent headquarters, and cach
organigation will elect an executive com-
mitteeman, which will make up the General
Executive Committee

In addition to these committees there ie
to be an Advisory Committee of Seven to be
selected by the city General Cotntnittee,
the members of which shall be ex-officio
roembers of the Lxecutive Committee, and
in the vacations of the Lxecutive Committee

emooracy shall be strictly in accordance
vith the Btate and national peliey of the
Dremooratie party in State and Hational aflalre
but shall be NOh-partion® 16 local aff

PULLMAN'S WIDOW WILL FIGHT.

Gives Notice to His Mother That She Must
Be Recognized.

San Francisco, Noy, 29.-A scandalous
fight over the body of young George M.
Pullman was narrowly averted to-day
After young Pullman's doath his mother,
who is in Chicago, sent orders to her agent
here to ship the body to her
to recognize the widow in any way.
these orders were mentioned to Sanger Pull-
man he seemed to regard them as harsh
The widow refused to relinquish her rights
over her dead husband's body and declared
that unless his mother recognived her she
wouldn't permit the body to go East.
position was strengthened by the fact that
just before his death George made a will
leaving hie wife the bulk of his estate

Mrs. Pullman never forgave Mrs. Braze!l
for marrying George. She had paid a large
sum to set her son free from Lynn Fernald,
yet two days after the divorce he marricd
this California woman, who is ten years
older than he was. Her anger was great
and she declared that neither the wife nor
any of her relatives should ever be received
in her house or recognized by her in any
way. It is believed that she will use every
endeavor to prevent the widow from se-
curing any share of the estate and a lively
will contest is expected.

River Bridge.

granted to the John A. Roebling Com-
pany yesterday an extension of six months
beyond the time stipulated in the contract

PRICE TWO CENTS.

STRIKE CLO‘S BIG MILLS.

SWITCHVMEN FORCE 13,000 MEN
INTO IDLENESS,
Congestion of Freight on River Division
of Pennsylvania Road Cuts OF Miliv
Material-—-Company Says It Has Plenty
of Switchmen, but They Are Green

 

Pittssuna, Nov. 20.—On account of the
ngestion of freight in the yards of the
river division of the’ Pennsylvania Rail-
road all the mills whose terminals are fed
from that railroad were closed down to-
night for lack of material to run them
Thirteen thousand men are thus throwr
into idleness. The plants are the Crescent
Steel Works, Clark's, Pittsburg Bridge
works, Carnegie Company's upper anc
lower union mills, Park Steel Works, the
American Steel and Wire Company's mills
at Fourteenth and Twenty-sixth streets,
the MeConway-Torley Company's foundry
Zug & Co.'s mill and the Marshall foundry

Although the railroad authorities assert
that they have full complements of switeh-
ing crews in place of the strikers, the trouble
a) that the new men are still unfamiliar
with the yards. There is also a trouble-
wine congestion in the Glenwood and
Port Perry yards of the Baltimore ana
Ohio and in the vards of the Junction and
the Pittsburg and Western roada, both
owned by the Baltimore and Ohio. Off.
cials of the other roads say that work ts

| moving smoothly.

McKeesport, Pa., Nov. 29. Although the
order to the ra lway switchmen in MceKees-
port to strike has been out for more than
twenty-four hours it has not been obeyed.
A few of the men on the Baltimore and
Ohio have struck, but the results are not
serious,

 

GORMAN FOR PRESIDENT.

 

Senator Balley Thinks Him the Most Avail
able Democratic Candidate.

“I believe Arthur P. Gorman of Mary-
land the most available can:lidate for the
Presidential nomination in 1904,” remarked
Senator Joseph Bailey of Texas at the
Waldorf-Astoria last night.

“That was my opinion several weeks
ago,” he continued, “and because of the
result of the election in Maryland [I am
more convinced than ever that my con-
clusions are correct.”

Asked whether he believed there would
be any revision of the tariff ae the next
session in Congress, Senator Bailey re-
plied in the negative, saving that the Re-
pacers were satisfied with the present
aw and that it could not be changed with-
out their consent,

With regard to a Ship Subsidy bill, he
expressed a belief that a measure alon
the lines of the Senator Hanna idea woul
be enacted at the coming session

With regard to Cuba, he said it was his
impression that if the Republican party
was continued in power the island would
be acquired by the United States Govern-

ment.

aor Bailey left for Washington last
night.

cx-Senator Gorman arrived at the Fifth
Avenue Hote! last night. He was told
that Senator Bailey was booming him for
the Democratic nomination for President

in 1004. “It's a good way off, isn't it?”
was all that Mr. Gorman would say in re-
ply.
