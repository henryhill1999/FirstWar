ENGLISH OPINION DIVIDED

There is a sharp division in English

the Marquis of Salisburv's Government |
tacitly acknowledged and approved the
Monroe Doctrine, and the best political
opinion of the country indorses that atti-
tude from the viewpoint of self-interest
as well as diplomatic friendship. Thus
to-day's Spectator says

“We are, next to the United States, the
greatest American power, and like
the States, have no desire to see the status
quo violently altered by the efforts of con-
tinental European States to carver out
for themselves colonial empires in Central

English Seaman Describes His Experience
and Says He Doesn't Like It.
Special Cable Despatch to Tar SUN

LONDON, Aug. 30.-A seaman who took
part in the recent trial of Submarine Boat

2 in Stokes Bay gives an interesting de-

scription of his experiences

He says the sensation when the boat
is diving is very singular. The increased
pressure on the hull caused br the sub-
mersion can be distinctly felt. He attrib-
utes this to the deadening of vibration
through submersion. There is plenty of

light from the electric lamp. A

greenish haze slants in through the glass

scuttles of the conning tower. Ata depth
of two fathoms one can tell by peering
through one of these whether the weather
is cloudy or the sun is shining on the water

The first sense is one of numbness, but

he is inclined to believe that this is more

fanciful than real, and is cauesd by a feol-
ing of helplessnoss. There is no percepti-
ble vibration to the boat even when
hull is submerged at a speed of seven knors
except for a slight tremor caused by the
working of the garolene engine The
sense of silence is profound

The longest time they were under water
was three hours and twenty-seven minutes

Towards the finish he felt slightly Nase -

Lonvon, Aug. 30.—The chimney sweeps
of London have announced their intention
to meet at Trafalgar Square Sunday week,
to protest to the London County Council
against the law prohibiting them fr m crve

the mourntul wail of the London chimney
sweep frequently arouses a whole street of
sleepers at unearthly hours of the morning
Even when the sweep is ordered to keep
quiet at a certain time he often violate-
this instruction, and not only rings Lis
bell, but wails like a lost until
sleepy housemaid is aroused

Long suffering Londoners invoked the
awi of the County Council and argued that
it is not reasonable that so many should

DECLINE IN) BRITISH WAGES

Kevives the Gloomy Predictions as to Trade

Disasters,
Special Cable Despatcn to THE SUN
LONDON, Aug. 30.--The Government re-

port in regard to the prevailing rates of

wages in 1901 has caused a revival of the
gloomy apprehension of British trade
disasters. The decline is regarded as the
first serious one that has occurred since
1895. The decrease in the weekly wages
last year amounted to $7,500,000 This
loss was principally in mining, quarry-

ing and the metal, engineering and ship-
building trades

It is said to be going on in the present

vear aiso, and there is an increase in the
number of unemployed workmen, This
situation will almost certainly become

worse by reason of the return of a large
nfimber of volunteers from South Africa

Sir Christopher Furness, the shipbuilder
who is himself a free trader, in a speech
yesterday expressed the opinion tuat the
tendency of England was toward pro-
tection, while he would not be surprised
to see America adopt free trade

50.000 Persons gt Sheepshead Bay.

Six weeks ago John A. Drake, the Chie
cago millionaire turfman, announced pubs
, licly that he had the winner of the Fue
tunty in his stabl He meant his
bay colt Savable, by the famous Salk
vator, out oof Strathflower, who was
purchased by him from Pat Dunne, the
Western borseman, recently for $30,000,
Dunne having purchased the colt aa @
yearling at the Haggin sale for $550, At
'the time Eastern horsemen were inclined

| to ridicule Mr. Drake's confident prediction,

}and when Savable recently ran a very
poor race at Seratoga the impression be-
|} came general that the youngster would
not do. But yesterday down at Sheeps-

head Bay, in the presence of an immense
crowd of 50,000 spectatora, Savable made
good his owner's forecast by winning on
the post in the last jump by six inches from
August Belmont's Lord of the Vale, by
Hastings Lady Violet. That Mr. Drake
still retained confidence in Savable was
shown by the fact that his commissioners
were busy placing heavy wagers with so
much industry that the colt's price was
beaten down from 20 to 1 to eights. Just
how much Mr. Drake won in bets could
not be told, but a fair estimate placed his
| winnings at $150,000. He and his friend,
John W Gates, fairly burnt up the ring,
their joint winnings footing up close
to $00,000, it is said. When Savable re
turned to the paddock and dockey Lucien
Lyne had been raised aloft into the historio
floral horseshoe Mr. Drake said to the
numerous persons who crowded around
him to offer their congratulations:

“I knew | had the Futurity winner all
along. Il may have been laughed at, but
Savable got the money.”

Two lengths behind Lord of the Vale
came James R. Keene's magnificent filly
Dazzling by St. Leonards--Splendour, who
under Shaw's whip beat Julius Fleische
mann's Hurstbourne by Indio—Flora Hurst
by ashort head. A length away was Deimet
& Dwyer's Africander, while ,Whitney
& Duryea'’s Irish Lad, by Candlemas--
Arrow Grass, carrying top weight, 130
pounds, finished sixth. Close behind were
William C, Whitney's Payne, C. R. Ellison’s
skilful, J. P. Kramer's Golden Maxim and
S.S. Brown's Blue Ribbon, while far back
in the dusty ruck were August Belmont’s
highly tried Hastings colt Mizzen, the
Messrs, Keene’s crack performer, White-
chapel; Whitney & Duryea's much-touted
Acefull and the other Keene starters, Duster
and Flying Prince. Twenty-four horses ran
and they were sent away to a magnificent
start forall except Mr. Belmont’s Fire Eater,
who broke with the others and then propped
himself. John EB. Madden's Mirthful filly,
Merry Ree!, was crowded at the outer rail
a few yards after leaving the barrier and
lost all chances for victory then and there,

Coming down the bend in the track ‘It
was anybody's race, the big field being
stretched across from rail to raillike a troop
of cavalry. ‘Then in the last flerce etrug-
gie down the stretch, where the great crowd
stood watching every movement of the gal-
lant two-year-olds, the race was narrowed
down to four contenders, Lord of the Vale,
Hurstbourne, Savable and Dazzling. As
these youngsters drew away followed by
Irish Lad and Africander, the others, beaten
decisively, began to stop and etraggled in
in a long-drawn-out procession, The win-
ner's time was comparatively slow, consid-
ering the condition of the track, the figure
being 1:14 for the six furlongs,

The result was a severe financial blow to
the public, for the Messrs, Keene's repree
sentatives, Flying Prince, Duster, Dazzling
and Whitechapel, were coupled favorites
at threes, with Whitney & Duryea’s Irish
Lad and Acefull coupled second choices ag
7to 2. The race waa so open in character
that the layers felt safe in taking all
the money in sight upon the publio
choices The Futurity was worth $45.
400 to the winner, an additional nest
egg for Mr. Drake's pocketbook; $5,250 to
the second horse and $2,750 to the third
horse. J. B. Haggin, who nominated the
winner, received $2,000; Mr, Belmont, who
nominated Lord of the Vale, got $1,260, and
Mr. Keene, who nominated Dazzling, got
$500 extra,

The race was truly run, being free from
any unpleasant features such as marred
the running of the Saratoga Special, and
demonstrated the fact that the breeding
industry in this country has grown in mare
vellous fashion Savable was prepared tor
