to September, 1912, and that the duties
of the office were twofold—audits and
investigation,

In his two and a half years as Com-
missioner he said he had investigated
perhaps a dozen matters in the Police

sometimes for the Police Commissioner

He had made several investigations. for
the Mayor in 1910, largely of clubbing
cases,

Ile was continually getting com-

rect and others from the Mayor. Many
of these were aguinst questionable re-
sorts. An investigation waa made in
each case and Mr. Fosdick took steps
in every established case to remove the
place,

Mr. Buckner asked him how he, as
Commissioner of Accounts, had har-
died a questionable resort case.

“If we found the complaint had any
ground whatever,” the witness replied,
“we took it up with the Police Commis-
sioner or with the captain of the pre
cInet. In the last year we went to the
captains almost entirely. , They always
shut the places up when we com-
plained. {

“Karly in 1912," Mr. fosdick con-
tinued, “we began to get a large number
of complaints through the mail about
two members of the Police Department.
One was in charge of a squad and was
alleged to be holding up gambling house
keepers. We found the complaints hard
to run down,

“Finally 1 took the matter up with
Commissioner Waldo. This was in Jan-

uary of this year. I told him T had
heen getting many complaints about
Lieut. Becker, and asked him if he was

sure of Becker. 1 told him I had ne
facts—only complaints,

“Mr. Waldo said he wasn't sure of
anybody at Headquarters; that he found
it safer to work on the theory that all
would take it if they could get it; but
that under the system he had devised
it was impossible for anybody to get
away with it.” :

The witness said that as Commis-
sioner Waldo described his system to
him one man was watching a second
and the second was watching somebody
else, each being euger to “get” some-
thing on the other

“| told him IT thought it impossible
to devise any system,” Mr, Fosdick
went on, “that human ingenulty
couldn't beat,” .

Between what his inspectors told tin
and the anonymous letters Mr, Tos-
dick grew “a little uneasy” and went to
Waldo again, Then he detailed two in-
spectors to work in Brooklyn and two
in Manhattan,

“I told them T was not interested in
the fact that gambling existed, but
merely in the connection of the police
with it. The two men in Brooklyn gave
up after two weeks work. After six
weeks thestwo in Manhattun told me
they had been spotted. by Inspector
