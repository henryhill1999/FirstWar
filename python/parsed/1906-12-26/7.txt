WILL ORGANIZE NEW BANK.

David R. Forgan to Have an Institation
of His Own in Chicago.

Carcaco, Deo. 24.—It was announced
late to-night that David R. Forgan had
resigned as vice-president of the First
National Bank and that he would organize
a national bank of his own within a short
time.

Mr. Forgan’s resignation takes effect
January 2.

It was not made clear just why Mr. Forgan
was qovertes his connection with the bank
of which his brother, James B. Forgan,
was president. As James B. For oon-
trols the First National, so will vid R.
control the new institution. It will be
capitalized at $1,500,000.

“Associated with me,” said Mr. Forgan,
“will be some of the best known Chicago
business men.

“Since the amalgamation of so many of
Chicago’s banks, and particularly since the
failure of John R. Walsh's banks, there has
been a demand for another strong national
bank. Chicago's commerce is big and grows
bigger every month. The volume of trade
is double that of ten years ago, and yet
there are fewer banks then.
