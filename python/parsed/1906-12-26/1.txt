Spectal Cable Despatches to THE SUN.

BeLarapr, Dee. 25.—The bill authorizing
a loan, which the Skupstehina passed a few
days ago, has led to angry public feeling,
not only threatens a ministerial
crisis, ulway# a more or less explosive oc-
currence in Servia, but points also |to the
consummation of the long predicted ahti-
dynastic outbreak.

There was a noisy

police charged with swords and the gen-
darmes used their revolvers, wounding @
student.

The crowd acattered, but gathered again
and went to the university, where a student
made a fiery speech. He declared that in
King Alexander's time the police were not
allowed to attack students. He added that
the struggle would continue

There was another noisy demonstration
outs'de the Skupstchina on Monday. The
Goverainent has now conceded the appoint -
ment of a commission to investigate the
loan question, but the popular unrest con-
tinues .

LONDON, Dec. 26.--Mail advices received
by the S/andard from Belgrade explain
why nothing concerning the loan debates
in the Skupstehina reached the outside
world. It had become known that Deputy
Katics, a Socialist, intended to attack the
King in connection with the loan. The pal-
ace thereupon appealed to Premier Pasics
to muzzie the orator

M. Pasics, knowing that he could not
prevent M. Katics from speaking in Parlia-
ment, summoned the Socialist leader and
arranged foran immediate strike of thecity's
printers and compositors, to last until the
bill was passed. Two
was handed over to compensate the news-
papers and the men for their losses

M. Katics made his threatened attack,
declaring, among other things, that the
only part of the loan which would remain

he in King Peter's pocket. This did not
go beyond the House, as the strike was
e@omplete, not even the official publications
appearing.

The loan bill was forced through by a
narrow majority and now awaits the King’s
approval. Much depends on his action.
If he refuses to sanction the measure and
dissolves the Skupetchina he will make a
dangerous enemy of Premier Pasics, who
will immediately raise in Parliament the
question of the fitness of the Crown Prince
to succeed to the throne. He would thus
let loose the anti-dynastic forces with un-
forseeable consequences.

SPANISH COURT REJOICES.

Gorgeous Christmas Ceremony in Honor
of Prospect of an Hetr to the Throne.
Special Cable Despatch to TuR® SUN

Maprip, Dec. 25.—The court assembled
this morning to carry out one of the most
sumptuous functions held in fifty years.
As Christmas coincided with the official
announcement of the Queen’s pregnancy,
King Alfonso resolved to celebrate the
occasion by ordering a “Capilla publica.”

The double significance of the occasion
was stated on the invitation cards. The
@eremony was splendid, even for the Spanish
court. The galleries of the royal palace
were filled at 11 o'clock by an enormous
throng of grandees, nobility and aristo-
crats, for whom the court officials found
places with difficulty.

The main feature of the function was
a procession of the royal family to the
Christmas mass in the palace chapel. King
Alfonso wore the uniform of a captain-
general and many glittering orders. He
walked by the side of the Queen at the
head of the procession. The Queen was
robed in white silk, over which was a helio-
trope mantle, embroidered with symbolical
lions, castles and fleurs de lys.

The Queen-mother, Christina, and other
royalties followed. Then came a long
train of exalted personages in resplendent
uniforms, gold lace and orders.

The Bishop of Sion celebrated mass,
their Majesties sitting on thrones under
a canopy of red velvet embroidered with
gold. A te deum followed the mass, after
which tls royal procession re-formed and
returned. The King and Queen feceived an
immense ovation. Afterward they lunched
privately. The Queen spent the afternoon
decorating a Christ mas tree for her nieces
and nephews.

Stanchron, according to the neighbors, has
been a source of discord in the Hickmuller |

on several occasions threatened to throw
him out of the house, but his wife declared
that he should stay and invariably had her

BACK FROM VISIT TO TIBET.

Vather MeGiliicuddy of Worcester Tourcd
Country With English Officers.
WorcEsTerR, Maxs., Dec. 25.—The Key.
Daniel F. McGillicuddy, pastor of St, |
Stephen's Catholic Church, has just returned |
from a tour of the world, which included a

 

 

fourteen day journey into Tibet.

The trip was made with three English |
officers, Sir Donald McDonal, Capt. Stockty, |
his aide, and Capt. Hill, who were making |
a tour of the country to collect the Tibetan |
tribute to the English. Father McGilli- |
cuddy was allowed to travel with the offi- |
cers as far as Gyantse, one of the garrisons |
in Tibet visited by the English officers.

The priest says there were persons at the
Sikkim border who have been there for
years waiting an opportunity to reach the
interior. One woman, a Scot, has lived in
Sikkim for eleven years, hoping to get the
permission of the English to enter the
country. The natives offered no bar to the
ogee of the party.

“We found the natives practically cowed,”
said Father McGillicuddy. “They stand
between the devil and the deep sea. On
one side is a fear of the Chinese and on the
other a greater fear of the English. The }
result is that a white man may go through
without molestation.”

NEGRO BOY HIT BY AIS TOURING
CAR IN WASHINGTON.

 

Witnesses Disagree as to Whether or Not
the Chaeffeur Was at Fault—He’'s Ar-
rested—Mrs. L. 9. Leiter and Two
Guests In the Car with the Owner.

Wasuinotron, Dec. %.--A large touring
automobile, the property of Joseph Leiter,
ran over and instantly killed Samuel West,
colored, 14 years old, at the corner of Four-
teenth street and Columbia road, North-
west, at 11:15 o’clock this morning. Repre-
sentative Joseph V. Graff of Illinois and his
son, a student at Dartmouth College, had a
narrow escape from being run down at the
same time, according to Mr. Graff's story.

Joseph Leiter and his mother, Mrs. L. Z.
Leiter, and Mr. and Mrs. Franklin Reming-
ton of New York, guests of the Leiters,
were passengers in the car, which was
driven by Charles H. Raymond, a chauffeur
who has been in the employ of Joseph
Leiter a few days only. The Leiters said
that he had taken the place of a chauffeur
— was discharged for speeding the ma-
chine.

Eyewitnesses of the accident said that
West alighted from a street car at the cross-
ing and started to run across the street to a
store where he was employed. Immedi-
ately behind came Representative Graff
and his son, who left the street car at the
same time that young West did. The auto-
mobile struck the boy and the wheels pasans
over his head, crushing the skull. e was
meneaty killed. Representative Graff
warned his son of the car's approach, and
according to Mr. Graff, the son got out o!
the way just in time to escape being run
down.

The Leiter automobile was stopped
immediately anda policeman who witnessed
the accident arrested the chauffeur and de-
tained J h Leiter and Mrs. L. Z. Leiter
long enough to take their personal bonds
for their Sppensnnee as witnesses at the
inquest, which will be held to-morrow.
Mr. and Mrs. Remington were not required

Mrs. Leiter and Mrs. Remington were
unnerved by the accident. Mrs. Leiter
left word that she be notified as soon as the
family of the West boy was located. She
expressed great sympathy and regret over
the accident.

Witnesses of the accident do not agree

— of responsibility attachin,
to the chauffeur. Some of them declare
just after the tragedy that the chauffeur
was guilty of gross carelessness. The
chauffeur and some other witnesses said
that the motor car was not going above the
rate of eight miles an hour at the time West
was struck.

Raymond was released late to-night on a
$5,000 bail bond furnished by Joseph Leiter.

Mrs. Leiter said to-night that the acci-
dent was unavoidable. Raymond, the
ohauffeur, she declared, was a careful man
who had driven four years for the late
Gardiner Hubbard, president ofthe National
ee Society, and had been engaged
by the Leiters a few days ago because he
was recommended as an unusually careful
man. Mrs. Leiter said that he took the
place of a man discharged because he had
violated the s i ordinance.

The automobile, according to Mrs. Leiter,
was not going more than six or eight miles
an hour, and the chauffeur was sounding
his born at the time the boy was struck. |
She said she saw the boy carelessly run |

| directly in front of the automobile.

'

|

Mrs. Leiter's opinion as to the speed of |
the machine is borne out by the statement |
of a policeman and other eyewitnesses that |
|

| the machine was brought to a standstill

within ten feet of where the boy was struck.

Franklin Remington, who with Mrs.
Remington is spending the holidays with
the Leiters, is a nephew of Mra. Leiter.

 

HANSOM GOES INTO

| Robert H. Simpson, Inside, Has His Nose

Broken—Place Unguarded.

An excavation on the east side of Broad-
way, which is entirely unguarded and
which has been a menace at Broadway
and Sixty-second street for a couple of
months, caused Robert H. Simpson, a
broker living at the Hotel Lorraine, to |
spend the better part of Christmas in the
Roosevelt Hospital. Through the accident,

Shortly before start ng out for dinner

call for the hansom and waa speeding up
Broadway when the accident occurred.

It requires some careful driving to take a
vehicle safely between the holes, which are |
seperated only by the width of the car |
track and are invisible except on close ap-
proach. Just as the hansom was between
the holes vesterday one of the front tires
struck a piece of planking, causing the
vehicle to topple over on its side into the
hole to the west of the track.

When Policeman Keegan of the West
Sixty-eighth street station got to the scene |
of the accident the cab was several feet
below street level, with William J. Daly,
the chauffeur, under the cab. It took
Keegan some time to extricate Daly and |
Simpson, both of whom were badly done
up

Tne Auchincloss took both men in the am-
bulance to the hospital, where Daly had his
wounds dressed before going to his home
at 129 East 10ist street. Besides having
his nose broken Mr. Simpson was badly cut

CONSCIENCE MADE HIM TELL.

Thieving Watchman Owns Up and Sneers
at Two Detectives on the Job.

For several weeks So] Newmark, a dealer
in underclothing at 472 Broadway, has been
missing bis stock. He communicated with
Police Headquarters and Detective Ser-
geants Dowling and Oppenheim were put
on the job. They worked and watched, but
the goods continued to disappear. On
Monday Joe Levy, who is 23 years old and
lives at 200 East Twenty-seventh street, a
watchman in the place, asked if he could
see the boss.

“These cops are dead ones, boss,” he said.
“If you wait until they get wise to what’s
goin’ on the thieves'll have the whole outfit.
I know who's swipin’ the stuff!”
“Who? Tell me quick!” replied New-
mark eagerly.
“Me! I'm the man,” replied Levy.
“This is Christmas time, not April Fool's
day,” said Newmark. “Don’t josh me,
oe; I'm too busy for nonsense!
“I’m on the level, boss. It's me. I ain't
treated you right. Me and a pal has been
doin’, it anc as I know you'll get us or some-

 

body else will sooner or later and my con-
science bothers me, I'm ready to give up.”
Newmark called in the two detectives and
turned Levy over to them. He told how
every morning at 5 o’clock he let in his
friend, Alexander Goldberg, who is about
his age, and with whom lived. They
carried out as much as they could and it
was taken to their flat, where a woman who
said she was Sophia Green and who was
supposed to be oa wife presided.
From that place it was disposed of

The detectives went with Levy to his
rooms and found the woman and Goldberg
sorting over the stock, of which some $500
worth was spread about. They arrested
the pair.

“We got away with as much more,” Levy
said. “What did we do with the money?
Oh, prices are high! it takes a good deal to
keep three respectable persons,” he re-
plied. °
They were held for trial in $1,500 each.

DEATH OF CHARLES H. JEWETT.

His Brother, Orville, in 3879 Threw a
Bomb Which Killed Their Uncie.
The death of Charles H. Jewett, a re-
tired white lead merchant, at his home
in Englewood; N. J., yesterday, recalla
a tragedy which shocked the city in 1877.
On April 9 of that year Orville D. Jewett,
his brother, threw a hand grenade in the

 

office of the white lead firm of John Jewett |

& Sons, of which both were members, at
Burling slip and Front street

The grenade killed his uncle, George W.
Jewett, the senior partner of the firm ,and
seriously wounded Joseph W. Dean, who
was negotiating to buy Orville’s interest
rm. He then turned a revolver on
himself and fired four shots into his body,
which later caused his death.

His brother Charles, who died yesterday,
had been present during the negotiations,
but hid left a few minutes before the ex-
plosive was thrown, on a_ mission for his
uncle, the man who was killed. The inves-

tigation of the affair later showed that the |

members of the firm were dissatisfied with
Orville Jewett's conduct of his part of the
business and had insisted that he sell out
his interest .

It was said he was of an irascible disposi-
tion, and that he was temporarily inaane
through anger when he procured the bomb
and eon it.

Charles H. Jewett was born in Brooklyn
and was 77 years old. The white lead firm
of which he was a member until it was
absorbed by the white, lead trust
vears ago was started by his father, dobn
Jeweit, about 1830

He was a member of the Down Town
As 0 dation, the Caliimet Club and the New
York Zoological Society. His wife, three
sons, Edward H., Charles H., Jr., and George
W. Jewett, all brokers of this city, and one
daughter, Mrs. H. W. Blake of Englewood,
survive him.

COURT

Trial of Labor Leaders Shea and Associates
Not Interrupted.

Cutcago, Dec. 25.—For the first time in
many years the criminal court branch
of the Chicago Judiciary was-in seasion on
Christmas Day, when the trial of Cornelius
F. Shea and his associates, charged with
conspiracy, was resumed before Judge
Boll.

Shea and his associates won two im-
portant decisions affecting the line of testi-
mony to be permitted for defence. The
substance of the points decided by Judge
Ball follows:

That the defence may introduce testi-
mony antedating the official calling of the
strike to show that a controversy existed
between Montgomery, Ward & Co., und the
Garment Workers’ Union; that the defence
may offer testimony to show that repeated
efforts to secure arbitration were made by
the Chicago Federation of Labor, to dispute
the evidence that Shea and four associates
called the strike after accepting a $1,500
bribe for so doing.

Jerome to Resume His Insurance Investl-
gation Today, but Most of the Evi-
dence Will Be Decumentary —Forgery
in the Third Degree the Charge.

The Grand Jury investigation of the
management of the New York Life Insur-
ance Company will be continued to-day
when District Attorney Jerome returns
from Lakeville, Conn. it is expected
that about one more session will be needed
to finish up the particular phase of the
New York Life management which the
Grand Jury has been inquiring into—stock
deals with other companies. if any in-
dictments are found they wil! be filed with
Recorder Goff either to-morrow or Friday.
The indictments, if any, wil! be for forgery
in the third degree.

There is one interesting feature of the
present investigation, which doesn’t wind
up the full investigation of the company.
It is known that unless indictments are
filed by this Grand Jury no other Grand
Jury will ever have an opportunity, as the
statute of Hmitations covering the par-
| ticular class of transactions will have ex-
pired. It is said that these transactions
either had their inception before 1901 or
were completed that year, and the statute |
of limitations is five years.

It is said that Mr. Jerome has called
practically all the witnesses of importance.
All that is needed to do now is to present

formal proof in the shape of documents
the methods used in

and books to show
certain transactions

The investigation has been a_ very
thorough one 4 number of witnesses
have been examined, including George

W. Perkins, who was vice-president of the |
company; Edmund T). Randolph, treasurer;
F. H. Shipman, assistant auditor; M. M
Mattison, a bookkeeper in the treasurer's
department; Alexander Webb, dJr., who
was secretary of the New York Security
and Trust Company, a subsidiary of the
|New York Life; Woodbury Langdon and |
|G. A. Morrison, both of whom were mem- |
bers of the finance committee
|

|
From the offices that these men held |
in the sompaty it is pretty plain that the |
investigation has covered all lines, All |
the evidence has been along the line of |
tending to prove falsification of books |
in order to conceal the true import of cer- |
'
'
!
'
!

tain transactions. In order to have in-
dictments against men high in the affairs
of the company it will be necessary to
prove that they had knowledge of the en-
tries that were made and gave orders con-
cerning thenf. |

“No, your honor, that’s only a Tammany
Indian,” suggested Clerk Dyer, who had

unaware whether his Indian was a Sioux,
a Cherokee or a Thompson Seton Indian,
was made to depose that he knew “enough |
of the races of human kind to determine |
with unerring accuracy that Harry White- |
blanket is of the Indian race.”

Big Buck Whiteblanket, a husky member
of the Thirty-fourth street tribe of the |

MURDER WITH SUICIDE,

 

Yogiclesky’s Wife Left Him a Week After
Marriage—He Brooded Over It and
Invaded Her Reoms—Killed@ Her When
She Again Refused to Live With Him.

Mrs. Marie Yogielesky, a dressmaker,
who had used her maiden name of Will since
she quarrelled with her husband, Otto, an
electrician, after she had lived with him
only a week, was shot and killed by him
in her apartments on the fourth floor of the
tenement house at 419 East Sixty-fourth
street last night. The man then turned
the revolver on himself and sent a bullet
into his mouth. He died soon after an
ambulance surgeon got to him.

Mrs. Yogielesky, or Will, as all her neigh-
bors knew her, was a native of Berlin, as
was her husband, whom she met last spring.
The two were married by an Alderman at
the City Hall last June. They lived together
for a week in East Sixty-ninth street, and
the woman then left him, telling her friends
that she had acquired such a dislike for him
that she couldn’t bear to have him,around
her. Her husband called on her frequently,
begging her to come back to him.

A month ago Mrs. Yogielesky moved into
one of the model tenements in the Sixty-
fourth street block between Firat avenue
and Avenue A. With her was Eliza Horsch-
ler, 25 years old, who acted as housekeeper
while Mrs. Yogielesky was out working.
The two women invited the latter's sister,
Annie, a servant for an uptown family, to
attend a little Christmas party in their flat
last night. Shortly after 10 o'clock Annie
left the house on her way home.

The girl had scarcely gone when there
was a sharp rapping on the door. Mrs.
Yogielesky had gone into the bathroom,
and Eliza, thinking that her sister had
returned for something, opened the door.
Yogielesky was standing there greatly
excited.

“I want to see my wife,” he said in Ger-
man. He forced his way past the girl, who
tried to block the door. When Mrs. Yogiel-
esky heard his voice she hurried into her
bedroom and slammed the door. Her |
hushand followed.

“Why don't you come and live with me
and quit making me yeteper the girl
heard Yogielesky ask his wife.

“I don't care for you. I want you to go |

| away and leave me alone,” the woman |

replied. |

“T'll kill you, then!” said Yogielesky. j

The Horschler girl ran to the door to
plead with the man, but got there just in
time to see him pull a pistol and fire » shot
into his wife’s back at such chose quarters
that her clothing began to blaze. As she |
fell to the floor Vogielesky leaned over and |
sent two more bullets into his wife's head, |
When he saw that she was lifeless he killed |
himself.

The Horschler girl was so badly
frightened that she crawled out of a window
and went down the fire escape to an apa t-
ment on the floor below. The shots had
been heard through the house and it was

BULLET FOR WIFE AND SELF.

Flectrician Kilis Himself After Shooting
His Wife—She Will Recover.

After a quarrel with his wife over family
affairs John J. O’Rourke, an electrician,
shortly before midnight of Monday drew
a revolver from his pocket and fired
two shots at her. One of the bullets struck
her in the temple and the other in the right

band fired the first shot. She fell to the
floor unconscious, and O'Rourke, thinking
he had killed her, turned the weapon on
himself and sent a bullet crashing into his
brain. He fell dead beside her.

The noise of the shooting attracted the
attention of neighbors, and when some
of them ventured to enter the house they

said he was dead, and then set to work to
restore Mrs. O'Rourke to consciousness,
After working over the woman for about
an hour he finally brought her to. She was
then sent to St. Mary’s Hospital. There it
was discovered that her condition was not
serious. Unless complications set in she
She has not yet been able to
give a statement of what occurred.

The O'Rourkes lived in a two story Queen
Anne cottage at 76 Donington avenue,
Hills. O'Rourke was 28 years
old. His wife, Lillian, ia only 24 vears old,

' cause of the quarrels between the couple,

it is said, Mrs. O'Rourke's brother, Henry
Maier, who lived with his wife on the top
floor of the house, moved out about a month
ago. Sincethen the couple have lived alone
in the house.

About five days «go Mrs. O'Rourke
caused the arrest of her hushand and he
was arraigned before Mazistrate Healy
at Far Rockaway on a charge of assault.
The wife, however, relented when the case
was called, and instead of pressing the
chatee against her husband she begged
the Magistrate to let him go. The Magis-
trate, however, refused to do so and he set
a hearing in the matter for next Friday.
The police say that the couple must have
had a good time last night before the
fatal quarrel. On the table in the dining
room were the remains of a supper. There
were several empty wine bottles, indicating
that the pair were evidently enjoying a
late meal when the quarrel arose.
