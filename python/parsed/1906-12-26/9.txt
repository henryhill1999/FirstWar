Unparalleled Winter Showing of

New COTTON DRESS GOODS
for 1907 .
Unique in Beauty and Variety

Thia is the largest display ever shown at this season. In the section where
the filmy fabrics hold sway it is easy to forget that Winter is here. These

and Summer Roses. The spaciousness of the Wanamaker Store permits a
satisfactory showing of these light materials, so our customers will find ex-
amination and selection a pleasure.

While women who are going South will be particularly interested, women
who like first choice in choosing Summer dresses, and those who want diapha-
nous party gowns for the present season, should see this splendid display
in ite first freshness.

In these days of “the higher education of the eyes,” the master designers
for foreign and American looms are expected each season to show new ideas
in textiles and greater beauty in designs. The inventive Yankees and the
skilled workers of St. Gall, Switzerland, have successfully met these de-
mands. The former have produced in the American Printed Cottons, ex-
quisitely lustrous fabrics, new and beautiful patterns and wonderful color-
effects; the latter show charming novelties and new beauties in their Swiss
muslins. See the silken sheen, the cobwebby fineness, the marvelous color-
blendings, the daintiness of trailing vine and delicate flowers of some of
these sheer fabrics, and you will admit that new versions of Summer dress
cottons surpase the old. Prices are very moderate. Below are a few hints of
the variety and price-range:

| Fur ‘Par aad Pevtieel Coats
For Men and Women.

The new Wanamaker Fur Store demands the attention ot
every careful purchaser of furs. In the first place, because of
the matter of quality. Wanamaker standards will not permit

of anything but carefully-selected skins and _perfectly-made
| garments. Every piece is inspected in the most drastic manner
before it is permitted to go into our stocks. Again, there is
very large and carefully-selected variety of styles from which to
choose; and there is the very important point of price, which on
every piece of fur and every fur garment sold by this house is the
lowest for which a garment of equal quality and workmanship
can be purchased anywhere.

Here are some hints of garments particularly interesting at
the present time:

Sterling
Playerpiano

This piano is acknowledged, in
the art world, as the greatest
achievement in the history of
piarmo construction. It has
opened a royal road to music, for
there isn’t a man or woman, how-
ever ignorant of the art of music,
who cannot sit down at once and
play on it anything written for
the piano. It consists of two
instruments in one, that is one of our artistic Sterling Upright Grand
Pianos with a Sterling Player hidden in it. It is ready to play by
hand in the usual way if desired, or, by simply inserting a music roll,
it opens up for anyone the world’ s treasure-house of music, whether
you know music or not.

You couldn’t buy a better instrument if you paid $1,000. It is
a high-priced, and can be bought on the easiest monthly payments
if desir

We have just finished the largest Christmas Business in our his-
tory. It is gratifying to feel that the appreciation of our rigid system
in selling only reputable pianos grows every year. The Sterling
piano always pays the purchaser,

Second-hand Pianos

During October and November we took in a large number of
second-hand pianos in exchange for new Sterlings, but the holiday
rush prevented our getting them in condition to sell. Most of these
pianos are now ready, and are instruments that we guarantee. Rather
than include them in our stock taking we offer them this week at

Very Large Priced Reductions

Among them are many very notable makes. We have made the
prices so low that we know you will be astonished, and terms to suit

Among these we have some pianos as low as $125, that will give
many years of musical satisfaction.

If you fail to visit our warerooms fhis week you will miss one of
the best opportunities of the year.
