SOUTH CAROLINA DISPLEASED WITH
M'LAURIN AND TILLMAN.

Their Resignations of High Office Fecause of

a Personal Clash Regarded as Undignified

Fach Scemsto Be Satisfied,

Cuarveston, 8. C., May 26.- The joint
resignation of United States Senators
Tillman and McLaurin, which will become
eYective on Sept. 15, reached the State
capital to-day In the resignation the
Senators have asked for a special primary

rine of McLaurin can be put to the test,
then this eleetion shall be held has not
been determined

rhe announcement of the action of the
& pators at Gaffney yesterday has already
caised a reaction to set in and sentiment
js overwhelmingly against the move made
hy the Senators, Just at this time the
State is ina political upheaval MeLaurin
has returned here from Washington to lay
the foundation of a White Republican
party and Tillman is bent on whipping him
the start, Behind the joint resignation
he bitter personal feeling between the
Senators, and the public, while not accept.
ing Tillman's statement that he took the
ctep for the good of his party, believes
it was done for personal spite and to
show his power over McLaurin

The fact that the resignations are uncon.
ditional makes Gov. McSweeney the master
of a situation of which he could not have
obtained control in any other way. The
decided opposition that has already sprung
un against the rivals has induced Demo-
tie leaders to urge the Governor to use

the avowed purpose of dragging McLaurin

footsteps to Gaffney and there in the midst
of excitement and in the heat of passion
taunted his colleagne to resign. McLaurin
has only two years to serve, Tillman
has six, having just been reélected te-

I would not leave my six years bomb-

of. IT saw the opportunity to make
a ten strike for Democracy. IT was ready
to take it regardless of the personal sacri-
fice. I want South Carolina to say whether
she wants two Democrats or two Republi-
cans in the Senate. If the people don't
Want to realect me I don't care to serve
them. I shall announce my candidacy
to succeed myself and shai! take auch
other steps as ! find desirable

“I regard it fortunate that this ia an off-
year, so that we can discuss thease national
issues without any trading and combina-
tions and the voters can decide upon
the issues without outside interference, If
I relieve the State of eighteen months of
McLaurin | think I will be entitled to er edit
and thanks. If a commercial Democrat
isn't a Republican, | don't know what he ia,
If MeLaurin is a Democrat I am not. I
wish the people to decide het ween us.”

“Will you and Senator McLaurin both
enter the primary?”

“Lam going before the people, and there
will be a number of other candidates. I
presume if MeLaurin’s health permits he
will alao run.”

“Will you both run for the long term
you have just vacated?”

“He can run for either one. There is no
restriction about that. The resignation is
unconditional, and he might as well run
for my seat as his own,”

As to whether he thought MeLaurin
weaker now than last time he ran, when it
was well understood that Tillman backed
Evans, the Senator said:

“T did not oppose him then and my friends
did not fight him. There are a whole lot
of people who voted for him against Evans
who will see him in Jericho before they will
support him.”

In reply to a request for a statement,
Senator MeLaurin said:

Tillman just made one of his binffs, but
this time he got called. I put him in a posi-
tion where he either had to resign and go
into a Senator.al race with me or confess
| he was bluffing and afraid to risk his politi-
eal scalp, though willing to knife me in a
campaign in which he waa not a candidate
and had nothing at stake. And he could
not afford to crawl in public.

“ALLL desire is a free and open fight with
Tiliman upon the issues about which we
differ. I earnestly hope that all others
will keep out of our race and run for the
other Senatorship, so that Tillman and I
may meet as man to man and fight it ont
He said he was unwilling to bulldoze me
to a joint debate with him if T was afraid
him. I have shown him that I
was not afraid, and now I hope that he will
not be afraid to meet me alone in the Sena-
torial hope he will not get any
of his strikers into the race to dodge be-
hind. Let the others scramble for the
place I vacate.”

RIVE KILLED; 25 INJURED.

HEAD-ON COLLISION ON THE AIBANY
AND HUDSON TROLLEY TINE.

 

Two Cars Crash Into Each Other While Going
at a Rate of $0 or 40 Miles an Hour One
Driven Half Throngh the Other~ Both
Motormen Killed Two Injured May Die.

ALNANY, May 26,--Five passengers were
killed and twenty-five or more injured in a
head-on collision between two of the bg
motor cars on the Albany and Hudson Rail-
way snd Power Company's line about two
miles beyond east of Greenbush and six
miles from Albany at 3:40 0'clock this after-
noon

The accident occurred while the cara were
running at a tate of between thirty and
forty miles an hour, The two cars which
metin the crash were crowded with pas-
sengers, the car which left Albany at 3:30
o'cloek, bound south, tn charge of motorman
Smith, having refused to take on any more
owing to lack of seating accommodations
The northbound car from Hudson which
came in collision with car 22, was car
19, and js believed to have contained as
many passengers as could be comfortably
cared for. This car was in charge of Mo-
torman Nichols.

The Albany and Hudson Company's cars
areextra large and heavy vehicles, about
the size of a steam railroad coach, They
have carried large loads of passengers on
Sunday into the pretty country towns of
Rensselaer county, and to-day the comple-

ments of paasengera were especially
heavy, the company having opened a
pleasure park at Kinderhook Lake.

The road is a single-track line, with
awitchings and sidings, and the two cars,
bound in opposite directions, were trying to

make a switch when they dashed into each

If an Informal Agreement Among Brick Church
Members Is Carried Out—Hamorous Letter

 

MAY 27, 1901.-COPYRIGHT, 1901, BY THE SUN PRINTING AND PUBLISHING ASSOCIATION.

From the Pastor About Fxperiences a

Palestine Read in the Black Draped Church,

It {@ proposed in the Brick Preabyteriean
Church to raise a memorial fund, the income
of which will abundantly provide for Mrs
Babeock. The Brick Church is one of the
wealthiest Presbyterian congregations io
the country and many of the officers are
more than millionaires. An officer of the
church said yesterday that several of the
trustees, members of the #easion and un-
official members of the church had talked
the matter over informally and had come to
the conclusion that the fund ought to be large
enough to give Mra Babcock an independence
for life. When asked if any sum had been
agreed upon, this officer said

‘The subtect has been only informally dis-
cursed It sesame to be the informal agree-
ment that not leas than $259,000 should be
raised. It would be rather ciffleult to in-
vest that amount in such a way as to yield
more than 4 per cent, which would return
to Mrs Babcock only $10,000. That ts Iitue
enough for her to have I believe that there
are 250 members of this church who would
be glad to give $1,000 aplece. Tf that be true
there are as many mora who would give
emailer amounts. It is the idea of some of
the oMoers of the church to start out with
the idea of raising $250,000, Starting out with
that idea, I would not be at all surprised if
we raised $275,000 or $900,000 Whatever
amount is raised, it will be invested go that
all Mrs. Babcock will have to do will be to
draw the income.”

The Rev. Dr. Thomas S. Hastings, formerly
President of the Union Theological Seml-
nary, conducted the services at the church
vesterday morning. The congregation was
eo large that even the extra seata in the choir
loft were oeeupled and the standing room
galleries was) appropriated The
auditorium bore evidence that the church is
