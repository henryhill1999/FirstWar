While on a mud bank in the Halifax River,
left the boat last night and departed from
St. Augustine this morning on Atlantic
Coast Line train 88, due in New York at

He said that until Daniel Smith, brother |

of his secretary, boarded the houseboat
in the Halifax River he did not know that
anybody was looking for him

“I knew nothing of the bank failure,’
he said, “and now that I do know it I am
rushing back to New York to attend a
banking meeting, although I am sick.”

He said that as soon as he heard Smith's
story he decided to return to Néw York
at once and aid in straightening out the
trouble caused the city by the failure of
the Carnegie Trust Company and also
' give evidence regarding the alleged fund
raised to defeat racetrack legislation

Mr. Hyde spoke bitterly of alleged

He declared he had been followed by

greatly annoyed him and his family.
He said he had been so worried that he
wanted to resign office, and only refrained
from doing so on the advice of friends.

MR. CRAM WAS A CANDIDATE.

Mr. Cram, who was a candidate for
Senator himself, has been saying for
some days to his acquaintances that his

'relations with Mr. Murphy would be
broken off if Mr. Sheehan was elected.
Yesterday he said:

“The interests have one Senator a e
and should not have two. Why should not
the other 9,000,000 people in this State be
represented?

“Between Sheehan and Shepaid I shoula
| certainly prefer Shepard. Mr. Sheehan

is a charming man and a personal friend
of mine, but the interests have dictated
|his nomination. Mr. Shepard is a man
|of fine character, spotless reputation and
/greatubility. Hiseleetion at least would
not drive the people into such bitter re-
jSentment that they would turn against

| the Democratic party, as I believe they ,

j willif Mr. Sheehan is elected. The people
}are up inarms and will resent the election
| of another representative of the interests.
if think there many flaws in Mr.
Shepard's declaration of principles. I
»approve of his attitude on the tari, but
\IT think he is wrong about the regulation
of public service corporations. When
we take the outrages that we see in this
!city by these corporations, the treatment
that wemen and children are subjected
to—surely we must realize that the people
will resent this soouer or later.”
MURPHY SAID NO TO HIM

Mr. Cram was asked whom he
favored originally for Senator.

“Many of my friends came to me,” he
replicd, “and asked me to be a candid ata,
but Mr. Murphy would not hear of it. T
night have been a candidate if it had
not been that he did not regard it with
favor.”

“Did he tell you so?”

“He did. I think the peonle wanted
somebody in sympathy with their in-
terests, somebody who understood that
the very wealthy must not control tha
situation. The tariff is an important
issue, but while | am for tariff for revenue
oily Tam more impressed with the idea
that slowly butssurely we are becoming
a country of the very poor and the very
rich.”

Mr. Cram said that he had seen Mr.
| Murphy last about a week ago
| “Did he tell you then that he was for
| Sheehan?”
| “Oh, no,” said Mr. Cram. “That was
)settled right after the Rochester con-
vention.”

He said that he had been associated
in politics with Mr. Murphy for six or
|seven years, and that as chairman of
,the Democratic county committee ha

had much work with many ungrateful
| details to attend to

; “Will you give this up if Mr. Sheehan
‘is elected?”

“Perhaps it is a little too early to say
anything definite yet,” said Mr. Cram,
; "but I believe there is very little doubt
that Sheehan will be elected. Only the
Governor can save the situation. Unless
he will act there will be a horrible, fright-
ful mess for the Democratic party in
this State from which it will never re-
cover, The politicians don't seem to
understand the people. They don't seem
to grasp tho fact that while they are ap-
parently sulfering in silence they are
really boiling within.”
| The Democratic party, Mr. Cram added,
| would kill every chance it has for winning
in 1912 if Sheehan becomes a Senator.

“I say this,” he continued, “although
I like Sheehan personally, It isn't go
much what he did sixteen or twenty years
ago as it is what he represents to-day.
I believe in organization, but the present
condition of affairs is shocking.”
