OMclals Circulating Stories of Revolt,
Hurking Weetings and Setving Seme |
Arms Wholesale Arrests About Can-)
anea Demands of Yeung Voters.

Fu Paso, June %.— Following the arrest
of sixty-five men and the capture of a
hundred rifles at Cananea last Thursday
Col. Emilio Kooterlitaky and his rurales
arrested four men on Sunday near Villa
Verde, thirty miles from Cananea, who
were transporting on burros to Cananea
4,000 rounds of ammunition, several rifles
and two pistols. This information comes
from Del Rio and Cananea, Mexico, and
Naco, Arizona.

It developed here to-day that two anti-
Diaz meetings were held in this city on
Sunday, one on South Station street and
one in Fast Fl Paso and that others were
held in other Texas border towns. Mezi-
can officials in Ciudad Juarez, opposite
Ei Paso, made these statements. They
also said they understood that ammuni-
tion has been bought up here, as in Ari-
zona, where the supply of arms and am-
munition in stores is completely ex-
hausted. But Fl Paso merchants say
there have been no heavy sales of arms
here

The town of Cananea is now virtually
under martial law. The authorities have
taken measures to prevent meetings that
might in any wav foment trouble. The
police have orders to disperse any gather-
ing of fifty or more persons and a house
to house search has revealed the hiding
place of many rifles and much ammant-
tion
