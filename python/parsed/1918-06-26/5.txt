The Soldier Boy of Eighteen.

Highteen ts not too young to begin
military training, whatever may be
thought of putting eighteen Into the
first line trenches.

Our own opinion {s that some of the
best fighters at Uncle San's call will
be found in the class between eighteen
and twenty-one. The extension down-
ward of the age of service is indicated
by every consideration of common
eense, of national experience in previ-
ous wars, of instructive European ex-
perience in older systems of universal
training. As between eighteen and
nineteen as the minimum age for ac-
tual entrance upon the field of war
there may be some question; as
against a selective service which shall
begin at eighteen the intensive prep-
aration required in the case of all
novitiate recruits, young or old, there
can be no reasonable objection.

Senator Fau’s bill calis to the col-

ors—that is, would register and hold
subject to draft for military service,
or for industrial service essential to
Wilitary success—all able bodied
Asnericans between the ages of elgh-
deen and forty-five inclusive.
* Senator France's bill does the same
thing, between the eame age limits;
except that it specifically provides that
military service between eighteen and
twenty-one shall be training rather
than fighting; and we infer it holds
the minor classes subject to call for
industrial work necessary to the win-
ning of the war.

The main thing is to make the
training universal, and to get the real
training started at eighteen.

he change of sentiment regarding
@tte extension of the draft age, both
up and down, has been very marked
of iate. This is due to the efforts
of Provost Marsha! General Craowpra,
to the gradual definition of ideas and
purposes in the War Department and
to a better understanding in Congress
of what is demanded by the military
situation, and by the industrial and
the agricultural situation behind the
military situation.

The soldier boy of eighteen is com-
ing. He is to have his part tn the
great system now in process of devel-
opment for the winning of the war.

A Certain Pink Dodger.
' A Sun reader in Tuckahoe sends to
us a pink dodger circulated in her
neighborhood in the interest of the
war savings stamp drive, Part of
the dodger is as follows:

“AMERICANS !
“A White W. 8. 8. Pledge Card Is
Your Pledge of Loyalty.
“A Yellow Refusal Card May Indicate
You Are a Pro-German or Slacker.”

 

‘

The way in which the second para-
graph of the leaf, although the con-
tingent “may” is used, impresses our
correspondent is indicated in a let-
ter here appended:

“To THE Epitor or Tus SuN—Sir:
There is a tang of Prussianism about
the present W. S. 8. drive that I wonder
whether the American people deserve.
In every case where the Government
has squarely presented a need, that
nee@ has been oversubscribed. It has
not been necessary to employ ‘hold-up’
acthods.,

“We are told that the Government de-
pended upon W, §&. 8. to furnish $2,000,-
000,000. I have found no one who un-
derstood this to be so, Could not the
newspapers have made the public clearly
aware of this before the present ‘pay up
or be branded’ method was resorted to?

“There is plenty of money in the
country to finance the war; also, those
who hold it seem willing to use it that
way, but there ia a fair proportion of
people whose salaries have not been in-
creased to meet our war prices, and who
are keeping out of debt only by heroic
wacrifices. Many of them are already
etruggling with their Liberty bond pay-
ments. Is it fair or necessary to de-
mand from them another quota or
brand them as slackers? This may be
necessary later on, but was there now

no alternative? N, EL. M,

They give and give, and then they re-
sent the word or look which intimates
that, no matter how often and at
What sacrifice they have given, they
must give again or be considered in a
way disloyal.

This is not the first complatat of
thiq nature that Tue Sun hag re-
celved; not particularly about the
War Savings Stamps campaign, but
about almost every patriotic or hu-
mane effort In which the public has
been personally solicited by the vol-
unteer workers. These volunteers
have done a remarkably fine service
to thelr country. That they have not
been unerring judges of human na-
tul *. OF possessed of such clairvoyant
pow. .s as would enable them to know
when the purse of the solicited Is
empty, is not their fault. Their er-
rors have been of the head only.
Perhaps they were badly conched.
We have seen more than one Ameri-
can turn red with embarrassment and
anger in a theatre because the well
meaning Liberty Loan worker in-
sisted that he could “take another
fifty dollar bond; surely, anybody can
do that.” If that financial philosophy
had a bottom to it Join Saxcrrst, sal-
ary $50 a week, could handle the
whole loan! The fact !s that In the
thentre campaigns the mute workers,
both for bonds and for the Red Cross,
were the most successful. They met
the “prospect” eye to eye; the oppor-
tunity was there for the patriot and
he took ft as rapidly as if a volume
of argument or insistence had been
poured Into his ear.

Almost all the_money that has been
subscribed for the Liberty Loans, the
war stamps and the Red Cross has
come willingly from a people that is
actuated by patriotism, sympathy and
pride. The little that the enthuslastic
worker has shamed out of the pock-
ets of the unwilling has hardly been
worth while. The pink dodger is but
one among a thousand—and better—
methods that are used to sell war
savings stamps Consider the beau-
tiful young women who sell thrift
stamps in restaurants. When they
make ao sale they smile; when they
fail, they smile just the same. They
know.

goes about his work In a tactless way.
If they have given to patriotic uses
until giving has hurt, there is noth-
ing to worry about. Each and every
American is the keeper of his purse
and his conscience, particularly the
latter. Conscience will tell him or
her when it Is wisdom to open the
purse or close it. If anybody shouts
at you to buy a stamp, remember
that he only fears that you have for-
gotten, for the moment, a glorious
opportunity.

 

Dr. von Kuehimann Talks of Bel-
gium and German Colonies.

In hig statement in the Reichstag
of the war alms of Germany the For-
elgn Secretary, Dr. RicHaRD von
KUHLMANN, laid especial stress upon
the German attitude regarding Bel-
glum and the recovery of her lost
colonies and world trade. It is not
unnatural that these subjects of con-
troversy should be thus associated.
Antwerp and the Scheldt as a Ger-
man outlet to the oceans and her over-
sea possessions were among the lures
that determined Germany upon her
venture of conquest.

The Foreign Secretary declares that
Germany can give no pledges regard-
ing Belgium. In this the real Ger-
man attitude toward Belgium Is dis-
The Allled nations have so
position,

closed,
considered Germany's
never actually made an unequivocal
statement regarding it.

The present military occupation has
aimed at a division of the nation
into its two racial units and the ab-
sorption through a process of gelf-
determination of the northern and
more coveted section. Sem!-officlally
to the world were given two reasons
or motives for the forcible occupation
of Belgium. The first was the neces-
sity of the Belgian coast, particularly
{ts northern portion, to the comple-
tion of the Germanic scheme of over-
sea trade, The second was the ur-
gency of a Germanic control of the
Belgian frontier for the proteciion of
the neighboring rich industrial re-
gions of the Rhine valley, Elther of
these reasons would be sufficient jus-
tification to the German militaristic
party for the devastation of the coun-

try or for its final incorporation

Empire.
Dr. Kttiumann in further defining
the German war alims says:

“We wish for the German people and
our allies a free, strong, independent ex-
istence within the boundaries drawn for
us by history. We desire overseas pos-
sessions corresponding to our greatness
and wealth; the freedom of the sea,
carrying our trade to all parts of the
world.”

This 1s practically a reiteration of
the doctrine held by Von BetHMANN-
Hottweo and his successors in the
German Chancellorship.

Germany's colonies have all fallen
{nto the hands of the Allies. The
last, German East Africa, was occu-
pled several months ago by the troops
under General Smuts, The people of
the South African Union are tnsist-
ing upon the retention of the posses-
sions which they took after severe
campaigns, The Pacifie possessions
of Germany are now held by Japan,
Australian and New Zealand, ‘The
British colonies lhave set up elaims
to the occupied islands upon the basis
that their restoration to Gscrany
would constitute a menace to thelr
security and integrity as nations,

The German insistence upon the re-
turn of these possessions 1s due
largely to the need of Germany for
tropical supplies, Bho commercial

¢

 

al- |
though the German Government hus |

within the boundaries of the

   

leaders of Germany hold these imper-
ative to the completion of the Ger-
man industrial scheme, They would
thus provide against the contingency
of a fallure of raw material from Al-
lied nations by establishing definite
sources of supplies of thelr own,

If the Foreign Minister has put
forth his statement as a new peace
offensive it is not likely to receive
more consideration than other utter-
ances from Berlin. The question of
colonies and of the future of German
trade may he settled at the peace
conference. The rehabilitation of
Belgium is a condition of peace. The
pledge that Germany shall give will
be a binding pledge and not another
scfap of paper.

A French Son of the Revolution.

There is an element of special in-
terest for Americans in the announce-
ment that Captain A.exanpre Benr-
THER of the French army has been
taken prisoner by the Germans; for
this young soldier is a descendant of
one of Napo.eon’s famous Marshals,
who came to America with Laray-
etre in his youth and fought for the
independence of the colonies In the
War of the Revolution, If he lived
in this country Captain BertHim
would be eligible to membership In
the Sons of the Revolution.

Of all the distinguished soldiers
who were made Marshals of France
when Naporscon assumed the Impe-
rial title none was more intimately
associated with the fortunes of the
Emperor than Lovia ALEXANDRE Brr-
THIER, Who constantly participnted In
his milltary activities from 1796 down
to his abdication tn 1814 and ban-
ishment to Elba. Bertier had al-
ready won reputation as a mi itary
leader when Bonaparte rose to ),rom-
inence; and he became successively
chief of the general staff, commander
of the army in Italy nnd Minister of
War, being succeeded in the latter
office by the famous Carnor.

In 1814, however, Bertutier acted as
spokesman for the Marshals of France
in welcoming Lovis XVIII. to the
royal throne; although there {s good
reason to belleve that the old soldier
would have rejoined NapoLeon during
the hundred days preceding Waterloo
if he had been able to find an oppor-
tunity to do so.

BourniEsNne, the most Intimate bl-
ographer of Narotron, 18 most em-
phatic as to the genuine affection
which Brrturer felt for the Em-
peror, and says that Napo.ron would
undoubtedly have welcomed him back
with nothing more than a passing
gibe at his salutation of the Bourbon
King. He quotes the Emperor as say-
ing that Bertier was “a man full
of honor, courage and probity, and
exceedingly regular In the perform-
ance of his duties,” and on another
occasion that he had “talents, ac-
tivity, courage and character"; while
on the other hand at St. Helena he
called BERTHIER a goose !

Perhaps the great exile realized
that the goose is one of the bravest
of birds and that geese once saved
the city of Rome, Certain it is that
Marshal Bertier saved the life of
NaroLtxon on the retreat from Mos-
cow. The Emperor wos riding his
favorite silver gray Persinn mare,
named Tauris, when an unexpected
attack by a large body of Cossacks
compelled the staff to charge the en-
emy and Tauris became so excited
by the Cossack yells that she would
have carried her rider Into the midst
of the attncking party !f BrertHier
had not managed to seize her bridle
and by a desperate effort check her
mad cnreer,

A Marshal of France who was once
a fellow soldier with Larayerte in
our War of Independence should al-
ways be remembered with honor by
Americans

 

 

Can a Non-Golfer Be a Good Man?

A friend who will not be offended
if we refer to him as middle aged
writes to THE Sun asking:

“Do you think there are any good
men who are not golfers?”

We think the questioner, enger to
be brief, overlooked some essential
exclusions which we must indicate
before revealing our thoughts on this
interesting subject.

There ure many good men whose
occupations do not allow them the
use of the three hours of daylight a
round of eighteen holes consumes, tn-
cluding the time spent in dressing
rooms and under showers, and in in-
evitable explanations of certnin foo-
zles, of hard luck, rubs of the green
which account for defeat, or boasting
of the masterly shots which earned
victory. There are other good men
who cannot afford the moderate ex-
pense of golfing even over public
links. Also, there must be some good
men living in unfavored localities
where the most dependable of flivvers
will not carry them to a golf course
between the rising and setting of a
June day’s sun. That their depriva-
tion is to be deplored we admit, but
we are compelled to think of them as
good men; many of them.

What, then, of the remainder of
mankind ; those who have time, avail-
able funds in the treasury not other-
wise appropriated, and who lve
within easy reach of a golf course,
yet who do not play golf? Can they
be good men?

The seven ages, it 1s comfortingly
true, need not be considered, From
schoolboy to veteran none is too
young, too old to enjoy the fascinating
sport. The young play well; the eld-
ers, If they be of right mind, find as
much enjoyment and a vaster amount
of pleasurable argument out of a
round whose score cards bear double
figures for each hole,

Adopting the limitations we have
suggested, can a man convincingly
introduce good character testimony
and at the same time plead guilty of
refraining from, neglecting or refys-

UE ork he

ing to play golf? It is not an easy
mutter to decide.

Might it not be that a man may be
good yet not play golf because he is
not informed of some of the less re-
vealed pleasures and profits of the
game? We have heard of a man who
plays regularly only because he loves
birds, He has this year identified
seventeen varieties of the warbler
family in the shadowy forests and
brush bordering the fair greens of
his course wherein he spends many
of his golfing hours seeking balis
driven awry. A more intimate knowl-
edge of wild flowers rewards those
whose intense senrch of thé rough,
looking for lost balls, brings them
into closer communion with nature
than they ever enjoyed before. Sur-
prises of the woods have been en-
thusiastically reported by a golfer
who, before he abandoned the cue for
the driver, supposed that birch and
beech were local variants of the name
of the same tree,

Thus it is demonstrated that fresh
nir, exercise, the thrill of competi-
tion, the joy of a close approach, a
long put, gossip and other refresh-
ment of the nineteenth hole far from
exhaust the long lst of attractions
of golf, many of them unsuspected by
the non-golfer.

So we withhold judgment. But if
there be any man convinced that he
is good, but whose youth or age de-
prives him of the privilege of help-
{ng to drive the Huns across the
Rhine, who will try to drive a golf
ball over a water hazard requiring a
carry of only 125 yards, we feel our-
selves competent to assure him that
he fs destined to experience several
new and mixed emotions.

The news from the Italian front in-
dicates that it is impossible for Gen-
eral Wurm to execute a turning

In the hurry of debate Representative
JOHNSON, whose State, Washington,
has been most bedeviled by the I. W.
W., gave this answer to a member
who asked as to the beliefs of the
order: “That labor and capital have
nothing in common; destroy society,
overturn civilization, stamp out indi-
viduality, erase the laws of private
property whether of money, land,
righta, mental attainment or manual
skill.” The gentleman from Wash-
ington does well to imply that the
mental attainments and manual oekill
of tle successful workman are his
private property. It is @ good defini-
tion.

For those who like to ponder over
this sort of thing it seems to be the
sort of thing they like to ponder over.
When the House in committee of the
whole considered a law for the de-
portation of anarchists Speaker CLarkK
called Socialist Lonpon to the chair.
Never a chairman more punctilious,
more rigid in enforcing all rules, more
conservative of minorities’ rights,
more formal in appwing every written
and unwritten law of the House, more
stern in preserving order. All well
enough to breathe defiance to author-
ity on the soap box, but in the seat
of power man given and indisputa-
ble authority hath a charm.

Germany promises that she. will
make no promises regarding Belgium.
But, in the light of history, we must
decline to believe her.

 

 

 

THE POLICEMAN’'S PAY.

A Woman of Cosmopolitan Experience
Speaks on the Subject.

To tHe Enrtor or THe SUN-—SSr: I
have noted with great Interest the var!-
Ous articles and letters in your paper
in reference to the police force of our
city and its Inadequate pay,

At this grave moment in the world’s
history the conservation of man power
should be paramount. Having lived in
many of the large cities of Furope I can
say without prejudice that the police of
New York in its various departments is
not equalled anywhere in the world.

They are splendid specimens of man-
liness and courage. The careless ob-
server little realizes the demands made
upon these men. For hours they are
exposed to intense heat, cold and storm,
Again and again they are called upon
to do courageous and dangerous work
for which no money can pay.

Qur brave firemen plunge into literal
barrages at many fires and with little
Protection, Are they less brave than
our men at the front?

If the “laborer ta worthy of his hire,”
then these men who mean so much to
every citizen should be protected and
encouraged, A good man is ready to
risk a great deal if he feels that his In-
come is sufficient for those dependent
upon him. It ts only a matter of juatice
that this issue at atake should be deter-
mined in favor of the police of New
York elty.

JUDICIAL RECALL,

TRAMPS IT THE WISEST WHO

WARNING TO CAR THIEVES.| LIE

Judge Clearwater Calls Attention to, The Property Protection Section, Di-

the Pernicious Character and Wide
Reach of the Sociajist Propaganda.

To THE EvITor oF Tus SuN—Sir: The
report of the committee of the American
Bar Association to oppore judicial recall,
which will come up for consideration at
the association’s next onnual meeting
at Cleveland on August 28, deserven,
even in these parlous times, when our
thoughts and energies are centred upon
the prosecution of the war, the consid-
eration of a greater constituency than
the bar.

It calls attention to the etnister fact
that judicial recall ie the subject of de-
bate in thousands of high schools and in
many colleges, especially in the West-
ern States, and that the Socialiats of
the West and Northwest holdly avow
the purpose of establishing it in its most
pernicious form.

Every student of the times known that
the menace of Boctaliem has never been
more throatening than to-day, and that
all the elements which chafe at restraint
gleefully view the utilisation of energy
and property by the Government for the
brosecution of the war as a permanent
step toward the ultimate abrogation of
all constitutional limitations and to the
establishment of government by human
whim,

The recall of judicial decisions and
of Judges who deliver opinions at vari-
ance with the popular caprice of the
moment {fs #0 alluring to the non-refiect-
ing mind, and affords so captivating a
propaganda to the Socialist, the an-
archist and the demagogue that {ft be-
hooves not only the bar but all patrte
otle Americans never to relax vigilant
oppoaition to a heresy so destructive of
reprosentative government.

Unfortunately, lawyers as a rule are
80 submerged by the exactionna and re-
Pponsibilities of professional duties that
too many of them fall in this obligation
to elvilization, but neither the bar nor
layman ever should forget that wise
maxim of Terence, “Fallacia alla aliam
trudit.” A. T. CLEARWATER.

THE DECIMAL SUPERSTITION

The Stand Pat View of the Standard
of Weights and Measures.

To THE Evitor oF THE 6UN—Sir; Un-
der the title “The Decimal Supereti-
tion” @ writer in the Saturday Review
criticises the metric system in a way
which is at once searching and novel
and which coincides with the views of
your correspondent In Tur Sun. The
following points must meet with the
agreement of those who are obliged to
use both systems of weights and meas
urer. “Generations of half educated re-
formers have clamored for the adoption
of Continental weights and measures,
Their contentions are that commercial
relations would be expanded, the time
of schoolhoys and clerks be economised,
and so-called progress be pureed. It
does not occur to them that the change
may havo far reaching consequences,”
Consequences of this kind are that the
change will affect the small purse most;
that where the shilling, the franc, the
lira and the dollar have been the ac-
cepted standards, the florin, liter and
Kilogram will introduce confusion, The
writer then proceeds: ‘This !s a char-
acteristic example of the way In which
the decimal superstition affects small
minds. Tens are presumably more easy
to add up because they end with a cl-
Dher that need not exercise the brain.
But why fa 70 plus 50 a simpler eum
than 7 plus 6? What is the advantage
of appending a wholly unnecessary col-
umn at the end of a score? In it not
plain that in adding 76 centimes to 35
we go through the subconscious and
supererogatory mental process of trana-
mitting five centimes into a halfpenny?
The worship of Number Ten {ts merely a
savage superstition handed down from
the days when counting was confined
to the fingers.”

In a note to this communication the
editor, while agreeing to much of it, be-
eves that the metric system haa the
lesser inconvenience. The settlement
of the question must, however, wait until
the end of the war. Meanwhile people
are encouraged to criticise and to speak
exactly as they think. There are many
things crude and wrong about the deci-
mal system, and {ts warmest advocates
can take the verdict of an untrained
mind in the same gense as that in which
Napoleon accepted the criticism of his
orderly. A person of natural intelli-
wence but technically ignorant serves
as a foolometer whose measure is not
without its value,

To THe Eviton oy Tug SUN—Sir: In

I beg space in your valuable paper to

say that good wheatless pastry can be

made from one's regular recipes by

dropping the wheat flour entirely and
substituting a mixed flour of one-third

harley flour, one-third corn flour and
aifted twice,

I use brown sugar inatead of white,

and corn of! for shortening, except for
ple crust, for which I use cocoanut bute
ter, and I have made successful cake,
cookles, doughnuts and ple crust.

THE ROSE'S NAME.
German Appellations [Ill Become
Beautiful Flowers.

To Tne Knrtor or Tus BuN--Sér; In
Ture Sun of June 31 a Newark floriat
presumes to characterise as “silly” the
{dea of changing the German names of
flowers. The gentleman's letter, with its
absurd comparisons, ie far aililer than
the idea he flouts.

That idea te but one more manifesta-
tation of the world’s right desire to
eliminate ao far as may be the modern
German label. The world resents the
Teutonic tag on the things it buys, sella,
user, takes Into ite daily iife. To re-
tain that tag is to retain a constant
symbol of the confessed ambition of
Toutonism to Teutonise us all.

One cannot rogdily think of any ob-
ject to which a German name is less
suited than it {8 to a flower. Flowers
are emblems of courtesy and regard;
why name them after reprenentatives of
& people who regard nothing and have
violated all courtesy? Flowers are em-
blems of purity; why attach to them
names borne among a people to whom
nothing is pure? Flowers cheer the bed
of pain; why fasten upon them names
that originated among those who pride
themeelves on bombing ambulance and
hoepital?

When we go out into the garden and
look upon the wonder of a pure white
rose we are reluctant to call it by the
name of a German woman—one of
thoee German women who denied food
to captive soldiera, who spat in their
fncea, who have not Nfted one voice
of sympathy for their French or Bel-
gian sisters, If we cannot cal) that pure
white rose by any better name than
the cacophonous one of Frau Karl
Druachke let it be nameless,

THE MAKING OF BEER.

A Btatement of the Anti-Saloon
League's Position.

To Tks Eprroa or Tre BuN—&@: One
of your correapondents recently accused
me of favoring the continuation of the
manufacture of beer and wine because
I eaid that the Preaident and Mr. Hoover
were right in Ineisting that the manu-
facture of beer should not be out off
until the sale of whiskey was also
stopped. I did not suppose than any
reader of Tue 8un could so mistake
Plain English, or that anybody who
knows what has been going on in New
York could assume for a minute that
the Anti-faloon League fe in favor of
extending any kind of privileges to the
liquor traffic.

For the benefit of the gentleman from
Jamaica I wish to gay that the Anti-
Baioon League atande for stopping both
the manufacture and the sale of avery
sort of alcoholic beverage as @ war

ter of permanent policy by meane of a

TRAMPS IT ALONE.

 

A Yankee Wanderer Finds Fair Friendship Vain and the Lending of
, Pink Pajamas a Mockery.

 

A tramp would not wilfully make
&@ sentimental journey. If it were sug-
geated that he should he would reg-
ister a vigorous objection. The com-
plex problem of existence taxes the
wits of the man whose main aim is
to unburden himeelf of the responsi-
bilities of life. This in itself is suf-
ficient excuse for his refusal to attach
to his unconventional loiterings a per-
fectly useless appendage. Women re-
quire, in addition to sumptuous furs,
diamonds and fine apparel. A male
tramp (there afe no female ones)
longs only for toga that will pass mus-
ter with tho police, and the rough,
aquare meal that satisfies a farm

the open is more~ consequent and
more healthful to Weary William. Be-
ing @ tramp he is absolved from pro-
found attempts at sound reasoning.
These belong to professors and law-
yers. The sordid concern about money
that keeps the merchant and stock
broker awake nights to make sentt-
mental journeys possible won't dis-
turb a tramp's slumber at midday.

These pearls of thought were etrung
when a laay in perplexity appealed to
me for assistance as J tramped
through the narrow streets of Havana
on my way to the steamship wharf.
She had a wicker travelling bag and a

location, the exact position of which
she had lost, tucked somewhere behind
her puckered brows.

“My cabby has dumped me here and
left me. Can you tell me where is the
Goctor?” she asked pleadingly.

Havana had been visited with an
epidemic scare. I was myself looking
for the health officer to get a clean bill
before sailing. So I attached her to
my limited entourage that consisted of
a Cuban beggar hopelessly beseeching |
alma from my flattened purse. We/|

together and came out together——cer-

thing about a second class passage, an |
excuse in iteelf bearing the stamp of)

should be a stowaway, but the lady’s |
wicker bag was in my grasp and T|
had to go aboard with her. I clung |
to this physical evidence of respect- |
ability, for such is the psychic effect of |
womankind on mankind, in spite of a!
porter’s attempt to relleve me of it, |
and deposited it at the door of her|
stateroom. Then I stood waiting, like
my Cuban beggar, for her largess.

“Thank you.” Her steel gray eyes
were looking steadily into mine. That
wan the beginning. I was apprehen-
sive of the ending. I communed with
myself. Why are not women properly
protected in their wanderings, and why
are they always appealing to men in
their distress when they are them-
selves so capable? With there stee! |
gtay eyés aboard I was sure that the
chameleon fascination of the sea would
be blotted out. I didn't want to be a |

tion on the class to haunt the ladies’

serting the ship, but the gangplank |
was drawn and we were steaming past
the Punta fortress on our way out of |
Havana harbor, ;

The only way to avoid my com- |
pelling acquaintance was to haunt the
smoking room. After dinner I went
there and found that I was not the
only tramp aboard. And seated snugly
in @ corner on the leathern cushions
wae the lady. In a moment she was

STINT OR SPEND? |

Two Views of the Matter of Our
Standards of Living.

To THe Epiron or THe SuN—Sir; It

{a characteristic of Tae SuN always to

present both sides of a question to its
readers, fairly and forcibly, but I have
never before seen so conspicuous an ex-
ample as that which appears in Satur-
day's paper.

In one column “M. T. R.,"” a corre-
spondent, presents a clear, and certainiy
a plausible argument in favor of en-
couraging all kinds of business, and the
lavish expenditure of money by every-
body, in order that people may make
prof™s enough to pay the inevitable
taxes Imposed because of the necessity
for defraying the expenses of the war

I judge from the tenor of sundry
editorial articles that have recently ap-
peared in your paper that Tur Sun is,
to may the least, inclined toward this
view of the question, The appearance
of “M. T. B.'s" letter was no surprise.

Very well. There is much to be said
in favor, Thugs far, the public generally
seems to take that side. I have ob-
served few signa of reducing expendl-
tures, Doubtless there has been much |
of it, but the general appearance of New
York city does not Indicate great
economy.

Automobiles, which “M. T. R."” cites |
as the product of an induatry that
should be specially encouraged, are
more numerous than ever before. Pur- |
veyors of luxuries, from lobsters to
jewelry, seem to be making money.
Theatro seats at high prices sell readily.
Fashion has not yet proh{bited ex-
travagance entirely, If some are per-
force economical, others are more ex-
travamant than ever.

But in the very next column to that
which contains "M. T. R.'s" letter ap-
pears an interview with Sir Robert Arm-
strong Jones, whem THY SUN clagses as
“an eminent Bri: authority.’ | And
Sir Robert discusses che same quertion.

A few lines will bear repeating. He
gays: “Economy ia a virtue which for |

her prompt and cooing rejoinder.

So she saw them, handled them, ap-
Praised and admired them and ex.
claimed with enthusiasm:

“They would be a perfectly stunning
costume for the masque they ara to
havo in the saloon to-night. I'd bor-
row them if you wouldn't give mo

Being detached, she had already
been given away once, but I was dis-
pored, if any one would accept the
gift, to give her away once more,

“Can you get past the captain? 7
queried.

“Oh, my, yes; the captain ts «4
friend of mine,” she exclaimed jub'-
lantly. She went to the hall arrayed
in my pink night garments. I stayed
in my stateroom to make it possible
for her to cover her daring under the
suspicion that would rest on me, 1
had proof that the concealment waa
effectual, for the pretty bride whie-
pered as she passed me on the statr-
way next morning:

“You was a dream in those pink pa-
