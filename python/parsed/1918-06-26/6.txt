Twelve Prize Winning Orig-
inals and 100 Others to

NEBRASKA WANTS THEM,

Art Critic of State University !
at Lincoln Makes First
Request.

An important event tn connection with
the ship poster competition of the na-
tional service section of the United
States Shipping Board Emergency Fleet
Corporation, will be an exhibition of the
twelve prize winners and 100 more #e-
lected entries, soon after tho judges
make their awnrds in the four divisions.

Tt will be held in New York city ata
place to be announced later. The com-
mittee in charge of the contest, which
{a being conducted through Tis Scn, is
Anxious to give as many people as pos-
aible a chance to see the originals, and
with this idea in view is planning to
have further exhibitions in lbraries and
museums in other big cities throughout
the country.

The art department of the State Uni-
versity, Lincoln, Neb., fa the firat in
the field to ask for an exhibition of
the posters, indicating an inland Btate’s
lively interest in the national programme
to speed up ahipbullding as well as a
keen interest in the work of American
artists.

Art Critic Makes Request

The requeat for the posters came yes-
terday from Miss Blanche C. Grant, art
critic of the university, who is visiting
in Taunton, Masa.

Miss Grant wrote: “Thank you for
the announcement of the competition
which waa sent to me in Lincoln, Neb.
I cannot be in this competition, I believe,
but I want to be the first, or among
the first, to ask if we cannot have the
exhibition of posters out in Lincoln at
the Art Gallery of the State University
where I happen to be art critic.

“The university gallery is a good place
for such an exhibition and we in the
middle West need that sort of exhibition,
I sincerely hope it may be arranged.
We shall be giad to have copies of the
posters which you wiil get out after the
competition closes. Those help a deal.
Seme of my advanced puplis have deen
competitors in other poster work.

“Please put us on the list of places
that want the exhibition and posters.”

Frederick W. Allen, who is doing
splendid work as State Director for
Greater New York of the National War
Savings Committee, is confident that the
ship posters, which will resuit from the
contest are going to be a mighty force in
pushing the work of the national service
aection in inducing shipyard workers to
back up Uncle Sam to the limit.

Expects Brilliant Results.

Mp. Allen sald yesterday afternoon:

“The National Service Section, United
States Bhipping Board Emergency Fleet
Corporation, 1 believe, will get apiendid
resulta from their ship poeter competi-
tion, as the poster competition which
was held under the auspices of the War
Savings Committee proved a great suc-
ceas, 2,400 drawings being submitted.
These drawings have been in constant
service in exhibita in various parts of
the city for some weeks,

“Pictures and illustrations convey
thoughts far more quickly than the
printed word, and theae competitions are
sure to bring forth many original con-
ceptions of any given eubject. Shipping,
with the great call for production in-
volved, lends itself particularly to a pos-
ter competition, and I belleve the results
will he very satisfactory.”

“The Bridge (of Ships) to Pershing.”
motion picturas of scenes in America’s
bustest shipyards, which Mr. Creel's
Committee on Public Information made
for Dr. Eaton's section, will be shown
at 2.30 o'clock thie afternoon in the au-

expect to enter the competition can learn
much of the wonderful activities now go-
Ing on at shipbuilding planta by a study
of the film.

The pictures will be taken to Brooklyn,
where they will be shown to-night to the
workers employed at the big plant of the
Morse Dry Dock and Repair Company.

CARDINAL ORDERS
MASS FOR VICTORY

Special Servites to Be Held
on Independence Day.

In a circular letter addressed to the
rectors of all the Roman Catholic
Churches in the New York archdiocese
Cardinal Farley recommends that a spe-
Gial mass be eaid in each church on
Independence Day “for the welfare of
our country and the victory of American
arms.”

The Cardinal writes as follows: “Our
people have given ample proof of the
quality cf their Americanism, but a eol-
emn declaration of their steadfast and
unqualified allegivnce to our dear land
befare God's altar cannot fail to inspire
and enthuse them. The war is begin-
ning to pinch

“It will call for great sacrifices of
men and means. <A loyal people will
bear such sacrifices cheerfully and will
support every measure proposed by the
national Government as necessary for
our defence.

“Loyalty, therefore, in the case of the
non-combatants means sacrifices that
the men who are fighting for us may
have suMcient munitions of war.

“Independence Day must have
year a more solemn signifieance. The
war if a new Ceclaration of America’s
freedom to be maintained at the cost of
considerable suffering and hardalip

“IT would recommend that ita ofmer-
vance have a inore religious character
than is usual and that a maas which the
people should be invited to attend he
celebrated in every church for the wel-
fare of our country and the victory of
American arms."

gossip which kept more than one group
of their friends up extraordinarily late
last night.

For, try as they would, the Broadway
friends of Mr. Edeson and Miss New-
combe were unable to penetrate the tnys-
tery either of their whereabouts or prea-
ent marital status further than tho rec-
ords of the City Clerk's office at Newark,
N. J., which stated boldly that George
Robert Edeson and Miss Mary New-
combe had obtained a marriage license
there on Monday.

In Newark the mystery was corre-

spondingly deep. When the license was
obtained the couple who got it jet slip
the !nformation that they Intended to
feturn there yeaterday to be married.
An expectant group awaited the promised
return far into last night, but there was
no return. And no one along Broadway
who considered themselves the very clos-
eat friende either of Miss Newcoinbe or
Mr. Exlervon would admit that they
had the aelightest information that Mr.
Edeson and Miss Newcombe were con-
templating marriage or whore they
might have secreted themselves since
the Newark license was obtained.

Edeson “Out of Town.’

When the license was issued Mr. Ede-

gon, who does not use the name George
in hie theatre appearances, gave his ad-
drese as 1 West Sixty-seventh street,
t which ts the Hotel Des Artistes. There it
waa explained Mr. Edeson was “out of
town for a few days,” but that nothing,
absoiutely nothing, had been heard of his
intention of getting marricd. Miss New-
combe's residence here could not be lo-
cated any more succesafully than could
the lady hersel¢.

Interest in the marriage of Mr. Edeson
was intensified because the final decres
of divorce obtained by his second wife,
Mra, George-Kiiot Porter Edeson, was
signed only on June 4. They had been
married aince 1908, his first wife, who
i was Ellen Berg. the actress, who played
with him tn “Soldiers of Fortune,’ hav-
ing died some time earlier. Apparently
i Mr Edeson's union with Miss Neweombe,

If it had been solemnized, fs a romance
of the stage.

The second Mra Edeson, who still oe-
cupies the Edeson country place, Strong-
heart House, at North Haven, L. 1., sald
{there jant night that she had not heard
of the Intention of her former husband
to remarry.

“T recetved a letter from him only to-
night,” the former Mre Edegon said,
“but he menttoned nothing of that.”

“Do you know who Miss Newcombe
is’ Mrs. Edeson was asked

“Oh, yes.” was the peply "she {fe
a yvoung woman tn whom Mr Edeson

j Was Interested I believe he put her on
the stage. I don’t Know much else about
her, or where she may have come from.”

Divorce Papers Sealed.

The papere !n Mrs. Edeson's divorce
sult were sealed. Mrs, Edeson said
Strongheart Houwe was her property
and that she was living thera with
her daughter, Roberta Edeson, who
is & years old. Strongheart House re-
ceived its name froin the play tn which
Mr. Exdleson made one of his greatest
etage successes,

Mr. Edeson now fa about 50 vears
old. Miss Neweombe !a only about half
hie age. In “Sick-a-Bed" she scored a
distinct success as Constance Wreme.
She played two years ago as a member
of Mr. Edeson’s company in “His
| Brother's Keeper.’ a play which Mr
Kideson also wrote. Hecently Mr. Ede-
son has been apeparing in motion pie-
tures and in vaudeville. and a few weeks
ago tried out @ new play, “Liberty Gun,”
at Atlantle City, in which, it is under-
stood, he will open in this city in Sep-
tember.

In the application for the marriage

DIES HERE AT 81

Chairman of Phelps-Dodge
Corporation and Author-
ity on Mining.

DOCTOR AND PREACHER

Abandoned These Professions
to Develop His Company’s
Properties.

Dr. James Douglas, well known au-
thority on mining and metallurgy, phi-
lanthropist and historian and chairman
of the board of the Phelps-Dodge Cor-
poration, copper producers, died ay his
Spuyten Duyvil home yesterday, aged 81
years,

Funeral services will he held in the

| Church of the Mediator, 281st street ard

Kingsbridge avenue, at 4 o'clock this
afternoon. The body will be taken to
Quetec, where services will be held in
St. Andrew's Church at 10 o'clock Fri-
day morning, preceding burial in the
family plot,

James Douglas was born at Quebec,
Canada, November 4, 1837. He was the
son of Dr. James Douglas, a prominent

surgéon In the Dominion, who Introduced
the modern treatment of {nsanity into
Canada when he founded the Quebec
Lunatic Asylum.

Young Douglas followed in the foot-
steps of his father and studied medicine
in Canada and abroad. He waa grad-
uated from Queens University in the
Dominion, studied medicine at Laval
University and later was professor of
chemistry at Morrin College, Quebec.

After studying medicine for some
years young Douglas decided that he
was not enthralled with the profession
and began the study of theology, going
to the University of Edinburgh, Scot-
land.

Receives License to Preach.

In 1875 Dr. Douglas, who received his
icense to preach, but Waa not ordained,
returned to Canada to retrieve his
father’s fortune which had been lost
chiefly in mining investments, For a
time he managed the lunatic asylum In
Quebee which was founded by his father,
but because of the elder Douglas's faith
'n mining the younger did not keep at
his somewhat sedentary position long.

In the same year he went to the Har-
vey HI!!! mines tn southern Canada and
beran the practical study of mining.
metallurgy and chemistry on the ground
itself,

After a short experience fn that dis-
Dr. Douglas ‘eft Canada to take
charge of the metallurgical work of the
Chemical Copper Campany, which was
then operating in Pharnixville, Pa. This
concern was &pecializing in the extrac-
tion of copper from the iron ores of the
Jones mine,

Avallable ore supplies soon were ex-
hausted and lr, Douglas turned his at-
tention to copper matte from the West-
érn districts, It was this company which
was the first to separate, on a paying
basis, precious métals from copper matte
by the electrolytle process,

In 1880 Dr. Douglas left Pheenixville
and journeyed to the frontier towns of
Arizona. A year later found him operat-
ing for the late William FE. Dodge and
the late 1D. Willis James of the old firm
of Phelps, Dodge & Co. About this time
he located many copper claims in the
Warren mining district In addition to

| copper mines at Morenci, Ariz., for these

interests

In a few years Dr. Douglas had devel-
oped these properties to the point of
productlon, and they were absorbed by
f& new organiazation, the Copper Queen
Consolidated Mining Company, of which
Dr Douglas became president.

Under his direction this group of mines
prospered, and railroads were built con-
necting the famous copper mining town
of Bisbee, Ariz, with the inain line of
the Southern Pacific Railroad.

Many Properties Acquired.

As time went on new properties were
in which Tor
igias was the active head Among
them were the Detroit: Copper Min
Company, the United Globe Mines, the
Montezuma Copper Company in Mexico,
the Commercial Mining Company, the
Burro Mountain Copper Company and
the Stag Canyon Fuel Company. These
ties were taken over in 1908 by
Phelps, Dodge & Co,, of which Dr, Doug-
las was president.

The rallroads which were built in con-
nection with the development of thease
een
combined under the title of the El Paso
and Southwestern Railroad Company,
which operates more than a thousand
Dr.
Douglas was president of this road at
the thne of his death,

It was during the administration of

Douglas that the annual production
of copper by the Phelps-Dodre Corpora-
tien, of which he was chairman of the
bourd of directors, jumped from a com-
paratively low figure to the astonishing
amount of approximately 155,000,000
pounds,

Dr. Douglas was the author of sev-
eral books. Among them were “Ca-
nadian Independence,” “Quebec in the
Century,” “New England
New France’ and “Journals and
