|BELGIAN LIVING COST
UP 600 PER CENT.

Laboring Class Is on Verge of |
Starvation.

 

 

Special Cable Despatch to Tax SUN from the
London Times.
Copyright, 1918; all rights reserved.

Tue Haaue, June 25.—A lawyer of
Brussels, who recently escaped from the
country, says the cost of living in Bel-
gium has increased 600 per cent. under
Germarf administration, as the Germans
requisition nearly everything. Rich peo-
ple are spending their capital, the middle
class is completely ruined, while the
laboring class, which {s mainly unem-
ployed, is on the verge of starvation and
ia dependent upon outside relief.

Most of the inhabitants of Belgium
have lost a quarter of their weight,

tuberculosis has increased 100 per cent.
and the mortality has more than doubled.
A ton of coal in Brussels sells for $50.
The Germans are looking after their
Flemish activist friends, but the sepa-
ratist movement has made little head-
way. The people laugh at the German
controlled Flemish newspapers and still
feel confident of victory by the Allies,

Two workmen who sent a message by
pigeon to the Allies’ lines were shot
recently in Mainault province. Only 30
per cent. of the men who try to escape
reach neutral eoil, ’ Often they prefer
being shot at on the frontier to being
arrested at home.

Some prominent men have had won-
derful escapes. The secret police, which
is composed mainly of German Jews
and commercial agents, are very active,
The prisons at Tournal, Antwerp and
Charlerot have been converted into tor-
ture chambers; several victims at Ant-
werp have gone mad. The treatment of
those condemned to deportation is
ehocking.

 

DR. BAYNE IN FOE PRISON.

Thought Dead, Held in Germany.

WASHINGTON, June 25.—Dr, J. Breck-
inridge Bayne, a Washington physician
who had been believed to be dead by
his family since last September, is safe
in a German prison camp. A letter,
dated March 15 and bearing a Bucha-

Dr. Bayne had been serving with the
British Red Crdss and no news had been
received from him since September, when
the Germans invaded Rumania, The
hospital staff fled, but Dr. Bayne re-
mained behind to attend the wounded
and was taken prisoner by the Germans,
Some of his personal effects later were

WAS BRILLIANT SOLDIER

 

Wrote Betrothed He and An-

other Officer Had Devised
New Attack.

 

Lieut. James B. Scarr of Hasbrouck
Heights, N. J., son of James 21. Scarr,
head of the New York Weather Bureau,
wae killed In action in France June 6,
according to a telegram received by his
father yesterday from the Waf Depart-
ment.

Lieut. Scarr took an examination for
appointment as Second Lieutenant in
the Regular Army iin April, 1917, im-
mediately after war was declared. He
had had four years military training
in the Cadet Corps of Rutgers College
and was captain of the corps when he
Sraduated in 1916. His aptitude for
nilitary work caused his instructof,
Lieut. S. C. Leisure, to advise him to
take it up as a profession.

Lieut. Scarr entered the Reserve
Officers’ Training Camp at Fort Myer,
Va, but just before the course
was finished he was appointed a pro-
viaional Second Lieutenant in the Reg-

ular Army and assigned to the Thirtieth
Infantry of the Third Division at Syra-
cuse. In November he was appointed
First Lieutenant and made battalion
adjutant and intelligence officer. With
other commissioned men he went to
France before his division, arriving there
the first week in March. When the divi-
sion arrived he became division censor.

Made High Record in Training.

An unusual record was made by him
in a training school back of the lines
and he was graduated with an average
of 98 per cent. for the course, being es-
pecially recommended for appointment
as an instructor.

While he was fn the school he was
sent to the front line for ten days for
observation work.

“His latest letter was dated May 6,"
his father said yesterday. ‘He wrote
me he was instructing 200 men for spe-
cial work, but could not tell what it
wae. I imagine those men were detailed
to him for intelligence work. I have
asked the War Department for further
details and I suppose we will get them.”

Mr. Scarr believes his son may have

died in demonstrating a new pian of
attack, which he and another officer had
originated.: Lieut. Scarr told of the idea
in a letter to his flancee, Miss Grace
Webb, daughter of Mayor and te, |
George H. Webb of Hasbrouck Helene
N. J. The letter was written May 30
seven days before Lieut. Scarr was|
killed and in {t he said:

“A Captain and I have figured out a
new and entirely different plan of attack
and to-morrow we expect to take it per-
sonally to some high officers for con- |
sideration. It is a great plan and if |
they accept it I eee the war ending in|
short order.”

Lieut. Scarr's attitude toward the war
is expressed, his father said, in a clip-
ping enclosed in his last letter to his
parents. It was:

God, Who gavest men eyes to see a dream;

RE Ra SODA OS Dn nnn Un EEL eee Dn Lee SS

God, Who gaveat men hearts to follow the
ean f |

God, Who gavest men stars to find heaven
by

God, W ‘ho madest men glad at need to die;

Lord, from the hills again we hear the)
drum;

God, Who lovest free men, lead on—we
come.

Mr, Searr's other son, Lieut. Francis

J. Searr, is aid-de-camp to Major-Gen. |

Farnsworth, commander of the Thirty-
seventh Division of the National Guard.

Born in Kansas 25 Years Ago.

Lieut. James Scarr was born in Hollis,
Kan., February 17, 1893. The Scarr |
family came to the vicinity of New York
In 1910 from Florida. The Lieutenant |
graduated from Hackensack High!
School. He was a brilliant oritor in his
college years, being a member of the
Rutgers Debating Team for four years,
which ia thought to be a record. Many
{pr izes and honors were won by him in-
cluding basketball and other team
I. iumerals, He was a member of Delta
Epsilon fraternity.

When he graduated
came a teacher in the Hasbrouck
Heights High School. Under him ath-
letics reached their high water mark.

Private Andrew Freeman, 24 years
old, whose name appears among those
reported as severely wounded, made his
home with his sister, Mrs. Pauline El-
lenbogen of 500 East 163d street.

Mrs. Ellenbogen said yesterday that
her parents had come to this country
from Austria when their children were
young. Both parents became American
citizens.

She said her brother Andrew, a ma-
chinist, had enlisted in March, 1917, in

bogen said this was the second time he
had been wounded. The first time was
in December, 1917, but after being in
the hospital for a month he was re-
turned to the firing line.

In his letters from the front Private
Freeman said that he liked the war
game very much; that there was lots of
excitement and ‘that the bullets were
flying over one’s head continually, but
that one didn't mind that any more.
His most recent letter, dated May 28,
was received here yesterday, Mrs, Ellen-
bogen said, In it he had informed her
of certain allotments of money he had
made and of an insurance policy he had
taken out, adding, ‘So that if I should
lose out you will have something.”

Has Brother in Austrian Army.

Private Freeman has a brother, Max,
34 years old, who was in Austria at the
outbreak of the war in 1914 and who,
although he was an American citizen,
was pressed into the Austrian army. He
went there on a trip arranged by a union
of which he was a member, and while
visiting his native town met a young
woman whom he married.

According to Mrs, Ellenbogen there ts
still a third brother, Benjamin, 28, who
was drafted April 28 and is now serving
with a base hospital somewhere in
Georgia.

Joseph Leites, 26, mentioned in yes-
terday's casualty list as killed in action
in France May 28, lived with his aunt,
Mrs. Rebecca Splegel, at 82 Ridge atreet.
He had seen service in the army and
reenlisted when the war broke out. Be-
ing an expert marksman he was imme-
diately sent to France. His aunt is in|

George M. Davis of New Rochelle was

otified by the Red Cross to-day that his
aon, Lieut. George Moulton Davis, has
been wounded and gassed and is suffer-
ing from shell shock. A letter written
from a French hospital June & by the
Lieutenant describes the attack in which
he was injured.

He was directing the flre of his com-
pany of the Twenty-sixth Infantry in
the Toul sector when a shell etruck
within ten feet of him, inflicting body
wounds and tearing away a portion of
his gas mask. He continued the attack
until ordered to the rear. The Lieuten-
ant said that he was concerned only
about the effects of shell shock. He
wrote that he would be all right shortly
and back on the line. Lieut. Davis is
23 years old and was commissioned
from the second Plattsburg camp. He
was a senior at Dartmouth.

Special Despatch to Tur Scx.
WASHINGTON, June 25. — Satisfaction

ov.
over the news of a prospective parley

‘ between American and German repre-

sentatives at Berne, Switzerland, to dis-
cuss ways of ameliorating the condition
and treatment of American prisoners of
held in German was
pressed here by
and agencies to-day. The
is tentatively scheduled ft
August 5S and is in response to repre-
sentations made through Spanish diplo-

camps ex-

vr

| matic channels.

The action is looked upon as opening

| the way for bettering the treatment of
| | Prisoners held in Germany and eliminat-

ing much of the suffertng in the camps
that has been reported through neutral
| channels. The proposal has been made
by this Government that a Swiss com-
mission visit the camps in Germany
where Americans are held to determine
which of the soldiers may be classed as
invalids and released for internment in
Switzerland for the rest of the war.
Similar privileges are proposed in con-
nection with the enemy aliens who are
held in the internment camps in this
country.

Since the capture of the first Ameri- |

cans by the Germans relief work in the
prison camps there has been carried on
through Swiss channels. A supply depot
was established in Berne by the Ameri-
can Red Cross and weekly allotments of
food, clothing, soap and other comforts
have been sent to them. By this chan-
nel also packages from the homes of
men in this country have been delivered
to them.

The hope is expressed here that the
Berne parley may result in the appoint-
ment of a commission from neutral na-
tions which will look after the condition
of the prisoners in all of the countries
at war and bring an end to the cruelties
and needless sufferings to which the men
have been subjected.

Lloyd George Wants Action.

Premier Lloyd George urged the need
of settling the Irish problem hecause it
was increasing the diff}jculties not merely
of the British Government, but the dif-
ficulties of the United States Govern-
ment in conducting the war.

Ex-Premier Asquith again appealed to
the Government to refer the Irish ques-
tion to the Dominions conference.

Mr. Lloyd George appealed to Sir
Edward Carson to show the same spirit
he displayed two years ago and subse-
quently “in using his very great abili-
ties and unrivalled influence in Ulster
to try to obtain some measure looking
to the willing assent of the Irish people
to imperial unity.”

The Government, he said, stood by
the policy it had proclaimed on April 9,
but in the method of administering it
the Government must be advised by the
men it had entrusted with the admin-
istration.

Mr. Lloyd George sald that the Irish
problem was the most baffling that had
ever come under the consideration of the
Government or of Parliament. It had
baffled many Governments that had
more time to consider it than the pres-
ent one. It was causing much difficulty
and perplexity to a Government charged
with the most tremendous responsibility
ever imposed on any Government in
Great Britain. The problem was low
without having
the full assent of its people.

The Premier said he did not believe
it beyond the capacity of Parliament to
carry through a measure of home rule
for Ireland which would deal justly and

lequitably with the legitimate objections

of a large part of the Irish community.

Dealing with the evidence on the con-
spiracy, Mr. Lloyd George said it was
the same evidence that was adduced in
1916. It was lost for some time
then recovered. The Government real-
ized the significance of what was going
on, It would be quite impossible to pub-
lish the character of the evidence, but
there was no doubt in the mind of any
one who had examined it that there ex-
isted a very serious conspiracy in which
powerful people in Ireland were en-
gaged in an effort to subvert British rule
in Ireland,

The difference this made, the Pre-
was that the atmosphere
of assent which was growing inside
Ireland and in Parliament was disturbed,

thought that was one of the most fata!
mistakes the Church had committed and
believed every member of the Chureh

side Ireland, felt it was a mistake and
Wished to dissociate themselves from it.

Lioyd George said it would be an act

 

 

of folly to try to force home rule
through under these conditions, and
until the existing attitude was removed.
He regarded the action of the Sinn Fein-
ers and others concerned in the plot in
attempting to deal a deadly blow at

the British Empire at a moment of great

peril by challenging the whole su-
premacy of the British Parliament as
the deadliest blow to the liberties of

Ireland that had been dealt in his time.

He added that he still was hopeful of
the restoration of conditions in Ireland
which would recreate the conciliatory
apirit which at one time dominated all
parties in England and Ireland, ‘‘that
we should be able to secure a settle-
ment of the problem during the war."

The Allies were fighting for the prin-
ciple for which Ireland has struggled,
he said, and he hoped Treland was pre-
pared voluntarily to take her share in
the struggle at any time. It was the
duty of the Government first of all, be-
fore it took any further action in the
matter, to see that Ireland had the op-
portunity of entering the struggle volun-
