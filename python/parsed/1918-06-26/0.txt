AMSTERDAM, Jane 25.—Speaking in |

for Count von Hertiing said: |

“I sald that these four potats of Prest- |
dent Wilson micht possibly form the
hasts of a general world peace. No ute.
terance of President Wilson whatever |
followed this, so that there is no ebject |
fn spinning uny further the threads

“There is still less object now, after ,
statements since then have reached us, |
especially from Amerten. These state-
ments, indeed, made ft really clear what |
{s to be understood—a peace lengue of
peoples, or a league of peoples for the |
maintenance of freedem and justice.”

 

'
|
AMSTEROAM, June 25.—Germany’s war |
and peace aims were briefly set forth
the idea that she desired to secure world |
domination through the war disclaimed, |
and the responsibility for the conflict ,
Primarily placed upon Russia, by Dr
Richard von Kuehlmann, the German
Foreign Secretary, in a speech to the
Reichstag in Berlin yesterday.

While declaring that what was de-
sired for the German people and their |
allies was “a free, strong, independent |
existence” within the boundaries drawn
for them “by history,” the Foreign Sec-
retary aaid Germany would have to de-
cline to make any prior concessions by
stating her position as to Belgium in
a way which would bind her without
similarly binding Germany's enemies.

With reference to the peace question
Dr. von Kuehimann quoted from former
Premier Asquith's speech of May 16 in
which he said that the British Govern-
ment would not turn a deaf ear to a
peace proposal if it was not couched in
ambiguous terms,

“We likewise can make the same
declaration,” added the Foreign Secre-
tary, “knowing it to be also our policy.

“Once the moment arrives—when, I
care not to prophesy—that the nations
which are at present locked in battle
will exchange peace views, one of the
preliminary conditions must be certain
degrees of mutual confidence in each
other's honesty and chivalry.

“For so long,” continued Dr. von
Kuehlmann, “as every overture is re-
garded by others as a peace offensive—
as a trap or as something false for the
purpose of sowing disunion between
allies; so long as every attempt at a
rapprochement is at once violently de-
nounced by the enemies of a rapproche-
ment in the various countries, so long
will it be impossible to see how any
exchange of ideas leading to peace can
be begun.

Military Decision Hopeless.

“In view of the magnitude of this
war and the number of Powers, includ-
ing those from overseas, that are en-
gaged, its end can hardly be expected
through purely military decisions alone
and without recourse to diplomatic nego-
tlations,

“Our position on.the battlefields, our
enormous military resources, the situa-
tlon and the determination at home per-
us to use such language. We hope
our enemies perceive that In view of our
resources the {dea of victory for the
Entente is a dream.”

teferring to the responsibility for the
war, as he viewed it, Dr, von Kuehl-
mann said;

“Il do not believe any responsible man
in Germany, not even the Emperor or
the members of the Impertal Govern-
. ever for a moment belleved they
could win the domination of Europe by
Sarting this war. The idea of world
domination in Europe is Utopian, as was
proved by Napoleon.”

After declaring that the revelations
‘hat had been made showed Russia as
the Power which planned and desired |
the war, with France abetting her and
England's attitude strengthening the
Russian desire for conflict, Dr. von Kuehl-
mann again declared that Germany had
not entertained any bellef that this war
could lead even to the domination of
Furope and much less that of the world.

In introducing his statement of the
German war aims the Foreign Minister
said:

“I consider it necessary to say quite
kimply, and In a way easy for all to un-
derstand, what our positive desires are.

Japan to Keep Out of
Siberia Until Menaced

By the Associated Press.

TOKIO, June 21, delayed.—

The newspapers to-day report
that as a result of the delibera-
tions of the advisory board on
diplomatic affairs, Japan has de-
cided not to comply with the re-
quest of the Entente and to re-
frain from intervention in Siberia
at present.

In diplomatic circles it is be-
lieved that Japan, unless directly
menaced, will not act without
the support of the United States.

LONDON, June 26.—The em-
bargo on Chinese action in
Siberia has beerraised, accord-
ing to a Harbin despatch to the
Daily Mail. The reason given
for this action is that Russia is
taking no steps to prevent the
Germans from advancing in the
East. {

GERMAN RAIDER SEEN
IN WATERS NEAR U. S.|

Incoming Skippers Tell of |

Heavily Armed Ship. |

 

Nonro.k, June 25.—Reports of the
presence of a fast and heavily armed
German raider in West Indian waters
were brought here to-day by masters of
vessels arriving from Central and South
America. The ship ts said to be of the |
cruiser type, with a rakish build and!
clean lines, \

The raider first made her appearance
200 miles east of Hamilton, Bermuda,
where she is reported to have sunk a
large British steamship. Two American
merchant ships were shelled, but man-
aged to escape.

The fact that the raider made no ef- |
fort to attack at least two vessels which |
sighted her led the captains to believe;
that she !s 2 mother ship for submerines
which recently were operating off the|
Atlantic coast.

The raider was described by the ship
captains as about 270 feet long, with a
speed estimated at from fifteen to twenty
knots an hour, Some of those who |
sighted the craft expressed the belief |
that she was a former fruit steamer |
plying between the United States and
Central America, which had been cap-
tured and armed by one of the sub-
marines operating off the coast. In their
opinion, the vessel was manned by some |
of the seventy-odd men reported to have
been in the crew of one of the sub-

marines.

 

WASHINGTON, June 25.—At the Navy
Department to-night it was sald that
no report of a raider in West Indian
waters or on this side of the Atlantic
had been received at the Department.
It was regarded as possible that ~_
raider might have slipped through the -
naval cordon around the North Sea or
that a steamship captured by a sub-
marine had been armed,

Spectal Despatch to Tue Sc.

Wasittncton, June 25.—The extension
of the scope of the selective draft law
with a view to making all male citizens
of the United States between the ages
of 20 and 40 Hable to active military
service to-night seemed to be a wellnigh
certain result of the deliberations of the
Senate now considering the $12,000,000,-
060 army appropriation bill.

The proposal is largely in the nature
of a compromise. It was effected after
a spirited debate this afternoon in which
there developed a very apparent oppos!-
tion to material reduction of the agw
limite on sentimental and practical

grounds and a somewhat restricted but |

not very coherent objection to ralsing
the limit to 45. Out of the conflicting
views of the Senators the reasonableness
of the present proposal seemed to strike
a general reeponse, and as a compromise
the above mentioned limits are likely to

| be adopted after a little more discussion

to-morrow.

Includes Allies and Declarants.

The Senate first took under considera-
tion the amendment offered by Senator
Fall (N. M.) in which it was proposed
to raise the limits of the draftable ages
from the present 21 to 31 limits to the
limite belleved to have been preferred by
those Senators who favor putting prac-
tically the entire man power of the na-
tion under enrolment—18 to 45. The
day’s debate dealt with these age Mmit
Qgures, but at +ts conclusion Senator
Hitcheeck (Neb.) presefted the follow-
ing substitute for the Fall amendment:

“Such draftias herein provided shall
be based upon lHability to military ser-
vice of all male citizens between the
ages of 20 and 40 years, both Inciusive,
and also such male residents of the
United States as are the nationals of
countries cobelligerent with the United
States in the present war or are the
nationals of countries neutral in the
present war and have declared their
intention to become citizens and falled
to assert any claim to immunity as for-
eign nationals; provided, however, if
such claim to immunity is asserted it
shall be recognized and shall operate as
a withdrawal and cancellation of the
declaration to become an American citi-
zen and the individual shall forever be
debarred from becoming one.”

Senator Hitchcock informed his fel-
lows that the proposed compromise had
been submitted to various Senators of
divergent views and that it had seemed
to them an acceptable solution of the
difficulties which beset the 18 to 45 prop-
osition, ~

Wadsworth Urges Action.

There was in the early part of the
debate evidence that the Senate was
feeling its way, but as the discussion
progressed {t became clear that although
there was certain opposition to the exact
terms of the Fall amendment an over-

| whelming majority of the Senate real-

ized that changes in the draft law were
necessary to avoid the extension of the
draft through the classes now under
enrolment, which would have dragged
men of draft age with dependent fam-
ilies into the army at great cost to the
nation in efficiency, the comfort and
happiness of families and the disruption
of essential industries.

WasuinctTon, Jure 25. —- President
Wilson may have an announcement of

pressing problems of the war—will be
uppermost in the President's mind

Meanwhile reports that definite action
of a military character is about to be
undertaken {in Siberia or elsewhere in
Russia are characterized authoritatively
as without basis, or at least as prema-
ture. The possibility of such a military
enterprise depends primarily on the
wishes of the Russian people. Up to
the present, from the viewpoint of this
Government, there has been no convine-
ing evidence that the Russians want

Hints at Executions “if Neces-

Lonpon, June —Edward Shortt,
Chief Secretary for Ireland, speaking in

 

or

|
|

the House that the German plot In Ire-|
land was a real and imminent danger to |
this country. |

He said he was satisfied that both the,

clergy and the Nationalists had used!
their influence to assist in keeping the
peace, |

Secretary Shortt sald the Government
had found that Germany was in touch
with Ireland, and that not only were
messages going to Ireland from a Ger-
man source but that they were going

'frorn Ireland from Irish sources to Ger-

many. '

The collapsible boat in which a man, )
now a prisoner, landed in Ireland from
a submarine, Mr. Shortt said, was made
of wanvas similar to that made at Han-
over before the war.

Mr. Shortt said the Government knew :
that in a certain port of Germany a
large Amount of ammunition was loaded
into a German submarine, and that sub-
marines had been seen in localities
where the destruction of shipping could
not have been their object.

Two Causes for Change.

Mr. Shortt said that since the Pre-
mier had announced the Government's
policy with regard to Ireland circum-
stances had entirely changed, there being
two main causes. The first and most
far reaching cause, he said, was the die-
covery of a German plot in Ireland.

In addition there was the fact that the
feeling in Ireland against conacription
and the movement which necessarily
followed that feeling had been used by
the extremists in a physical movement
tu conjunction with the German pict. |

The speaker said he did not for aj|
moment say that any substantial pro- |
portion of those in Ireland who were
opposed to conscription had any knowl. |
cuge that they were being used to fur- |
ther a German plot '

Mr. Shortt eaid that Sinn Feiners |
had been captured im tne ant.-conserip- |
tion movement. It hati been declared |
that the German plot was a bogus plot
trtended to injure Ireland, but he re-
gretied to say that there was no need
for invention, for the plot was a fact.
When he and Viscount French went to
Ireland, Mr, Shortt continued, they
found the reappearance of seditious
propaganda in the form of poems, pam-
phlets and notices posted on walis in-
citing the people to afd any (ierman

German Gold in Evidence.
“Any straw and fodder taken by the!
German army.” Mr. Shortt said one of |
these postera read, “will be paid for by |
Germany.” i
Mr. Shortt quoted excerpts from many |
speeches that had been delivered urging |
iMegafl drilling for the purpose of aesist- |

jing Germany, and said the sources of |

information upon which the Government |
relied to show German intrigue existed,
both {n Ireland and outside had always |
proved true when tested by subsequent |
events. i

He said he had traced the activity of):
German agents in Ireland from 1911 andj
asserted that at the beginning of the!
War a pamphlet entitled “Ireland, Ger- |
many and the Freedom of the Seas" had)
been in citculation in Ireland, It bore!
evidence of being German printed, and

i for the last three months had begun to|
; reappear in lreland, }

it was here, the speaker said, the Gov
ernment had found Germany was in|
touch with Ireland, and made reference |
to the collapsible boat in which the pris: |
oner in the Tower had landed, |

'
Prof, De Valera Involved. '

It was a vers peculiar coincidence, wr. |
Shortt continued, that upon Prof. Edward |
De Valera, member of Parliament fos |
Hast Clare and a prominent Sinn Feiner, |
was found the text of a letter written to/
him by another interned man which |
made allusion to something which was!
going to happen two monthe ofter the
German offensive began, and that De/
Valera was reminded that the two!
months would not be-up until the end of!
May.

Ronald MeNeill, Unionist,
speaker, asked: “Has
been shot?”

“No,” replied Mr
we are forced by those who call thems |
selves interned persons, we have no de- |
sire for any more executions. If wel

otherwise the respongibilits will be upon |

Parts, June 25.—The defeat of the
Austrians in Italy is taking on more
and more the character of a disaster
for the Central Empires. The Ital-
jans and their allies, the French and
British contingents, are now taking
the offensive on the difficult northern
front and to-day made material gains
not only on the Asiago plateau but
also to the east, in the Monte Grappa
and Monte Asolone fegions.

On the Piave the last rear guard of

,the Austrians has been compelled to
‘surrender, and the entire west bank

has been reoccupied by the Italians,
who, moreover, have crossed the river

Wasiisaton, June 25.—- News from
Italy to-day, while conffrming the great
victory won by the Italians in hurling
the Austrian army across the Piave in
disorganized retreat, threw little addi-
tional Nght upon the extent of the dis-
aster to the enemy. Until figures are
available showing more fully the logs to!
the Dual Monarchy in men and material, |
officials here hesitated to form opinions:
as to the probable effect the defeat will
have on the whole military situation... ~.4

On the face of the latest news from |
the Italian front. it appearedsio many |
observers that the Austrian army, @@ an|
offensive weapon, is not to be serfously }
considered for months to come = It will]
take tire to repair the damage to morale '
and equipment, even ff the internal situa-
tion produced by shortage of food among
the civilan population does not further
cripple Austria's military power. The
Dual Monarchy by itself is beileved here
to be out of the fighting for the summer. }

What Germany plans to do or will be!
able to do to aid her chief ally is another |
matter. As yet there is no sign of a}

Italian front. Unless such a movement!

here are convinced that it will mean that |
Germany intends to seek to save the ase)
uation by attempting at once to com-
plete her offensive projects in France. |
