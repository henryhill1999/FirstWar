run up to the ninth inning here to-day,

the Phillies banged out two runs, win-

dropped back to seventh place.

It was a tough game for the old Phila-
delphia favorite to toma away, as Jack
seldom pitched a better game in his
Ppalmy days at Shibe Park when his
speed made him one of the most feared
pitchers in the American League.

RED SOX SLUGGERS |
TURN ON YANKEES

Ruth Hits Ninth Homer—
Boston Retains Lead by Beat-
ing Locals by 7 to 3.

|

 

By FREDERICK G. LIEB,

Murderers’ Row of the Yankees was
outmurdered on the Polo Grounds yes-
terday by sundry gentlemen on the Bos-
ton Red Sox. It might not be amiss to
say that the Bean Boys electrocuted
("the Row,” with big, burly Babe Ruth
‘turning on the juice. One of Babe's
famous homers started Boston off to a
fine lead in the first inning, and there-
after the lads from the Hub had fairly
smooth sailing. They won the second
tiff of the exciting series by a score of
7 to 3.

It was the first time a New York team
has bowed to the superior prowess of a
Boston club on the Polo lawn this sea-
eon. The defeat epolled the chance of
the Yankees to snatch the lead. To
emerge from the series in first place
they must win two games, in which they
must defeat Mays and Ruth.

Ruth was back tn the Boston outfield |
yesterday, because Amos Strunk |
sprained an ankle in Monday's game
It didn't take long for Rabe to start,
firing. With two out in the first inning |
Whiteman rapped a aingie to left, bring-
ing up Big Babe. He connected with |
the first ball and drove it into an up-
stairs box for a home run. All his |
home runs made in New York have gone
into the upper stand. It was the ninth)
home run Ruth has made this year and |
his third on the Polo Grounds this |
spring. As he appeared in only three |
games in Harlem he has a record of one
home run for each game he has played
here.

jumped their contracts. They know that their futures are wrapped up|
entirely with organized baseball, and those who feel that they still have }
several years of efficiency in their arms dare not make the change. In|

CLOSE FINISHES IN
RACES AT AQUEDUCT

Three Events Decided by
Small Margins—Fleeing

Sheik Wins Stake.

tacegoers at the Aqueduct track yes-
terday saw some of the best contests of
the year, Although there were no cham-
pions competing, all of the events were
well filled and resulted jn stirring
finishes. In the last three events only

the margin of inches decided the wine
ner,

The feature of the card was the Cas
narsie Selling Stakes for two-year-olds
over the five furlong course. It went to
George W. Loft's Fleeing Sheik. This
son of Delhi and Runaway Girl gave
away big lumps of weight to his oppo-
nents and won like a real nice colt. At
the end of the journey he was a length in
front of Blairgowrie, which took place
honors, four lengths ahead of The Boy.

It was Fleeing Shetk’s third consecus
tive victory and despite the fact that he
had defeated practically the same fleid
at Jamaica last week, he was made secs
ond choice to PP. A. Clark's Lion d'Or,
When it came to race Fleeing Sheik was
ina class by himself. ie broke from tha
barrier on his toes and quickly opened
up a blg gap oon his opponents. At the
head of toe stretch Blainzowrie and
Vurling challenred, but the Loft colt
stood a long strive gamely and run rather

jeasily.

The fourth race, a handicap for mares
years old and upward, at
mile, was won by Joe Marrone's
Hanovia, a chestnut daughter of Fair
Play and Miss Hanover She defeated
eight of the best mares and fillies in
training, That she earned the honors
was due in great part to Jockey Rice.
He put up a Garrison finish and lifted
his mount past the judger, a scant head
in front of Dorcas. Hanovia travelled
ever the one mile route in the fast time
of 1:88 4-5,

Tn the fifth race Minto 17. won because
Jockey Bell ontrode the fashional pilot
Lawrence Lyke. Lyke had the leg on
Cadillac, From beginning to the end
of the one mile and a siateenth course
Minto and Cadillae raced head and
head. Fifteen yards from the finish Lyke
succeeded jin sticking Cadillac's nose fn
front, but Bell continued to work ener-
gellcally on Minto 11, and succeeded in
landing his mount home the victor by

 

two more tallies in the ninth. Zim} While none of the three are .390 hitters they are experienced fielders the smallest possible margin
