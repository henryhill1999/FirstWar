MISS TUCKER KEEPS
| UP DRIVE FOR FUND

Tireless Ragtime Queen Will
Take Part in Fete at
Farmer Oval.

   

 

PLANT SALE ON TO-DAY

Block Parties ‘to Help, Get
Smokes for “Over There”
Become a Fad.

 

Let no one imagine that Sophie
Tucker's party at the Shelburne Hotel,
Brighton Beach, Friday night, big as
that is going to be, will end her activ-
ities for Tus Sun Tobacco Fund. If
any one had such a thought he is a
pereon who doesn't know the Ragtime
Queen.

That party will wind up some time or
other in the early hours of Saturday
morning. On Saturday afternoon and
evening Miss Tucker, assisted by her
Five Kings of Syncopation, will do her
regular turn at the Bushwick Theatre
with all the encores that are sure to be
demanded. Sunday at 10:30 A. M. will
find her at Farmer Oval, Fresh Pond
road, Brooklyn, for its to be Sophie
Tucker—Five Kings of #yncopation—
Van and Schenck—Pennasylvania Red
Cape—SuNn Tobdacce Fund morning out
there.

The Van and Schenck baseball club is
going to play the Pennsylvania Red
Caps, the receipts coming to the fund.
Wvery person as he enters the gate will
receive an envelope on which to write
his name and address, so that he will
q@et postcards from the soldiers and IN
which to place contributions.

Bophie Tucker is to be mistress of
@eremonies. She and her kings will help
entertain, Van and Schenck will sing,
Allan Coogan wil! dance and the Twelfth
@reet Band of Manhattan has volun-
@eered to play between innings—not
Baseball, but brass instruments.

Van and Schenck, otherwise known as
the Pennant Battery Winners of Song
Land, also have offered their services
fer Mies Tucker's Shelburne party Fri-
@ay night. This gifted team is popular
with vaudeville audiences everywhere,
and they are tireleas fund boosters.
And besides them and the other volun-
teer performers whose names have al-
weady been published, these are some
@f the promised attractions:

Gaintiey and Norton, singers with
timmings, who will offer some new com-
edy songs, and the Watson Sisters, Fan-
ale and Kitty, who have a winning eong
and dance act. Both these pairs are at
@e Bushwick this week and Van and
@chenck are at the Palace.

Another Novel Feature.

And hete’s a real novelty. Mr. Der-
kin, director of Nerkin's famoes animal
act, one of the headliners on the Keith
circuit, ie going to put on exhibition at
the Shelburne a mamma monkey and
her week old baby, the cutest little, scrap
of near humanity ever seen. If costs
only a quarter to see this happy family,
and whoever desires to do so may drop
additional coina for soldiers’ amokes in a
nearby contribution box.

Friday night is certainly going to be
a great time for the women, for patriotic

Brooklyn has set a lively pace in block
parties for smokes, but Manhattan
doesn't propose to be outdone. The
Thomas M. Farley Association, sixty of
whose members are tn Uncle Sam's ber-
wice, is arranging to hold one Fourth
of July night in Sixty-second street be-
tween First and Second avenues, Alder-
man Tom Farley will be host in chief

tng films of the May party at which the
Alderman entertained 10,000 of his con-
atituents.

On the afternoon of the Fourth there
will be athletie games in Queensborough
Park, Fifty-ninth etreet and Avenue A,
and after patriotic speeches have been
made Alderman Farley will take up a
collection for the fund. For the evening

‘West First street, between Sheepshead
Bay road and Rallroad avenue, Coney
Island, will be the scene of a block party
next week. Michael Fass, chairman, and
Charles Rubins, vieeechairman of the
committee in charge, are preparing a
programme of dances, musical features
and speeches, and there will be auctions
of various articles, Fass, by the way,

COMMITS BIGAMY
10 AVOID DRAFT

Charles Lippman Tells Board
He Prefers Prison to Army
Service.

 

Charlies Lippman of 1124 Simpson
street, The Bronx, was indicted by the
Grand Jury yesterday for bigamy, ad-
mittedly committed to avoid the draft,
He told Solomon Tekulsky, Assistant
District Attosney, that he-praferred jail
to the army and deliberately committed
a felony, which under the seléctive ser-
vioe act: exempts him from military
duty. He wag arrested on Monday night
by Detective Chrystie and arraigned in
the First District Magistrate's Court.

According to Mr. Tekuisky about ten

years ago Lippman married Becky le-
vine. They have one child. He desetted
her early in 1917 and on May 15 of that
year married Sarah Rarlick in Newark,

N. J., with whom he lived at 122. St
Mark's place. ©n June 6, 1917, he rege
istered with Local Board No. 107 and

claimed exemption because of a wife de-
perdent on him for support. He made
a similar claim tn his questionnatre, but
the claim was disallowed as-his marriage
was obviously a slacker marriage.
According to the second wife when
Tdppman failed to gain exemption he
told her that he never worked and ex-
pected her to suport him, suggesting
that she lead a ilfe of shame for his
financial benefit. When-she refused he
demanded that she give him $200 #0 that
he..could flee te Canada ‘to cscape the
draft.
deserted her,

of bis second matrimonial yenture and
persuaded her to live with him again.
She accepted the offer on his promise to

remarry trer; and on Febuary’ 28 ‘last)

they were married in the marriage
license bureau by Deputy City Clerk
Cruse.

With the Newark and the New York
marriage certificates {in his possession
Lippman entered the offices of the local
board and, threwing the papers at the
officials there, calmly told them that he
had committed bigamy in onier to gain
exemption, The board thereupon ine
formed District Attorney Swann, who

speech given the most serious attention
was that of Henator Wadaworth (N. Y.). |
“As the Senators know,” said Mr. |
Wadswotth, “under the present system
of drafting men between the ages of
21 and 31. inclusive a.questionnaire has
been arranged under which the men
ltable to draft under the registration are
classified, and that in Clase 1 are placed
those men who are unmarried and also
those men, I think, who while married
aro not dependant upon by their fam-
dAjies in the slightest degree for support.
ik has been the ambition of the War
Department, as I understand it, to re-
crult the army of the United States from
men of Class 1. \
“A good deal of discussion has taken
place in the Jast few months as to the
sise of the army the United States must

drafting men between 80 and 40 who
had neither families nor dependents in
preference to the family man between
30 and 30, the fathers and providers.

That the compromise was even then
in the making was evident from the re-
marks which followed. Said Senator
Reed: “Now. the suggestion which I
have to make and which I may embody
in the form of an amendment is the pro-
priety of calling in the unmarried men
between 30 and 40 for military service
before we call upon the married men be-
tween 20 and 30 for military service.
When I say married men I mean those
whose families are dependent upon them.
I should like to get the Senator's opin-
fon upon that.”

| Wadsworth Woald Exempt Father

Benator Wadsworth repiied: “IT am
in entire aympathy with the Senator
from Missouri on that proposition, but
let me say to him that that is exactly
what the questionnaire system under
which all registrants are classified does,

} and that sanie questionnaire system and

that same cluissification would hold good
in ite operation among the men between
the ages of 21 and 40.

Senator Nelaon (Minn.), supporting
the general plan to raise the age limits,
told the Senate that the American civil
war was fought by boys from 17 years
cold upward. He added:

“If the Senators want an army that
can render efficient service, that can
stand the teat of warfare they will take
that basis from 16 to 3a or 45, I care
not which.

“To my mind after a man has passed |
40 years or at the utmost 4), he is of
little or no value to stand the test of
a campaign. Now let ue not be fooled
by any maudlin sentiment in thie mat-

powerful enemy and we shall need an
army and the beat kind of an army.

“If we extend the limit from 18 to

HARRIMAN NATIONAL BANK

Fifth Avenue and 44th Street
New York

Unredeemed Pledges

War has brought us face to face with the neces-
sity of sacrificing our cherished hit-or-miss method
of providing for Government expenses .by appro-
priation.

The platforms of both political parties prac-
tically committed them to the budget system. Why
not, then, let us have it? Apart from the fact that
it would eliminate extravagance, scandal and “pork,”
are we wise to accept financial guesses from public
servants who, not by particular fitness, but through
political fortune, have power to tax in the billions?

The estimated need of $24,000,000,000 this year
may, gauged by our previous experience, actually
turn out to be double or half. The budget system
would relieve the business mind of the worry and
irritation which it must undergo for the next
twelve months.

The Harriman National Bank is officially ad-
vised that proper budgetary action would result in
saving of hundreds of millions annually. More-
over, every bank is besieged by customers in a
quandary inquiring as to taxation that they may
properly order their merchandise and other com-
mitments. They are in forced ignorance and with-
out definite information, an anomalous position which
it is the obligation of the Government to relieve.

Every good housewife has a budget, and with the
economic and financial experts the Government has
assembled at Washington, it should not be difficult
to frame a budget system for the United States that
shall inform investors in the Government and tax-
payers of their exact financial status.
