Hundreds of Persons to Be
Penalized for Evasion.

WaAsuinoton, June 26.—The
harvest of taxes ever gathered by the fed.

With the expiration of the time for pay-
Ing excess profits and income assess-
ments without added penalties for de-
linquency.

Estimates placed the sum collected
from these sources at $2,775,000,000, and
exact figures probably will be known
next Monday or Tuesday. Almost a half
Dillion came in to-day from corporations
and other big taxpayers who postponed
payment as long as possible.

Payments not made to-day are sub-
ject to penalties of 6 per cent., with 1
ber cent. a month interest. Indications
were that the aggregate of delinquent
payments on returns filed would not be
large.

Hundreds of small business and pro-

failed to file returns or to make pay-

There was further Ilquidation in July,
but after opening at unchanged prices
the market steadied on the special San-
tos cable showing further advances of
100 to 150 reis in futures there and
closed net unchangel to three points
higher. The market had the appearance
of being sold out, as there wag littie
offering late in the day, and it is sald
that deliveries on the notices expected
to-day will go Into strong hands.

Coffee peaple here expressed surprise
at the ability of Brazil to advance prices
in the face of the tremendous stocks on
hand at the ports there and the large
amount of coffee still believed to be in
the interfor. ft is estimated that the
total crop of 1917-18, including all kinds,
will reach 22,000,000 bagr, one of the
largest evér grown, while the outlet has
been decidedly Hmited and Is still re-
stricted, with the freight situation even
to markets which remain open much
unsettled.

The local spot market was very dul!
and prices unchanged,

The morning cable from Brazil re-

Generally the trading in the market
for outside securities was quiet and un-

interesting yesterday. A few atrong

advances as a rule were limited to less
than a point. In the early part of the
session the independent oil etocks acted
better than on the previous day, but be-
