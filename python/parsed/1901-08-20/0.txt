either to-day or to-morrow by the issue of

noxious gases which had killed two of their
companions, Adam Kest and John Bugine,
two crib employees who had been given up
for dead, were rescued to-day alive. Their
eacape from death was miraculous. After
brave Plummer Jones had given up his
life in the fire accident last week in a vain
search of the tunnel for possible survivors,
the hunt for the missing men was aban-
doned. The waterworks officials gave it
out that no one, alive or dead, was left in
the tunnel

It was 2 o'clock this afternoon when
laborers cleaning away the débris at the
burned crib heard rappings upon the pipe
which conveyed air into the tunnel. They

had before him a number of the witnesses |

wh have previously testified Among
them were Capt. Flood, Sacgt. Shiels and
Wardman Dwyer of the Tenderloin station,

who signed the teatimony they had given

Fagar A. Whitney, the poolroom tipster,
was in the Juatioe’s chambers all the after-
noon About 4 o'clock he came out and took
a coat in the Special Seesions court room,
where a number of policemen and reporters
were sitting. He saauntered toward the door
leading out into the corridor, stopped when
he came to the policeman who was guarding
the exit, and asked that he be taken back to
the Tombs
“Are they through with you?” asked the
cop

“For to-day,” he said

A man who eaw him walking about the
room and did not hear him ask to be taken
back to the Tombs thought he must have
heen released on bail

*Who's on your bond?” he asked Whitney.

“I'm not on bail,” he replied. “I can get
bail whenever I want it, but I'd rather stay
where I am for awhile ”

Then he stuck his cigar rakishly in one
comer of hia mouth and went across the
Bridge of Sighs.

Justice Jerome was asked what was to
be done with the testimony. He answered
that it would al) be read ove? as soon as
1 wee signed and then a conclusion would
be reached by the District Attorney as to
the best method of procedure

IS THE MAYOR RE-ELIGIBLE?

Tammany Men Arguing the Potnt--No
Authoritative Anewer.

Since the adoption of the revised Charter
for this city there has been a good deal of
dispute among politicians over the question
whether the disqualification for reclection
imposed on the Mayor by the present Char
tr would apply to Mayor Van Wyck. The
Charter adopted in 1897 provides for a four-
year term for the Mayor and says that he
shall be ineligible for the succeeding term
The revised Charter aaye that the Mayor
shall be elected for a two-year term and puts
no limit on the number of terms he may
serve conmequaveny

Some of Mayor Van Wyck's friends hold
that although elected under a charter which

srovided against his reflection he is eligible
Be election to the term beginning on June
1. when the charter allowing a Mavor elected
under it to suceeed himself goes into effect
asa whole Others declare that he ie barred
The question has arisen several times and
ho authoritative answer to it has been given

As a matter of fact, the Mayor does not
wert a renomination. He wanta to go hack
t) the bench and in the Supreme Court Some
of the men who think Tammany will win
anyway want him to run for Mayor for a
vindication of the absentee landlord sys-
tem of municipal government

VOUNG LOVERS FLY TO JERSEY.

One Hour Wed When Papas Come and
Take Uride and Uridegreom Heme.
Monristownx, N J, Aug 10-— Wedded

and parted all within an hour. That is

the little drama of Arthur Smith and Anna

Marcella Peterson of New York. Arthur

is 2 and Anna l7. Their parents objected

to their marrying and they fled from the
metropolis to seek a dominie in New Jersey

They arrived here yesterday morning on

the 1010 train. Getting into.a carriage

they drove around town visiting the differ-
ent clergymen in the hope of getting one
to tie the knot. After many failures they
started for Mendham, eigit miles away,
where they soon found a minister willing
to perform the ceremony. A short time
later they registered at the Mendham Hotel
ae Mr and Mrs Arthur Smith. They were
ust receiving the co: tulations of a
ew farmers who were «sitting around the
hotel when a horse covered with foam
dashed up Two men leaped from the car-
riage and strode into the hostelry. They
were the fathers of the bride and bride-
room, Edward M. Smith and Richard
eterson, and they were in a towering «.

*Young man, come here,” roared Mr
Smith

“Young woman, come here,” shouted
Peterson

“But, papa, we're married,” faltered the
young couple, as they came tremblingly
orward

“Married, eh?” and Smith glowered on
his son, and, taking him by the ear, led him
to the carriage

“Married,” snorted Peterson aa he led
hie daughter to the other conveyance.

“It’sall your fault,” said Smith to Peter-
son savagely as he started for Morris-
town

told you to watch ‘em,” returned
Smith as he followed down the road

It looks some to the rural residenta of
old Morris as if young Mr. and Mr« Smith
might have some difficulty in the immediate
future in fulfilling their arrange obliga-
tions. The party of four left for New York
on an evening train

TUESDAY, AUGUST 20,

| RIVER STRAMER OVERTURNED,

 

 

GOLCONDA AT CROWELLS,

| Tornade Hit the Vessel as Ghe Was Making
& Landing -Seventy-five Passengers
on Board, Many of Whom Were at Sup-
per —Unable to Fscape as Veeec! Sank.

Papucan, Ky, Aug. 10—The worst
steamboat disaster of years bhereabouts
occurred to-night about 7 o'clook, when
the City of Goleonda, plying between this
city and Elizabethtown, Il), waa struck
by a tornado as she landed at Crowells,
six miles above here, and turned over.
Many of the passengers were at supper
and were unable to escape from the cabin
At least sixteen were drowned

The boat was loaded with live stock and
grain and had about «vent y-five passengers
Several who reached the deck as the tornado
struck the vessel jumped overboard in
their fright and were lost

Capt. Jesse Bauer and Pilot EB. E. Peck
swam to shore and after reacting all in
sight hurried tc the city Capt. Peck said
that when the boat sank there was no time
to eRcape

She went down in ten feet of water on
her side, and what few passengers were
found struggling in the water clung to
a yaw! and reached «shore. After the
wind had sulmided the crew rowed to the
wreck, but found no one, and of all the
women on board only one is known to have
been saved

Capt. Peck says that the books will have
to be found before it can be determined
who and how many are lost, but places
the number of those who perished at sixteen
or twenty Three deckhands saved a
woman and a child and came to the city
through the woods. Most of the crew
was lost

The boat left Elizabethtown at 1 P.M
and was due to arrive bere at 7”. M. She
had an unusually large passenger list,
as she was the only boat coming down
to-day

Among those reported lost are: Mra
Dave Adams and niece, Miss Lucy Barnett,
Smithland; Miss Lizzie Graham, sister of
Clerk Charles Graham of thie city; Miss
Trisie Grimes, Girahamville, this county;
Mrs. Lon Hogan and three children, this
city; W. Atta Davis, a stockman of Living-
ston county; Charlies Slayton of lola, Ky;
two young women from Smithlanud, names
not known here; three deckhands

H. E. Worten and N. & Quarternous of
Hampton, Ky., arrived to-night, having
escaped by breaking the glass in the cabin
The Mary N left to-night for the scene to
bring back the survivors, and the dead who
are in the cabin

The beat was valued at $2,500 and had
been in the trade for several years

WAITRESSES STRIKE AT BEACH.

Hotel Lewry Enitstea an Awkward but
Earnest Squad toe Serve Dinner. __

There was more trouble yesterday at the
Fort Lowry Hotel in Bath Beach from a
strike of the same waitresses who about
a month ago tied up the meal service of the
hotel very tightly Manager Coffin of the
Fort Lowry has had several difficulties with
the waitresses. They liked him well enough,
they said, but several of them quarrelled
with the French chef and on that account
two of the girls quit. Yesterday Head
Walter Charies O'Connor, who has charge
of the front dining room, commonly known
to the boarders as “the first cabin,” got into
an argument with Mr. Lowry, the owner
of the hotel, and threw up his job

When the thirty waitresses heard of
O'Connor's leaving they said they were
going to leave, too, and forming a column,
two abreast, headed by May Brady, the
heat waitress in the rear dining room,
or the “steerage.” they marched to Man-
ager Coffin’s office. There they said they
wanted their pay, aud when they were
told that they could have it in the morning
they departed

This happened at $ o'clock and the 350
or te of the hotel were assembled
on the hotel veranda, wondering how they
were going to get their dinners. The
hotel management finally got as waiters
“Capt ” Leon von Stoll, the bathing master,
his assistant, who is known only as * Fritz,”
and who can't talk anything but German,
Jim, the beetblack, who was decked out in
a clean white apron, five chambermatids,
and three dishwashers

All of the extemporized waiters per-
formed valiant feats of service and all
acquitted themselves nobly Of course,
no one paid any attention to Jim, the boot-
black, when he «pilled a tray full of soup
and roast beef on the gown of one of the

AY.

seats «The accident was rightly at-
ributed to his great earnestness. By §&
o'clock nearly everybody had been at-
tended to and the hotel management

said they would have plenty of new waiters
to-day

TONS OF DYNAMITE EX-
PLODE IN UUERKIMER.

FIVE

Of Fifteen Members of the New Vork Cem
tral Ratiroad Bridge Gang, Who Were |
Stopping in a Car on a wide Track |
One Only Facape Death or Injury.

Henaimen, N.Y, Aug 10--Five tons of
dynamite, stored in the old Mohawk and
Malone roundhouse in this village, blew up
at 10:16 to-night, instantly killing thirteen
men, all members of the New York Central
bridge gang, who were stopping in a car
which stood on a side track near by. Only
five out of fifteen men have been accounted
for, Three of these are dead and one mor-
tally injured) Another escaped with only
a few bruises J. H
man of the gang = Bricks and fragmenta of
iron were blown several blocks away All
the windows within blocks were
broken and nearly al| the plate glass win-
dows in the village were «hattered

The dynamite was stored in
house, in which at the time there were three

 

Vosburg was fore-

 

«vera!

a round-

engines, and these, together, with the
building, were blown to pieces
The place where the explosion oceurred

is only a short distance from the village
There was in, one at
the time as far as has been learned, and

in the roundhouse

the only persons anywhere near it appare
ently were the bridge men, who were asleep
in their car, which had been put on a siding
within a few feet of the roundhouse

For some time dynamite for use in builrle
ing operations on the road has been stored
in part of the building in consideratile
quantities. Almost every building in the
village felt the shock of the explosion,
which is described as having been terrific
This can be judged from the fact that it
was felt in Parkford, ten miles away, and
also in Little Falls, where the people thought
they had been visited by a slight earth-
quake

In Herkimer itself every window in the
town was shattered and cornices of rey
eral buildings fell off as a result of the
shock. The explosion occurred at 1090
and at that hour fortunately most of the
people of the town had retired, and conse
quently it ia believed that few have been
injured by falling glass or otherwise

No other building in town was destroyed,
but the roundhouse, which was a good-
sized building, is in mine These took
fire after the explosion and burned fiercely
adding to the exciternent into which the
explosion threw every one

VACHT CLUB FAXPELS HIM.

Anderson's Wife Thrashed Another Mem-

The members of the Brooklyn
Club met lest night to try on charges pre-
ferred by the House Comittee two of their
fellow members, W. J. Burg and Arthur
M. Anderson, whose wife horsewhipped
Burg on the club veranda about three
weeks ago and furnished an exciting subject
for gossip which the members decided

action that it did take she would “take
the matter into beriown hands and make
a clean job of it" That was all she would
say

why the company discharged all its women

satisfied with the men in its employ and
decided to try women conductors as an ex

patronage and would be more refined than

At first the company's expectations were
fully realized, for patronage wae attracted
to the lines and the nmxwipta were greatly

from the $30 whieh Dr. England paid for
his degree, and there remains a net profit
tothe learned *Chancellor” of the * National
University” of from 62047 to $29.67 on @

irty-dollar doctor of divinity deal

Probably, however, there should alao be
dedueted from this «un a small commission
to the “National University” agent. The
agent in this particular case was the Rev
of

George Stuart Campbell, DD. now
Glen Riddle, Pa Dr England aaid to-
night that he did not know positively

whether the Rew Dr Campbell, D. D., was
paid by commission or whether he took it
out in a free degree of DD. for himaelf,
but he was inclined to beliewe that the
reverend drummer for “Chancellor” Hark-
ins's diploma factory received a commision

for his eerviess The first that was known

here in Washington about the degree of
doetor of divinity having been conferred
upon Dr. England was on the éth of July,
1804, when a local paper, the Warren Tidings,
printed the following item:

“The » of doctor o ,

country in oa few yeare has hono
townsman is gratifying indeed.”

Dr. England, who is pastor of the Preaby-
terian Chureh here, is personally popular
in bis congregation and has acquired a
reputation for pulpit eloquence. People,
therefore, were generally very glad that
he had been thus honored by the University
of Chicago. The reason Dr. England did
not disabuse them as to the particular
university from which he had got his de-
gree was that he was deceived himself,
he said, in discussing the subject in hie
study at the parsonage. Notwithetan®
ing the fact that that magnificent apes
men of the Job printer's art, his diploma,
began with the words: “Senatus Universi-
tatia Nationalis,” he «till was under the
impression that it was the University of
which had honored him, and that
name “F W. Harkin, Praeses,” was
“Harper, Praeses" The reason he wae
«) deceived, he says, was because of his
faith in bis brother clergyman, the Rev.
George Stuart Campbell, D D)., who, aa the
clerieal “barker” for the learned Harkin's
liploma factory, roped him into a trans-
action which he now very much regrete
