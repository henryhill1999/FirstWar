TO KEEP BOTH OUT

 

ENaLEwoon, N. J., Nov. 10.—-More than
romiunce is to mark the elopement of Miss
Klizabeth ©, Coppell and her ehauffeur,

touch of war
the latest development, and on the out-
come of this family feud depends the pos-
session of the Towers, the beautiful family
residence of the Coppells, so long pointed
out by residents of Tenafly, N. J., as one
of the town's show places

The bride's two brothers, Herbert and
Arthur Coppell, appealed to the Tenafly
authorities for a police guard for the

| Towers and to-night two policemen were

stationed at the gates with instructions
to keep out Mrs. Connors or her husband
They have been directed to tell Mrs, Con-
nors that the Towers is no longer her
home,

 

The two brothers are apparently In-
censed over the disclosure yesterday of
the secret marriage last April of their

sister, who {ts $1 vears old, and the fact

that she should have chosen a chauffeur
nine years her junior for a husband
Their contention is said to be that by the

terms of the will of their father, the late
(jeorge Coppell wealthy railroad
financier, the Towers is forfeted to her
automatically by her marriage

To Discharge All Servants,

The Coppell brothers appealed to the

Tenafly authorities last night on hearing
{rumors of their sister's marriage, and
being informed that their sister, who was

at that time with her husband in Atlantic

iCity, had acknowledged — the wedding,

they asked that a guard be placed at

|the gates They immediately discharged
all the servants and locked the doors
'

They #ave Instruction to the blue-
coated guards at the outside gates that
they should resist the entrance of Mrs

 

} Connors or her husband; that the should

go far enough to make the couple under-

‘stand that the residence no longer is th

 

bride's, Then they continued:
“If Mrs. Connors insists upon entering
the house allow her to do so Also allow

her to take the automobile into the
sonal property.

BULGARIA SENDS ENVOY HERE.

AN

 

olntment of Prof. Stephen
Panaretof Announced in Soffa,
Sorta, Nov. 10.—Surprise was caused

here to-day by the announcement that

Prof. Stephen Panaretoff of Robert Col- |

lege, Constantinople, has been appointed

Bulgarian Minister to the United States
ind that he is now on his way to Wasn-
ington The matter was kept so quiet

that even some members of the Cabinet

did not know of the appointment

Bulgaria at present has no diplomatic
representative at Washnigton and when
the matter of sending a Minister to the
United States was broached by a former

Cabinet it was laid aside on the ground
that the remoteness of the relations of

the two countries did not warrant the addl-

tion of such an expense to the budget

It is said that the real reason for the

appointment is the desire of King Ferdi-
| nand to visit the United States in the near

future. Prof, Panuretoff will be his diplo-
matic advance agent Queen Eleanora
was to have visited the United States

early in the present year and King Fer-
dinuand said he would probably attend
the Pan-American exposition at San Fran-
cisco in 1915, but the plans were spoiled
