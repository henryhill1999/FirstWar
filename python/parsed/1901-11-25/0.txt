li was then expected that they would
dsembark somewhere in the vicinity of

Wasurnoton, Nov. 24.—The Secretary
of the Navy has received a despatch from
Lieutenant-Commander Henry McCrea,
commanding the United States gunboat
Mochias, in which he confirms that part
of Tue Scx's Colon despatch, which says
that the Colombian gunboat Gen. Pinzon
had arrived at that port. He does not
mention anything about his reported re-

ol to permit the Colombian commander
to land troops.

Lieutenant-Commander McCrea ts re-
g2rded as such a well-balanced and sensible
officer, thoroughly familiar with diplomatic
cleervances between nations, that the
of tals here are ratisfied that he had some
good reason for declining to let the Govern-
ment troops go ashore at Colon. His prompt
landing of bluejackets and marines from

SAN JUAN CELEBRATES.

Seclis Its Insue of 600,000 Bends to J. M.

Ceballos & Co. at 8 Per Cont. Premium.

Special Cable Despated to Tue Sun.

San JvuAN, Porto Rico, Nov. 24.—This city
yesterday celebrated the sale by auction
of a new issue of municipal bonds to the
amount of $600,000. J. M. Ceballos & Co.
of New York were the highest bidders.
They offered a premium of 8 per cent. or
about $618,375.

The officials and citizens generally are
very happy over this good bargain as it
shows the estimation in which the credit of
the city is held. Last night the City Hall
was decorated and illuminated and the
Mayor held a reception in honer of the
event.

The bonds are to run for twenty years
at 6 per cent, interest. The Government
reserves the right to redeem them in ten
years if it sees fit. The insular Treasurer
is empowered to withhold taxes in case
of default.

The following is the summary of the bids
fn the order in which they were opened:
Mason, Lewis & Co,. par; Adolph Kley~-
bolte & Co., $587,100; the new First National
Bank of Columbus, $616,000; J. M. Ceballos
& Co., $618,875 and Seasongood & Mayer of
Cincinnati, $613,750. The award will be an-
nounced to-morrow.

This is the first investment of American
capital in Porto Rican public securities.
Many other cities on the island are coon-
templating the issue of similar bonds for
public improvements.

CHURCHILL AT THE DEWEY.

DROPPED IN TO SEE THAT BIG
TIM OBEYED THE LAW.

 

Made No Arrests There, but Left a Couple
of Detectives Behind to Keep an Eye
on the Senater’s Place —Closes Dance
Halli on Avenue B—Arrests Keeper.

Acting Captain Churchill of the East
Fifth street station, who has been stirring
up the Bowery and contiguous streets by
his sudden rakis on saloons, gambling
houses and dives was comparatively in-
active last night. At the station houne,
shortly after a last tour of the pre-
cinct for the evening, he said that he
was quite confident that his recent activity
had produced the desired result, and that
for a few days at least he'believed no at-
tempt would be made to violate the law.

At 10:30 o'clock he started on a tour
which lasted several hours, to see if his
orders to close up had been obeyed. He
went first to the Dewey Theatre, Big Tim
Sullivan's place, stayed there an hour
and left two detectives with instructions
to prevent any violation of the law. There
wae no violation.

In the course of his trip Churchill came
acroes Max Zwerdling’s saloon and dance
hall at 28 Avenue B. There was a crowd
dancing and Churchill says the foam on
the beer glasses wasn't dry by any means.
He ordered the whole crowd out and then
had a detective put Zwerdling under ar-
rest. Elsewhere he found everything
closed up tight, he said.

Sergt. Churchill has changed his tone a
little in the last twenty-four hours. From
talk of clubbing the heads off of lawbreakers
who declined to be arrested peaceably
and open deflance of certain of his superiors
in the department he has come down to an
attitude of meekness that is hard to ex-
plain. He said last night:

“I have been misquoted ever since I
took command of this precinct and started
in to see that the law was not violated.
It has put me in a false light both inside and
outside of the department. I never said
that I would club the heads off of people
and all that talk about my defying Devery
to interfere with me in the performance of
my duty, was put in my mouth. Even if
I wanted to say such a thing you don't
suppose I would be such a fool as to do it.

Why it would be nothing short of crazy | scrap iron.
for a sergeant in my position to talk of the | ¥8s

Deputy Commissioner of Police in that way.

“Anybody that knows me knows that I |

am not trying to make a grand stand play.
But those who do not know me can't believe
anything else in view of what has been
printed as coming from me. I don't want to
stand in the limelight. Let themturn that on
geome one else. is idea that I am an ex-
ceptional man_in the department is a

foolish one. There are hundreds of men |
in the

ment to-day of my rank who
would do the same as I am doing, and some
of them could do it better, 1 don't doubt.
I don't mind having what I do printed,
but I don’t want to be made 4 mountebank

ARMED MINERS STEAL AWAY.

Vanished Like the Mist When the Soldiers
Came.

Hexpgrson, Ky., Nov. 24.—Temporarily
at least, the labor war in the Hopkins coal
region is at an end. Judge Hall, with Adju-
tant-General Murray, and a detachment
of State troops at his back, went by special
train from Madisonville to Mortonville
this morning, Judge Hall, with the Statutes
of Kentucky under his arm, then went to
the union miners’ camp. He found it
practically deserted, all of the contingent
of tramps from other States had moved
out and of the 300 or 400 men who were
there a few days ago, only twenty-seven
remained. These were nearly all mere
boys and most of them residents of Hopkins
county. All of the large equipment of
rifles with which the mine workers’ union
supplied this, as well as all other wings
of the invading army, had disappeared.

Judge Hall read the law to the gang
and told all present that they were under
arrest. A few ran away and escaped;
a few more ran away and were captured.
All the prisoners were corralled in one of
the tents where one burly fellow said
that he would not budge. John B. Harlan,
who is a relative of Justice Harlan of the
United States Supreme Court, disposed
of this dilemma by picking up the big man
and carrying him under his arm like a
sack of corn with his head under his arm,
toward a wai wagon. At this the
belligerent deci: he would walk.

The whole gang was then escorted to
the railroad station by the militia and
there, with the exception of two, who were

rmitted to escape, they were loaded into
bon cars and ca to Madisonville, where
they were lodged in jail. Their hearing
will be on Tuesday next. One of the two
permitted to escape was Artie Oakes, who
was one of the ringleaders and who is
a Lieutenant in the militia. The tents of
the camp were taken down and conveyed
to Madisonville where they were
up in freight cars and sidetracked.

The ral opinion is that this ends
the trouble for a month or so at least. U
to cate it is a total defeat for Mitchell's
union.

94 SAVED BY BREECHES BUOY,

FLOTTBEK HAD CRUEL BEATING
BY SEA AT LONG BRANCH.

Amateur Life Savers Vied With Uxperts
im Herotsm and Saved Tug's . Crow
—Iron Pier Demolished and One Man
Drowned-——-Much Damage on Shore.

Lono Baancu, N. J., Nov. 24.—The large
thres-masted ship which was in distress
off here last night went ashore early this
morning between Monmouth and North
Long Branch and is now high and dry on
tho sand.

She turned out to be the Flotthek of
Hamburg, a steel ship of 1,971 tons, bound
from Plymouth, England, for New York,
with a cargo of china, clay and arsenic and
carrying a crew of twenty-four men, in-
cluding Capt. Leo Zingler and a mate.

All of the crew were rescued by the
breeches buoy after the hardest kiid of
work on the part of the life savers. The
tug Robert Haddon, which was towing the
Flottbek when the storm came up, but
which had to cast her adrift by being dis-
abled herself, through an accident to her
rudder, wont ashore about the same time
as the ship at Long Branch and was smashed
into kindling wood against the iron pier
the pier itself being demolished later by
the waves.

All of the crew of the tug except the
mate were rescued in the nick of time by
some volunteer life savers. The mate
was washed overboard, but managed to
swim to the beach.

According to Capt. Zingler of the Flott-
bek, his ship, which left Plymouth Oct.
8, had good weather until some hours
after he passed Barnegat on Saturday
morning. When off Barnegat the tug
Robert Haddon came up and offered to
tow his ship into New York for $150, but
as the weather was then pretty clear and
the captain had al) sails bent, he decided
to try and save the money and refused the
offer.

Capt. Zingler says it began to blow hard
soon after he refused the tug's offer. When
the wind shifted to northeast it began to
blow a gale. The sails were reefed, but
when 4 o'clock came the German skipper
made up his mind to accept the offer of the
tug. Signals were made, which the Had-
don promptly answered, and then an at-
tempt was made to put one of the ship's
hawsers aboard the tug The hawser was
too heavy to manage in the heavy rea and
a lighter one was strung from the tug to
the ship.

After about half an hour's towing in
the teeth of the gale the tug’* rudder was
unshipped by fouling with a shadpole.

Capt. Starks signalled that he was dis-
abled and Capt. Zingler let go his anchors.
About 10:30 they began to drag and the
big ship drifted broadside toward the
shore, r decks —- by the combers
that came over her rails.

Capt. Zingler, as soon as he saw that the
anchors had parted, ordered all the ship's
stock of rocketa, bombs and red lights to

 

be set: off. In setting one of them him-
self it exploded and the captain was severely
burned about the face.

The life-saving corpe, in charge of Capt
Mulligan, had noticed the ship in the after-
noon and saw her eignale of distress imme-
diately, so that when the ship was about
700 yards off the beach an attempt was
made to throw a line across the vessel
The line went over all fright, but
thoee on board could not find it on
account of the darkness and the waves
then breaking over her Another line was
fired with the same result

Finally, on the fourth attempt and when
the ship was about 30 yards off shore, the
life-saving crew managed to get a line over
the vessel that those on beard could see
and the breeches buoy was then quickly

ed

A first to come ashore by it was Alex-
ander Alesinark, a fifteen-vear-old cabin
boy who three weeks ago had broken hie
leg and was therefore helpless. When the

storm came up he had gone below, and the |

captain carried him in his arms to the
breeches buoy and saw that he was the
first ashore

One after another the
off, the captain being the last tw leave
It took about half an hour to rescue the
crew, and during this time Capt. Mulligan
says the spray ‘oom the waves frequently
ehot a hundred yards up the beech, and
the sound of the waves pounding against
the side of the ship wa» like that of cannon

When the tide receded (his morning the
Plottbek was left high and dry on the rand

MORNING CALL, THROAT CUT.

Dentist Hesper Bercher Attempts Suiciie
a Second Time.

Hesper Beecher, a dentist, who has an
office at 1042 Third avenue, walked along
120th street at Amsterdam avenue at 8
o'clock yesterday morning wearing no
overcoat and holding his coat collar tight
about his neck. His watch chain was
dangling and a man called his attention
to it. Beecher unbuttoned his coat. His
neck and shirt were covered with blood.

Policeman Glavin hustled him to the J.
Hood Wright Hvspital. He had a two-inch
gash in his throat and was weak from loss
of blood. In his pockets were §200 in cash,
a check for $50 and a bank book on the
Bowery Savings Bank, showing a deposit
of $1,000.

The police learned that Beecher attempted
to commit suicide about two months ago
at 127th street and Fifth avenue, by taking
a dose of chloral, and cutting both his wrists.
He was found at that time in an unfinished
building across the street from St. An-
drew's Protestant Episcopal Church. It
was said at that time that Beecher was in
love with a woman in Connecticut, who
had jilted him. The police think that the
woman now lives in Harlem, and that he
had been to see her.

House Surgeon Ogilvie at the hospita
asked Beecher why he had tried to kill
himself. Beecher wrote on a piece of

paper:

“If Thad only gone back to bed and called
in the afternoon——"*

Here he stopped and would not write
any more. He sent for Peter R. Gatens,
his lawyer, and the Rev. Elmer A. Dent,
of 225 East Sixty-first street. Both came
to the hospital last night, but refused to
say anything about the reason why Beecher
had tried to take his life. They said that
he came of a respectable family. He is
likely to recover

 

PRESIDENT AND THE INDIANS.

He Is Interested tn the Fate of the Rem-

" mant ef the Mission Tribe.

Ios ANGELES, Cal, Nov. 24.— Charles F.
Lummis, an author and expert on South-
western arch@ology, has been asked by
President Roosevelt to go to Washington
and confer with him on the approaching
eviction of Mission Indians from their
home .on Warner's ranch in San Diego
county. Mr. Lummis is at the head of a
society whichhas interested itself in the

fate of this remnant of the once powerful
tribe of Mission Indians.

Downey Harvey, owner of the ranch,
recently received by law a ruling that the
Indians must vacate the ranch, w they
have lived for more than thirty —
there are no lands available for them, the
Indians will starve unless the Government
finds them a reservation

These Indians are in little worse plight
than most of the aborigines in southern
California. The filling in all available
water rights has cut off the
Indians from means of irrigation and all
along the edge of the Colorado and Mojave
deserts they are slowly dying of starvation,
as it i# impossible to raise enough to eat,

and there is work only a few months in a

year

A phenomena! tide, which slightly re-
duced the dimensions of Manhattan Island
and made other and much smaller islands
in this neighborhood so diminutive that
they were not discoverable except by apy-
glass, caused more damage to property
and local shipping than any tidal overflow in
the memory of veteran boatmen. The full
moon, combined with the power of an east
and northeasterly wind which had been
blowing since dawn on Saturday, sweeping
the waters of ocean and Sound this way,
was the author of the flood.

It was a wonder, was that tide. It flooded
the workings of the Rapid Transit tunnel
near the Harlem River, so that most of
the work at that point will have to be done
over again. It put Smith street and its
piers a foot or more under water, stopped
the street cars, set City Island's main street
aswim, so that folks went to church in row-

age, undermined the seawall at Fort Schuy-
ler and made the fort an island, and, com-
bined with the wind, tossed the ferryboats
so that passengers were seasick, and one
boat rolled her boiler loose. And way
up the North River under Riverside Drive
a coal barge sank and gave the wealthy
folks in the mansions hard by a seaside
thrill.

The gale was not remarkable, except
for uniformity of foree. Its maximum
stunt was 58 miles an hour, as measured
by the anemometer on the Weather Bu-
rean's office. In the open sea, according
to the observation of the commanders of
liners that arrived yesterday, the blow
varied between 55 and 70 miles. The blast

| was permeated with rain that gave it bat-

tering-ram weight, and it smashed and

| samanges signs, swinging and statian-

ary, and knocked many plate glass win-
dows to emithereens. Wires were torn
down by flood and gale. For a time,
Sandy Hook was shut off from communi-
cation with Manhattan, and the City Island
wires were put out of commission.

The storm, it ix conjectured, was born
on the plains of Texas. It began swirling
in modest fashion, contrary to the custom
of Texas cyclones, on Thureday. It gath-
ered energy as it pirouetted this way, and
was the worst arial and marine motor of
the season before its advance forces struck
these parts on Saturday morning. Only
0 of an inch of rain fell, so that didn't
contribute much to the inundation. It was
chiefly tide and cyclone.
