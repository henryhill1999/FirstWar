FINANCIAL AND COMMERCIAL.

Tavrspay, Nov. 22.

Irregularity was again to-day the, pre-
vailing feature df stock market transactions.
A generally better tone ruled in the foreign
markets, owing to the easier monetary
conditions which there as well as here
have come to pass within the last ten days.
The Bank of England's weekly return,
made public this morning, was not, per-
haps, as extremely favorable as was an-
ticipated yesterday, but still made a strong
showing. The bank increased its gold
holdings nearly $7,000,000, or an even greater
enlargement than had been looked for.
But as the loan account of the bank was
also swollen in proportionate degree the
bank’s proportion of reserve to liabilities
was raised to only 40.32 per cent., as against
last week's percentage of 40.96 per cent.
The weekly exhibit of the Bank of France
was not quite so gratifying as the foregoing;
as, although the loans of the French insti-
tution were reduced $7,887,000, the bank's
cash fell of $4,700,000. Put no matter
how produced, cheerfulness was plainly
evident in all important foreign financial
centres and it brought about higher prices
there for American stocks before the open-
ing of business here. (in the other hand,
London houses although at first buyers
of stocks here were afterward sellers, and
it was estimated that the total net sales
here for foreign. account exceeded pur-
chases by 25,000 shares. Inthe fore part of
the day strength in the local security mar-
ket was pronounced, Union Pacifico stock
was the leader and remained so during the
entire day, dealings in the stock forming
more than one-fifth of the total volume
of transactions in the maraet as a
whole; and even though the stock
afterward lost the greater part of its
advance it still closed at a gain of
almost a full point. The tendency of
current speculation to engage itself with

low priced and usually inactive shares was |
once more evident and particular gains |
were recorded in. the morning hours of | US2sr..

business by the Missouri, Kansas and Texas
common and preferred, National Rail-
road of Mexioo first and second preferred,
Virginia Iron, Coal and Coke, Pittsburg
Coal, Colorado Fue}, Pacific Mail, Republic
Iron and Steel, Texas Land Trust, Brooklyn
Rapid Transit and Delaware and Hudson
stocks. In nearly all of these cases special
reasons were ostensibly at work. The
extreme advance of 10% points in Virginia
Iron, Coal and Coke stock was accomplished
on a relatively small volume of trading,
as the stock is supposed to be controlled
almost entirely by one large Wall Street
commission house. The rumor circulated
that the company was to be taken into a
meditated merger of various Southern
coal and iron properties. Improved pros-
pects, as was thought, for the passage of a
subsidy bill in Congress in the coming
winter accounted for the rise in Pacific
Mail. Confidence that the highest court
of the State would uphold the right, as-
serted by the Brooklyn Rapid Transit
Company in the litigation now pending,
to charge an extra fare on its Coney Island
lines was the basis of the advance in the
company’s shares, and an impression in
the financial district that now that a Harri-

man control over the Illinois Central Rail- |

road Company had been attained the James
J. Hill railway interests would endeavor
to lay hold of the lines of a competing
property was commonly offered as the rea-
son for the buying of the Missouri, Kansas
and Texas shares. Dealings much larger
than ordinarily witnessed in Delaware and
Hudson stock caused at one time an advance
of 5% points inthe price of the security, half
of which was retained asa final net gain,
and the idea’gained currency that not only
was an annual dividend rate of 10 per cent.
likely to be established for the stock next
month but that the entrance of new stock-
holding interests into the property was
going on.’

Nevertheless; while strength was notice-
alle in these quarters it was liquidation
apparently that was in the ascendant and
in the afternoon the general market turned
weak. There were no adverse develop-
ments in the money situation to cause sell-
ing of stocks, as call mqney rates were even
easier to-day than they were yesterday
and the pgice of funds for use for longer
periods re ed unchanged. The local
banks reported a gain for the week of nearly
$2,000,000 in their transactions with the
Sub-Treasury, although this will be offset to
some degree in the bank statement at the
end of the week by the shipment yesterday
and to-day of $1,250,000 to San Francisco.
The premium, too, on New York exchange
in Chicago disappeared and a discount
was substituted in its stead, the meaning
of this occurrence being, as it seemed, that
interior financial institutions at the low
level of call money rates touched to-day
were not free lenders of funds. But the
one potent cause of the weakness in the
market in the afternoon was ugdoubtedly
the more or less disappointing reception
from a speculative point of view given by
Wall Street in the announcement this morn-
ing of the Great Northern Railway Com-
pany’s issue of stock to its shareholders,
representing their participation in the
company’s lease of ore lands to the United
States Steel Corporation. These stock
certificates are not really such, but are
certificates representing a beneficiary in-
terest in a deed of trust executed by the
Great Northern company covering the
profits of the ore land lease, and it appears
that for the time being at least the interest
return on these certificates will not be
large. At any rate the announcement as
made to-day disclosed nothing that had not
long been a matter of common knowledge
in connection with the ore land transaction,
and whether or not by reason of profit
taking after Wall Street’s usual fashion
following the promulgation of expected
“good news” the Great Northern Railway
and Northern Pacifico stocks and the price
of the new certificates on the curb market
all declined sharply. The St. Paul common
shares were also heavy, falling nearly five
points below their high quotation on the
present movement; and the continual press-
ing of these stocks for sale resulted in a
general decline in the market in the final
hour of business.

THE CURB MARKET.

Trading in outside securities was again
much lighter to-day and irregularity con-
tinued to be the chief characteristic of the
market. There were only a few individual

stocks in which dealings were large or where
net changes were more than fractional.
these Great Northern Ore and Standard Oil
were the weakest stocks on the list, the former
falling to. 87 in sympathy with the heaviness
of all the Hill stocks. Renewed weakness was
shown by Standard Oil, the decline in this
issue at one time reaching (5 points.
sing was firm and active and improved nearly
a point, and United and Butte Coalition also
showed especial

THE BOSTON MARKET.

Boston, Nov. 22.—There was a broad and
active market for copper again to-day. Calu-
met and Arizona and Osceola were the fea-
tures of the higher priced shares, the former
selling as bigh as 163 and closing at 162, a new
price record, on sales of 2,100 shares, while
Osceola gained two points on sales of 1,800
shares. Montana Coal and Coke was the more
active of the cheaper stocks, sales reaching
10,700 shares. The balance of the list was
firm and prices closed near the top.

The industrial list was again active, but no
especial feature. Railroads were quiet but

THE GRAIN MARKETS.

Trading Light and Changes Narrow —The
Northwest Selling Wheat —Receipts of
AN Grains Light.

Wheat ended at a slight decline, owing
mainly to liquidation here, at Chicago and
also at Min olia, Some advance took
place early,’ Owing partly to small receipts
at the Northwest, light offerings and cover-
ing of shorts.

Northwestern prices were firm, even though
poor wire service cut down business. The
mills are absorbing wheat pretty freely,
judging from the fact that the Minneapolis
stock is gradually decreasing. Undoing of
spreads with the Northwest has latterly
been something of a feature. Whe stock at
Minneapolis has decreased 60,000 bushels
thus far this week. Spring flour quotation’
have been advanced by Northwestern mills.

The Northwestern Miller says that there
seems to be no change in the situation as to
the railroads moving wheat to Minneapolis
and Duluth any faster than they have been
doing. The talk ig heard that as soon as
cold weather comes there will be marked
improvement in receipts, but many elevator
men are sceptical about this, in the last
few ys there has been quite a heavy fall
of snow in North Dakota, and with rain in
South Dakota and southern Minnesota, and
also bad roads, farmers are unable to haul
wheat to market were they inclined to sell.

Up vheother hana, the #rice Current weealy
ome Sipe was one beara. =
offic russian crop repore, . em

 oens. of the wheat crop had been seeded

November 15 against 80 per t. up to
Ocvober 15, and 7z per cene. to November 15
last year. The growing wheat in this coun-
try is doing weil. There is a steady trans-
ferring from December to May at tne larg-
est carrying charge seen for some years
pas. Liverpool was %d. lower, owing to
weaker American cables, but e steadier
ow to firmer La Plata offerings. Berlin
oh quiet and 4c. lower.

Later on, when it became apparent that
the Northwest was selling pretty freely:
1 traders became more disposed to se!
and prices weakened. ber_©o!
tinued to come out here at the West.
M moreover, wed heaviness,
an encouraged the bears to work for
adecline. At Minneapolis ; 8 Dusen brokers
seld December and bought May at a differ-
= of two cents. The cash markets were

uiet.

: The speculation, however, was far from
being active. In fact, many regarded the
action of the market as @ natural setback
atter the recent advance. Certainly senti-
ment amo bears is not aeons, which
is not sur g in view of the strong North-
western situation. At the same time bulls
are not dis, to make a determined «tand

 

as a rule until December liquidation has | \
| eome in recent years: that is, the mill tries

been completed. Some prominent commis-
sion houses, however, ate advising pur-
chases on the setbacks between now and the
first of next month, when they think the
market will be in a better position to respond
vo underlying conditions, which they regard
as favorable to an ultimate advance.

Hulburd Warren, W. H. Lake and others
were selling at Chicago, supposedly for North-
western account. Peavey was selling May.
Finley Barrell sold December and bough
May. The Argentine shipments are esti-
mated at 800,000 bush., against 728,000 last
week and 1,622,000 last year. )

Chicago wired to Sidney C. Love & Co
“The trade in the Northwest has come to a
realization of the fact that differences be-
tween winter and spring wheat are too wide
as jud from milling standpoint and that
the spring wheat millers are out of the run-
ning at the difference.”

nneaPolis: “December wheat should be

beught on this break. We won't get any re-
ceipts until after January 1, and then they
won't be large. ‘The wheat that is piled up in
the countr Because houses are full is because
mill¢ own ht and are afraid to let it get away
from them.”

THE CORN SITUATION, ~

Prices were firmer early. Cornat the West,
according to the Price Current, is somewhat
soft, and the weather conditions were not
favorable. This led to some buying. But
there was no snap in the trading. Most

ople would like to sell short on the crop out-
on but the weather for maturing the corn is
bad, and the short interest is already pretty
large. Besides, however the crop may
be, the actual receipts at the present time are
only moderate.

Chicago got only ¥ cars, with but eight
of contract grade. To-day 213 cars are ex-
pected there. The total primary receipts
were 381,000 bush., against 524,000 last year,
The cash market was quiet but firm, with
Chicago quotations 40 higher. With better
weather a considerable increase in the re-
ceipts is expected. Later in the day prices

| were easier with wheat. The Argentine

shipments for the week are estimated at 2,000, -

| 000 bush., against 2,470,000 last week and

2,226,000 last year.
THE OATS FEATURES.

Oats ruled steady with the trading lifeless
and devoid of features worthy of note. A
better shipping demand was reported at the
West and prices at Chicago were \c. to
‘4c. higher. The speculation at Chicago was
confined mainly to changing from December

ay. : :
Chicago received 104 cars, including 26 of
contract grade, and expects 164 to-day. The
total primary receipts were 465,000 bush.
Wheat was quiet on the spot. Sales, 80,000

THE COTTON MARKET.

Disappointment Over Revision Causes Sharp
Break—Heavy Liquidation and Bear
Raiding.

Prices declined sharply yesterday. To the
great disappointment of those who think that
the revision of the differences between grades
should have been more radical, low middling
is still valued in the achedule as only 50 poinis
below middling, whereas at New Orleans,
Galveston, Houston, Memphis, Savannah
and Mobile it is 100 to 137 points below mid-

 

dling, so that under ordinary circumstances |

the low grades, it would seem, muat be attracted
to New York. Thisactionin regard to revision
undoubtedly had a depressing effect. Further-
more, the weather at the South was in the
mainclear. Liverpool showed depression and
the estimates for New Orleans and Houston
to-day are large. Liverpool sold here and

some leading local operators attacked the |

maPxet with considerable success. They were
aided by those who preferred to realize profita

after the recent rise and by others who sold on |

the theory that in any case a reaction waa
due. Later on came a temporary rally, owing
to covering by early sellers, who to all appear-

ance made a quick foray on the market and |!

covered on the break. Moreovey, Wall Street

was a buyer in spite of the action in regard |

to revision and some houses which have been
bullish of late were again buying, not to men-
tion certain spot interests.

It is held by very many that regardless of

revision or anything elge the market is des-

tined to reach higher prices on the strength
of what they regard as the facts of supply and

demand. It is felt by

AMERICAN TRUST BLDG., CHICAGO

on the subject of the cotton business of the
world that no obstacle will be big enough to

revent prices advancing, because they think
ft is not an affair of speculators or speriila
tive manewuyres of any sort, however seen
ingly deep, but rather a question largely be-
tween the planter and the spinner, he

 

 

| public is not in the apeculation,and for the

time being atfjleast shows no sign of coming

lin. The trade, therefore, reverts practically

to old time conditions before trading in tv
tures became the feature which it has be.

to buy cotton at the South and finding the
better grades searce has to pay ood round
premiums to get them, From all accounts

they are pot getting yery much even uncer

| mills are sold six to eicht months ahead, and

there are experienced men in the cotton busi-

' neas,caring little about thecotton speculation,
| since they are engaged in the legitimate co!-
| ton trade, who maintain that the consump-

tion of American cotion this year will belin-
ited only by the available supply of labor at

| the mills. Heavy lonses have been sustained
| at the South by those who sold to the milis

early in the year at low prices and who now

self, Beara here have received a severe
check in the last month, and if the bul are
right in their premises the logical conclis ton
ia that they are going to get further severe
checks in the future, Yesterday, however,
the pressure was on the selling side.

“award Movse & Co. said: “We look
upon to-day’s liquidation of longs as a very
good feature and preparing the way fora
new and more permanent price moveme!
No matter what>the imperfections of the
ginners’ report may be, it means thaf ail
estimates between 13,000,000 and 14,000.00
will be shelved for the present. To that
extent it operates to cause a universal re-
duction in extreme crop figures, and is there-
fore bullish in a way. Farmers have sold a
large proportion of their crop at handsome
prices. ‘They are likely to market the balance
of their holdings slowly. They are @ power-
ful force to be reckoned with in the regula
tion of prices, and we believe the demand
from spinners will be sufficient to advance
them fram the present level, which is very
little above 10 cents.” .

Messrs. Price, Gwathmey and Weld sold
early and bought lateron. Messrs. Hubbard
Mo¥se, Shearson and Moofe were seilers
Mesars. Weld, Dick, Freeman, Mcintyre ani
Kich were buyers. ;

Carpenter, Baggot & Co, said: “Trade con
ditions are excellent, spot demand ir al! that
could be expected and the satisfying
November commitments will create a acra\)
ble for cotton. The ginners’ figures of ves

terday may cause further reduction in «rop
estimates, and if foreign manufacturers cols
into the market higher prices must rule
With the continuation of a good demand tor

future market must work closer to the price:
spots; therefore, while the movement is very
large and will no daubt continue 80, We lies
tate to express an opinion as to which
prove the stronger factor in prices for [he
near future. Any advance in prices. from
this level would tend to encourage bullish
support and probably bring in good orders
from the South, so that we are probably on
7 eve of a very decided change one way or
the other.”

Theodore Hy Price said: “Making all due
allowance for linters and city crop, there
does not seem to be a possibility that the
commercial crop for the season 1906-07 \')
exceed 11,750,000 bales. IT think it highiv
probable that the com-nercial crop, wil! fa)!
rather under than over this figure.”
