A | WEEK of CELEBRATIONS

— mere fact that the Wanamaker Store has been in New York for Ten Yearg is of small public interest.
What it has accomplisht, and what kind of a store is here today, in the old Stewart location, are matters of more
importance.
Hence our broad invitation, for you to COME AND SEE.
The New Wanamaker Building, added to the old Stewart Building, presents a plant of THIRTY-TWO ACRES AREA, for
Retailing. The twe buildings contain features that have been called some of the most interesting “sights” of New York City.
But we have provided much further for the enjoyment of those who come.
