BULLETS AIMED AT PHYSICIAN
WHO TREATED HER.

Ove Bystander, a Law Student, Is Badly
Wounded—Dr. Bierhott and the Other
Victim Get Of With Slight Injuries
—Ph)siclan Says Woman is Insane.

Dr. Frederick Bierhoff, a physician with |

® targe practice and one of the consulting

staff of the German dispensary, was fol- |

lowed from his office yesterday afternoon
hy a former wornan patient, who fired five
ebots at him at the corner of Fitty-ninth
atreet and Madison avenue. Two of these
shots struck the dootor, one in the left
ahoulder and the other in the right arm.
One of the other bullets struck Otto H.
Droege,a lawyer, of 61 Park row, and another
hit Paul Sheehan,a Columbia University
@tudent. The fifth bullet went wild.

Of the men injured young Sheehan was
hurt the worst. The bullet struck him
in the middle of the back. He was re-
moved from the Presbyterian Hospital to
St. Luke's last night and the doctors were
trving to find the bullet. Both
Droege were shot because they happened
to be in the crowd on the corner when the
woman opened her fusillade on the doctor.
TDroege escaped | with a flesh wound in the
arm

The woman who did the shooting is Ot-
tilia Sebneider, who has been living for
the last three weeks at 2196 Anthony avenue,
in The Bronx. From the fact that she
wore a bonnet fashioned somewhat after
those worn by Salvation Army lassies she
was ot first taken for a member of that
organization. She told the police that she

helonged to the Sisters of Mercy and had |

reen a sister in Germany. She haa a suit
against Dr. Bierhoff for $25,900 damages for
malpractice in the Supreme Court. The
State Medical Association ia defending it
for the doctor.

The woman told a rambling story to the
police of having been operated upon by the
doctor According to Dr. Bierhof, the
woman is a paranoiac, has been pronounced
so by experts and for the last five years
has been writing him threatening letters
under the delusion that he had injured
her

He got a warrant out for her some time
ago in the Yorkville court, but says that
the police told him they could not find her
The police believe the woman is crazy

The place selected by the wornan for the
shooting could not have been a worse one,
as there is a continual crowd transsferring
from the cars there. Dr. Bierhoff's office is
at 51 Fast Fifty-eighth street. According
to his story the woman has rever visited
bis office, but a year ago way iaid him in the
street. He had not seen her again until
yesterday

Dr. Bierhoff left his office about 2 o'clock
in the afternoon and walked east through
Fifty-eighth street, turning up Madison
avenue, The woman apparently had been
hanging about the neighborhood for some
time. Some persons were found who
thought they had remembered seeing her
pacing up and down near the corner. The
woman was behind the doctor when he
turned up Madisonavenue. He had not seen
her and walked on unconscious of what
was in store for him. She is a pale, thin-
faced woman and wore a rather expensive
Persian lamb coat and a cheap black skirt.
She had on a black t er bonnet with a
red band across it, like the Salvation Army
bonnets, only there was nothing written

_ on this band.

As Dr. Bierhoff, who is a short. slender
man, walked up the avenue towards Fifty-

‘ninth street the woman quickened her pace

nntil she was about seven feet behind him.
Trolley cars were stopping to unload pas-
sengers, and two traffic policemen, Bovle
and Long, were busy taking care of the jam
of cars and vehicles of all kinds.

Few people noticed the woman, and no-
hody paid particular attention to her. The
doctor started to cross Fifty-ninth street
from the southeast corner, and had got
about two feet from the curb when the
woman pulled out a six shooter from her
breast, levelled it at the man not five feet
ahead of her and blazed omer. The first
hyallet struck the doctor in the left shoulder
and mare him wheel around. He saw the
woman standing there with the smoking
«un in her hand, and then he started to run
around her, crouching in an effort to get
awev fromthe other shots. As he started
making circles] the woman fired again and

again. She was turning around, too, fol-
lowing the doctor. The second bullet
struck the doctor in the right arm. As the

gin kept blazing away there were shrieks
of terror from the crowds on the corner,

Young Sheehan and Droege had been
etanding on the southwest corner waiting
for cars, Sheehan fell with the bullet in
his back, but Droeege did not know that
he had been bit uniil later when the blood
began to trickle cown his arm.

fhe traffic policeman ran to the woman
and grabbed ber before she conld fire the
last cartridge in the revolver. By that
time the doctor had ceased doing circles
and was limping down Madison avenue
toward his home. Before he had gone
far two men ran up and grabbed him. The
doctor was very pale.

“Im shot. tT need help,” he gasped.

the tvo men pulled him along to where
the two policemen were holding the strug-
giing woman. As she saw the doctor she
wrenched one of her hands tree and slapped
Sim oan the face. “FI! kill you yet,” she
svreamed

Rovie and Long, the two policemen, had
to fight to get the woman into a drug store
in Madison avenue. The injure men
were taken into the same place and an
ambulance sent for. It was found that
Dr. Bierhoff's wounds were not dangerous,
end when he discovered this be asked to
he helped to his home around the corner.

roege and Sheehan were taken in the
ambulance to the Presbyterian Hospital
and the woman was sent in a patrol wagon
to the East Fifty-first street station. From
there she was taken to the Sixty-seventh
wtreet station to be searched by the matron.
It wae then discovered that she was carry-
ing a short dog whip under her skirt.

't didn’t mean to shoot him,” she said.
*I meant to fire in the air and then to horse-
whip him.” She had $15 in money and a
bundle of papers. Some of them proved to

he papers in the suit she has against the |

doctor in the Supreme Court. The suit was

hegun in March, 1903. and Howe & Hum- }

mel were her lawyers then. There were
niso what appea: to be signed statements
by doctors that they had found the woman
siffering from various troubles. At first
the said that she was a designer of patterns,
and accused the doctor of stealing some of
her designs. She said she came here from
Germany twelve years ago, and five years
ogo had gone as a patient to Dr. Bierhoff.
She told the police and reporters who ques-
tioned her that be had operated upon her
many times, and that her condition became
such that she had to go to Bellevue Hospital.
She said that she had visited the doytor first
on September 14, 1902, and that it was in the
following November that she had gone to
Bellevue. The pistol she had bought when
she came out of Bellevue.

later on send her back to Germany. He
did not do what he promised and she has
heen annoving me at intervals ever since.”

Dr. Bierhoff said that the woman was un-

him, but that her insanity fits were periodi-
eal, about every six months. Whenever
she had one of these spells, he said, she
began to make trouble for him, goihg to the
police and writing him letters. he woman,
the doctor said, had waylaid him a vear ago
at the corner of Ninth street and Third
avenue. He called a policeman, but the
latter refused to go after the woman and

would appear in court against her. The
doctor said that after this occurred he had
written to the Police Commissioner and de-
manded protection from the woman. The

warrant in Yorkville Court,

that they could find no trace of the woman

“I feel sure,” said the doctor, “that had
the police authorities given the matter the
attention which I, as a citizen and taxpayer,
had a right to demand and did demand, the
woman would have been rendered harmless.
I consider the woman far lesa responsible for

wounded to-day than I do the police authori-
ties.”

The doctor declared that when the woman
brought suit the State Medical Association
had investigated the nature of the suit and
his own conduct in the matter and had
then volunteered, as is ite
ouaree of the defence, which was done,
Dr. Bierhoff’s own lawyer, A. S. Gilbert,
retiring from the case. “As soon as the
State Medica] Association took up the de-
fence,” said the doctor, “Howe & Hum-
mell promptly dropped out. There were
attempts made to settle the suit.”

A number of physicians called upon Dr.
Bierhoff to congratulate him upon his
escape. They seemed to have heard of
the trouble Dr. Bierhoff had been having
with the woman.

The police at the Fifty-first street station
said they remembered that the doctor had
complained about the woman before. It
was also said that the woman had been

her story, and that several times detectives
had been sent to see the doctor. When
the doctor told them his side of the case
no more attention was paid to the woman's
complaint, apparently.

At the house, 218 Anthony avenue,
where Miss Schneider has been living for a
month, very little was known about her.
Mrs. Harding, the owner of the house,
said that Miss Schneider has always acted
in a perfectly sane manner, telling little
about herself. She had never mentioned
Dr. Bierhoff’s name.

Rudolph Hoff of 1420 Fifth avenue said last
night that for nearly ayear Miss Schneider
has been trying to get people interested in
her case,so that she could raise money to
press her suit. She had a number of circn-
lars printed giving details of her case and
sent them to rich people. She also posted

| The Main had passed the Savoie and the

for the Main, on the Friedrich's port quarter.

| sufferings and hai @ hips which these prov-

; inces have undergone ever since their in-
corporation with Prussia have only been

| increased and intensified in the course of

| your reign.

“Not only have their complaints not

| Ministers have answered them by new
laws, which in the eyes of all surrounding

'of a spirit of hatred, vincictiveness and
oppression .”

| that the school laws are persecution He
\ adds
| “Year by year the martyrdom of the chil-

| and weeping is louder and more frequent in

the schools. The measure is overflowing. Its

overflow brings with it, besides God's wrath
and the indignation of men, your own dis-
grace as well.”

After referring to the great wars waged
| by the Kaiser's ancestors, the letter con-
tinues

“In your day, Sire, there is but one mo-
mentous conflict, that of mighty Prussia
fighting little children. On one side are
rods and prison and on the other sice tears.”

Recalling the royal manifesto of 1867
guaranteeing that the Poles would not
suffer in their religion, language or custome
by their incorporation into the North Ger-
man Confederation, Sienkiewicz appeals to
the Kaiser to reflect upon how the promice
has been fulfiiled.

“Willyour Majesty,” he asks, “as custodian
of the honor, both of Germany and your
own line, and as the great representative
of the monarchical idea, condescend to
reflect that the honor of the meanest of your
subjects depends upon their fidelity to a
