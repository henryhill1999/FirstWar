Poth Great Northern Stock and the Cer-

tifcates When Issued Deciine—Are the
h CertiNcates Subject to Transfer Tax?
Northern Pacitio Melon Expected,

flalf the statisticians of Wall Street were
Dothered yesterday over the problem of
the value of the trust certificates which,
according to am announcement made by
dames J. Hill in the morning papers, the
Great Northern is to give to its stockholders
gs proof of ownership in the receipts of the
exe deal. That the certificates were the
richest of all the many extra disbursements
made to Great Northern stockholders
‘was apparent to all, but apart from this
generality there was wide difference be-
tween the high and low estimates of the
4{ncome from the new securities.

That speculators did not consider them
as valuable after the officia! announcement
as before was apparent from the curb
market. A few days ago, when the curb
began dealing in the security “when, as
and if issued,” it sold up to 92%, and the
minimum price in the trading prior to the
offcial announcement was 91%. That was
Wednesday's closing price and it was
yesterday's high price. From it in trans-
actions of 2,500 certificates the price re-
ceded steadily to 87, and closed at the low

int.

The idea that the forthcoming certificates
had been appraised too high was also evi-
dent in the course of Great Northern stock,
which declined from 33034 to 325, and, like
the certificates, closed at the low point of
theday. The decline was generally ascribed
to profit taking on the part of speculators
who were satisfied that stock thal certificates
both were not worth more than the current
quotations for Great Northern.

The highest estimate of the income from
the certificates was based on the official
rtatement that all the iron ore properties
held by the Lake Superior Company, Ltd.,
are to pass to holders of the trust certificates.
Very valuable mines, it was said, are held
by this company apart from those leased
to the Steel Corporation, and these were
eaid to be earning, as a fesult of leases to
various parties, nearly $4,000,000 a year,
or enough to pay 24% per cent. on the certifi-
cates. Adding to this nearly $?37,500, the
minimum receivable from the Steel Corpo-
ration, suMcient is produced to add about
1, per cent. during the first year with in-
creases subsequently as the amount of
extracted ore increases and the price in-
creases.

On the other hand, those who left out of
the calculation entirely the properties not
leased to the Steel Corporation ciphered out
that the certificates would produce in 1907
jeas than one-half of 1 per cent. This in-
come, they estimated, would ipcrease at the
rate of about one-half of 1 per cent. a year
until, in 1917, when the amount of ore to be
extracted reaches the op & the sliding
scale, *the income would about 644 per
cent. With estimates further confused
by differences of opinion regarding the
amount of ore in the beds and the actual
amount to be taken out annually, it was
felt that the problem presented plenty of
field for speculation.

During the day the interesting question
arose as to whether or not the certificates
are subject to the stock transfer tax. It
was pointed out that they have no par value,
but represent only an interest in proceeds
to come from the sale of ore. The general
idea seemed to be that by putting out
certificates rather than shares in a holding
company the Great Northern management
had discovered the first successful device
for avoiding the stock transfer tax.

It is the general understanding that the
Northern Pacific extra dividends will be
announced within a few weeks. There
was excellent corroboration yesterday of
the report that Great Northern will buy
Northern Pacifie’s equity, in Burlington,
that Northern Pacific will thereupon de-
clare a 20 per cent. cash and a 33 per cent.
scrip dividend and that Northern Pacific,
on acquiring absolute control of the Bur-
lington, will raise money for the purchase
by issuing new stock, which will give further
additional rights to stockholders.

RAILROAD EARNINGS INCREASE.

Nearly $07,000,000 More in Year Ended
June 30 Than in the Previous Year.

WasHINGTON, Nov. 22.—The net earnings
of the railroads of the United States for
the year ended’ June 30 last aggregate
$787,596,877, or nearly $97,000,000 more than
for the preceding year, according to a pre-
liminary report made by the Interstate
Commerce Commission. The income from
other sources than operation amounted to
$132,625,982, making a total of $920,221 ,859.
Against this amount were charged as inter-
eat, rents, betterments, taxes, &c., $590,386,-
654, and as dividends, $220,406,598, leaving a
surplus of $100,428,707 for the year, as against
$89,043,490 in the previous year. The divi-
dends declared in 1906 were $34,248,603 more
than in 1905.

The total gross earnings of the roads
amounted to $2,310,760,030, of which $618,-
555,034 were passenger earnings and $1,640,-
042,862 freight earnings, while the operating
expenses aggregated $1,582,163,153.

he figures given include reports from
railway companies operating 220,020 miles
of line, or about 99 per cent. of the mileage
that will be covered by the final report on
the statistics of railways for the year.

The statement as to dividends does not
embrace those paid by leased lines from the
income they received as rent.

Thresher Manufacturers Want Tariff Re-
vised,

Kkupranapous, Nov. The National
Ad@sociation of Thresher Manufacturers,
which closed its annual session here this
morning, is not afraid of foreign competi-
tion. A resolution was adopted asking
for a revision of the tariff and the removal
of the high duties on steel, iron and lum-
er, and sxpressing willingness to have no
duty on threshing machines or traction
engines brought into this country.

GOSSIP OF WALL STREET.™).

As has frequently happened in the last
year, good news was availed of yesterday
for profit taking im the general list. This was
natural, for all important developments
affecting Wall Street are more or less dis-
counted, speculators taking chances on the
rumors which generally precede official an-
nouncements. How far the reaction will
go must depend in a large measure on the
extent of the profit taking movement,
although in such cases there ia a good deal
of short selling to be reckoned with, but
conservative interests expreas the opinion
that in this instance the decline will not be
great. Bankers point to the easier situation
in money and the further help which would
be rendered by the selling of stocks in sup-
port of the contention that there is little to
worry the well margined bull at present.

The Street professed to be dissatisfied with
the terms of the Great Northern ore deal,
and the price of Great Northern on the
Exchange and of the trust certificates on
the curb declined in consequence. It was
reckoned that the highest dividend that could
be paid on the certifioates in the first year
was 3 per cent.,and as this would not give
them a higher valuation than 90 or there-
abouts Great Northern as a7 per cent. stock
would be selling at a pretty high level. In
good quarters it was said, however, that
there would be valuable rights on a new
issue of Great Northern stock early io 1907
and that at about the same time a similar
windfall would be secured by holders of
Northern Paoific.

Dealings in the Great Northern certificates
on the curb aggregated a total of 2,500 shares,
and the price dropped from 91% to 87. On
the preceding day, before the official an-
nouncement of the plan was made, quotations
ruled around 92.

Just what was going on in Amalgamated
Copper the traders were unable to guess.
There were plenty of tips and plenty of buy-
ing orders, bu. a stream of stock came from
somewhere that made it impossible for the
bulls to maintain the price above 114, and thie
tended to turn opinion toward the conclusion
that the bullish operations were in the hands
of a pool formed some days ago without the
cooperation of Standard Oil interests. The
pool operation seems to have been under-
taken in the belief that a public following
could be secured, as the rise in St. Paul had
created a strong impression that 26 Broadway
was the centre from which bullishness on the
market radiated. It has frequently been
evident that Standard Oil interests are not
disposed to tolerate encroachments on their
preserves, and unless the present pool has
aseurances of this support it can hardly be
very successful. The policy of Standard Oil
interests in regard to movements tn their own
stocks seems to be to make the move or mar it
—never to follow. °

E. H. Harriman was reported to have
reached Chicago on hia way back to New York,
and this revived the rumor that the Union
Pacifico annual report would be published in
the near future. The matter of giving the
document to the public is in Mr. Harriman’s
hands, and as he was expected to reach this
city within twenty-four hours it was believed
that Wall Street might not be kept in sus-
pense over the end of the present week. ‘The
announcement of the Great Northern plan
lent new interest to the expected document,
as of course Union Pacific’s participation in
the dea! will depend on the amount of Great
Northern which it still retains, and despite
the intimations to the contrary it is believed
that the Harriman company is still a large
stockholder in the principal Hill road.
At times when the general market showed
signs of heaviness Union Pacific maintained
good strength, but while this quality was
attributed in some quarters to favorable
anticipations of the annual report there was a
very respectable number of brokers who were
suspicious that it was really the result of
manipulation designed to conceal! realizing
in other stocks. There was apparently a
not inconsiderable short interest that had been
put out on the talis of an inquiry into the legal-
ity of some of the company’s land holdings,
and the covering of this was a factor of some
consequence. The decline in the last half
hour left the character of the day's operations
all the more doubtful.

As the Great Northern plan showed how it
could be done, thestory that the coal proper-
ties would be separated from the anthracite
roads was revived and caused a sharp ad-
vance in this group of stocks. The defect
in the rumors on the same subject heretofore
has been that the distribution of stocks of the
coal companies to holders of the stocks of the
railroads left the way open for some other
interest to obtain control of the coal proper-
ties by purchase in the market. Under the
Hill plan, or a modification of it to meet some-
what different circumstances, control of the
coal properties could be retained indefinitely
for the benefit of the stockholders of the
roads through trustees, and as of course the
beneficial certificates have no voting power
it would make little difference what hands they
fellinto. As apparently the new rate law will
compel a separation of coal properties from
the railroads, the belief is entertained that
some such plan as that announced by Great
Northern will sooner or later be adopted.

 

The consistent strength in Mexican Na-
tional issues bears out the statements made
some time ago on good authority, that at the
next dividend period the rate on the first
preferred would be increased. The initial
payment of 1 per cent. was made on August
1, the understanding at that time being that
the stock was thereby put on a 2 per cent.
basis. That it should already be practi -
cally decided to make a larger distribution
next time is strong testimony to the confi-
dence with which the leading interests in the
company regard the futureoftheroad. Mexi-
ean National is practically controlled by the
Government of Mexico, but questions of
policy, it is supposed, are largely determined
by Speyer & Co. of this city, and the well
known conservatism of that firm is a suffi-
cient guarantee that nothing will be done
that is not abundantly justified by condi-
tions—hence the significance of the proposed
action. The earnings of the road continue
to show gratifying increases, but this in itself
would not be considered a sufficient reason
for an advance in the dividend, and it may
therefore be safely inferred that the physi-
cal and financial condition of the property
is satisfactory and that there is good reaso
to believe that the improvement In the road's
affairs will be permanent.

Some other reason lurks behind the move-
ment in Delaware and Hudson than what
was adduced from the Hill ore deal as an
indication of what might be done in the way
of making stockholders direct participants
in the profits of the coal properties. That
there is another reason is evident from the
fact that the rise had already assumed large
proportions before the Great Northern plan
was announced. What this reason is few
people seem to know, but these few have been
buyers of the stock for weeks, Some of the
buyers are capitalists interested in other
anthracite roads, and it is said that after
looking into the Delaware and Hudson
affairs they came to the conclusion that there
was substantial value in the property far in
excess of the price put upon it by the market
quotations for the securities. Delaware and
Hudson owns the largest body of iron ore
now remaining outside of the hands of the
manufacturing interests since the lease of
the Great Northern ores, and it is quite possi-
ble that this fact has had a good deal to do
with the rise in the stock. It ia known that
the ¢ompany has had several inquiries as to
the terms on which it would grant mining
rights covering large sections of those lands.

Republic Iron and Steel and Tennessee
Coal and Iron advanced simultaneously on
rumors of farther progress in the scheme
for a Southern fron combination. and it was
also said that part at least of the advance
in Virginia Iron, Coal and Coke was due to
the possibility of the inclusion of this com-
pany in the proposed merger. An addi-
tional factor in the movement in Republic
Tron and Steel was that directors will soon
meet for action on the preferred dividend,
when in addition to the regular quarterly
1% per cent. an extra distribution of 2 per
cent. on account of the back dividends will
probably be declared, while there may possibly
be an announcement of a plan to pay off all
the back dividends at once and leave the way
open for the commencement of payments
on the common.

Pennsylvania has for so long been con-
sidered the rear guard of bull movements
that the traders looked upon its advance in
the firat hour with a certain amount of mis-
giving. They argued that when the rear
guard was brought to the front for action it
meant the retirement of stocks that had
previously occupied that place and for this
reason proceeded to take profits all through
the list. Of course it is not safe to assume
that Pennsylvania will always be held in
reserve to be brought out only when other
stocks have become tired, and some day the
traders who look upon the advance of this
stock as an indication of wavering among
the leaders will: probably be treated to an
unpleasant surprise. The more established
the belief becomes that Pennsylvania is the
tail end of bull movements the greater will
be the surprise when the interests having
charge of the stock in the market change
their tactics. Then indeed there may be
what in the vernacular of the Street is called
“a killing.”

IRON AND .STEEL.

 

Large Import Orders for British Pig Iron
—Lack of Steel Making Iron Closes Mills.

Liberal demands for all grades of pig iron
are reflected in domestic markets. Founders
who had anticipated a lull for December and
the fore part of January are booking so much
business that all idea of the usual between
seasons quiet weeks has been abandoned.
Several of the larger founders in stoves, hot
water and low pressure steam boilers say that
they have not got a new dollar for an old one
in the fall's business, as the rise in iron caught
them with large bookings based upon metal
and fuel at much below rates that have ruled
for two months. Machinery works find no
difficulty in getting prices for far forward
deliveries of products: based upon the ruling
costs of iron. Several large import orders
for Scotch and English iron for north Atlantie
and Gulf ports were placed yesterday. The
steamship Vizcania is loading 3,000 tons of
Cleveland pig at Middlesbrough for Boston;
freightage, 6s. 6d. a ton. The steamship
Ennisbrook is chartered from the same port
to Baltimore with 4,000 tons of mixed numbers
at 6s. per ton freightage. The steamship
Bray Head is loading 4,500 tons of foundry
and steel making iron at Glasgow for New
Orleans at 7s, 6d. per ton freightage.

There is due to arrive at north Atlantic
ports within twelve days 10,000 tons of Scotch
and English foundry pig.

At north Atlantic ports No. 1 Scotch, to
arrive, is at $23.50@8$24. Cleveland No. 3, to
arrive, is at $22.50@823. Eastern foundry
No.2 X, at furnaces, is at $24.50 for firat quarter
and $23 for second quarter. Southern foundry
No. 2, at Birmingham, is $24.60@$25 for first
quarter and $19@$19.50 for second quarter.
Mahoning and Shenango Valley bessemer and
basic are stror¢ at $21.75@$22.25. Old mate-
rials are active and strong. The recent sharp
advance stimulated heavy buying. Melters
anticipate a further advance for several
sorts of scrap.

Coke is active for prime foundry for tide-
water and for furnace grades for interior
smelting works. Few Southwestern smelters
have on hand one-half the stocks that are
usual at the opening of winter. Prices are
strong at $4.15@$4.50 for best Connellsville
foundry and $3.15@$3.40 for furnace. Vir-
ginia and West Virginia are at $3.40@34.30
for foundry and $2.90@$3.25 for furnace.
Scarcity of steel making iron has necessitated
the shutting down of several mills, and the
lack of crude and semi-finished steel is shap-
ing conditions that will compel the temporary
shortage of several finishing mills in the
West. A number of important mills are so
reduced as to stocks of steel making iron
that they are running with not more than
four to six days stock of bessemer and basic
ahead of them. Little new business in rail-
road materia! is reported, except a few orders

for electrio railroad cars and rails for the,

Fastern and Middle States.
COPPER, TIN AND LEAD.

 

Copper Markets Strong and Unchanged
—Activity In Pig Tin, Spelter and Lead.
Domestic markets are active for casting,
electrolytic and casting copper for January,
February and March. For larger tonnages
producers are selling electrolytic at 22@22);c.,

January to March, Lake, for the same
period, 22%;@23c. Casting, best grades,
January and February, 22%,@23c. The

electrical engineering corporations are en-
deavoring to place specifications forward to
June on the basis of ruling prices. So far
producers, including corporations that are
connected with these consumers in a com-
munity of interest, have declined to contract
beyond March. The engineering trades
strikes in Scotland are holding back a num-
ber of important copper specifications for
the marine engineering trades which were
to have been placed during this month. The
European markets are unchanged as to
prices between metal merchants and con-
sumers. Best selected rules at £107. The
speculative market for warrants closed at
£101 10s., spot, and £102 Iie. for forwards.
Pig tin closed at £196, spot, and £197 for
three months. The local market for pig
tin is strong at 43@43',c. Pig lead, spot, is
at 5.95@6c.

The domestic markets for pig tin, pig lead,
spelter and antimony are remarkably active
for this season. Many buyers are in the
market for these metals in large amounts
required for manufactures that must be
shipped in January.

Passage of Constitutional Amendment
Revives an Old Pian.

The California Improvement
learned yeaterday that a recount of the
vote on a California constitutional amend-
ment repealing the tax on mortgages field
by non-residents showed that the amend-
ment had been adopted. The adoption of
the proposition is certain to have an im-
portant effect in bringing money into San
Francisco for rebuilding purposes, and
very likely it will revive the comprehensive
plan of rebuilding formulated last spring
by H. 8S. Black, president of the United
States Realty and Improvement Company;
F. A. Vanderlip, vice-president of the
National City Bank, and others.

The plan was announced early in May,
after it became certain that Congress would
advance no money for rebuilding purposes.
Thomas Magee, a wealthy property owner
of San Francisco; Senator Newlands of
Nevada and Congressman Lane of San
Francisco cooperated with Messrs. Black
and Vanderlip in formulating it. . Generally
it contemplated the formation of a company
to operate after the fashion of the European
mortgage banks.

The company was to have a capital of
$10,000,000, but was to be so operated that
it would be able to finance rebuilding to
the amount of $75,000,000 or $100,000,000.
It was to make mortgage loans at 5% or
6 per cent., iasue bonds secured by t!
loans and sell the bonds to the publio at a
rate of interest one-half of 1 per cent. less than
the interest rate on the mo . This one-
oo. per cent. oneese was to be retained

y company for operat; expenses,
and, togemer with ciate at the prin-
cipal of the mortgages, to be in a

king fund for the retirement of the bonds.
t was officially announced that the com-
was to be organized at once, but when
he plan was turned over to the lawyers
they discovered an impediment in that
section of the California State Constitu-
tion which is now re led. The situation
was explained to the San Francisco relief
committee, and it was in this way that the
movement for the repeal of the section
originated. °
t is probable, however, that the revived
plan will not be on such a comprehensive
plane as was intended last sp , forthe
reason that much of the rebui has
since then been financed in other he
A meeting of those interested will probably
be held early next week.

 

MISCELLANEOUS MARKETS.

Coffee Moves Within Narrow Limits —Pro-
visions Easier.

Coffee fluctuated within a marrow range.
At the opening the tone was somewhat easier
owing to lower cables from Europe and acat-
tered liquidation, together with more or less
foreign selling and some pressure from room
shorts. Later on, however, the feeling be-
came steadier. Selling was checked by un-
favorable crop reports, which caused cévering.
There issteady, if quiet, buying foranadvance,
however, by those who think coffee has merits
and is selling unduly low. A cable from
Havre stated that better prices were expected
in the near future. Prado, Chaves & Co.
cabled from Santos: “Surtax of three francs
will be imposed in Rio and Minas Geraes during
December. Next crop reports become worse
every day.”

Coffee on the spot was quiet at 7 "4c. for No.

FINANCIAL NOTES.

The Sub-Treasury yesterday transferred
$500,000 to San Francisco, making $1,250,000
in two days. Like Wednesday's transfer, the
money is needed on the Coast for moving the
citrus fruit crop.

Robert W. Nelson, president of the Ameri-
can Type Founders’ Company, and August
Schierenberg of the firm of Herklotz, Corn
& Co. have been elected directors of the
Mutual Alliance Trust Company. ~

Francis F. Palmer, Joseph B. Crocker,
John H. Auerbach and John F. L. Curtis have
been elected members of the Stock Exchange.

Latrobe Steel Company Litigation.

In the United States Circuit Court at
Philadelphia hearings have been proceed-
ing for the past week in a suit brought
against the Latrobe Steel Company by
Charles H. Ferry of New York, its largest
stockholder, to restrain the directors from
subscribing $700,000 of the company’s
funds to the stock of the Latrobe Steel
and Coupler Company. The Latrobe Steel
Company, formerly one of the richest steel
producers in Pennsylvania, has sold its
plant and is in liquidation. Four hundred
dollars per share hes already been divided
among stockholders, and Mr. Ferry sues
to compel a cash distribution of the remain-
i assets, amounting to several million
dollars, claiming that as the company (ns

one out of business its funds must be
Fivided and cannot be put into a new enter-

rise. Many prominent Philadelphians are
interested in the company, including E. B.
Morris of the Girard Trust Company and
E. T. Stotesbury of Drexel & Co., and the
case has excited much interest. Frank
R. Lawrence of New York is counsel for
the plaintiff, and John G. Johnson of Phila-
delphia represents the company.
