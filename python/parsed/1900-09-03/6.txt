LABOR'S IDLE DAY.

A alight Increase was observable Inst week
in the volume of transactions on the Stock
Exohanas, but it was nothing like enough
to be accepted as betokening a revival of publie
{interest in the market, SUll, the so-called
apathy of citizens whose interests are threatened
by a Bryanite victory In the coming Presiden-
tla) elaction by no means proves that they are
jukewarm in their desire to prevent it. The
aotivity of the partisans of destruction and

ent condition of business, the
closing of the Stock Exchange last Saturday,
as well as to-day, involves little loss to {ta mem-
bers, but, ordinarily, the curtailment of one
week by half a day, and of the next by a whole
one, would make a considerable inroad upon
their commissions. To workingmen, however,
the loss in wages, and to employers whore
operations are for the eame period suspended,
that in profite, must be immense. Calling, too,
a day of idleness, “Labor Day,” ia a queer com-
of words, The Idea, undoubtedly,

but the effect has been to formulate an ex-

offend aritical taste.

Names, however, are of trifting importance
compared © ith the things they represent to the
mind. In this case, whether to-day be called

Labor Day or Idieness Day, it is none the less

established, it indicates a tendency, the
importance ef which from an economic
potnt of view 1s very great Sunday sum

for a seventh of our time,
half holiday for a fourteenth
—and practically, with many people, for a
eeventtr—while, besides theses, there are in
this State New Year's Day, Election Day, and
other legal holidays to the number of nine, with
cocasional spectal additions. Out of 365 days
of the year, therefore, 118 at least are either
wholly or partly industrially non-productive.

That human beings are incapable of com
tinuous, unbroken activity, and therefore
need intervals of rest, no one disputes. The
muscles and the nervous system become ex-
hausted after afew hours’ exertion, and nothing
but inaction enables them to regain their capac
ity for fresh effort. Over the greater part
of the globe, too, the darkness of night seeme
to provide naturally, and even to compel,
this needed cessation of effort, and where arti-
fia! {uminants are used, or daylight is ex-
traordinartly prolonged, or continuous labor
fe troperative, relays of men must relieve one
another to give to each an opportunity for
sleep. Thus, eallors at sea are divided Into
watches, {ron workers into shifts, and in other
industries there are day hands and night hands
who succeed each other at stated periods.

Mankind too, naturally, dislikes work and
prefers idleness. Hence. at an early pertod, ft
added to the periodical cessation of toll com-
pelled by darkness, whole days devoted to
religious and political festivals. The division
of the Innar month into weeks of seven days
each, and the observance of one day in each
wook as a festival, was not original with Moses.
It had already been adopted in India and other
Agetio countries, and the assumed sacredness
of the number seven was « result and not the
cause of the practice. The period of time
marked by the moon's revolution around the
earth, although {t was a needed intermediate
between the day and the year, was, as a
whole, too long for convenience.and was, there-~
fore, further divided into quarters correspond-
{ng to the moon's changes. These quarters,
consisting of about seven days each, became
the week as weetillhaveit, The displacement
of the Greek and Roman divisions of the month
by the Hebrew week, and the tenacity with
which Christians as well as Hebrews adhere to
the observance of one day in that week as a day
of rest. seems to indicate that their practice {is
founded upon natural law, and should not, there-
fore, be assailed without better reasons than
have as yet been adduced against it. It is
also worthy of note that im the year 958, under
Edgar the Peaceful, one of the Saxon Kings of
England, the Sunday cessation of labor was
commanded to begin at nones, or three o'clock
on Saturday afternoon, thus anticipating by
nearly a thousand years our present Saturday
balf holiday. In Roman Catholio countries
numerous saints’ days and Church festivals have
been added to Sunday, as days of religious ab-
stinence from work. Fven in Protestant Eng-
land, Ash Wednesday, Good Friday, Whit Mon
day and some other purely Church fasts and
feaste are legal holidays.

Against the love of idleness, and the multipli-
cation of holidays to gratify it, must be set off
in certain reaiona the stern requirements which
soll and climate make of inceseant labor to sus-
tain life. In Scotland, Sweden, Switzerland,
New England, and other countries little favored
by nature, the struggle for existence can be
@bandoned only under the penalty of extinction.
Hence, their inhabitants are industrious as well
as frugal, and cease labor only when strict relig-
fous duty demands it. As we approach the
tropics, and in proportion as the bounty of na
ture provides food without human aid, holidays
are more frequent unt] in some localities one
day's work in the week and even leas, is all that
aman needs to support himaelf and his famflr.
No law there makes holidays imperative: they
are observed spontaneously.

More than this, the progress of the race {n
civilization has added new and artificial wants
to those of primitive savagery, and multitudes
labor, now, not merely for food and clothing,
but for luxurtes and enjoyvments. In this
country, for example, few of its inhabitants
are content todo no more than barely keep them-
wlves alive. The consumption of beer, spirits
tnd tobacco alone indicates this, and when to
the monay spent for these stimulants we add
that expended upon the finer kinds of food,
upon costly wines, beautiful garments, elegant
dwellings and amusements of various kinda,
we have a total far surpassing that required
te purchase necessaries. Now, luxuries cannot
be had without labor, and whenever the com-
pensation for laber is insufficient to pay for
them discontent springs up. Most people,
too, are not satisfied with merely gratifying
thelr wants from day to day. They wish to
fooumniate a surplus either as a provision for
the future or as a capital with which to increase
thelr present gains. To such people every
day subtracted by law from their laboring time
teens a clear loss, and they are, therefore,
Opposed to increasing the number of legal
holidays and in favor of reducing It.

On the other hand, the advocates of frequent
holidays insist, with a show of plausibility,
that they rather increase than diminish in-
dustrial productivity, They argue that, as @
+i Feat enables a man to work more ef-

*ly the following day than if he were

As for working now in order to be able to rest
at some remote period hereafter, they ask why
{t would not be wiser to take some, at least,
of that rest now, while intervals of work make
itenjoyable. It is well known that no man ia
#80 unhappy as he who has been accustomed to
be busy but no longer has anything to
busy himself with. Even the few favorites
of fortune who are not obliged to work ‘or a
Mving, work at amusing themselves as sedii-
lously as if they were getting paid for it, and
devote to sports and pastimes as much energy
@s would be expended in acquiring riches. The
happiest man, undoubtedly, is one who has a
useful occupation, which does not burden him
with anxious care, and which leaves him free
to take a holiday when he pleases. Such men,
however, are few. For the vast majority there
{a no half-way between engrossing, unremitting
toll and irksome idleness, Success in any call-
