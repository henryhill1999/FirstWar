MRS. JESSE R. GRANT |
SUES FOR SUPPORT

General's Son, She Charges, vir-|
tually Deserted Her 50
Ago.

 

Years

 

Jesse Root Grant, son of the late Gen.
Ulysses 8 Grant, was made defendant In

|a suit brougat in the Supreme Court yes-

terday by his wife, Mrs, Elizabeth Chap-
man Grant, who allewes that her husband
virtually deserted her thirty years ago
und hae refused to contribute to her sup-
port most of the time

The auit, which seeks to recover a part
income of $5,490 a year which
Grant receives from two trust funds, fol-
lows the dismissal of a suit for divorce

since,

of the

brought by Grant against his wife in
Reno, Nev., in which the court refused
to find that Mrs. Grant deserted her
husband,

In the divorce sult as well as in the
sult brought here yesterday Mrs. Grant
has the support of her daughter, Mrs. Nellie

| Grant Cronan, wife of Lieutenant-Com-

mander Cronan, U. 8. N., and her son, Lieut.
Chapman Grant, U. 8. A. She names her
children as defendants in the suit brought
here because they have an interest in the
trust funds involved, but both filed no-
tices waiving any claim to the money

The other defendant named {fs the United
States Trust Company, trustee under the
will of Mra, Julia Dent Grant, widow 9f |

| the President, and also trustee of a fund |
| raised in 1888 by public subscription for

the benefit of Mrs. Grant.

In her complaint Mrs, Grant says that
Mrs, Julia Dent Grant died in 1902, leav-
ing her estate in trust and providing that}
her son Jesse was to get one-fourth of
the income, which was to be used for the
support of his family. Jesse Grant’a in-
come from thia fund is £8,000. He has
an additional income of $2,400 from a
fund of $220,000 raised In 1888 by George
Jones and put in trust. }

Mrs, Grant says ehe married her hus-,
band in 1880 and that the expenses of |
the marriage were paid by his mother.
She and her husband lived with Mrs, |
Julia Dent Grant until her death in 1902, |
during which time the latter paid the en- |
tire expense of maintaining the househotd |
and allowed her son Jesse $250 a month, |
He contributed little or nothing to the
household expenses, the plaintife says. |
Mrs. Grant says that after the death of
her mother-in-law her husband pald her
$250 a month until 1910 with the excep-
tion of two years, when he paid her only
3500 a yeur.

The piaintift alleges that her husband
has absented himself from home for long
periods, during which time he was “not
engaged in any business but solely pur-
suing his own pleasure.” Since 1910 her!
husband had not supported her or lived
with her, nor permitted her to live with
him. In addition to the $5,400 Income
he has received large sums in his profes-
sion as a civil engineer. During thie
time the plaintiff's only means of support
has been $100 a month rent from a house
she owns in San Diego, Cal.

Mra Grant asks for a reusonable pro-
vision for her support from her hus-
band's income of $5,400.

With Batcher and His Clerk,
Derrorr, June 20.-—-Tyrus Cobb, boll-

ing with rage, suffering with a thumb be-

Neved to be broken and dishevelled from

a street fight, was put into a patrol

wagon to-night and taken to the police

, station and locked up.

W. L. Carpenter, proprietor of a meat
market on Hamilton Boulevard, says he
will prosecute Cobb for threatening te
kill him and backing up the threat by
thrusting a revolver in his face.

The trouble, Carpenter said, arose over
the sale of a fish to Mrs, Cobb, An argu-
ment over the telephone ensued, in which
the butcher said Mrs. Cobb told him she
was through trading there,

“I am glad of it, as | don't want your |
trade," Carpenter said he told Mrs. Cobb. :
Later Cobb went to Carpenter's store, |

“Cobb acted like a crazy man, flour-
ishing his wun about and telling me he |
would blow my head off,” said Carpenter.
“He said I insulted his wife. T told him
1 never saw his wife and wouldn't know
her if I saw her.”

Harold Harding, 20 years old, employed

by Carpenter, thrust himself in front of
his employer and, it Is said, Cobb knocked

Harding down |

Carpenter took a hand and was
promptly knocked down, The police ar-
rived then and Cobb was arrested,

At a late hour to-night Charles Navin,
secretary of the Detroit Baseball Club,
went into conference with Capt. Palmer
in regard to getting Cobb released. Cobb
had a badly cut right hand, and it ts

and who founded several milk dairies in|
this elty on the same lines as the Straus

Dr. de Rothschild, who is one of the!

tended a gala performance at the Opera!
for the benefit of M. Antoine, the former |
manager of the Odeon, who lost all his
money in that venture and was then a
moved from the management. At the
close of the performance Dr. de Rothe
ehild started home with Dr. Leon Zadoe-
Kahn, chief physician at the Rothschild
Hospital, They had walked but a short
distance when they noticed a man follow-
ing them. Upon reaching the grand boule-
vards the man suddenly fired five shoe
at M. de Rothschild, one of which hit
him in the left leg. Dr, de Rothschild
fell, but was quickly picked up and driven
to his residence in the Rue de Faubourg

The man who fired the shots was ar-
rested. He sald his name was Prudhon

markable accidents tn the history of
aviation.

a few miles
from here, this morning for the purpose
of taking photographs of the troops
underneath, who were participating tn
the army manceuvres and whose move-
ments were being watched by a great

The commander of the

began a sham attack on the bieger ma-

The pilot of the biplane suddenly
mane@uyred his machine with the idea
of taking a position directly over the
airship in such a manner that in actual
warfare he could drop a bomb on the
balloon, No one knows exactly what
happened, as every one aboard both
craft was killed, but the pilot of the
smaller machine must have made a

Verrific Explosion Follows.

The collision was followed by a terrific
explosion, which was probably caused
by a spark from the motor of the aero-
plane igniting the gas escaping from
the balloor. HKoth machines were im-
mediately enveloped in flames and they
came down from a height of 1,300 feet
together, in a masse of wreckage alight-
ing on the slope of Koenigsberg hill.
Every man in both machines was killed
or burned to death and the bodles were
mutilated and charred beyond recogni-
tion.

The collision occurred so quickly and
unexpectedly that the troops and people
| below were dumfounded for a moment,
but the soldiers soon recovered their calm-
ness and rushed up the hill to the point
where the wrecked machines lay. The
nine bodies were all found close together.
