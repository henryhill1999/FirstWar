1as approved will not preclude the pros-|
ae of labor unions for acts in vio-
lation of the anti-trust laws.

His supporters in the House, who
in drafting the amendment, |
have advised him that the language to!

 

| be added to the Clayton bill will merely |

clarify that section which deals with!
labor organizations and that It will not
in fact exempt them from prosecution,

The Administration's defence is not,
however, very convincing in the face of}
the complete satisfaction that now pre-
in the labor camp. At best a
grave question of doubt seems to be
by the amendment, which !{s to,
be added to the first paragraph of gec-|
of the Clayton bill, That para-|

| graph reads:

“That nothing contained in the
anti-trust laws shall be construed to
forbid the existence and operation of
fraternal, consumers’, agricul- |
tural or horticultural organizations,
orders or associations operating under
the lodge instituted for
purpose of mutual help and not hav-
ing capital stock or jucted for
profit or to forbid or restrain indi-
vidual members of such orders or aas-
from carrying out the
objects of such waesocia-

soclations

tions.”

The Amendment, |
Through the acceptance of the amend-
ment the following has been added;
“Nor shall such organizations, or-
ders or associations or the members
thereof be held or construed fllegal
combinations or conspiracies in re-
straiut of trade under the anti-trust
law.” j
It is believed here that the Wilson Ad-
ministration by its action has lald itself
open to all the criticlam which may arise | ‘
from class legislation. The belief is that)
eventually Administration will have)
to answer charge of exempting a
certain class from the operation of a law
of the land.
There was a
acterize the
first conspicuous surrender to the exigen-
cles of politics.
The argument which was used with tell-
ing effect Was that unless the Democrats
gave the unions what they

the
the

tendency
President's

here to char-
action as hig

wanted :

would be a tremendous number of casual-
ties among the Democratic candidates in
the elections this fall. The ranks of those
demanding the exemption was increased by
members from agricultural districts who
desired the exemption for farmers’ organt!-
zations,

The first concession to the unions was |
made by the Administration when the
anti-trust bill was introduced early tn
April with the section 7 quoted above.
This section, it was contended, gave the
unions a status in law that they had never
enjoyed before, but did not prevent prose-
eutions for acts described by the bill as

illegal.
Having got a taste, the labor leaders
wanted a bite. They entered upon an ag-

gressive fight for further changes in the

Clayton bill which would accomplish the
full exemption. Seventeen of the repre-
sentatives of labor, headed by Representa-
tive Lewis of Maryland, chairman of the
House Committee on Labor, undertook to
spread the propaganda jn favor of the
further amendment of the Clayton bill,

The campaign for this purpose came to
a head yesterday when the labor leaders
and thetr supporters decided to call a
caucus of the House Democrats and write
the desired amendment Into the Clayton
bill over the head of the President unless |
{ts adoption should be agreed to by the}
Administration.

Union labor is further placated by a
second amendment, which Administration
leaders have agreed to incorporate in the!
anti-tryst bill, This amendment will fol-
low section 19 of the Clayton bill, which
forbids the Issuance of injunctions against |

“peaceful assemblage, pieketing and boy-
ecotting by the unions.” Referring to
such acts the amendment will read:
“Nor shall any of the acts épeci-
fied in this paragraph be construed
or held to be unlawful.”

WASHINGTON, May 26.— Theodore
Roosevelt made to-night the firet pub-
lic statement on politics to which he has
given utterance since he returned to the

Col. Theodore] the party and there was resort to forag-| United States.

Much signifieance was attached to the
fact that Mr. Roosevelt couched hie

most distinguished residents of Washing-|in the monkey house of any z00 in the; that he did not have a harsh word to
,Say about the Republican party or Re-

ton in politics, diplomacy and science, he
gave the first public account of his ex-
periences in the wilds of Amazona,
The dingy hall was crowded to suffoca. |
tion. It was ill ventilated and situated

on top of a huge retail market,

from | line

which the customary aromas of the meat)

and vegetable stalls arose to permeate the
atmosphere, but this did not incommode
the Colonel.

He insisied that he had put a big
river on the map; that he was prepared
to prove his contention against all critics
and that he was willing even to help them
wo and find what he had found, Also the
Colonel told his auditors that he had
learned to eat monkey meat and stewed
parrot during his South American Jour-
neyings.

Col. Roosevelt was scheduled to speak
It was nearly 8:30 when he ar-
rived tn the hall. He was accompanied by
Grosvenor, secretary of the
National Geographic Society, under whose

new

| auspices the lecture was to pe delivered ;

Anthony Fiala, Prof. Zahm of the Cath-

fean Museum of Natural History and Mr.

venor all were members of the Amazonian
expedition.

Briton did not so much as smile at the
thrust.

Apparently dissatisfied with not having
got a ‘rise’ out of the Britisher he
condemned the big map of South America
which the Geographic Society itself had
furnished him for illustrative purposes,
The Colonel walked to the map and with
his back to the audience tried his ap-
parent best to figure out where he had
been, and failing he told the audience
that the map was altogether out of line
with the truth, that it had mountains
where there was in reality a valley and
that the rivera ran the wrong way and
that confluences with other rivers were

The Colonel's assertions were firm and
emphatic in regard to the river which his
party traversed and which has been
subject of controversy ever since the first |
cldims of the returning party were con-
veyed to Foreign Minister Lauro-Muller of
the Republic of Brazil.

The Colonel's river, according to his dis-
course to-night, is as long as elther the
Rhine or the Elba, It is double the length
of the Seine or the Rhone, It ts filled
with rapids racing through chasms in
many instances and of no value as a nay-
igable waterway. Nevertheless, the Col-
onel promised any one who desired to
make the trip letters of introduction to
rubber men with plantations along the
lower reaches of his river and he assured
them that the work of a second expedition
through the wilds would be vastly facill-
tated by his own efforts,

Mr. Roosevelt eulogized the Progres-
sive Senators and Representatives, and
announced that he would take his part
in the campaign this year. He sald that
he would speak in Pennsylvania, and
possibly in California, but gave notice
that his appearances would be limited in
number.

Mr. Roosevelt will make his initial
appearance in the campaign this year
on the occasion of the Progressive con-
ference, to be held in Pittsburg on June
30, to further the candidacies of Gifford
Pinchot for the Senate and of Repre-
eentative Lewis of that Slate, a Proe

At the conclusion of Mr. Roosevelt's
| brief speech he requested all those not
members of the Progressive Congres-
sional committee to withdraw in order
that the Progressives might have a full
and free conference. Mr. Roosevelt and
his associates then went into executive
session.

Mr. Roosevelt's Addrens.
Mr. Roosevelt's speech follows:

I am not going to have any inter-
views to-night, but there {s one
Statement I want to make. I came
here primarily to attend the Geo-
graphic Soclety's meet; secondarily,
I wanted to see the Progressive
Senators and Representatives ig
Congress because I feel that a big
debt is owing to them for what they
have done and the way they have
borne themselves under most trying
circumstances.

I wish to state this:

Men who face a crisis are either
overwhelmed by It or else grow ie
stature because of passing through it.
You men have faced a@ real crisis.

You have been tried as no other
body of men tn either house of
Congress has been tried for sixty
years past-—-I mean not since the
first man who championed the prin-
ciples of Abraham Lincoln came to
Congress.

You have been exposed to every
form of attack from both sides and
you have so borne yourselves as to
force the respect of your enemies,
I speak from my heart when I say
that my original feeling of sym-
pathy has changed. I feel no
sympathy at all now. I feel ad-
miration, respect and a small de-
gree of envy.

Will Be in the Campaign.

Of course I wish to take my part
in the campalgn this year. But it
will not be possible for me to speak
a dozen times a day. It is quite
impossible for me to be in forty
different places at once,

I have been asked by Representa-
tive Lewis and Mr. Pinchot, who
will open the campaign in Pennsyl-
vania at the second Progressive
conference in Pittsburg on June 30,
to be present on that occasion, Of
course I shall accept.

I have written Gov, Hiram John-
son that if my presence is desired
