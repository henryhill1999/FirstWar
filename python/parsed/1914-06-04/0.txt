Mrs. Adele Scott of 103 Bostwick ave-
nue, Jersey City, lay dreaming of burglars |
early yesterday morning while real bur-

glars were turning things topsy turvy in

The first impression that forced its)

the sight of her husband running around,

“Buralars have been here,” he said |

Mrs. Scott screamed and looked for her

Then Mrs. Scott recalled her dream she |
had dreamed of burglars in the room ad-

up in her sleep, gathered her Jewels to- |

Scott's bathrobe. Upon remembering her
dream she looked in a wardrobe and
found her watch and rings in the pocket |
of her husband’e bathrobe.

The burglars entered the house through
a window on the first floor and made their

BEE GIVES EDISON EDISON INSPIRATION.

Watching Flight,
Airship.

PHILADELPHIA, June 3.—Thomas A. Fdl-
son arrived in the city to-day to attend
the convention of the National Electric
Light Association. As the Inventor and
his wife were on their way to this city
from New York by automobile to-day they
passed through a shady glen. Fitting
among the trees was a bumble bee,

“Do you know,” sald Mr. Edison, “as I
watched that bee I realized that a real
plane, a heavier than air machine of great
weight, can be bullt as soon as we obtain
something that beats the air at the rate of
200 times a second,

“That bumble bee was one inch long,
three-eighths of an inch In diameter, with
a wing one-quarter inch wide and five
eighthe of an Inch long. The wings
weighed a willogram, That bee weighed
7,000 times more than his wings. If we
can only get to that, get to that-—-the
greatest thing for the smallest wing-——that
is the thing. The bee's wings beat the air
300 times a second.

“A bee works on sound waves. Remem-
ber the air is rigid as steel if the pressure |
is oniy sudden enough. Give us something
that beats the air 200 times a second and
we will neve a real plane.”

upon the destructive characteristics of
this legislation was startling even to
members of Congress He contended
that it would d srupt many cf the great
‘ rallroad systems, that under {it the
Union Paci would be separated from
the Oregon Short Line, that would
impair the a of railroad securities
and that some systems would be forced
into the hands of receivers because they
would not be able under t to finance
their necessities

Similar opiniones expressed by
A. H. Harris, general counsel of the New
York Central, Judge Lovett and Mr,
Harris appeared as witnesses before the
Senate Committee on Interstate Come
merce.

Discussing the provision which prevents
interlocking directorates for common car-

form the bill would force the dissolution
of the most important lines of the United
