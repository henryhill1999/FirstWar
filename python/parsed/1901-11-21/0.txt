Wounded in Engagement Between In-
gorgents and Government Ferces —Com-
munication With Panama Restored.

Special Cadle Despaich to Tam Sun.

Covox, Nov, 20.—The city of Colon is

ion of the Liberals,

One hundred and sixty men took and paid
for passage by railroad train last evening
from Las Cascadas. They arrived in the
town at 8 o'clock and attacked the defend-

ing force.

After a fight that lasted an hour they
took the town’s Prefect prisoner. Fourteen
men were killed and twenty-two wounded,

Traffic is not impeded.
The United States gunboat Machias
landed a force at the railroad station this

morning.

WasHINGTON, Nov. 20.—-A number of
telegrams were received at the State De-
partment to-day from the United States
consular officers at Panama and Colon
emfirming the report of the capture of the
latter city by the Liberals or insurgents.

Following the receipt of these messages
a conference was held at the White House
between President Roosevelt, acting Secre-
tary of State Hilland Rear Admiral Crown-
inshield, Chief of the Naval Bureau of Navi-
gation. The conference resulted in the de-
snatch of instructions to the United States
Consul-General at Panama and Capt. Perry,
of the battleship Lowa, at the same place,
to insist that free transit across the
Isthmus be preserved and to use the naval
force of the United States to prevent any
inte! tion of it,
The first despatch received by the State
Department was in regard to the activity
of the insurgents at Colon and did not
mention the capture of that place. It
was apparently sent before the town was
taken. This message was from Consul-
General Gudger at ma. In it he said

vat “a considerable number" of Liberals

{ taken possession of the transisthmian
tailroad at a certain point, cut the tele-

raph wire and removed a rail, In a later

atch Mr. Gudger reported that Colon
had been taken by the Liberals.

Further information came from Mr.

almros, the United States Consul at Colon.

e telegraphed that Colon had been taken

v the rebels last night, and while all busi-

oss was suspended, transit across the
heme was not interrupted and American
life and property were safe and not likely
to be endan ered .

The next despatch was from Lieutenant-

‘commander eCrea, commanding the
"8. gunboat Machias at Colon 6 re-
ported:

*The insurgents have Pp ame of the
city, At the request of the proper au-
thorities I have landed forces for the _pro-
tection of the property of the railroad.”

In their interview with President Roose-
velt, which took place in the President's
office, Mr. Hill and Admiral Crowninshield
explained the situation on the Isthmus
with particular reference to the prompt
action of Lieutenant-Commander McCrea
in landing his men. Authority for that
course is found in the treaty between the
United States and New Granada, now the
Vnited States of Colombia, by which this
Government obligates itself to keep transit
across the Isthmus open at all times. Amert-
can marines were landed there in the revo-
lution of 1885. Since the outbreak of the
present insurrectionary movement  fre-
quent notice has been given to the inhabi-
tants of the lathmus the Liberal! forces
by Consul-General Gudger that the United
States Government would adhere strictly
to ite treaty obligations and that trouble
would be avoided by armed bands if rail-
read traffic were permitted to proceed
Fithout interference

President Roosevelt approved the course
of Lieutenant-Commander MeCrea, aod
gr authority for sending instructions to

r Gudger to notify all ties who are
engaged in molesti or interfering with
free transit across the Isthmus that such
interference must cease, and directing him
to consult with Capt. Perry of the lowa
Instructions of the same character were
tent to Capt. Perry

The capture of Colon is the greatest
victory the Liberals have achieved in the
+ protracted insurrection, and it is

he greater blow to the Colombian Govern-
Tent on account of the recent official decla-
fetions that the rebellion had been crushed

PASTOR WRITES NOVELS.

+ Dr. Ludlow Accused by Church Mein-
ber of Neglecting Pastoral Duties.

East Onanag, N. J., Nov. 20.—The Rev.
Dr. James M. Ludlow, D. D., the historical
writer and author of “Deborah” has been
severely criticised by a prominent member
of his church, the Munn Avenue Presby-
terian Church at East Orange, for neglect-
ing his duties as pastor in order that he
might write novels. The church is one of
the largest and most fashionable in the
Oranges. In a circular which was sent to
members of the congregation, the writer,
William 8. Wensley of South Maple avenue,
East Orange, declared that people who
went to church twice on Sunday were not
strengthened spiritually by a book review.
“Do we not,” the circular continues, “need
@ preacher, instead of a man whose heart
is with ancient history and modern litera-
ture and ld we not have one for the
salary we pay? One with an irresistible
desire to prepare a sermon for Sunda.
evening instead of a talk about a boo
he has read for his diversion, or secular
edication?” The writer suggested that Dr.
Ludlow devote himself exclusively to litera-
ture.

The Rev. Dr. Ludlow said last night
that the people of the community had
known him for fifteen years and that he
would leave the case to their judgment.
Asked whether he intended adopting a
literary career, he replied that just the
contrary was the case, that in the past
aix weeks he had declined the offers of
three publishing houses on the ground
that he never allowed such work to inter-
fere with his duties as minister. His
literary work, he said, was done chiefly
in vacations. Dr. Ludlow is popular in
his congregation and in the city.

THE BROOKLYNPOSTMASTERSHIP

Organization Will Insist on Appointment
of Moberts.

The resignation of Postmaster Francis
H. Wilson of Brooklyn, which was forwarded
to Washington on Friday, to take effect
on the appointment of his successor, has
caused much gossip in political circles,
although Mr. Wilson declared yesterday
that politics had nothing whatever to do
with his resignation. He said, further,
that he was going to Washington before
the end of the week to see President Roose-
velt and that he would have no further
statement to make until after his return.

The Republican leaders in Brooklyn are
all deeply interested over the choice of Mr.
Wilson's successor, and they will be greatly
disappointed if George H. Roberts, Jr, is
not the man.

All along Mr. Roberts, indeed, has been
the only candidate in sight. The news,
therefore, which came to Brooklyn from
Washington on Tuesday that President
Roosevelt had decided not to appoint Mr.
Roberts and had asked for the submission
of other names gave the local statesmen
an unpleasant shock. The interest in the
controversy was increased yesterday when
another despatch was received in Brook!wa
announcing that President Roosevelt had
been in conference with Lieut.-Gov. Wood-
ruff and former Mayor Schieren in reference
to the postmastership. Mr. Woodruff,

 

Rev

 

according to the despatch, made this state-
rent before his call at the White House:

“The Republican ongaatgeticn of Kings
county is unanimously behind Messrs.

Roberta and Sharkey and will have no
other candidates for the offices of Post
master and Naval Officer. [ shall tell
President this in language that cannot
misunderstood. We have no _ second
choice, no compromise candidates, and
if the President declines to a int Mr.
Roberts and Mr. Sharkey he will have to
go outside the organization for his men
“The organization has not selected Mr.
Roberts at vard, and we are willing
to stand or fall with him. I «hall tell the

President that I regard him to be fit and |

fully up to the standard of qualifications
that he has set
to take the organization candidates for
these two offices, he will, I think, regret it.”

DR. BURGESS ELECTED BISHOP
CHOSEN TO SUQCEED THE LATE

 

Ten Ballots Were Taken and the Con-
vention Did Not Adjourn Untlt 1
o'Clock This Morning — There Were
Eighteen Candidates in the Field.

Garven City, N. Y., Nov. 21,--Shortly
before 1 o'clock this morning, on the tenth
ballot, the special convention of the Dio-
cese of Long Island chose the Rey. Dr.
Frederic Burgess of Grace Church, Brooklyn,
to be the second Protestant Episcopal
Bishop of Long Island, in succession to
the late Bishop Littlejohn.

Dr. Burgess came to Brooklyn from St
John’s Church, Detroit, and succeeded
the Rev. Dr. Chauncey B. Brewster, who
about three years ago was chosen 0oo-
adjutor to Bishop Williams of Connecticut,
and upon the death of Bishop Williams
succeeded to the Bishopric.

Dr. Burgess is a widower with several
children. He is a member of the Governing
Board of the Church Charity Foundation.

Dr. Burgess received 54 clerical votes
out of 106 and 46 lay votes out of 77.

There were 116 clergymen and 243 lay-
men in the convention, and their votes
were scattered among eighteen candidates
for more than seven hours. At 9 o'clock
a choice seemed no nearer than when the
balloting began in the afternoon, and the
delegates were so far from being eager to
come to an agreement that a call for a
caucus of the laity had just been voted
down.

The principal candidates in nomination
were the Rev. Dr. Reese F. Alsop of St.
Agnes's Church, the Rev. Dr. Samuel D.
MeVonnell of Holy Trinity, the Rev. Arthur
Boxtail Kinsolving of Christ Church, the
Rev. Dr. Henry (. Swentzel of St. Luke's,
the Ray. Dr. James H. Darlington of Christ
Church, all of Brooklyn: the Rev. Henry
G. Bryan, canon of the Cathedral and arch-
deacon for Queens-Nassau, of Garden
City, and the Rev. W. R. Huntington of
Grace Church and the Rev. Dr. Henry
Lubeck of the Church of Zion and St. Tim-
othy, Manhattan.

Half a dozen efforts were made
to secure the withdrawal of = Dr.
Huntington's name on statements that
he had declared that he could not

consent to have his name used, but there
were as many endeavors to make @ con-
clusive representation that should he be
elected he could not refuse and had not
said that be would refuse to accept the
office. An effort was made also to make
the Rev. Dr. David H. Greer a leading can-
didate, despite repeated statements that,
according to report, he had accepted his
election as Bishop of Western Massachu-
setts. Two clerical votes and one lay
vote were cast for Dr. Greer, and one lay
and one clerical vote were cast for the Rey.
Dr. W. 5S. Rainsford

The highest number of [elerical votes
cast was 116, the highest number of lay
votes eighty-one. The vote of the iaity
is py parishes and although each parish
has Three re tatives R has but one
vote, ve to the fifth ballot Dr. Hunting-
ton's highest vote was twenty-one in the
clerical column and twenty-four in that of
the laity. The leading candidate from the
beginning in the number of votes polled
for him was Dr MeConnell, who varied
between twenty-five and thirty-eight cleri-
cal votes and nineteen and twenty-eight
lay votes. Upon the count of the fifth
ballot the end seemed no nearer than ever

As the new Bishop of Long Island will
receive a salary of $6,000, the same as that
mid to Bishop Littlejohn, together with
250 allowed for travelling expenses and
$6,500, the income of the Stewart founda-
tion, there is substantial reason other
than Epiecopal honors to lead clergymen
to wish for the office, The Bishop has
also a fine residence across the green from
the cathedral

The convention was opened with a com-
munion servier, at which Bishop Potter
pronounced a eulogium upon the life and
character of Bishop Litthjohn. The cathe
dral was filled by the y and = clerical
delegates and other who came toattend
the service or to wateh the proceedings
of the convention. Bishop Latiejane »
son-in-law, the Rev Wilmer P Bird, and
the Kev. Mr Keller of Arlington, No J,
were among ‘hose present

Bishop Potter said there was a Seotoh

CORBIN NOT FOR POLICE HEAD.

Somebody Talked to Him Ahout It, but
Mr. Low Says It's a Mistake.
Wasninaton, Nov. 20.—That Mayor Low
is endeavoring to secure an energetic,
capable military officer for Police Com-
missioner of New York is indicated by the
fact that several efforts have been made
to ascertain whether certain army offi-
cers would accept such an appointment.
Adjutant-General Corbin, whose name
has been mentioned for the Police Com-
missionership, denied this afternoon that
he had agreed to accept the office. He
refused to make any definite statement
as to how it had been offered to him, except
to say that he had been asked if such an
appointment would be agreeable to him.
Gen. Corbin declined to say who had made
the inquiry of him, but indicated plainly
that it was not Mayor Low. He said he
understood that several other army offi-
cers’ names were being considered, among
them Gen. Wesley Merritt and Gen. Fred

Grant.

“As to Gen. Grant,” he said, “I guess be
is in the same position as myself. I don't
think he would care to leave a career in
the army for the position. A retired army
officer would be more likely to take it,
though there is nothing to prevent Con-
gress passing a resolution permitting an
officer on the active list to hold a civil po-
sition, he of course relinquishing his mili-
tary pay during that period.”

Gen. Corbin also mentioned the name of
Gen, J. Ford Kent, retired, as an excellent
man for the office. Gen. Kent is well known
to President Roosevelt, they having par-
ticipated in the Santiago campaign to-
gether.

Mayor-elect Low said last night that
there must have been some mistake about
Gen. Corbin and that no such offer was
made by him to Gen. Corbin.

THE W. C. T. U. PROTESTS.

Opening of Saloons Here.

Fort Worth, Tex., Nov. 20.—The follow-
ing resolution, introduced by Mrs. Boole of
New York, was indorsed by the W.C. T.U.
convention this afternoon:

“The victory of the fusion ticket in New
York, which resulted in the overthrow
of Tammany, has caused general rejoicing.
This victory was gained by the united efforts
of good people, but we learn with regret that
some of the leaders are advocating openin
the saloons on Sunday. We, the Nation

TELEPHONE A BURGLAR ALARM,

Discovery Made by Former Lieut.-Gov.
Jones, the Man Whe “Pays the Freight."

BincuamtTon, N. Y., Nov. 20.+Former
Lieut -Gov. Edwerd F. Jones, who was
made famous by his phrase, “Jones pays
the freight,” has made the discovery that
each telephone may be made a burglar
alarm with the slight expense of a ball of
cord. The discevery came about through
the efforts of burglars to enter a neighbor's
house. In announcing his discovery Gen
Jones said

“Nearly every modern house has its
sleeping rooms upetairs. My plan is to
fasten the cord to the receiver, and when
you discover a burglar on the premises pull
it from the hook. The Central will understand
when there is a violent Jingling and flashing
of lights at unseemly hours that a burglar
ix in the house, and the police can be sent
and the marauders captured before they
have time to escape I have tested the plan
several times in the past few days and find
it works to perfection. *

CONFERENCE OF GOVERNORS
TO BRE CALLED TO DISCUSS WAR
ON RAILWAY COMBINE.
Gev. Van Sant ‘at Sei Announces
the Plan—North Dakota, Montana,

Washington and Idaho Executives
Expected to Respond to the Call.

 

MINNEAPOLIS, Minn., Nov. 20.—A combi-
nation of the Governors of the Western
States to fight the Northern Securities
Company plan for control of the Great
Northern and Northern Pacifico roads is
the latest plan proposed by Gov. Van Sant
of Minnesota. The following statement
was issued to-day from the Governor's
office:

“Owing to the great interest of the people
of the States west of us and the great de-
sire to see the attempt to consolidate the
Great Northern and Northern Pacific lines
resisted, Gov. Van Sant has concluded to
invite all the Governors of the States having
similar laws to those of Minnesota to join
in a united effort to fight the great railway
trust.”

A conference of the Governors will prob-
ably be held in St. Paul as soon as Gov.
Van Sant can communicate with the other
Western Executives and arrange such a
meeting. North Dakota, Montana, Wash-
ington and possibly Idaho are expected
to join in the effort to prevent the com-
bine. The first three States have laws
similar to those of Minnesota, and du
Minnetota'’s former fight five years ago
against the consolidation, started a move-
ment in the same direction, although the
victory won z this State made it unneces-
sary for the others to follow up the contest.

vy. Van Sant left for St. Cloud to-day
and Attorney-General Dengians, who is
now in the northern part of the State on a
hunting trip, is. expected to join the Gov-
ernor there if he can be reached by the
messengers who have been sent into the
woods in quest of him.

It is stated by prominent lawyers in St.
Paul, who have made a study of the State
laws governing the question of combina-
tions of corporations, that the Great North-
ern road may have forfeited its charter
in joining in the formation of the new com-
pany. Various plans have been proposed
to block the combine. Attorneys say
that if a traffic director is named for the
roads composing the combine, the State
would have 2.8 r case if the Attorney-
General deci to take the matter into
the courts.

The State officials and members of the
Legislature now think it certain that an
extra session of the Legislature will be
called, especially if the present laws are
found inasoqunee to deal with the problem,

HELENA, Mont., Nov. 20-—Gov. J. X.
Toole when asked to-day if he had de-
cided upon any steps to prevent the North-
western railway combine, said:

“Until I have reliable information as
to the basis upon which the proposed con-
solidation, if it can be called such, has been
made, I cannot talk or act intelligently.”

The Governor admitted that he was
looking up the law and said that he had
just read the decision of the Supreme Court
of the United States in the case of Pearsal
against the Great Northern, which was
started in the courts of nesota to pre-
vent the Great Northern from acquiring
a parallel line. He found that the Supreme
ray upheld pe lower court in preventing

y.
Linco, Neb., Nov. 20.—Gov. Savage
perenne laid before Attorney-General
thle morning the facte so far as he
had ¢@ them from the newspapers
about the consolidation of Nebraska's
two principal roads, the Burlington and
Union Pacific, together with a request
that he take the necessary steps to dis-
cover the legal status of the two roads
Mr. Prout says that he has no data or
facts upon which he can base an action
nor can he now say whether he can inter-
fere. So far as ia known, the two roads
are maintaining their separate identities
with respect to their management, and
it is a legal prepasition yet to be settled
whether control by the National Securities
Company of both roads is a consolidation

Have Protably Perished.
TELLURIDE, Col,, Nov. 20.
mouth of the Bullion tunnel this morning
imprisoned 200 men in the Smuggler Union
mine in Marshall Basin, Seven bodies
have been recovered, and it is believed
there are 100 men still in the mine. It will
be at least twenty-four hours before the
workings are cleared of smoke and the full

loss of life determined.

The bodies so far found are those of
T. Tarke!son, Carey Barkley, Ira Sundsti um,
E. H. Jones, William Merrifieli, foreman;
Joseph Nelson and a Finlander, name un-
known. Hugh O'Neill, engineer of the
Hoister, was taken from the mine alive
but cannot recover.

Fire started in the tramway bunk house |
at the mouth of the Bullion tunnel, the
principal opening from which the property
is worked, at 7:30 o'clock this morning and
spread rapidly. The boiler and engine
house, the blacksmith shop, the tramway
terminal, with its great ore bins and sev-
eral other smaller buildings were all soon
wrapped in flames,

AGED FARMER MURDERED.

Man Who Sheltered Tramps killed in His
ftome by One of Them.
Norwicu, Conn., Nov. 20.--Jeremiah
Shumway, aged 82, an eccentric farmer
living at Mohegan, in the town of Mont-
ville, about three miles from here, was
robbed and murdered by a tramp early
this evening. Shumway, who lived alone,
was accustomed to give shelter to any
tramps who came his way, and frequently
had two or more of these wanderers stop-
ping with him for several days. Three days
ago a young man came to his house and
was taken in by the old farmer.
Shumway was in this city this afternoon
on business and returned home about 5:30
o'clock. Within a few minutes a Jew
pedier passing the house saw a stranger
go up to the door and, as the old man ap-
peared, seize him by the throat. Instead
of acting himself, the pedler ran and alarmed

‘QUEEN OF SERVIA MURDERED?

UNCONFIRMED VIENNA RUMORS

No Detalis in the Story Given Out at the
Austrian Capital-Queen Draga of
Obseure Birth and Mer Marriage te
King Alexander Was Vigorously Op-
posed —Scandal at the Court Last May.

Spectal Cadle Despatch to Tar SUM.

ViENNA, Nov. 20.~ The Neue Freie Preage
prints a report that Queen Draga of Servia
was shot in a street in Belgrade.

Another rumor is that she committed
suicide:

No details have been received and it
is impossible to confirm either report.

The rumored assassination of Queen
Draga of Servia attacts more notice than
it otherwise would, owing to the belief,
which is based on information from many
sources, that the crisis which has long ex-
isted in Servia has reached a climax

The root of this climax is the financial
difficulty. The army of all ranks is re-
ceiving little or no pay and its enthusiasm
for the Obrenovitch dynasty, which King
Milan kept alive by making the army his
first consideration, has now vanished.

The trouble was increased by King
Alexander's marriage and the subsequent
incidents in connection therewith, eapecially
Queen Draga's insistence that her brother,
young Lieut. Lunjevitza, should be ac-
knowledged as heir to the crown,

The hostility of the army is shared by
the populace and it is believed here that
almost any outcome of the excitement is
possible.

 

Queen Draga was formerly Mme. Mas-
chin, a widow, and had been lady-in-wait-
ing to King Alexander's mother, the
unfortunate Queen Natalie. Mme. Mas-
chin was of obscure birth and twelve years
older than the young ruler, who took the
throne when his father, the notorious
King Milan, abdicated in 1889,

Upon going into the house the body o

wood lay near, covered with blood, and

promptly resigned, declaring the  pro-
posed marriage preposterous and a menace
to the State. Ex-King Milan heard the

ARREST OF ALLEGED “CADETS.”

Men at Albertson's Police Station.

Capt. Albertson of the Eldridge street

station was visited last night by Assistant

again showed his spirit. He sent officers
to the frontier to prevent his father’s re-
turn and organized a new Ministry.
Sweeping aside all opposition, King
Alexander married Mme. Maschin in Rel-
grade on Aug. 5, 1900. Though the mar-
riage had been so vigorously opposed
officially, the people seemed to have no
objection and the bridal party was heartily
cheered. The King had taken the pre-

District Attorney Sandford and a Deputy caution, however, to have the streetg lined

visit was neither the captain nor his visitors
would say. The two members of the Dis-
trict Attorney's staff were with the captain

would have to await developments in court

Capt. Albertson arrested Edward Gold

with troops.

The domestic affairs of the King dropped
from public attention until it was whis-
pered edrly in the vear that an heir was
expected to the Servian throne.

In May there was a scandal when it was
announced that the expectation was with-
out foundation. Queen Draga was at once
