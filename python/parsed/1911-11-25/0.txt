WASHINGTON, Nov. 24- For the third!
time President Taft has refused to inter-
fere with the fifteen year sentence which
Charles W. Morse, the New York banker,
is serving in the Federal prison at Atlanta,
Ga The plea made for Morse's release
was ill health,and Mr. Taft as an alterna-
tive to pardon or parole ordered the
transfer of the banker to the United States

army hospital at Fort) MePherson,
Georgia, where he will receive medical
treatment, but will be kept under sur

H. F. Dougherty and TB. Felder, coun
sel for Morse, presented the plea for
Morse’s release to President Taft and
Attorney-General Wickersham yester-
day. They declared that the prisoner is

tn a serions condition and asked for his
release on the ground that he could not

live long in confinement United States
District Attorney Wiseend Wo H. Move,
warden of the penitentiary at Atlanta
were in Washington to-day and were

consulted in regard to the case

Morse has been reported in ill health
since his commitment to the§ penitentiary
and the Department of Justice bas kent a
close watch on his condition. When the
application for pardon was made the
President asked at once for a state
ment of his present condition, and after
consideration of that report ordered the
transfer of Morse to the military hospital
In the military hospital Morse will
be assured of the medical treat-
ment and the President feels that by send-
ing him there he is giving Morse every
opportunity to regain his health that he
could have were he pardoned

ZANGW ILL INDIGNANT

That We Should 8 Suter old World Class,

The national citizens committee which
is arranging the mass meeting to be held
at Carnegie .Hall on Wednesday evening, |
December 6, received the following letter |
yesterday from Israel Zangwill, the writer
and Zionist:

1 am delighted to learn of the formation |
of the National Citizens Committee, This|
seems to mean business America has been
sitting down too long under a discrimination
among her citizens which is an affront to
the very idea of arepublie. It is seandaious
that the diseases of the Old World should be
thus forced tipon the new It is perfectly
true that England is also enduring this
insult, but then Kneeland is still part of the!
Old World, and its Conatitution was not
created under that vivifying influence of |

best

| nobler ideals which moulded the Constitu-

tion of America. Nevertheless it remains
a public scandal that even at a time of
Anglo-Russian entente it !s impossible |
for an English born Jew to move freely
through Russia. I am_ perfectly certain
that if the question had come up in the days
of Palmerston he would have found a short
cut through all Russia’a diplomatic delays.
| But England is now losing her old instinct
for freedom and justice. All the more
therefore does ii behoove America to step
forward and be the torch bearer to man-
kind, Sincerely yours,

Under Assistant District Attorney
Buckner’s easy questioning Stokes bern
the story of his aequaintanee with Lillian
Graham. That was back in 1908 at the
telephone in the Ansonia, Lillien was
living there with her sister, Mrs. Singleton,

Dblie serge sn

“Did you have meetings with other
women*” asked Buckner
“Why, yes,” said Stokes, “I was a

bachelor then.”

Stokes said that Lillian told him then
that she was 24 years old and that her
ambition was to go on the stage. She
knew that he had a stock farm in Ken-
tucky and wanted Stokes to take her out
there, he testified. From time to time he
gave her money and because she insisted,
he said, he invited her to his Kentucky
farm, where she stayed three days. She
had apartments at the Hotel Ansonia, but
Stokes said he had to ask her to leave
because the watchman told him she wag
coming in at all hours of the night. Her
hotel bill was unpaid when she left.

Later, when she asked for money,

Stokes gave her, he said, $200 or $300, he
couldn't remember which. That was to
pay for a trip to Paris, Subsequently

he saw her again and took her for auto-
mobile rides. She had come back to this
country, she told him, hoping to get a
job on the stage, but managers were
doubtful of her ability. She felt discour-
aged. ‘The situation in the theatrical
business was not what it had been and
chorus girls were to be had cheap,

On May 17, 1911, when Lillian went to

the Ansonia and asked Stokes for $500,
he refused to give it to her, he said, bo-
cause an Austrian Countess had

been saying things to him concerning
Lillian's merry ways. The Countess said
to Stokes:

“I met Miss Graham on the ship to
kurope and she told me, ‘I'm going abroad
to have my fun. IT have $2,500, $300 of it
from W. EF. D. Stokes.'”

The Countess was thoughtful enough
to recount some of Miss Graham's adven-
tures on shipboard, all of which made the
Ansonia man very sore, he testified, So
when Lillian asked him for $500 he said no
with extreme positiveness.,

“What did Miss Graham say to all this?”
pursued Buckner.

“She was very angry,” replied Stokes.
“I took $25 out of my pocket and offered
it to her, but she flung the money on the
floor and said she was going to com-
mit suicide. She took a bottle from her
j handbag and put it to her lips. I grabbed
