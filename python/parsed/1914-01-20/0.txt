Trade Boom Expected When

Revenues Is Checked.

Wasntnaton, Jan, 19.—-President Wil- |
son is optimistic about business conditions. |
He sees no sign of trouble on the bust-
ness horizon and took occasion to express
his views in this regard to callera at the
White House to-day.

If may be stated upon authority that
the President lias received reports from
what he regards as authoritative sources
to the effect that a feeling of confidence
in the future pervades the business world.

The Ivresident appears to be convinced

that bustness mon of the country do not
look for an upset in commercial and ea
dustrial conditions following legislation

already passed by the Democrats or to
be passed at the current session of Con-
grees

Mr. Wilson told callers to-day that the
reports which he had received in this con-
nection were in. sufflelent number and |
| from widely separated as to
Hleave no doubt on his part as to the ex-
tent of the belief in the minds of bust-
ness men that there Is no ground for
lack of confidence in what the future will
bring forth,

These reports, which have come to the
President personally, are said to be borne
out by others which have been made to,
by Secretary of Co verce Hedfleld,
Mr. Redfield, at the President's request,
has sought within the last month to keep
in close touch with the viewpoint of bust- |
nes® men throughout the country and he
confirmed the statement of the President's
correspondents that the operators of in-
dusttial corporations are not only hope-
ful but confident.

however, that the President will not touch |
on the question in to-morrow's |

It is regarded as practically certain |
that the President's personal view is that!
permisston to make the desired increase |
in freight rates should be given to the

This resolution aroused interest in the!
Senate when it was proposed by Senator |
Lane on January 12. The measure was
referred the following day to the Com- |
mittee on Interstate Commerce over Mr. |
Lane's protest. Among other things the |
resolution directed that the coramission |
