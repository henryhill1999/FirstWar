Steel Makers Fear Impost
on Industry to Pay for
Preparedness.

 

 

MAY SETTLE FATE
OF WILSON'’S IDEAS

 

Issue Seen for Republicans,
but Others Suggest Aid
for Democrats,

 

jt was learned yeeterday that much
of the discussion on preparedness, which
those who were present say was the
chief topic at Judge Gary’s dinner to
Col. Roosevelt, centred on the proposal
@f President Wilson and his advisers to
meet the increased expenditures for ships

and armaments by a tax on pig fron,
fabricated sieel and gagolene,

Not only are the steel manufacturera
ready to oppose any tax on pig iron and
fabricated steel, but there has already
developed opposition to the tax on gaso-
ene, particu.arly on the part of Senators
and Congressmen from the West. The
tax on pig iron and fabricated steel is
denounced as a tax upon industry and
the steel men stand ready to offer sub-
atitutes. It i8 believed that almost any
kind of a tariff would suit them rather
than a tax to be paid by the industries
which will profit chietly from the pre-
paredness programme.

Nearly every one who was at the Gary
inner admitted that preparedness was
discussed. Col. Roosevelt has told his
frienda that he is more interested in an
@dequate army and navy than he is in
anything else. But the men whom he
met at dinner are also much interested
{in the question of who is to foot the bill
Just what forms the discussion at the
dinner took is not known yet, but it is
taken for granted that Col. Roosevelt's
ideas us to the feasibility of starting a
campa.gn for the restoration of general
tariffa rather than for the imposition of
@pecial taxes were solicited.

Col, Roosevelt's foliowing in the West
is very strong and it is from the Wegt
that the steel men look for aid in turn-
ing over the slight Democratic majority
i the House of Representatives on this
particular proposition of paying for de-
fence. Politicians have figured that to
combine the opponents of a tax on guso-
lene with those who will oppose a tax on
tron and steel pr would go a long
way toward degeating Mr. Wilson's pro-
Grainne,

Four Gifts of $100,000 Each Mark Appeal in Carnegie

Seven hundred thousand dollars were
poured out Jast night at a meeting at
Carnegie Hail by the Jews of New York
for the relief of the Jews in the war
sofle of Europe. The smallest sum was
® car.fare, given by a nameless indi-
vidual who said that was all he had.

| The largest amount given from the floor
Was an inonymous $26,000. The pledges
were started by the announcemem of
four anonymous gifts of $109,000. It
was reported unofficially that the donors
were Jacob H. Schiff, Nathan Straus,
Julius Rosenwald of Sears, Roebuck &
Co,, and the Guggenheim brothers, These
pledges were made to the American
Jewish Relief Committee on condition
that they raise before January 1 the sum
of $1,000,000.

of the year,

Great Throng Quickly Gathers.

Yet the meeting began qhietly, almost
without enthusiasm. It was impressive
only in numbers at first. The hal) was
jammed before 8 o'clock, and Outside
a line of men and women, four abreast,
kept In order by ten policemen, stretched
along the sidewalk from the Fifty-sev-
enth street entrance to Seventh avenue,
and on Seventh avenue to Fifty-sixth
Street. These were persons without
tickets, waiting in the hope that there
would be vacant seats when the ticket
holders were all served. Most of them,
to the number of several hundred, went
away disappointed.

Louis Marshall, chairman of the com-
mittee, acted as chairman of the meet-
ing. Thomas Marshall, Vice-President
of the United States, who was announced
to speak, sent a letter saying that owing
to the illness of Mrs. Marshall he could
not come. There were speeches by
David Greer, Bishop of New York; John
H. Finley, State Commissioner of Educa-
Gon, and others,

Bishop Greer said that civilization
and humanity each owes a debt to the
Jews.

“Therefore, I say,” he concluded,” it
is humanity's debt to the Jew and I ap-
peal to that humanity of the American
people which is the boast, the legiti-
mate boast, the only worth while boast
and glory of the American people, which
never fails to respond to any human
needs, no matter how remote, as It is
responding now so liberally and so

freely.
“I appeal ta that humanity, that
American humanity, to pay promptly,

with free and open hand, its debt, its
human debt, to the Jewish people in this
their bitter hour, and so discharge ite
indebtedness to its own American human
life. In the name of the Chtistian
church, in the name of civilization, in
the name of American humanity, IT ap-
peal in behalf of the Jew, who is suf-
fering to-day—inen, women and children
—to-night, on the other side of the
seas.”

It remained, however, for Dr. J. L.
Magnes to strike the first real spirit of
feeling from the great audience.

ask $1,260,000, that we may send it

that we must pour out our hearts in

in fatness, people who want for nothing.
Shall we sit and listen complacently to
what the speakers before me had said

There was a tong pause. Then a little

| aisle, laid a dollar bill at the speaker's
feet and turned and fied. That broke
| the fee and the pledges came quick and
fast. John Simon of 16 Wiltam atreet
| began with a pledge of $1,900. Mr. and
Mra Israel Unterberg followed with
another $1,000. Then came the Inde-
pendent Order of Abraham with $16,000,
Abraham Prianger gave $1,500 and then
Mrs. Sophia Beer gave $2,000. The order
of Brith Abraham gave $5,000. Jacob
Wertheim, Samuel Untermyer and Louis
Marshall gave sums of $10,000 each.
Justice Irving Lehman, son-in-law of
Nathan Straus, gave $6,000.

Sums were pledged from other citfes
also, PMadelphia, which Mr. Magnes
said had abready guaranteed $50,000 for
the European sufferers, pledged an addi-
tional $10,000 last night through Phila-
delphians in the audience. Providence,
R. 1, sent $1,000, Cincinnati and Port-
land, Ore., pledged $20,000 and $25,006
respectively.

Tempest of Applause Stirred.

From various groups of the Business
Men’s League of New York came sums
ranging all the way from $6,000, given
by-the Cloak and Suit Manufacturers, to
$100—about $28,000 in all.

As the giving grew the applause
waxed louder. [t was loudest of all
when Congres#:ran Meyer London gave
$100 and again when the pledged $1,000
for Vorwaerts, Loud clapping welcomed
such well known names as Judge Otto
Rosalsky, who gave $200; former Health
Commissioner 8. 8. Goldwater, who gave
$250, and Rabbi Joseph Stiverman, who
gave $100.

The enthusiasm was, however, un-
bounded when an unnamed man gave
$3.50, half of his week's salary.

A letter of regret was sent by Mayor
Mitchel, who was unable to be present.
United States Senator William J. Stone
also was prevented from coming, but
sent his speech, which was read,

Mayor Confronted by Great
Heap of Letters Opposing
All Night Permits.

 

NO DECISION YET MADE

 

Broadway Association Asks
Mitchel to Let Down Bars
to Those Who've Asked.

 

Shall New York welcome the New
Year with shout and laughter, with
dance and song and the pop of merry
corks, or ought it rather to consume
those early morning hours with sessions
of sweet, silent thought? Wouldn't it
be better for everybody if everybody
would have a good time until 1 o'clock
in the morning and then stop right
there and begin to contemplate? Ought
the opening of another stretch in the
all too brief career of man to be an
occasion for hilarity or for sober mus-
ings?

Those are the questions that are now
surging through the brain of Mayor

Mitchel. With the first tall of snow
the letters and petitions of those who
oppose an all night celebration began to
accumulate upon his desk. There is a
heap of them there now that would drive
any less equable person to distraction.
Most of them are from clergymen and
they paint in varied degrees the depths
of degradation to which the city is
brought by these “orgies.” The famil-
jarity which some of these letters dis-
close with night life at its worst in New
York comes each year as a shock to
those who think they have a fair knowl-
edge of things as they go along Broad-
way. Last year 215 al] night licenses
were issued and not one complaint was
heard, but all that is to be changed this
year, according to the Mayor's inform-
ants.

The Rev, William M. Carr of the
Beekman Hill M. E. Church says he be-
leves everybody can get enough to drink
during the usual license hours of the
day without using the night. He says
the harmfulness of drink ts coming te
be more and more realized by the peo-
ples of the earth, and most emphati-
cally by Americans. In his opinion the
New Year should not begin “with a
carousal, but rather with serious
thought."’

Drunk Once a Year.

The Rey. Robert Watson of the Scotch
Presbyterian Church, Ninety-sixth street
and Central) Park West, urges the Mayor
to take such action as will “convince all
the people that you are on the side of
septeomnneet He says there must be

peo, n this town “to ik
your Reem a quiet effort to Teal all of
the people into a better understanding
of what life really means.”

“T have men tn my church,” writes the}

Rev. Victor G. Flinn of the Third Mora-
vian Church, “whe can keep sober
throughout the rest of the year but who
ure drunk every New Year's Day, and
frequently for a while after.”

Another clergyman suggests that one
reason Why all night licenses should not
be granted on New Year's eve ts that
Sunday comes two days later
the letters lay stress on the riotous con-
ditions that preva!] everywhere, Soine
of the petitioners think some places
should be allowed to keep open, but they
protest against any general al) night
business

The Mayor hasn't decided yet what he
will do. As in former years the Police
Commissioner will be consulted and
those places which have a reputation for
orderliness will probably be favored,
is the practice not to give licenses that
are really all night licenses, but to ex-
tend the time Himit for an hour or two

The Broadway Association eent a re-
quest to Mayor Mitchel last night asking
him to itasue all night licenses to the
dozen or more restaurant and hotel. pro-
prietors who have sought them. David

Austrian Charge Confers With
Lansing to Reach Better
Understanding.

 

U. 8S. NOTE PUBLIC TO-DAY

 

If Second American Document
Is Milder Than First Trou-
ble May End.

 

WaAsntnaton, Dec, 21.—Informal con-
ferences are in progress between Secre-
tary Lansing and Baron von Zwiedinek,
Charge d'Affaires of the Austrian Em-
bassy, with a view, it is understood, to
paving the way toward a better under-
standing in connection with the Ancona
controversy.

Although !t was denied at the State
Department to-day that these confer-
ences aro similar to the “informal con-
versations which have been tn progress
between Lansing and Ambassador von
Bernstor® for a settlement of the Lust-
tania issue,” the fact that they have
been going on almost daily since the
first American Ancona note was sent
to Austria on December 6 and are ad-
mitted to have reference to the Ancona
matter {is regarded as significant of
@ possible effort to get together.

Interest in the tone of the second
American note to Austria, which ts to be
made public to-morrow, is increased by
the report that the State Department had
been given to understand that a modifi-
cation {n some of the phraseology might
make an amicable agreement
possible.

It is not improbable that while the
United Siates has declined in its two !n-
formal notes to Austria to disclose in
detail the facts on which it bases its
peremptory demands, and while Austria
in her reply to the first American note

| appeared to stand by her original version

of the Ancona attack, as set forth by
her Admiralty, these informal confer-
ences have resulted tn an exchange of
evidence which may have an important
bea ing on Austrta's final reply.

In German and Austrian quarters no

secret is made of the belief that both
| countries In their formal exchanges have
j been “playing to the public.” In the
same quarters it is said confidently that
having had these formal exchanges it
may be possible for the two countries
through informal and contidential ex-
changes between Mr. Lansing and Baron
Zwiedinek to pave the way for an under-
standing.

In this connection attention !s called
j to the timportant part which the informal

| Sgonversations” betweer the Secretary
of State and Count von Berns: -rff paved
‘in bringing about a satisfactury settle-
rent of the Arabic controversy and a
discussion of the Lusitania issue. It Is
e fact that although the final formal
note of this country to Berlin on the
Submarine dispute was extremely, sharp
jand bas never been answered the “In-
{formal conversations” Washington
have been in progress ever since

While the nature of the American
'notes to Austria on the Ancona incident
will not admit of the sare delay, it is
believed in well informed quarters that
@ut of the conferences now going on at
the State Department favorable develop-
ments are likely to come.

Special Cable Despatch to Taw Sux.
Lonpon, Dec, 21—The Athens correspondent of the Duily Chronicle

telegraphs:

“I have reliable news to the effect that the Russians landed troops yes-
terday at Varna after a severe bombardment by the fleet. which laid the
town in ruins and silenced the Bulgarian artillery.

“The losses inflicted on the Bulgarian garrison were severe.

When the

resistance ended the transports disembarked infantry and artillery with-

out loss.

“A despatch from a neutral Consul at Varna states that the Russians
are strong enough to hold the place against any possible Bulgarian attack.”

The first despatch announcing the new
naval action against the Bulgarian port
came from Athens and was as follows:

“A Russian cruiser and two destroy-
ers, which are convoying sixteen trans-
, Ports Alled with troops, have arrived off
| the Bulgarian coast and are bombarding

Varna vigorously.”

A later message, received by the Paris
Temps via Berne, said:

“A large Russian squadron !s bom-

 

more | barding the Bulgarian port of Varna."

.

Varna lies only a few miles south of
(the Rumanian border and is an im-
portant railroad terminus. It is strongly
fortified, the Bulgarians having strength-
{ened the coast defence works consider-
ably since the war began.

would at the same time satisfy the de-

MME. BERNHARDT DYING,

 

Lendon Hearn Actress, 70 Years
Old, Cannot Recover,
Lonvon, Dec, 21-—The Deaily  ele-

graph’s correspondent reports that Sarah
Bernhardt is dying,

Mme, Bernhardt, who is
old, contracted a severe cold recently
when returning from the theatre. She
has been ill eince, but her condition was
not believed to be serious. Her ‘health
has been fragile ever elnce she under-
went an operation last February when
her right leg was amputated. It was
replaced by an artificial leg, and as soon
as the famous tragedienne had fully re-
covered from the effects of the operation
she resumed her work, though with
great limitations.

On October 23, when Mme. Bernhardt
celebrated her birthday, the hope was
expressed by her manager that she might
wppear in the United States before the
end of the year.

WasHINGTON, Dec, 21,-—Germany's re-
ply to the last note of the United States
fn the Frye case was received to-day by
the State Department.

This controversy involves the conten-
tion by the United States that small
boats in the open sea do not constitute
a place of safety for the passengers of a
destroyed liner.

{force be augmented,”
The wastage is enormous, he sald, and
the country must aim at getting into

Says Thousands of Lives
Were Vainly Lost.

 

BLAME PLACED ON
GEN. IAN HAMILTON

 

He Will Not Return to Com-
mand in the East, As-
quith States,

Special! Cable Despatch te Tuy Sux.

Lonpon, Dec, 21.—Sir Edward Caw
son, who retired as Attorney-General re-
cently because he disagreed with other
members of the Cabinet in regard to the
Balkan policy of the Allies, launched #
vitriolic attack upon the Government in
the House of Commons to-day regarding
the withdrawal of the army of 100,000
men from Suvla Bay and Anzac, on
Galipoli peninsula, officially announced
yesterday.

It was not the abandonment of tho
Dardanelles canipaign, however, which
formed the object of Sir Edward's
speech, but the fact that the nation had
been left completely !n the dark for
nearly four months as to what was
suing on at the Dardanelles,

“It is a great public scandal,” sald
Sir Edward, “that no report concerning
ithe Suvla Bay operations has been pulp

lished. Sinoe August there has not been
made public a word of what was hap-

pening.

Thousands Lost by Delay.

“Now the wiihdrawa] from two fronte
le hurled al the nation us if it were a
kind of victory. Why were Cie men lef
in a kind of hell on Galllpolt from Au-

ust to Deceinber 20, thousands being
lost while somebody was making up hi
nind whether the men ought to be left
there or not?”

Sir Edward Carson's attack came im-
mediately after Premier Asquith in «@
brief statement to House of Com-
mons had given the reasons for
withdrawal of the forees from the
northern part of the Gallipoll peninsula

The Premier said that the retirement
froin the Dardanelles positlons—with the
notable exception of the position at the
tip of the pentnsula—had been taken on

the
the

the advice of Gen Monro and Earl
Kitchener.

“The retirement,” the Premier con-
M“nued, “was an operation of peculiar

hazard, for the least misjudgment might
have led to serious lose. It was carrled
out by the navy and army combined in
a manner for which no praise could be

 

too high, and which will give the ser
vices enduring fame in the annals of
warfare

‘With the exception of a relatively
small proportion of the stores and
very few guns, which had to be left
behind and which were destroyed, the
whole force at both places was re
moved with perfect serenity, The total

casunllies—At seems almost incredible-
'n the whole operation were two military
and one mwaval wounded,

“T am sure that the House will take
the earliest opportunity to express ite
admiration and gratitude to Gen. Monre
for carrying out these difficult opers-
tions, while other officers deserving spe-
celal praise are Gen, Birdwood and A
miral Wemyss, the latter supervising the
naval operations

“Tt {» most gratifying to know that
these splendid troops were embarke!
to a new destination without the loss

of an single Ife, and after a short and
much needed rest they will be ready and

1 am sure, alse eager fo resunie thelr
gallant cureer,”

Immediately after the Prime Minteter
fad tinished, John Redmond, the Trish
Nationallat leader {in the Commons,
sprang to his feet and denounced the
Dardanelles campaign as a failure. He

Premier Asauith replied that the des

him only recently
