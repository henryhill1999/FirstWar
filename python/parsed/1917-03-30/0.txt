_Persocrap, March 28 (via London,
March 29).—An appeal to the workmen
of the German and Austrian coalition to
rise against the imperial authority and
to establish their’ freedom, says the
Petrograd Telegraph Agency (the Rus-
gan official news agency), was launched
at a mass mecting of workmen, soldiera
and Deputies held to-day at the Duma.
The appeal was directed to the prole+
tariat of the whole world, but it spe-

urging the workmen of those countries to
“throw off the yoke of autocratic rule, as
the Russian people have overthrown the:
{mperial autocrats, and: refuse to serve |
longer as an instrument in the hands of
kings, capitalists and bankers.”

By a united effort, thé appeal declares,
“we can stop this awful murdér which is
the shame of humanity.”

The document states emphatically that |
ft is not a craven appeal for peace, de- |
caring:
found liberty against gll interference,
whether from within or without. It will
not yield before belligerent bgyonets nor
will it permit itself to be coerced by for-
@ign military power."

Still Ready to Fight.

During the debate on the text of the
appeal opposition was offered by several
speakers, who expressed the opinion that

understood in Germany as an admission

“When we speak to the Germans we
always keep guns in our hands. We
shall fight to the last drop of blood for
Iiberty if the Germans do not accept the
appeal. The dominating idea of the ap-
peal is that we are seeking peace by
urging others to throw off the yoke."

After M. Tcheidse had spoken M.
Rodzianko, President of the Duma, is-
sued from the building amid a scene
of the greatest enthusiasm
rangued the soldiers, calling upon them
t fight against “the most terrible of
@emies, the Ge ne.” . ‘

“We shall do otr utmost,” he added,

Passengers and crews of both vessels
abandoned the Alnwick Castle in five
boats. One of these boats landed on the
Spanish coast. It originally contained
twenty persons, including a stewardess
and a child, but five of them died. All
the survivors in this boat were suffering
from frost bite.

The ‘other boats also were picked up
during the week, one containing twenty-
seven, another twenty-nine and the third
twenty eurvivors. In these boats there
were five persons dead. The fifth boat
which put out from the steamer has not

The Alnwick Castle was of 5,900 tons

| Lonpox, March 28.—Reuter’s Amster-

\ vices, says the Reichstag has adopted
‘all three readings of the emergency
‘budget. Both Socialist parties voted |
| against the measure.
“Eduard Bernstein, Socialist,” say the
advices, “delivered a speech justifying

‘said, was converted into an energy by

|Germany. A good and sincere peace
must be striven for at the speediest mo+

“Herr Bernstein added that the events
in Russia under the leadership of the
Socialists strengthened the confidence

Dr. Peter Spahn, leader of the Catho- |

‘tag, as charged by the Prussian Herren- |
