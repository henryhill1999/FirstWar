COTTON NOT ACTIVE,
BUT HOLDS STEADY

Liverpool Buying to Undo
Straddles Furnishes Chief
Trading Feature,

 

 

 

REVISION OF ACREAGE

.

 

while cotton showed no great acy. ity
yesterday, aside from purchases of about
oo.000 bales for Liverpool during the
firet hour of trading, the market wae gen-
erally and a slight net gain
wae estublished for the day. The fea.
of the day were the continuation
of favorable Weather, English buying to
juce straddles and heavy exports. The

steady,

tures

re
exports, amounting to 51,000 bales, were
ueusually large, considering the etage of
the se uso

Advices from Texas state that the
geather is perfect, except in the south.
west, Where drought continues, It is
believed that the dry weather tn the
eourwest will interfere considerably
with the tnerease which had been ex-
pected in the Texas acreage,

Apo her feature was the annual up-

ward revision of the previous season's
acreage, Which is now placed by the
Department of Agriculture at 32,107,000
acres, compared with the guess last se. -
son of 21,535,000 acres. The new figure:
wi!| be used as the bagis of calculation:
this year.

Cables state that tt is considered
probable that the British Government
will intervene this week in the wage
dispute between cotton operatives and
eniployees. As matters now stand the

uniens are counting on @ general strike
oy June 10 if the demands have not
been granted at that time.

New England cotton brokers say that
manufacturers are showing only a lim-
fred tnterest in cotton. The South con-
tnues to hold very firtnly on prices.
It is believed that some of the mills will
ave to buy more cotton before the
summer is far advanced, but nearly all
ire well supplied for early requirements
\n Alabama spot firm saya: “The de-
mand for spot
tent and offerings are extremely light,
which is undoubtedly due to the market
having & sagging tendency, thus re-
“training possible buyers from covering
their commitments. Sellers, as a rule,
are able to hold their product until more
satisfactory prices can be secured.”

GOSSIP OF WALL STREET.

A Specialty Market.

Yesterday's stock market was largely
one of specialties and, to a consider-
uble extent, new specialties, Although
there was a turnover of 617,900 shares,
{t was significant that the trading in
the old line stocks that have proven
their worth was remarkably light. The
turnover in Steel common was only 13,-
000 shares; in Union Pacific, 2,200
shares ; in Southern Pacific, 1,900 shares ;
in Atchison, 3,000 shares; and in
| Reading, the most active stock on the
list, only 11,500 shares. On the other
hand the International Mercantile Ma-
rine etocks and the motor issues, which
‘re at present receiving the attention

f strong pools, were most active, the
| turnover in Marine preferred being 76,-

900 shares and in the common 38,200
shares, In the motor stocks, 14,800
shares of Chandler Motors were traded,
14,600 shares of Maxwell Motors and
6,975 shares of Willys-Overland,

From the behavior of yesterday's
market {it was evident that, if left alone,
{t would have been a dull Ppre-vonven-
tion market, which would have been
most natural at this time, However, tn-
tense activity in specialties was injected
{nto {t, and as a result whatever activity
might have taken Place in the standard
rails and industrials was halted until a
healthier condition of the market made
Opportunities for commitments in these
stocks more attractive.

 

 

 

 

Mercantile Marine.
International Mercantile Marine pre-
ferred, for the first time since it began
| its sensational advance from around 3

"1915, crossed par yesterday. It sold
= high as 100% and closed at 991%, an
‘dvance of 214 points over Saturday's
lose. Marine preferred had been tipped
'o go to par last week and, Judging
from its performance on Friday, would
have done so had not the newa of the
naval battle in the North Sea tem-
porarily unsettled the entire stock mar-
ket. Yesterday's strength and activity
in the stock was accompanied by re-
ports that important developments w
being worked out at the conferences of
| the committees representing ‘he vari-
| ous classes of securities of the company
and that an early solution of all
| difficulties of the reorganization might
| be expected. It was even reported
| bers &@ Statement would be forthcoming
before the day was out, but this proved
| tneorrect, although it was intimated at
| the close of the day's conferences that
) 4 announcement might be expected to-
day Murine preferred's new top was

Whether that movement was brought
about by profit tating or by the fact
that the more conservative of the broker-

Many of the more conservative broker
age houses are refusing to varty the
higher priced motor stocks on margin
except for customers who they know

big margins, which inust be kept “gvod.”
In one house where the fnquiry was
mnade as to how much margin war

the answer was “50 per cent, not 50

Midvale Dividends.

3 Steel was strong and active
year on reports that the directors
of that company would declare an initial

‘dividend at Wednesday's meeting : The
turnover in Midvale amounted to @,a00
!phares, as compared with 1.500 shares
on Saturday, It closed at 63%, an ad-
vance of 1% points over the previous
final price. It is rumored that the Initial
