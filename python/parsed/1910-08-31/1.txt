The papers filed with the decmion show
that one reason for the falling out of the
brothers was a fine of $300 imposed on
Jacques by an arbitrator for taking bis
wife to the Chateau des Beaux Arta on
July 3 and 6 last, and another waa the
promotion by Jacques of a “cornnh oder,”
a to facilitate the conesurm) tion
of corn on the ear

Louis also brought suit to restrain bis
brothers from removing the manager
of the Huntington place and two head-
waiters on the ground that they are
his fmends and to compel hia brothers
to an arbitration agreement
by whieh all differences between them
were to be submitted to AoA) Anderson
owner of the studio buriding in which the
Cafe dea Beaus Arts is situated, for his

decision
When the case was anhmitted to Juatice

Rischoff a month age none of the brothers
would say much coneernng the underiy-
ing causes of their disagreement, except
that family disputes Were to blame Jusa-
Bischoff in his decision yestertay

The first trouble arose, Louis save
when Jacques made overdrafta of $4,000
in 1908 and later the brothers didn't
agree because he wanted the pay of each
officer reduced from $10.000 a year with
hoard and lodging to 86.000 a vear with
toard and lodging Because he insisted
the arbitrator fine Jacques $y
for taking hia wife to the Chateau in vio-
ation of the agreement and because he
opposed the use by Jacques of the prestige
f the corporation in promoting his corn
holder there was more trouble, but
Jac yues and Andre always held together
against him

“Prior to Andre and Jacques taking
sides against me they fell out among
themselves.” says Louis, “and once this
ts settioed they will fall out again They
are only united by the adhesive power of
animus toward the deponent *

Loum declares the brothers told him

that

He attaches to his papers the decision
of the arbitrator on the subject of fining
Jacques, which shows that Louis also
wanted Andre fined $500 for taking his
sister-in-law to the Chateau. The ar-
bitrator found Jacques guilty of taking
his wife te the Chateau on July 3 and 4
and directa that he pay 8500 into the
treasury forthwith

further
At the hearing some doubt was raised

as ty whether immediate families’ re-
ferred to in the ahove deewion includes
a sister-in-law. I did not subject Andre
Bustanoby to a fine of $500 for permitting
his sister-in-law on the premises, but
decided hereafter that sister-in-law he
inclided in immediate families”
