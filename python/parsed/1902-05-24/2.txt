AGAINST YALE “TAP DAY”

ctien Taken to Prevent
ping’ on College Campus.

New Haven, Conn., May 23.-—-Concerning
the report that Treasurer Morris F. Tyler
of Yale University had notified one of the
Yale senior societies that hereafter the
institution called *Tap Day” will probably
not be allowed on the campus, President
Hadley made this statement to-night

“There has been alsolutely no
action on the subjeet or formal notification
There te hurried or
inconsiderate in action ”

President Hadley declared that) what-
ever action wae taken would he with the
consent of al! ned and that it was a
subject that tad been doscussed more or
lems for five or 8X years. He wre satisfied
that the members of the
themselves were opposed to “Tap Day
and that (f some
plan could be devised all concerned would
approve of it

All that Treasurer Tyler would say on
the subject to-night was that such a notice

 

is no disposition to

eonet

seruor sor bet lon

other

had been given out. He has charge of
the campus and (he buildings Tt ts said
that the base for this step of Mr. Tyler
is that “Tap Dav” is unne esmary, that it
is no good in iteelf, and that there is too
much college politios connected with it,

of which the faculty has no official cogni-
vanes ‘Therefore it should move off the
Cath us

 

A prominent Vale senior sectety man
to-night said that Mr. ‘Tyler had no
authonty to give such notification to the
senior society, amd that college sentiment
would certaaly rebel against any such
dictum without the opimon of the great
college body sanctioned such a move

son was slapped for
tthe three senior socret cs

that yesterdays had “Tap Day” ceremonies

“Tap ty" grew into Yale lfe bet ween
S78 and IS78 At that period there had
been a lot of trouble and considerable
Vidlence between the somety and non-
eomety menoon the night of election. To
avoid su colbetons at night between the
students was deeded that on a@ certain
iy in Mav the nierm who had been

should be slapped or ‘tapped” and that

the whole college community should have

 

a chance to eee this public ceremony
Thereafter, each year nearly all the mem-

to a designated spet oon the campus and

renamed there until the slapping of the

RAPID TRANSIT COMMISSION
SUBMITS CONTRACT DRAFTS.

 

 

Grout Disagrees With the Majority and
Wants a Three-tent Fare insisted On
Tunnel Must Be Completed in Two
Years and Leased for at Least Pity.

The Rapid Transit Commissioners held a
special meeting yesterday to receive the
tentative draft of the form of contract for
the building of the tunnel railroad from
the City Hall in Manhattan to Flatbush
avenue, Brooklyn. The provisional con
tract was presented by Alexander Bo Or
Charles Stewart Smith and Comptroller
Grout, the committee appointed to draw

* | up the contract

While in general the new contract follows
that diawn for the subway in this borough
the members of the committee differ on

several important provisions “Two reports

were presented, one signed by Messrs.
Smith and Orr and the other by Mr. Grout
The majority repert provides that the

maximum fare between the two boroughs
shall be five cents Mr Grout dissents and
offers as a substitute a provision that (he
bidders be restricted to a three-cent fare

The Comptroller protests against
the clause of the majority report, which
appropriates $1,000,000 for terminal pur-
poses Mr Grout thinks that the con-
tractor should be obliged to bid on the
terminals

By the contract recommended by the
majority of the committee the contractor |
must undertake, first, to construct the
entire railroad within two years, and, sec- |
ond, to hire the railroad upon a lease for
fifty years with a privilege to the contractor
of a renewal for twenty-five years

If He ts Not tn the Consultors’ List for
Archbishop They Wil Net Tell.

The belief prevailed among the Roman
Catholic clergy vesterday that Bishop
MieDonnell of Brookivn was not in the
ist of three candidates for Archbishop
named by the irremovable rectors and
consultors, but because of the pledge of
secrecy by which the rectors were bound,
no official confirmation of this belief could

The opinion held so generally by the
clergy was based on a sort of canvass
made of the priests before they went into

session. The canvass indicated
was the purpose of the majority to adhere
strictly to a policy of home rule and to

~elect three candidates living in the diocese
of New York

Following this policy, it is supposed
that the Rev Joseph F. Mooney, Viecar-
General, was placed as dignior, or the sec-
