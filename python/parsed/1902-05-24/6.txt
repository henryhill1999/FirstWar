Chartes Carrati of Carreliten.

The interest recently awakened in our
colonial era has led the United States Catho-
He Historical Soctety to put forth a volume
containing a number of letters penned by
Charles Carroll of Carrollton, most of
which are now printed for the first time
The « dence has been edited by
Mr. Thomas Meagher Field, who, by means
of an juction and a running com-
mentary, supplies the equivalent of a bieg-
raphy of Charles Carroll and of his family
Whatever doubt may hang over the origin

was in his ninety-seeond year when, in

we taake the following extract: *You

The doctrinal troubles of the Presbyr-
terian Church are illustrated with much
vigor in the novel called *Hardwicke,”
by Henry Edward Rood (Harper & Bros.)
The scene of Mr. Kood'’s story is laid in
Ormond, a village of this State, situated
about fiftvw miles the metropolis
When the Rew Ernest Robertaon, the new
minister, wason hie waw to Ormond, he
was apprised by Poster Jackson, the stage
driver, of the extraordinary difficulties
that lay before him Said Foster Jackson:
*The main reason why wou can't etay long
up in Ormond Church is because vou think”
Tt seers as though even a new Preshwterian
minister ought to have found this com-

from

prehensible, but young Mr Robertson |
erprese| surprise. “Because IT think!"
he echoet, *Yes,” responded Foster Jack-

fon,

flicking his horace with the whip, |
*because you think. When you get as | ©

old I be you'll understand that 4 minister
dasen't think-leastwiee not in many
churches, and ‘specially in one like the
Preebyterian Church at Ormond."

It soon became apparent that almost the

 

 

| entire congregation of the Orraond Church

were earnestiy opposed to any thinking
om the pert of their new pastor. They
stood by the Westminster Confession and
by the literal word of the Scriptures. Some
people make their own troubles, but Robert-
fon was not celled upon fomake hia. Almost
before he had time to open his mouth hie
eager flock were at bim, desiring to know
if he had any doubts regarding Adam and
the apple, Noah and the ark, and Jonah
and the whale. The situauon was awk-
ward, because he had not vet made up
his mind what his attitude toward the
higher criticiam should be He had thought
that in the peaceful environment of Ormond
he would have opportunity to turn
questions over quietly in his mind for a
year or two and so come to his conclusions
riowly. We find at the end of the second
chapter a description of what he had al-
ready accomplished in the way of thought
and of his condition of mind at the time
when he went to Ormond. “Le was gradu-
ated from the seminary,” we read, “and
was licensed to preach, and then began a
period of doubt in his own mind, whieh
caused him to go to far countries to study
and observe. For to him, as to millions
of others who believe in future existence,
had come questions in) comparison with
which all others are as idle dreams flitting
across a sleepers mind and instantly for-
gotten. He had not sought to evade the
questions or becloud the replies He
boldly faced therm like a man made in God's
own image—calmly, fearlessly Monthe and
years went by the while he was determin-
ing his pesition. He studied other relig-
ions than his own among those who sought
consolation for their troubled souls in teach-
ings of Confucius and in mosques and Bud-
dhtet temples Then he returned to his
native land and told the white-haired Presi-
dent of his theological seminary what he
had done

*'De vou wish to go one etep further
and tell me what you now think?’ asked
the old man, his eves flashing with enthusie
asm and hope as he regarded the tower of
youthful strength before him, who was
® honest in his search for truth

* ‘Not quite yet, sir,’ replied Robertson,
‘T want to serve in a little church where I
may be at peace and slowly make my final

the

decision Of some questions.” ”

Jason Henry was one of those by whom
this dream of slow and rounded processes
was to be rudely interrupted. Jason was
an elder of the Ormond Church He was
®) vears old, but still vigorous. At the
church sociable, which was arranged in
order to afford the new minister an cpper-
tunity make the acquaintance of his
people, Jason ate heartily, onsuming
an astonishing quantity of chicken salad,
hot biscuits, cake, coffee, preserves, sande.
wiches, cheese and pickles " Having forti-
fied humaelf, he turned to the new minister
and said
“I ben an elder here nigh onto fifty veara
an’ nowadays seems to me preachers don't
preach like they used to an’ oughter don't
say enough ‘bout hell fire and everlastin’
brimetone and torture for sinners. "Stead

‘God" means. But if I beliewed like you,
that he was created by an all-powerful
Being, a monstrous, cruel God that weighted

down from the start with @ load of
sin inherited from me an’ my father an’
gran'father—way back to Adam- if I be-
lieved for one instant that he couldn't
be saved before he had all them debts
paid off, besides fightin’ temptation on
his own hook every day of hie life—I'd
leave thie room, not the wonderin’ man
I am, but a ravin'’, crazy maniack'*

Tt will be aeen that the Ormond pastorate
offered no oppertunity for the quiet epecu-
lation of which Robertson had epoken in
the interview with the President of his
theological seminary. When Foster Jack-
son had finished, Jason Henry steadied
his old bones with his cane and said to the
minister ‘Bout time to go home an’
see to things. But you keep in mind whut
I maid, dominie, Whut we need here is
Rood, old-fashioned preachin'—strong meat
o’ the Bible, an’ plenty of it. Likewise
powerful prayers for light to be throwed
on them as is blinded, like that poor, miser-
able sinner who's just apoke to us. \We must
let the Lord work in His own mysterious

them prophets of old into a@ trance an’
made ‘em write their great proph'sys.
They didn't know whut they was writin’
until it wae all over; but they didn't balk
and kick and try to upset things.”

The new minister kept Jason's remarks
in ind. He had to, for they were fre-
quently reiterated, and the Widow Port
and David Hardwicke, the rich, hard man
of Ormond, also took goot care that he
should not forget the ruling Presbyterian
— in the village When David Hard-
cke drove his daughter from home ia
the dead of night in a raging snowstorm
because she loved the minister, he went
a little too far and did a Little too much,
whether it was good Presbytenaniem or
net Of course, there was a limit to his
power, and, of course, his heartless act
could not operate to prevent & proper senti-
mental termination to the story. We wish
we knew whether the generous young man

that it was the little cripple, Wille Hark
news, who purloined and burned the es-
pensive document containing the list of
trick questions prepared by “a famous
ecclesiastical lawyer in New York" for
the purpose of driving the new minister
in shame and humiliation from the Or-
mond church; also how the exceedingly
nice girl, Marion Ray, got on as 4 trained
nuree. But the story tells much, and is
very vigorous and satisfactory.

 

Nine Stories by Gorty.

Maxim Gorky, the young Russian story
teller, will have to look alive if he is going
to live up to the rather tremendous repu-
tation that his friends are making for him
We shoukd think that he would feel easier
if they would draw it a little mild. It may
be, however, that his stortes are too im-
portant to permit this to be possible

A third edition of *Tales from Gorky,”
tranalated from the Russian by R. Nishet
Bain, comes to us from the Funk & Wag-
nalla Company. Mr Bain calla Gorky ‘a
nomad endowed with that illuminating
epark we call genius,” end “an a
ragamuffin,” and “a remarkable man.”
says with evident pride: ‘It was aan
fortune, some eighteen months ago, in the

pages of the Pilot, to be the first to call the
attention of English readers to the strange
history of a Russian tramp of genius, who
is, moreover, his own chronicler. *

According to Mr. Bain, Gorsy has taken
a niche above Tolstoi (curious how theee
Russians soar), We read; “Maksim Gorky

Maximys the Bitter-is the pseudonym
deliberately chosen, at the outeet of bir
carver, by the young Muscovite author
who is at the present moment (and I do
bot even except the revered name of Tol-
atol) by far the most popular story teller
in the Russian Empire”

The story of the twenty-six bakers who
watched the conquest of a girl by an over
powering soldier with shiny golden hair on
hia arms, andafterward revered the soldier
and reviled the girl, is called “that power
