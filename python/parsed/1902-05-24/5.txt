Is it not possible that * the end ° is
ndicated in this migration to the Epis-
eopal Church of the whole congregation
wf a Church built generally upon the
same Confession of Faith which was
expurgated and decorated by the Gen-

al Assembly on Thursday? Is it not
possible that that was the very end to
vhich some of those most actively em-

doyed in getting up the revision were
consciously proceeding?

Nothing is more obvious than that the
Presbyterian Church will lose its reason
‘or separate existence whenever it sub-
~titutes for the definite and precise sys-
‘am of doctrine which has been its for

1ore than three hundred vears, the am-
biguous declaration of this hysterical
nesting The duplicity of the state-
nent is intended, primarily, to afford
ficial excuse for the teaching in Pres-
*¥Yterian theological schools which con-
radicta the Westminster Confession, as
s indicated very strikingly in the article
on the Bible. But it also furnishes justiti-
ation, and undoubtedly was so intended,

w the large number of Presbyterians
vho have passed over to the Episcopal
‘“hurch, at least so far as church attend-
ince ia concerned, No such change can
wave been made with any serious ex-
nectation of bringing back these desert-
ms, to whom, after their experience of
ne Episcopal liturgy, the Presbyterian
service would seem bare and uninviting,
ao matter how comfortable might be the
joctrine preached, as compared with the
yarshness of the retribution taught in
the old Confession.

As the Presbyterian Church cannot
get these people back, is there not reason
for suspecting that some of the influ-
ences powerful in the committee of re-
vision were not averse to having it fol-
low them? One of this committee is a
jayman who is a Presbyterian elder in
New York, but an Episcopal vestryman
in Lenox. The school of theology to
which Dr. Briccs belongs is jubilant
over the new siatement; and where bas
he gone?

The formal secession to the Episcopal
Church of the entire membership of a
Congregational church of New Jersey
at this very time must strike everybody
as significant. May it not be asymptom
of a general disorder in the Calvinistic
Churchea—of a fever of revulsion which
the Presbyterian General Assembly
sought to mitigate temporarily with the
soporific of an ambiguous doctrinal
statement compounded in a spirit: of
surrender to popular religious tastes at
this tire?’

Another contemporary secession will
receive fresh impetug from this attempt
to get away from the logie of the re-
ligious position. It ‘is the seceasion
to the agnosticism which gives up all
religious belief.

Oiled Wheels

On Wednesday the Senate took up the
colossal Public Buildings bill as it came
from the House, amended the same in
not less than 107 particulars involving
increase or decrease of appropriations,
and then passed the bill.

It is necessary to say that this per-
functory examination of one of the most
scandalous measures ever considered
in Congress was not conducted with a
corrective intention, As amendment
after amendment was rattled off by the
chairman of the Committee on Public
Buildings and Grounds, and adopred
without a word of dis mor even the
formality of a vote, the enormous aggre-
gate of about seventeen mallions origi-
nally carried by the bill was steadily in-
creased. The amendments indicated n
change of policy or of principle. They
merely registered differences of opinion
as to details between the Senate mana-
gers of the porkly distribution and their
brethren of the House. Only 21 of the to?
amendments in question effected reduc.

The Memorial to Rochambeau.

Although more than one hundred and
twenty vears have passed since CORN-
warirs's York
ahal! prove to-day by the unveiling of a
statue to Marshal RochaMApeat that we
atul remember the decisive part taken
by the commander of our French alles
in the achievement of the victory which
gave our country independence. It
fitt'ng that such a tribute should be paid
to him who was the official incarnation
of the aympathy, the sacrifices and the
services for which we were indebte!
to France amid the birth-throes of our
strugi:.e for national existence

The greatness of the obligation which
one people may confer upon another is
to be measured, not only by the value
of the gift to the beneficiary, but also
by the magnitude of its cost to the bene-
factor. To us the aid received from
the Government of Loris XVI. was
not only precious, but indispensable;
to the ancien régime, that gave it, the
price was bankruptey and min. Long
before the French monarchy decided
to confront England in our defence,
it secretly furnished the money with
which the Continental Army waa en-
abled to keep the fleld; for their cannon,
their muskets, their ammunition, their
clothes, their shoes, their food, the sol-
diers under WASHINGTON were repeat-
edivy indebted to France. As early aa
Jan. 13, 1777. when Brrooyne’s sur-
render was ten months distant, the
American Commissioners in Pans were
informed that, while, as yet, the King
was tunable to furnish therm either ships
or convoys, he would mark to therm his
good will by affording them secret
suceors which would extend their credit
and their purchases. The promise was
lovally and quickly performed. It was
arrange that half a million of lirres
should be paid to the bankers of the
Commissioners quarterly, the first in-
stallment within three days. The Com-
missioners were further encouraged to
contract with the Farmers-General to
furnish to the latter 56.000 hogsheads
of tobacco, on which contract thew re-
ceived an advance of a million livrea
Three ships laden with mulitary stores
were presently allowed to go to sea,
two of which reached America in season
for the summer campaign which was
to end in triumph at Saratoga.

Throughout 1777, the stream of oo-
vert supplies from France continued to
reach the American patriots, and on
March 13, 1778, the French Ambassador
in London \eft with the British Secre-
tary of State a reacript announcing
that * the United States of North Amer-
ica are in full possession of independence
which they had declared on the ath of
Jule, 1778; and, to consolidate the con-
nection between the United States and
respective plenipoten-
tiaries had signed a treaty of
and commerce.” This reseript
equivalent to a declaration of war, and,
thenceforward, for some five vears
the French Government was constrained
not only to uphold the cause of liberty
in North America, but to protect its
own dependencies by the maintenance
of fleets and armies in al] quarters of
the giohe

That the effort would far out-tax its
strength waa from the outset clear to
Necker, who, having been called to pre-
side over the French finances, was alive
to their desperate condition, and aceord-
ingly had desired that France should pre
serve A strict neutrality. FREDERICK
the Great, whose own poverty made hima
keen observer of his neighbors’ revenues
and expenditures, foretold repeatad|iy
the collapse of the French monarchy
if Loria XVI. should break the peace
in the interest of the American insur-

gents. The prediction was literally
and promptly fulfilled. It was the
enormous debt incurred in the world-
wide contest following the espousal
of the American cause that exhausted
the tinancial resources of the ancien

régime and compelled the calling of the
States-General, which involved France
n revolution. If, then, the value of a
g is to be caused bv its cost to the
giver indebtedness to the
archy of Loria XVI. was measureless
The vast importance of French

soon demonstrated in many ways. In

he did not attain the rank of Marshal

that State that “the French troops
would be restrained by the strictest

discipline; and that, acting under Gen.

WASHINGTON, they would live with the |

Americans as their brethren. I assure
the General Assembly that, as brethren,
not only my life, but the lives of the
troops under my command, are entirely
devoted to their service.” The pledge
thus given was faithfully kept. From
the outset to the end of his career in
America RocHAMREAU comported him-
self as the commander, not of independ-
ent but of auxiliary troops. While there
were hostile divisions and angry jeal-
ousies between CLINTON and Corn-
WALLIS, the two chief British officers
in the United States, perfect concord
and cooperation characterized the move-
ments of the Americans and their French
allies

A Chance of a Thousand.

Mr Mircuete of the Miners’ Union
has now the opportunity to do what, in
eur opinion, would be of matchless help
to the case he represents.

The load) which agitators without
principle have piled upon the back of
organized labor is heavy. Leaving out
the question of violence, the times when
contracts have prevented any large
bodies of laboring men fired by a desire
to strike from obeving the impulse of the
moment are few

bound not to strike, began the moment
the anthracite miners stopped work. If

than has been done by any of his prede-

The fact that a bituminous strike is

sion and repudiation of the suggestion
by the organization thus accused of pos-
sible treachery, must inevitably be hurt-
ful to organized labor's standing with

New Haven, Conn., May 23 —Before Judge
Silas A. Robinson of the Superior Court
here to-day the motion to dissolve the in-
junction against the removal of the seve:,-
teen milion dollar estate of Henry B Plant
from Connecticut to New York was argu

The injunction was granted reo v
upon the request of Charles E. Hoad«:
and Horace G. Hoadley, both of Wa
bury, who alleged that they were heirs
at law, and that they would be ir .
by the transfer of the estate fron@Coniect
cut to New York. The plaintiffe are son
of the late H. P. Hoadley of this city, a
half-brother of Henry B_ Plant The
defendants are Mra. Henry Rradiey Plant
the widow, and her son Morton F. Plas:
both of New York

The court was informed that the Plan
estate had already been distributed, tw
thirde to Plant's son and one-third to th.
widow, the distribution taking t

THE NEW TREATY WITH MEXICO.

Arbitrators of the Pius Fund Dispute
Must He Foretercrs.
Wasnrnaton, May 23.—In the trearr
arrangement signed vesterday
Mexico and the United States for the se
tlament of the Pius fund dispute by its re'-
erence to the permanent trituinal of a
tration at The Hague, there is a provis)
that the two arbitrators to be firet «+
shail not be taken from the list of per

  

 

 

 

 

betwee

arbitrators of the two countries ene
but shall be forei gners, This provi«
was deemed necessary in view of racer

experiences in arbitrations. In nea
every case the arbitrator selected by a
Government from its own citizens
jects has insisted on giving ‘he award t
the Government he represents

Another important feature of the treaty
is that Mexico and the United States ma
provide by subsequent arra "
to confine the selection of their art
to the list of members of the perma
tribunal of The Hague, Such an arra: ee
ment would permit the selection of any
Persons, not citizens of the Unit:
or Mexico, who may be desire.
arbitrator or umpire is, however
taken from the list of The Hague tribuns
members.
