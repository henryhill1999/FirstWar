The Valley of Decision—E, Wharton

The “Old Dodge’ Is NOT
A Smart Trick Because
People Now Look and Think
and Compare for Them-

selves.

The old shift, the old evasion of attempting to justify high
prices by sulking behind claims of superior qualities is
clearly revealed when you compare our prices for Books with
the prices charged by others. However, the price-differences
in Our favor are not nearly as great on Books as on other
lines—-notably

Muslin Underwear.

Some dealers do not pretend to sell at low prices. They
explain, saying in substance: “The personal convenience of
having your purchases cnee is ample compensation for
the extra cost.” That's an honest admission of a general
palicy, But there are storekeepers of quite a different ilk.

hey have charge accounts—tax their customers to maintain
the expensive system, and endeavor to convince the public
that their prices are as low as ours. And when we show
conclusively that such representations are untrue, they
intrench themselves in coward’s castle and exploit the old
subterfuge of “better quality.”

Books convey their own story of the Macy methods, And
women are the surest critics concerning Muslin Underwear.
The ones who buy for cash are certain to discriminate in
favor of the store that offers the best qualities for least
money. That’s Macy's, every time

 

We could pile item on item until this whole page over-
flowed—each showing that—quality for quality—our prices
are never matched. Take China, for example:

Theo Haviland’s China Din-
ner Sets, 100 pieces, includ-
ing soup tureen and plat-
ters, new shapes and the
daintiest of decorations,
stippled gold handles,

Advertised elsewhere as a bargain at
twenty dollars,

me 914,890 &

All stores that sell China have Theo
Haviland’s Dinner Sets—easiest thing in
the world to make comparisons.

Men’s Shirts
Ready-to-wear Shirts, made-to-measure Shirts—
Dress Shirts, Negligee Shirts, Night Shirts—we
offer unequalled values in all lines. We are bent
on getting careful men, who have a thought of
thrift connected with their Shirt buying, to come
here and see the extent of our Shirt stock—and the
excellence and economy it represents.

Men’s Unlaundered Shirts at 68c

We've been making and selling them for over twenty years and they

c we equal to any other store’s $1.00 Shirt. Materials are
68 chosen with greatest care, workmanship is always sub-
ter must be maintained.

jected to the most critical examination. Their high charac-

No skimping, slighting or stinting at any
point. Made of Utica Nonpareil muslin, soli three-ply linen bosom,
linen neck band and wristbands, handworked buttonholes, open back
or open front, sizes run from 13) to 18 inches. Unequalled value at
O8c.

Men’s Negligee Shirts at 94c

These are also our own productions—made in our factory to
compete with and surpass the best $1.50 Shirt on the mar-
ket—tine madras in all the newest patterns and colorings,
including tan and gray solids and stripes, plaited bosoms,
two pair cuffs, 94c.
White Nainsook Negligee Shirts, dainty-self-colored checks and
narrow satin stripes, attached and detached cuffs, so'd by others
at $1.50; our price 94c.

Pure Linen Negligee Shirts $2.74

Men's Negligee Shirts, made of pure linen, bosoms and
backs plaited, attached cuffs, same material and workmanship
of a well-known brand that retails everywhere at $3.50; our
price $2.74.

$1.00 Negligee Shirts at 64c.

Made of fine corded madras, neat figures and stripes on
white grounds, cut full and roomy, worth $1.00; our price 64c.

Shirts [ade-to-[leasure

David and John Anderson's imported Madras is the best
fabric for Negligee Shirts. They are shown and highly rec-
ommended by all the most exclusive Shirt makers, who ask
from $3.50 to $4.50 for them. Our price is $2.99, and we
guarantee every Shirt to fit with the nicest perfection. No
one can put better workmanship into a Shirt than we put
into these. What more could be asked?

Another grade of madras, large variety of exclusive

designs, $2.34. Same workmnship as the $2.99 ones.
White Dress Shirts, $1.49, $1.99 and $2.49. Others ask
$3.00, $3.50 and $4.00. The only difference between these
and ours is the price. That favors our products, of course.

Men’s Night Shirts

Men's Night Shirts, made of fine cambric, cut full and long,
trimmed with neat woven braid, sizes 15 to 19; our price 49c.

Boys’ Negligee Shirts at 89c.

Boys’ Negligee Shirts, made of fine madras, scores of the
prettiest patterns and colorings, plain and plaited bosoms,
attached or detached cuffs, 89c.

Boys’ Linen Collars, all the popular summer shapes, 9c.
