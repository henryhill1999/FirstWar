(NV AWERICAN BY MARRIAGE

| And Entitled te Come in, Trachoma or Ne
} Trachema.

The United States Cirewit Court of
Appeals sustained the Circuit Court
yesterday in deciding that analien woman
wha marries an American citizen be-
comes a citizen. The Department of
Commerce and Labor ordered the de-
portation of Mrs. Paris der Hohanessin,
an Armenian woman who came to this
country in December, 1908, after having
| married an American citizen in her
native country. The woman was suffering
from trachoma when she got here, Judge
Hand vacated the order, holding that
the woman was a citizen of this country
by virtue of her marriage. Assistant
United States Attorney Pratt, for the
Government, asserted that under the
Federal law a foreign born woman who
marries an American citizen can be
considered’a citizen only in case she
herself is capable of naturalizatian. Even
then, Mr. Pratt declared, the marriage
must take place in this country. He is
overruled,

The cause of the accident was not re-
ported, Capt. Gove promised to send
@ more complete report later to the Navy
Department. Capt. Gove asked that a
tug be sent from the Norfolk Navy Yard
to Hampton Roads to take off the bodies
of the victims of the accident, and to
transfer fireman Phillips, the only man
injured, to a shore hospital. The vic-
tims of the accident suffered from burns
caused by escaping steam

An unusual series of accidents has
befallen the veasels of the navy within
the last few days. The South Carolina,
Michigan and Dubuque lost port pro-
pellers within a few days of each other.

The Delaware had been detached from
the Atlantic flee and ordered to Hampton
Roads to transport the body of the late
Sefor Don Anibal Cruz, former Chilean
Minister here, to his native country. She
was scheduled to leave about January 31
for Valparaiso with the body, returning
to the Atlantic coast next May. It is not
known at the Department whether the
ship has been damaged so much as to
make it necessary to choose another
battleship for the trip to Chile.

Capt, Gove sent a telegram to the
Navy Department to-night giving further
details of the accident. His despatch
was aa follows:

“Three back headers of boiler ©, fire-
room 4, blew out explosively, killing
eight and injuring one, who will probably
die. They were all the men on duty
in that fireroom. Board of officers im-
mediately appointed to investigate and
report. Not yet completed their ex-
amination Extent of damage ten back
headers injured in boiler O Need ten
new ones, and probably corresponding
tubes. Cause cannot yet be placed ”

NorFouk, Va., Jan. 17.-—Because of a
snowstorm the Delaware, on which eight
men were killed and another fataily in-
jured to-day, was unable to pass into
Hampton Roads to-night. The vessel
anchored to-night twelve miles off Cape
Henry and is not likely to come in before

GERMAN EMPIRE 40. EARS OLD,

Outburst of Militant Patriotism to Cele.
brate Anniversary.
Special Cable Despatch to THR SUN

RBreuw, Jan. 17.—On the eve of the
fortieth anniversary of the foundation of
the empire the presa indulges in an out-
buret of militant. patriotiam and natural
pride over the nation’s progress. The
seml-official North German Garetle warns
the country against resting on her laurels
and sternly adjures her to remember
that the development of a nation is strife,
nothing but strife

Gen. von der Goltz, whom the Kaiser
made a Field Marshal on New Year's Day,
made a speech of a similar tenor, saying
among other things:

“The devotees of eternal peace have
received sharp sword thrusts from Ger-
many. It would be merciless to strike
deeper their wounds, but 4 would recall
Count von Moltke'’s saying, ‘Eternal
peace is a dream, and not even a pleasant
dream.'"

STOLE A LIMOUSINE.

 

 

Heward 8. Bowns Owned It Samuel

Elseman Got His Stolen Car Back.

A limousine touring car belonging to
Howard 8S. Bowns, a_ wholesale coal
dealer of 1 Broadway, who lives at the
Apthorp apartments, Seventy-ninth street
and Broadway, was stolen from the cor-
ner of Eighty-fourth street and Columbus
avenue last night. The chauffeur and
footman had left the machine standing
there for a few minutes and when they
returned it was gone. Both were so
excited that they could scarcely tell
the police. The car is black with white
running gear.

Another automobile was taken from
in front of the residence of Samuel Eise-
man of 41 West Eighty-ninth street on
Monday night. The chauffeur went into
the house and the car disappeared while
he was inside. It was found last evening
by Policeman Brown of the Morrisania
station at 163d
avenue, The Bronx

At 2:30 yesterday morning the residents
of that neighborhood were awakened by

'

loud noises which they traced to a machine

and three men dressed as chauffeurs
The men realized that they were being

seen, so they grabbed two emergency |

tires and went away. The car stood
there all day, but the neighbors didn't
think to notify the police Mr. Eiseman
| came up and claimed the machine, which
he valued at $5,000,

| DENOUNCES PROHIBITION.

| Governor of Alabama Declares for Sale of
| Liquors in Citles. ‘

Moxroomery, Ala, Jan. 17.—Deelar-
ing that the “Peace and dignity of the
State, promotion of temperance and that
majestic supremacy of the law upon
which alone depends peace and security
alike demand that a remedy for the de-
plorable conditions now existing in the
larger cities of the State should be found,”
Gov. O'Neal, in his message to the Legis-
lature to-day, recommended that some
| provisions of the prohibition law be re-
pealed and that a general law be passed
permitting the sale of liquors in cities
containing 13,000 and over.

More than one-third of the message
dealt with the liquor question. In his
discussion the Governor gives a review
of prohibition, saying that the crusade
against liquor has furnished opportunity
for the fanatic and demagogue, the agi-
tator and selfish politician. The Gov-
ernor declared that agitation of the liquor
question has divided parties, separated
and estranged friends, worked serious
harm to the Church and has cast evil
influence even over family circles,

CAWE IN) TROPIC DRESS.
Panamans Heard They Would Have to
Pay Dreadful Duty on Warm Clothes,

Francisco Viafora of Colon arrived
yesterday by the Royal Mail linen Mag-
dalena with a bamboo cane and a Panama
hat. He wore other things, but they would
hardly be regarded as protection against
the 40 temperature that occasionally hits
this neighborhood in January. His sis-
ter was with him, and she wore a dress of
light pink materia!.

francisco said that he had been told
that he would have to pay heavy duty if
he brought any winter clothing along,
and he decided that as we seemed to be
having moderate weather he would take
a chance. He and his sister shivered on
the Royal Mail pier until their uncle, who
had been telephoned for, arrived in a
great furry ulster and with a cab. The
young woman was enveloped in the
ulster and stowed away with her brother
in the cab and teken to a hotel. A tailor
and a dressmaker went to the hotel later
and outfitted the pair Eskimo style
