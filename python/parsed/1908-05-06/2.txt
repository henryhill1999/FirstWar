ARCGER'S PORTRAIT IN PLACE. |

Gt to the Pire Department Hung on the
Wall at Headquarters,

The memorial portrait of Deputy Fire
Chief Charles W. Kruger, who was killed
in a Canal atreet fire a little more than two
months ago, was presented to the Fire De-
partment yesterday, the presentation exer-
cises taking place at Fire Headquarters,
where the portrait ia to hang, The picture |
ia life size and was painted by Prof. d'Or
Danton, It represents Chief Kruger in his
rubber coat and boots and his familiar
white helmet, standing before a burning
building and directing the firemen behind
him. The portrait hangs on the east wall
of the third story, just outside the Com-
missioner’s room, It is set in a heavy gold
frame with a canopy of red

The presentation speech was made by
Brother Anthony of Manhattan College,
He referred to Chief Kruger as a proof
that the age of chivalry is not past and
spoke of him as “one who never shirked
his work, who seemed to know and love
naught but duty and who trampled all else
under foot; as a man who for more than @
third of a century had promptly, cheer-
fully, perseveringly followed the call of
duty even unto death,”

In accepting the portrait in behalf of
the Fire Department Comumiasioner Nicho-
las J, Hayes said of Chief Kruger that
malice or envy never harbored in his mind
and that he was the equal of any fireman
that ever lived

A large company of firemen and their
adtuirers Was preseut at the exercises,
Kinsmen of the chief occupied seats of
honor immediately in front of the portrait
Chey were Mra, Kruger, her daughters
Bina and Lrenegnd Chief Kruger’s sister,
Mrs Frederick Volzing.

Che committee thd? raised the fund for
the portrait was also present. It was com-
posed of William B, Ellison, Edward L
Olson, George L. Hunter and Hl. Van Den-
berg. They secured $1,800. This is more
than sufficient to pay for the portrait, The
surplus will go to the firemen's relief fund

 

 

JOUNSON BOOM IN) ALABAMA,

Three Hundred Men Campaigning for Him
Good Work Elsewhere,

May 5

 

WASHINGTON The two Senators

and the nine Representatives from Alabama,
all Democrats, each received this telegram
to-day from A. G. Smith, a lawyer of Bir-
mingham

‘Three bundred able men in Alabama are
conducting, a8 a committee, a campaign “or
Gov. Jobn A. Johnson of Minnesota for ‘be
Presidential womination, We would like
to have an expression of opinion from you
as to Johnson's availability for the nomina-
fon

Up to a late bour it could not be learned
that any of the Alabama delegation had
responded

The Johnson boomers were busy to-day
They got Senator Smith of Maryland to
declare for an uninetructed delegation
from his State to the Denver convention,
and Representative Leake of New Jersey
to make a etatement favorable to the Minne-
sota Governor's candidacy

“The nomination of a man like Johnson,”
said Mr. Leake, “would afford an oppor-
tunity to present clearly to the people the
issues of the Democratic party. We would
carry States in the Northwest which Bryan
cannot possibly swing. He would poll
more votes in the South than Bryan.

“It is to the action of the South that
we should be looking, In the North it is
well known that the nomination of Bryan
would mean the loas of many thousands of
Democratic votes. We are beginning to
realize that the Nebraskan's nomination
would be as costly in the South. Johnson
is the man who typifies the genuine princi-
ples of genuine Democracy, And I may
say that my information is that the South,
rapidly awakening to the value of the man,
is making up its mind to give him the nomi-
nation at Degver.”

 

Ta(t Seems Sure of California.

San Francisco, May 5.-Twenty-five
thousand votes were cast at the primary
election here to-day. The regular Repub-
licans swept all districts except a few pre-
cincta in which the Lincoln-Roosevelt fac-
tion was strong. There is no question that
the regular Republican party will control
the State convention by a good majority.

The delegates at large to the Chicago
convention will be Gov. Gillett, George ”
Knight, M. H. de Young and Harrison Gray
Otis, All of these are Taft men, though
Knight would probably favor Roosevelt
if he thought there was hope of nominat-
ing him.

Bob Davis Wants to Run a ‘Bryan Special"
te Denver.

the Democratic leader of
Hudson county, N. J., said yesterday he
is looking up passengers for a Denver
special to the Democratic national con-
vention. He doesn’t propose to ride on
ex-Senator James Smith's anti-Bryan train
and wants as many of the faithful as can
raise the price of a ticket to accompany
him and the other district delegates from
Hudson on his express de luxe. The Davis
special will stop at various points in the
State to pick up Bryan shouters.

WONDERING ABOUT HUGHES

SUPPOSE HE SHOULD DECIDE TO
RUN FOR GOVERNOR AGAIN?

 

 

Suggested Appointment of M. Lina Bruce
to the Supreme Bench Would Take Him
Out of the Race for the Nomination

state and National Conditions Mixed,

An announcement made yesterday to the
effect that most of the Supreme Court
Justices of New York county, inoluding
those of the Appellate Division, and very
many lawyers of high rank in the profes-
sion, had recommended to Gov, Hughes
that he appoint M.Linn Bruce to the vacancy
caused by the resignation of Justice David
Leventritt, elicited the information from
the camps of the Woodruff men and the

Parsons men that it will mean much to |
their minds if the Governor heeds the |
Mr. Bruoe waa Lieuten-

recoinmendations.
ant-Governor under Gov. Higgins, and was
defeated for that place on the ticket headed
by Gov. Hughes. Gov. Higgins thereupon
appointed Mr. Bruce to the Supreme Court
Justiceship made vacant by the resignation
of Morgan J. O'Brien

The Woodruff men and the Parson
men are actitely curious as to Gov, Hughes's
future, especially if the Governor, failing
to be nominated for President and con-
tinuing to withetand any movement to
nominate him for the Vice-Presidency,
should at the last moment change bis mind
renomination for

about pot desiring &
Governor. The Governor has sald in
personal conversatibns that he desired

to return to the practice of his profession
on January 1. Yet in view of recent events,
especially the Governor's stand on the
Aguew-Hart racing bill, most of the Re-
publicans connected with the State or-
ganization are rather concerned lest the
Governor should seek renomination, If
he appoints Mr, Bruce to the Yench these

politicians will be inolined to take it as |

indicating that he ia pot averse to & Te-
nomination

Many organization Republicans believe
that Mr. Bruce will be nominated for Gov-
ernor next fall. They say that he would
inake a far more available candidate than

either Senator Horace White of Syracuse |

or Speaker James W. Wadsworth, Jr., of

Geneseo for the reason that he has not |

been compelled to take part in the tre-
mendous discussion over the Agnew-Hart
racing bills. The practical politicians of the
organization, from William Barnes, Jr.,
down, estimate that the racing people in
the State represent anywhere from 40,000
to 60,000 votes, all of which, they urge,
would be cast against any Republican
who haa supported the Agnew-Hart legis-
ation, Speaker Wadsworth’s Republican
majority in the Assembly voted to pass the
Agnew-Hart bills, and Senator White in
the upper Honse took the same stand
Che appointment of Mr. Bruce to the bench
would, of course, take him out of the group
of available candidates for the Republican
nomination for Governor, The other most
likely candidate discussed was Supreme
Court Justice Joho Woodward of James-
town, now of the Appellate Division of the
Second Department, whose term on the
bench expires December $1, 1910, But all
this was incidental to the discussion over
Mr. Bruce, and the very general belief on
on the part of organization Republicans
that if Mr, Bruce succeeds Mr. Leventritt,
Gov. Hughes will eventually seek @ re-nom-
ination for Governor.

This discussion did not in any way
interrupt Gov. Hughes's Presidential boom.
Gen. Stewart L. Woodford, president of
the Hughes National League, is to open
headquarters in Chicago on Monday. This
will be thirty-five days before the national
convention is held in that city on June 12.
Gen. Woodford said that he would be in
Chicago a good part of the thirty-five days.
He is to talk with members of the national
committee and with all delegates arriving
in Chicago. The Hughes headquarters in
the Hotel Astor are palatial. It was stated
yesterday that Gen, Edwin A. McAlpin,
treasurer of the Hughes State League,
had raised $30,000 for the expenses of these
headquarters and those to be opened in
Chicago, Gov. Hughes was in town on
Monday night, but he did not visit his
headquarters at the Astor. That, however,
was an insignificant fact, though some
seemed to think it was* important. It
wasn't, for the reason that the Governor
is in constant communication with Gen.
Woodford and Gen. Woodford frequently
visite the Governor at Albany.
Ex-Governor Frank 8, Black, William L.
Ward, Republican national committeeman
for the State; George W. Aldridge, first
vice-president of the Hughes State League,
and ex-Representative Lucius N. Littauer
had an informal disoussion yesterday
afternoon as to the situation in the State.
All agreed that it was decidedly mixed,
and as for the Presidential outlook it was
even more mixed, although one or two
of these conferees believed that the tide
was running swiftly in favor of Secretary
Taft.

The letter is signed by the Rev J, Milton
Waldron, D. D., president of the National
Negro American Political League of the
United States, ‘Lhis organization whieh
has opened headquarters in Washington,

fecting a campaign which is to be waged

to the eud that the negro shall be impressed |
with the idea “that the salvation of bis |

The National Negro American Political

It is proposed to hold a series of meet-
ings protesting against the nomination of
Roosevelt or ‘Taft in Chicago beginning ten
days before the meeting of the hepublican
national convention.

“Ninety per cent. of the colored vote will
be cast against the Republican ticket |
either Roosevelt or Taft ie nominated,”
the letter says. “This is bound to have its
effect alao upon the Congressional nomin-
ines.”

The negroes connected with the league

| give notice that they cannot be dissuaded
from their course by Booker T. Washington,
William T. Vernon of Kansas, the negro
Registrar of the Treasury, and former Gov-
ernor Pinchback of Louisiana, who are sup-

| porting Secretary Taft. These men, the

league points out, know all about political
conditions in the South, but they are un-

| familiar with conditions affecting negroes
in the North,

While the Taft managers are inclined to
leaders in the House are particularly con-
cerned, inasmuch as if ‘Taft is nominated
and the fight by the negroes is continued
to the polls the result may be to jeopariize
Republican success in the Congresselections
It was pointed ott to-day that there are
twenty-five Congress districts represented
by Republicans where the
plurality is lesa than the negro vote. There
are fifty-two districts where the Republicans
are compelled to put up a determined fight
