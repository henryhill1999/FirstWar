Hecond the Senator Cassidy would not

with Senator MeCarren and others who were
in the clubhouse during the afternoon,

Witom H, Du Bois, the owner of the
Pareliogue Stable, lost a chance to win a neat
ite bankroll when his two-year-old Ross
Venton won the last rece at Jamaioa yester-
day Ross Fenton, a gray gelding by Maxim

Sermbrich, had been working well at Graves-
end, but he had not shown enough, in the
sstiyation of Owner Du Bois and Trainer
Fran Taylor, to warrant much support in
the betting ring. As a result of this lack
of confidence Ross,Fenton opened at 30 to 1
and went up to 40. Tle was ridden by k

Dr. Darling and Lady Nolsen, 2:14 1-2,
Placed Under the Ban.

It happens always that the unusual and the
usual rub shoulders together at the meetings
of the board of review of the National Trotting
Association. The spring session began yes-
terday at the Murray Hill Hotel. Firat to
appear in the board room was A. M. Griffin,
who beginning in 1876 has come on for every
session to serve as official stenographer, His
first notes were written out in longhand, the
next succeeding in the capitals of the earliest
vintage of typewriters and since then in the
long term of continuous service Griffin has
trotted along head to head with the moat
modern ways of transcribing hianotes. There
are not so many stenographers who have
been on one job since before the general in-
troduction of the typewriter in 1477.

As customary, President P. P. Johnson,
Lexington, Ky., was chairman and W, H.
Gocher, Hartford, Conn., secretary, Mem-
bers in attendance were J. M. Johnaon, Calais,
Me., of the Eastern district; De Foreat Settle,
Syracuse, N, Y., of the Atlantic district and
George Campbell Brown, Spring Hill, Tenn,
of the Central district, There is no repre-
sentative of the Pacific district, but to-day
the Western district will be spoken for by
John C, Welty, Canton, Ohio,

On the witness stand John F, Kingsley, @
driver of Pomfret, Conn, revealed how he
had in innocence been led astray by horses
and men, One Dr, BE. N. 8. Darling of Put-
nam, Conn., as much evidence revealed, had
owned @ no account mare, Molly O. It was
alleged he bought a sort of equine fac-
simile for the slow one called Lady Nelson,
2:1444, and sent her to be trained and raced
by Kingsley as Molly 0, At the same time
Darling, said the complaints, induced W. H,
Davenport, a wealthy resident of Pomfret, to
buy the green gelding Buster Wilkes and to
send it to Kingsley to be raced. This was
really Billy Wilkes, 2:18',. Kingsley out quite
a wide ewath at meetings throughout Con-
necticut and Massachusetts for a spell last
sunimer ss

When Buster Wilkes took second money of
$00 at Sturbridge, Mass., Secretary Gocher
notified Davenport he was standing for a
ringer. The owner asserted ignorance and
did not let the horse start again, The verdict
was that Davenport must bay back the Wenge!
winnings and the $50 fee to change name if he
desires to regain a good standing on the
trotting turf.

Driver Kingsley showed hia innocence in
this case and with regard to the identity of
Molly ©. Both horses had fooled him,

“Lf | am ordered to repay any money won,”
declared the reinsman, who was very ner-
vous, “it will only ore out some more of
my poor luck, When I took up trotting l
invested all my money, some $8,000, with a
business man of my town, for I thought
driving too risky. Well, a girl. got a $10,000
verdict ageing him for breach of promise
and the Sheriff got my money. He has been
baying me back $400 every three months,
and the only trotting winnings I could make
good would be from the next instalment.”

The board expelled Darling and Lady
Nelson, 2:14°4. The driver, Kingsley, was
exonerated under both counts.

HANGS UP TRACK RECORD IN
GREENFIELD STAKES.

 

Artonette, Bad News, Big Chief and Saylor,
Also Heavily Backed, Come Home
~Rows Fenton, a 40 to 1 Shot, Wins for
Patchegue Stable—Four Choices Score.

Four favorites and a second choice were
muccessful at Jamaica yeaterday and the
layers lost heavily, The perfect weather
brought out a crowd that numbered close to
15,000 persons, and all of them appeared to
enjoy the outing. The stake feature was the
Greenfield, for two-year-olds, at four and a
half furlongs, in which F. A, Forsythe's High
Private, the best youngster shown here ao
far, was an odds on favorite, backed down to
1to3, At the start Notter went to the front
with James RK. Keene's Voodoo, 12 to 1, who
led by a safe margin for the firat quarter,
Then he ran out on the turn and EB, Dugan
took command with High Private, who rushed
into the stretch in majestic fashion, He
Was eased up at the end and won rather
easily by half a length in 0:55 4-5, anew track
record, The Newcastle Stable’s Preceptor,

9 to 2, had ten lengths over A. J. Joyner's
i

Siskin, 25 to 1, for the place.

L. A. Cella won his first race of the season
here when Arionette, backed down to 3, took
the first event, for two-year-olds,tive furlongs.
She had enough speed to cut out the pace
and maintained her advantage all the way
to the wire, where she scored with three
lengths to spare in 1:01 2-5. H, T. Griffin's
Havre, 4 to 1, was always the contender and
beat 8. C. Hildreth's Force, backed from 8 to
18 to 5, by four lengths for the place, Force
was in close quarters most of the time and
can do better. The BR. & 0. Stables Pleas-
ing, reduced from 100 to 60, came from the
ruck in the last quarter and finished a bang up
fourth. Ruble also ran a good race from
where he got off. There was much crowding
just after the start,

E.R. Bradley's Bad News, 0to 10 favorite, war
much the best in the second race, at a mile and
a sixteenth. Notter kept him ineheck while
J. A. Wernberg's Druid, 15 to 1, and Mise A
M. Marrone’s St. Joseph, 25 to 1, led for three-
quarters of a mile. Then Bad News went to
the front and won easily by 1
lengths in 1:48 2-5. John howard’ Dennis
Stafford, backed from 5 to 16 to 5, ran into
the place, four lengths before Druid, the latéer
quitting at the head of the stretch

The Newcastle Stable's Big Chief, 13 to 10
favorite, was victorious in the handicap, at
six furlongs. He was third to the head of
the stretch and was carried wide, but when
Notter touched him with the whip he came
away in fine atyle and won, driving, by three
rartafof a length from M. L. Schwartz's Far

Yest,a20toishot. RK. F. Carman’s Fleming,
payee down to 13 to 5, led for nearly five
urlongs, but Shilling made too much use of
him so that he finished third, two lengths
back. H. P. Whitney's Adriana, 6 to t, had
early speed, but stopped as if short of work.
The time was 1:18 2-5.

J. H. MeCormick's Saylor, 8 to 5 favorite,
was an easy winner of the fifth race, a selling
event, at a mile and a sixteenth. Rockstone
made the pace to the far turn, where he quit,
and Saylor then breezed to the front, coming
home two and a half lengths before Trouble-
maker, 4 to 1, who had a safe margin over
Samuel H. Harris, 4 to 1, for the place. Lad
