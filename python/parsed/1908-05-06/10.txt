FRANCE OPTIMISTIC ABOUT US.

Prince André Poniatowski, president
of the French Finance Corporation, who
arrived yesterday by the North German
Liovd steamship Kronprinzessin Cecilie,
sid be had never been anything exoept
optroistic in regard to the financial future
of the United States, notwithstanding the
flurry through which the country was
passing. France had nobly supported the
American securities when Germany and
Fugland were blue, France never had
been pessimistic, although she had been
cautious. Frenchmen in the United States
had made a careful investigation of Ameri-
ca securities and had been favorably
impressed, The result was that there was,
even in the crisis, much buying in small
orders that aggregated a considerable
amount. French financiers now believed
that the six months sober thought the
Americans had had would result ve
favorably and would tend to prevent wild-
cat speculation,

fhe Prince, who thinks highly of Mr.
Harriman, said that French bankers and
brokers generally entertained a high,opinion
of him, Sinee he had become interested
in Erie the French were following his career
with enthusiasm, especially those French
speculators who were interested in Erie
stock, There was a strong belief that
Mr. Harriman never entered anything
without knowing exactly what he was
Boing to do, :

(.M Muchnie, the American representa
tive of the American Locomotive Works
in France, who was a fellow passenger
vf the Prince, had a good word to say for
the jatter's countrymen. Mr. Muchnio
had the pleasure of selling thirty big loco-
motives, Union Pacific style, to the Paris
and Orient Railway and a number of other
ocomotives for freight trains to other
French railways,

THE M’MANUS RECEIVER
Of a Madison Avenue Furniture Business
Headed by Osborn Congelton.

Thomas J. MeManus, known as The Mo-
Manus, politician, has been appointed re-
ceiver for the Thomas Mathews Company,
dealer in furniture, brie-&-brac and antiques
at Madison avenue and Forty-fifth street.
Judge Davis of the Supreme Court appointed
him in proceedings for the dissolution of
the company brought by Osborn Con-
gelton, president, and Anne MeAllister,
* treasurer, and his bond was fixed at $10,000.

Mr Congaton, stated that the p -

ings were friendly and that the assets will
eventually bring in a fair market sufficient
to pay all creditors in full. At present

Deputy Sheriff O'Neill is in charge on an
attacliment for $2,200 in favor of the London
Realty Company. company owes
$2,400 for rent and was likely to be dis-
possesead, which it is set up would be a

vardship, as many customers have left goods
on consignment, and gome of them are
in Furope and other countries and cannot
be reached in a hurry.

The liabilities are about $24,000, and the
value of he ane is not given. The one
bess was established many years ago by
Francis Colton, who was succeeded by
thomas Mathews, who died in 1900. Mr,
Mathews was succeeded by J. R. McAllister,
who died in October, 1904, and his widow
carried on the business until the present
corporation was formed on April 9, 1906,
with a capital of $100,000. Osborn Con-

GOSSIP OF WALL STREET.

The Street feels as sure now that tlre South-
ern Pacific dividend will be maintained at
6 per cent. as it felt a few weeks ago that the
rate would be reduced, Many beliefs and
theorics have given way before the advance
in the market and well known capitalists who |
last fall were said to be “down and out” are |
now said to be “wallowing In riches.” “Con- |
victlons,” aa one trader remarked yesterday, |

|

 

 

“become strongest at the end of a movement,
and when everybody becomes convinoed that
everything ia rosy the market will probably
react,” ‘

'

The strength of the market afforda little
satisfaction to the commission houses, There
is no business in it for them, Their custo-
mere are doing nothing and rents and other
expenses have to be paid, They would like
to get commissions, but their cllenta cannot
be induced to buy and have no stocks to sell.
The ordinary commission house ie bare of
stocks. Money is cheap and this makes it
look with favor onthe buying side, It draws
attention to the scarcity of stocks in the
Street, elaborates on what this means In the
way of prospective demand and argues that
large interesta have the market entirely in
their control-—intending to work it conalder-
ably higher in antitipation of an improve-
ment both in business and the political out-
look—but faila to extract more than a few
orders from the handful of enstomers that
drop in at its office, The almost complete
absence of buying orders from the general
public makes very interesting the inquiry
aa lo where the stocks sold in the past few days
by operators who realized on the long side
have gone to, If they have not been taken
into other hands after having served the
shorts for covering then it is hard to explain
the diMeculty of borrowing at the present
time even with all allowance for the unwill-
ingnesa of some houses to let stocks get out
of their hands since the recent bear failures,

It is probable that inany of the commission
houses, although talking in favor of an ad-
vance, would welcome a decline that gave
pronise of being more than a inere “healthy
reaction.” They would be able to get busi-
hess on the short side after il became reason-
ably clear that the technical position was
not as atrong as had been supposed and that
stocks could without diflcully be borrowed
tor delivery

“The Southern Pacific summer,” said a
prominent broker, “has been made by a
single swallow. Favorable net earnings have
been shown for one fonth after several
months of poor resulta, and without inquiring
as to what sort of returns are likely to follow
we take it for granted that the road has
emerged for good out of the darkness into
the light. When the bad earnings first began
fo appear explanations were printed monthly
to account for them, and now there are other
explanations, not official but such as might
be called well informed, which put a sorme-
what different complexion on the whole
matter, Such explanations are interesting,
to be sure, tut { never feel quite confident
regarding the atvaire of a company that finde
it necessary to make them,

When Southern Pacific in the forenoon
was making new high records for the year |
two financiers of the future, now serving
as office boys in one of the large brokerage
houses, sal in their corner discussing the |
relative merits of this stock and St. Paul, |
iseues that have been very much io the public
eye within the last few daya. “Southern
Pacific,” said one, “is worth more than St
Paul. It earna more monéy than any other
railroad in the country except Pennsylvania,
and it will earn more than Pennsylvania
when Pennsylvania begins to pay taxes on
ite tunnel in New York like Metropolitan
Street Railway paid to the party in power
and the party out of power.” “Yes,” re-
sponded the other, “but 1 guess that if South-
ern Pacific was as good as you say Harriman
would never have sold half of it to Union
Pacific. He'd have kept it himself.”

The earnings of the Vanderbilt lines for
March created a favorable impression, all
the leading roads in the system showing
increases fo net, the only decreases in this
item being reported by the minor properties,
By reducing operating expenses New York
Central changed a decrease of $607,546 in
gross into an increase of $117,406 in net, Lake
Shore a decrease of $410,753 in gross into an
increase of $4,816 in net, Michigan Central
4 decrease of $268,322 in gross into an increase
of $21,690 in net, and Big Four a decrease of
$103,442 in grows into an increase of $21,154
in net,

The Ohio crop report pul the condition of
winter wheat in that State at 92, as against
85 a month earlier and 74 at the corresponding
date las. year, The improvement here shown
for the month augured well, it was argued,
for the showing for the whole country in the
Government report to be published on Friday.

Perhaps those Missouri Pacific bulls who
assert that FE. H. Harriman will undertake
the task of devising a acheme of financing
for the Gould roads think tinue lies heavy on
his ha nda,

Some brokers regarded the increase of bull
activity in stocks like Amalgamated Copper,
American Smelting and Refining and National
Lead aa an indication of a broadening market
and more aggressive operations, while others
spoke of it as the bringing up of the rear
guard and the closing event of the campaign,
Where all agreed was in asserting that an in-
teresting stage had been reached aud that
the action of the market in the next day or
two would determine whether there was to
bean advance oraretreat, There are a great
many operators now maintaining an armed
neutrality who are ready to fall in with the
aide that offers the more aftractive indice -
ments,

Bull tips on Union Pacific were to be had
for the asking. In the care of Southern Ia-
cific it was not even necessary to ask for them,
They simply could not be eluded. They were
everywhere and in all sorta of forme, hey
greeted one in every office or bumped into him
at every corner and whispered in both his
ears at once, They made bim the most
pleasing promises, which were afterward
fulfilled to euch an extent as to afford a cer-
tain amount of evidence of good faith, and
by so doing converted to the bull side many
speculators who had before been either bear-
ish or apathetic. The expectation that fol-
lowing the meeting of the Union Pacific
stockholders announcement of the new bond
issue would be made proved to be ill founded
and the bull talk on this stock as on Southern
Pacific, concerned for the most part matters
other than the financing of the road's re-
quirements.

It ie said that the Union and Soulbern
Pacific dividends will be declared next week,
and there is no longer any doubt that in each
case the regular rate will be continued

$50,000,000 MORTGAGE ORDERED.

 

Pubile Service Corporation's New Financial
Scheme BMxplained,

Thomas N. Mo(Carter, president of the
Public Service Corporation of New Jersey,
gave out a statement yesterday afternoon,
which said in part;

The board of directors of public service
at their meeting held this afternoon author-
ized the execution of a first mortgage upon
all the property of the corporation, securing
an issue of $50,000,000 at par of 6 per cent
gold bonds, dated Mav 1, 1904. The mortgage
is designed to provide a complete financial
scheme for the company for years to come,
It covers all the real estate of the company,
all the leases of gas and clectrie properties
held by the company, and pledges as security
thereunder all the shares and bonds of under-
lying companies owned by the corporation,
running into a very large total.

Hy the terms of the mortgage $3,725,000 at
par of the bonds are to be forthwith de-
livered by the trustee to the corporation,
This is to recoup the company for better-
ments recently made and contracted for;
$7,250,000 at par are reserved for retiring
4 like amount of collateral gold notes, dated
November 1, 1904, whieh notes are secured
by a pledge of collateral of underlying securi-
ties, which collateral upon the completion of
the refunding of said notes becomes pri-
marily subject to this mortgage; $6,250,000 at
par of said bonds are reserved for retiring a
like amount, or so many thereof as may not
have been converted of the convertible notes
of the company, datad April 16, 1906, The re-
mainder of the total issue is reserved under
most carefully restricted provisions for future
betterments.

Not more than $25,000,000 at par of said
bonds can be certified and delivered under
the mortgage prior to January 1, 1011, and
thereafter not more than $4,500,000 at par
of said bonds can be issued in any one year
for betterments, except that this last pro-
vision je cumulative: that ia to say, if a lesser
number of bonds is taken in one year, an
excess number may be taken the following
year, provided the average does not exceed |
$4,500,000 at par.

The bonds required to be delivered to the
company simultaneously with the execution
of the mortgage have all been sold by the
company, together with a certain additional
amount of bonds, which it is expected will be
certified and delivered during the ensuing
year for additional betterments, so that the
company’s financing for this year is com-
pleted, and it is therefore not contemplated
that any bonds secured by this mortgage
will be offered to the public this year,

MET. RECEIVERS’ CERTIFICATES,

Argument Heard on Appeal From Order |
Authorizing Them, |

Judges Coxe, Ward and Holt, sitting in |
the United States Circuit Court of Appeals,
heard arguments yesterday on the appeal
of the Metropolitan Street Railway Com-
pany and the Morton and Guaranty Trust
companies from Judge Lacombe's order
of March 7 last authorizing the issue of
$3,500,000 in receivers’ certificates. :

J. Parker Kirlin, of counsel for the Metro- |
politan Street Railway Company, argued |
that the certificates should have been made
a lien on the property of the New York
@.ty Railway Company iustead of the Metro-
politan, saying that under the ninety-nine
vear lease between the two roads the New
York City Railway agreed to maintain the
leased lines in good condition. As to
Judge Lacombe's suggestion that the Met-
ropolitan bring an action for waste against
the New York City company because the
latter had allowed the lines to fall into
such condition that they became unprofit-
able, Mr. Kirlin said such an action could
be instituted only ut the termination of the |
lease, which hus still ninety-three years
to run.

Commercial Patlures for April,

Commercial failures in the United States
during April, according to statistics com-
piled by R. G, Dun & Co., were 1,300 in
number and $20,316,468 in amount of de-
faulted iiabilities. This is the best monthly
statement since last November, and the
comparison is still more favorable if the
brokerage and other more or less specula-
(ive concerns are omitted. Thue. the
manufacturing liabilities are much smaller
than in any month since last duly and trad-
ing losses are the lightest since November,
and the aggregate for these two classes,
which embrace the strictly commercial
failures, is more than $7,000,000 less than
in any previous month this reer, A large
increase appears of course when the figures
are compared with those of April, 1907,
when there were only,790 defaults, involving
$11,082,006. =
