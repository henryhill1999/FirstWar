The temperature stood at about 100 de-

the two Governors worked their levers
and the steering gear. They remained at
the job until a quarter of a mile of road
was graded and then departed on a tour
of inspection of other roads. The Kansas
Governor arrived at 3 o'clock in the after-

Mansion was whirled away to the scene of
the road working.

the State fully $1,300,000 in road im-

Special Cable Despatch to Tur Svs

Paris, Aug. 20.—Mrs, Ford Thompson
of St. Louls gave proof of her physical
prowess to-day by running down a thief
who stole her handbag and causing his
arrest.

Mrs. Thompson, who is 25 years
of age, was sitting in the Trocadero Gar-
dena reading when a man snatched her
gold handbag, which is valued at $400,
As she has not adopted the tight skirt
she was able to dash after the thief. She
gained rapidly on the man, so he ran
through the gardens and along the Rue
de Pasay. Then when he was able to run
no longer she grappled with him and held
him until a policeman came to her aid.

The man said his name was Sicre, that
he was 22 years old and had just finished
his military service with the grade of
sergeant. He had taken a course of
training at the Joinville physical culture
school.

Mrs. Thompson told the Magistrate

with her in Reno on the promise of dt-

Attorney Devlin, for the defence, con-
tended that a saloon keeper practically

, “We have proved," Deviin said, “that

that Diggs was apprehensive of a public

Enoagh Evidence to Convict.

“The evidence Introduced by the Gov-
ernment is sufficient tn law to convict
this defendant, but whether or not it
is sufficient to convince you that a verdict
of guilty should be brought tn is for you
to determine,

“The defendant went upon the stand
to testify in his own hehalf. He did not,
however, testify beyond the point where
the four young people were about to board
the train for Reno, Since he did not tes-
{fy concerning the entire transaction you
have a right to take this omission into
consideration, And if he hag failed to
explain or deny any of the testimony in-
troduced against him by reason of his
omissions such failure may be considered
by you. It fs a legal inference that he
would have denied or «xplained these
things had he been able *o.

“If you find that these girla were actu-
ally taken to Reno by the defendant as
charged in the indictment, then only .the
question of intent remains for you to des
termine, The reason advanced by the
defence is not one which will appeal to
your common sense, especially when
taken in connection with the acts of
the defendant, and you are not com-
pelled to believe it. There ie a homely
waying that acts speak louder than words.
From their acts you may determine their
intent. Even if you believe that the
young men themselves were frightened
into running away from Sacramento, if

BIG TIM ELUDES NURSES.

Rig Tim Sullivan, who returned from
a rest cure in Europe on the Imperator
on July 17, slipped away from two nurses
at the Hotel St. Denis yesterday, and
enjoyed a trip unescorted among his old
‘haunts. Friends who saw him on the
street alone telephoned to Sullivan's half-
brother, Larry Mulligan, asking if any-
thing was wrong, and Mulligan spent sev-
eral hours trying to locate the Congress-
man.

At 9:30 o'clock last night the telephone
operator at St. Denis received ai call
from Sullivan. He said he wanted to
talk to Mr. Mulligan. Mulligan had an
earnest conversation with the man on
the wire and then went out, When he
returned Sullivan was with him. ig
Tim waa smiling and looked happy.
