CARNEGIE’S NEW YEAR'S GIFT.

$750,000 TO THE BUREAU
AMERICAN REPUBLICS.

Ho Contritates It fer the Erection of a
Building tn Washington to Be Used as
Permanent Quarters fer the Bureau—
President Roosevelt Sends His Thanks.

Wasurvoron, Jan. 4.—It was announced
at the White House to-day that Andrew
Carnegie has contributed $750,000 toward
the erection of a building to be used as the
permanent quarters in the city of Waahing-
ton for the International Bureau of the,
American Republics and the Columbus
Memoria] Library. Mr. Carnegie, who is a
house guest of Secretary Root, called at the ;
White House to-day and obtained permis-
sion to make public a letter addressed to
him two days ago by Mr. Roosevelt, thank-
ing him for the gift. The President's letter, |
which is not spelled in the Roosevelt-Car-
negie reformed way, is as follows:

Tas Wurrz Hovsn,
Waseurnoron, Jan. 2, 1997.

Mr Daan Ma.Canwzor: I am somueh pleased
at learning from Secretary Root what you are
going to do for the Bureau of American Re-
publics. You have already done substantially
the same thing for the cause of peace at The
Hague. This new gift of yours has an almost
or quite equa! significance as far as the cause
of peace in the Western Hemisphere is con-
oerned, for the Bureau of American Republics
is striving to accomplish for this hemisphere
what the Hague Peace Tribunal is striving to
acoomplish for both hemispheres. 1 thank
you heartily.

Wishing you many happy New Years, be-
lieve me sinoerely —

HBODOMM,ROOSEVELE.

The gift of Mr. Carnegie ‘will bring the
total fund available for the: new home for
the bureau up to a trifle more than a million
dollars. Three years ago the board of
governors of the bureau‘decided that a
new building should be constructed. The
bureau now ocoupies a rented building,
formerly a residence, at the corner of Jack-
son place and Pennsylvania avenue, facing
Lafayette Square and just across the street
from the White House. The structure is
altogether inadequate for the needs of
the bureau.

When the decision was reached three
years ago that a new' building should be
erected the limit of cost was fixed at $125,000,
which sum would include the cost of the
site. The cost was to be borne by the

their population, just as the expenses of
the bureau are paid. The share of
United States was fixed at $71,000.
tary of State Hay sent a letter to the
dent on the subject, which resulted in a
measage to Congress asking the

tion of $71,000 for the purrese. A bill
drawn and passed the Senate, but failed
in the House.

Last summer, when Mr. Root was pre-
paring for the Pan-American Conference,
he ran across the old message of the Presi-
dent and found that the appropriation
asked had mot been made. Accordingly
he went to the Appropriations Committee
of Congrese and urged that funds be pro-
vided. He suggested $200,000 instead of
the $71,000; and the larger sum was ap-
propriated.

generation should see them drawing closer
together.

It is a cheering thought that all these are
for the first time to be represented at the
forthcoming Hague conference. Henceforth
they are members of that body, whose aim
is the settlement of international disputes
by that “high court of mations” or other
Similar tribunal.

I beg to express to each and ali of them
my heartfelt thanks for being permitted to
make such a New Year's gift as this. / have
never felt more keenly ihan i co this New
Year's morning how muoh more biesned it
is to give than to receive, and I consider
myself highly honored by being considered
worthy to provide the forthooming union
home, where the accredited representatives
of all the republics are to meet and, I trust,
to bind together their respective nations in
the bonds of unbroken peace.

In a statement prepared at the State
Department it was said that fifteen republics
other than the United States announced
their readiness to pay their proportion for
the building when the project was proposed
aad some of them sent the money, so that
there has been for several years $20,000 or
$30,000 in the Treasury of the United States
to be expended for the building.

The statement contained this also: “The
idea is to have the building a notable ex-
ample of Latin American architecture and
to have in it places which may be the head- |
quarters of each Latin American nation
or group of nations, as they may arrange
it. There are to be in it aleo reading rooms
in which the leading Latin American news
papers and zines will be f.

SATURDAY,

GEN. BINGHAM SPRINGS 4 MINE
ON WOULD-BE GRAFTERS.

 

Civil Servioe List Kept Seeret Until Pre
‘motions Are Made—Twe Acting In
epectors Reduced and Five Captains
Transferred—Eight New Sergeants,

Police Commiasioner Bingham announced
yesterday that he had made five new in-
speotors, eight sergeants and fifteen rounds-
men, reduced two acting inspectors to
command precincts, transferred five cap-
tains and appointed two new surgeons.

Incidentally, he won a decisive victory
over the Civil Service Commission by
promoting the lucky captains to the rank
of inspector from a brand new eligible
list which was furnished him only the
day before.

The new inspectors are William G. Hogan
of the Seventh’ inspecuon district, Stephen
O'Brien of the East Twenty-seoond street
station, Syivester D. Baldwin, who was
formerly an inspector, but was reduced to
make way for men reinstated by the courta,
James E. Hussey of the East 104th street
station, and James E. Dillon of the Old
Slip station.

The promotion of the inspectors is the
speediest in the annals of the Police De-
partment. It was only last Monday that
the candidates, twenty-four of whom
passed the test, took the mental examina-

the lucky ones. This was taken as a slap
at the wise political grafters who might

the Commissioner. He knew
that in the past exorbitant sums have been
to politicians by men of all ranks
seeking promotion, and yesterday was the
first time on record that a precedent against
this form of graft wae established.

When Commissioner Bingham asked for
a@ new list the Civil Service Commission
sent him nine names, among them Capt.
John Mutha of the Brooklyn Bridge and
John Daly of the West Forty-seventh street
station. There was absolutely no epecula-
tion as to who would be promoted, for
nobody except the Commiesioner and the
members of the Civil Service Commission
knew how the candidates stood on the list,
and everybody, even the captains them-
selves,were in the dark until the promotions
were made.

The promotion of Acting Inspector
Hogan came as the greatest surprise of the
day. He, Captains Bill Hodgins, John
O'Connor and Edward Gallagher and
Acting Inspector Charies Formosa were
the only candidates who made the list in the
first examination. When three cles
in the rank of inspector Com-
missioner Bingham announced that under
no consideration would he appoint any one
of the eligibles. He announced repeatedly
that he didn’t consider one of them fit for
promotion and said he would not advance
them unless ordered to by the courts. He
was asked what he had on the five, but he
wouldn’t say until he got up before the
Board of Aldermen. Then he said that
some of them were grafters and one was a
“damned fool.”

A few weeks ago the Commissioner was
served with a writ of mandamus ordering
him to show cause why he should not appoint
from the liet, and the Civil Service Com-
mission was also served with two tem-
porary injunctions restraining it from
holding a new examination for inspectors.
The Commissioner won out, however, and
@ new ex.mination was ordered.

When asked yesterday why he had
changed his opinion of Hogan, Gen. Bingham
said that he had always been in doubt about
what he had on him and found out by
watching his work closely that he would
make a good inspector. However, he
steadiastiy retused wo appli him from
He had heard unpleasant
stories about Hogan and for a time believed
them, and for this reason passed him over.

“But I found out that Hogan is all right,”
said the Commissioner yesterday. “He has
done good work im his district and shown
results. Then he went into the new exami-
nation like a man and came out at the top
of the list, making a splendid showing. In
view of that I could not conscientiously
pases him over, but if he had been with the
old bunch of five I would not have promoted
him.”

With the exception of Capt. O’Connor,
the four other candidates who were passed
over him on the first list landed on the
new one, but Hogan was the only one who
came within the first nine. On yesterday's
Mist Formosa was twelfth, Hodgins fifteenth
and Gallagher seventeenth, but none stood
any chance of being promoted.

Following the promotions Formosa was
reduced from acting inspector and sent to
command the Voorhies avenue station in
Brooklyn and O'Connor was assigned to
the Charles street station. The other cap-
tains traneferred were Stephen McDermott,
from Rockaway Beach to the East Twenty-
second street atation; George R. Holahan,
from the Voorhies avenue to the Adams
street station, Brooklyn; Edward Gallagher,
from City Island to the Church street sta-
tion; John J Lantry, from the Church street
to the East Fifty-firet street station, his
old command, and Patrick Corooran, from
the East Fifty-firet to the East 10¢th street
station. Lantry is a brother of the Fire
Commissioner.

Inspector Hussey was aeeigned yesterday
to the Third district, which takes in the
Tenderloin, relieving Adam Cross, who
was sent back to Brooklyn. O'Brien now
has charge of the Fifteenth district, a newly
created one, which takes in Coney Island;
Hogan goes to the Seventh, Baldwin to the
Tenth, and Jimmy Dillon will have charge
of the upper East Side. \

In promoting eight roundemen the Com-
missioner jumped a candidate on the list
to appoint Roundaman Charles Becker,
who was ninth Becker was active with
Sergt. McNaught and Policeman Faubel
in making raids over the head of Inspector
Schmittberger.

Two Brooklyn physicians, Drs. Heary G.
Webster and Thomas A. McGoldrick, said
to be MoCarren men, were appointed police
surgeons at a salary of $3,500 a year.

IN THE

 

SAME GRAVE.

Jafayette Keeler Was Buried Fifty Years
Age and Miss Carr Yesterday.

Moont Houxy, N,J., Jan. 4.—A romance
of fifty years ago Han been revived by the
death of Miss Elizabeth Thomas Carr, a
sister of the late Judge Carr, who has been
a resident of the town for a long time.
She was 78 years old and her last request
was that she should be buried in the same
grave with Lafayette Keeler, to whom she
was to have been married over fifty years
ago. Keeler was one of the promising young.
men of the village then, and after a court-
ship of a year won the heart of Miss Carr,
then one of the most beautiful girls in the
community. The day was set for the
wedding, but a week prior to the date
Keeler was stricken with smallpox and
goon afterward died. Miss Carr ever after-
ward lived alone, rarely going into society
and devoting her time to the welfare of
the poor.

The romance of her youth had almost
been forgotten when it was revived by her
last request. This request was respected
by her executor, and to-day she was buried
in the same grave in which she saw her
lover entombed half a century ago. Some
difficulty was experienced in securing a
grave digger, as it was feared the opening
of the grave might cause an outbreak of
smalipox, but the board of health declared
there was ao danger and the burial took
place.

33D STREET TUNNEL

 

THROUGH.

Headings Meet Under Third Avenue and
Make a Good Fit. p

The eastbound and westbound headings
of the Pennsylvania Railroad tunnel be-
neath Thirty-third street came together
yesterday morning directly under the
Third avenue elevated. The passageway
is now continuous from Fifth avenue to the
East River. Each of the gangs working
toward one another fought for the honor
of making the opening and the westbound
gang won out.-

Actual tunnelling beneath Thirty-third
street vegan iast Marci. Tho rook prored |
to be of good quality from the first and
rarely was any timbering necessary to hold
yp walls androof. For this reason progress
was exceptionally rapid.

The Pennsylvania Railroad jengineers,
who had “given the line” to the contractor's
engineers, had calculated so accurately
that the two headings met only seven-
thousandths of an inch out of grade and
ay three-hundredths of an inch out of
‘ine.

The tunnel is 42 feet wide and 21 feet high,
just like the one being built under Thirty-
second atreet. Later a dividing wall will
be built in each, so that under each street
there will be really two tunnels from Fifth
avenue to the river, while between Fifth
and Seventh avenues there will be one large
tunnel with three tracks in it. The laying
of concrete lining has already begun under
Thirty-second street and is soon to begin
under Thirty-third street.

 

FREIGHT HANDLERS UNEASY.

 

Organizers Stirring "Em to Sirfke Against
the Railroads.

About 2,500 local freight handlers are
preparing to make demands on the rail-
road companies for an increase of wages
from $1.85 to $2 a day. The agents of some
of the roads were notified yesterday that
the demands would be made. The men
are nearly all Italians and are not organized,
but organizers are at work, and some kind
of a union is expected to be formed before
Tuesday next.

The places of the 40 freight handlers
who struck against the Erie Railroad Com-
pany in Jersey City and Weehawken have
all been filled, but this will not deter the
others from striking.

At the various piers yesterday the freight
handlers were very much excited. They
talked as if they had been worked up to
the striking point by persons who know
more about conditions than they do. The
only railroad which ie paying these freight
handiers $2 a day is the Pennsylvania.
The roads on which the demand is to be
made are the New York Central, Delaware,
Lackawanna and Western, Lehigh Valley,
West Shore, Central Railroad of New Jersey
and Baltimore and Ohio.

Patiavaen, Jan. 4.—Dr. B.C. Flower,
the mining stock swindler, was arrested
to-day in thie city afver a chase lasing
more than two years, which reached chrough
Mexico and a good part of South America.

‘When taken int custody Dr. Flower
was posing as “Prof. Oxford,” a benevolent
gentleman wich a new process for making

The lavter were not specified to be of the

of Philacelphia ran their man down, “Prof.

Later, when taken to City Hall, headmitted
that he was Dr. R. C. Flower, and was so
entered on the blotter. He will have a
hearing to-morrow morning. The warrant
charges him with grand larceny and with
being a fugitive from justice.

Flower has been @ fugitive since May 34,
1004, when he jumped a $20,000 bail bond.
He went to Mexico. Sergeant Detective
McConville took up his trail. The doctor
was found in the City of Mexico. He was
the same brilliant, suave promoter there.
Before he could be arrested he learned of
McConaville’s presence and disappeared.
Mines were his forte in Mexico and Ameri-
can tourists his victims.

MoConville next found hie man in Brazil.
Again he disappeared, but bobbed up in
Central America and at various places in
South America afterward. MoConville
could not get within touch of him during
this time.

Flower hastwosons. One lives in Passaic
and the other in Cranford. It was known
that one of these was in communication
with his father and. messages were from
time to time intercepted,

In September last McConville learned
that Flower, under the name of Dainey,
was living at the Continental Hetel bere.
Again the tip preceded the law.

Through an intercepted telephone mes-
sage it was learned thet Dr. Flower was
to meet his son here. MoConville, Tate
and Wood took up the trail again. At last
they learned of Prof. Oxford and his re-
semblance to Flower.

They made inquiries as to what Oxford
did. They were told he had a chemical
process for manufacturing diamonds,
rubies and bricks.

*Sounds like Flower,” said McConville.

They went to his officeand peeped through
a transom of the room. The door was
plastered with signs of various mining
and smelting concerns. There were several
desks. At one was a long whiskered,
benevolent old gentleman talking en-
thusiastically of the way he could make
diamonds and rubies out of stuff that would
cost about $10 a ton. The detectives
listened with interest. He did not bok
like Flower at all, but the voice was his.
Tate went into the office. “Hello, Dr.
Flower,” he said. The fugitive protested
violently that there was a mistake.

MoConville stepped in and he wilted.
“I might as well own up,” ne said, “S"u
Flower.”

Assistant District Attorney Garvan got
word from Detective Sergeant MoConville
yesterday afternoon that Flower was under
arrest in Philadelphia.

persons who were interested in trying
to have him put behind bars. Flower was
mized up in several mining companies,
most of which went to pieces.

When the day arrived for Flower's trial!
om the indictment in which he was accused
of having swindled Mrs. Belle Gray Taylor,
Flower had vanished. He was then out on
ball of $23,000. Bail had been fixed at
$50,000, then reduced to $6,000 and finally
jumped to $23,000, which had been put up
by Mrs, Cornelia Storrs, the widow of a
former Deputy Comptroller.

At the same time the District Attorney's
office was looking into the death of Theo-
dore Hagaman, who had been a friend of
Flower, at the Waldorf-Astoria. A year
or more after Hagaman’s death there came
stories of Flower's relations with him and
his wife, and Hagaman's body was disin-
terred. It had been buried eo long, how-
ever, that an autopsy showed nothing.
Mrs, Hagaman said afterward that she
had lost about $1,000,000 in Flower's echemes.
The information in the District Attorney's

Nine firemen were overcome by smoke
at a blaze last night in the basement of a
five story brick loft building até to 10 First
street. The building is surrounded by
rickety Italian tenement houses, which
were emptied of their occupants by order
of Capt. Shaw of the Fifth street station.
The basement and second and third floors
of the building are oooupied by the: Tran-
scendent Lamp Company, manufacturers
of railroad lamps, and the fire seemed to
have started in a pile of excelaior. The fire-
men affected by the smoke fumes were
Bulaff, Ward, Costello, Hayes, O'Leary
and Levy of Engine 17, Carey and Lilley of
Engine 56 and Ellicott of Engine 5. They
were pulled out by their comrades and at-
tended by Dr. Reiss of the Fire Department.
The damage was estimated at $25,000.

The records of the exrcutivo com mittee

transactions himself and that ithe oxeon

executive committes the power of the whole ,
board of directors and then giving the.
chairman of th* executive committee the
power of that committee when it was not
in session.

A number of vague references were made
to loans negotiated by Mr. Harriman on
the minutes of the executive committes
with the simple statement that they had
been approved. No figures were given nor
any clue to what those loans were. The
commiaesion ordered that statements be
