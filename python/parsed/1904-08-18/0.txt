FOREMA N 'S FATAL BLUNDER.

Let Gas Flow Into Cellar and Was Killed |
by It—Three Others Overcome,

Hugh Cunningham of 503 West Forty-

eighth street boased the job of laying gas

pipes from the main into the double tene- |

mente at, 602 and 504 West Forty-seventh
street. He forgot to put caps on the ends
of the pipes in the cellar.

After turning on the gas at the main
yesterday afternoon, he went back to the
job. A few minutes later Thomas Leahy
of 426 East Twenty-fourth street, another
of the workmen, went into the cellar
and stumbled over the foreman's body.
He, too, fell unconscious.

Joseph Brunner of 28 West End avenue
followed Leahy, but managed to get back
upstairs before he was overcome. He
shouted to Patrick Carley of 672 Ninth ave-
nue, who was busy in the street excavation,
Carley turned off the cock and pulled Brun-
ner out of the gas filled ball. Then he went
into the cellar after Leahy and managed to
get him out. Brunner bad revived suffi-
ciently by that time to help him carry out
the unconscious foreman.

Meanwhile the gas had risen into the
rooms upstairs and the tenants began to
pile into the street, Policeman
of the West Forty-seventh street station
sent for an ambulance and with the help
of a priest from the Church of the Sacred
Heart tried to revive Cunningham by arti-
ficial respiration. Brunner and Carley
worked over Leahy and _ brought
around, but Cunningham died before the
ambulance surgeon arrived.

Mrs. Mary Robertson was found un-

way. Both were revived.

HOPE FOR ROOSEVELT'S AID.

Chicago Meat Strikers Now Turning to
the Prestdent—Violence Increases.

CH10AG0, Aug. 17.—Activity of T. A. Car-
roll, special agent of the Department of
Commerce and Labor, gave rise again to-day
to the impression that President Roose-
velt either has entered or is about to enter
into the meat strike situation. After having
been in close touch with both sides of the
controversy, Carroll visited President Don-
nelly this afternoon and held a long con-
ference with him.

It was declared at labor headquarters
this afternoon that the mysterious man
the strikers are depending upon to aid
them in reaching a settlement is President
Roosevelt. President Donnelly arranged
a secret meeting at which Secretary
Treasurer Homer D. Call of the international
butchers’ organization explainéd the sub-
ject fully to the President.

The labor leaders have no other plans
for bringing about peace, as the refusal
of the packers to concede then a conference
leaves no other alternative. The announce-
mnent was made to-day that no further
extension of the strike will be ordered by
the unions.

Violence exceeding that of the last few
days has marked the past twenty-four
hours. One house containing a group of
non-union rnen was attacked by a mob, lives
of women were imperilled, strike break-
ers were assaulted, the leading attorney
of one of the packing companies was men-
aced by a thrown rock, and in general the
night and the day were made stormy by
the disgruntled army of the idle.

Crowds around the strikers’ relief station
were greatly increased in numbers to-day.
An appeal is to be made to the labor men
throughout the country to contribute to
the support of the strikers.

The firemen had been at work only a few
minutes when some of then at the front
began to stagger down the stairs into the
street gasping for breath. They said the
smoke was as dense as they had ever seen
it in any room. Shortly after that other
firemen, themselves almost overcome, came
down the stairs carrying the limp forms
of their comrades who had Jost conscious-

ODELL CHARGES FR. AUD.

Complaint in Shipyard rd sult Says 82,346,000
Profits Were Not Accounted For.

The complaint in Gov, ee suit to
recover the $126,000 which he lost by buying
bonds in the United States Shipbuilding
Company makes sweeping charges against
the promoters whom he has named as
defendants,

One charge is that the defendants re-
tained as profits for which they made no
accounting $2,846,000 of the $6,000,000 which,
according to Odell, they told him was to
be paid in cash for the plants taken over.

“Wrongfully and fraudulently obtained
is the phrase used by
the complaint t odeseribe this transaction.

Goy. Odell bases his complaint of fraud
and misrepresentation on the prospectus
of June if, 1902. This was the public pros-
pectus, It has been said that another
prospectus marked “private and con-
fidential” was issued on April 19, 1902, and
that the Governor saw this.

The publie prospectus is taken up in
detail in the complaint and it is constantly
referred to as fraudulent and intended to
deceive.

The Mercantile Trust Company, a de-
fendant, comes in for a vicious attack, It
is charged that the $100,000 allotted to it
in the underwriting was intended
to be paid for, but was a “fraud and a lure
to induce others to underwrite on the'faith
of the reputation and standing of the said
Mercantile Trust Company.”

The Governor charges that
the original capital was ever
and that the
“did not have any

never

ho part of
paid by
shipbuilding
company further cash
pose in order to deceive the public, inelud-
ing this plaintiff.”

The complaint asks for a judgment for
$170,000 with interest from Jan, 7, 1903,

MANY HURT IN CAR CRASH,
Third and Madison Av. Cars Collide at

Busy Grand Street and Bowery Curve,

A number of persons were painfully
hurt yesterday: afternoon as the result
of a collision at Grand street and the Bowery
between a northbound Madison avenue
and a southbound Third avenue car, The |
Madison avenue cars turn into the Bowery ;
at that point. A flagman is stationed there

was due to a misunderstanding of his
signals by te motormen. The Third ave-
nue car rammed the Madison avenue car
as the latier was rounding the curve,

The passengers on the Madison avenue
ear escaped with a jgliing. On the Third
avenue car, people were thrown against
the seats in front of them and several were
flung into the street, Among the latter
were Mrs. Margaret Reid, 39 years old,
of 605 Eighth avenue, who received a badly
lacerated forehead, a sprained wrist and
val@pus contusions, and Mrs, Annie Selig,
30 years old, of 170 Henry street, whose
left side was injured. Both were taken
to St. Vincent’s Hospital,

Eight other persons received cuta and |

bruises, but they got away before the police
could get their names, Both cars were
considerably damaged.

 

A BLOCK IN FIVE SECONDS,

Wehmeyer Fined for Running Auto at
Express Train Speed.

When Mounted Policeman Hayes ar-
raigned Henry Wehmeyer before Magis-
trate Breen in the West Side court yester-
day afternoon he declared that the prisoner
along Riverside
Drive at the rate of fifty miles an hour.

The Judge looked up in amazement.

“Fifty miles an hour!” said he. “Why,
that is faster than the average express
train runs,”

“Can't help it, your Honor,” said Hayes
“That's how fast this man went. I timed
him with my stop watch from Eighty-

second street to Kighty-thir@ street. He
made that in 5 seconds.”

That would be about forty miles an
hour. An ordinary block in 5 seconds

would give thirty-six miles an hour, but
this block runs diagonally and is longer
than the regular block.

“T'll have to fine you $10.
fine vou $500," said the Court

Webmeyer said he was driver for A. ¢
Beckwith of 115 Fast Seventy-fourth street
and lived at 469 Amsterdam javenue, He
paid the fine.

MORRIS & WILMARTH RAID THEIR
OWN BRANCH OFFICE.

 

 

Found a Peephole Over the Door and
Leased Wires Running From the
Next Room to Boston and Albany—John
Hil, Jr., of Chicago Hunted Up the Leak

John Hill, Jr., representing the Chicago
Board of Trade, who has heen here since
Monday looking for a leak of the Chicago
grain quotations to the bucket shops in
Albany and Boston, thinks he has stopped
it. Yesteriay morning he gave informa-
tion to Morris & Wilmarth, stock and grain
dealers at 32 Broadway, which led them
to call the police and raid their own branch
office at 1269 Broadway. One prisoner !
was made, a man not in the employ of
Morris & Wilmarth, but he was discharged
in the Jefferson Market police court be-
cause the Magistrate could find no law to
punish a man who listens to grain quota-
tions in a broker's office next door and
peddles them out by wire.

Morris & Wilmarth are a Consolidated
Stock Exchange firm and members of the
Chicago Board of Trade, Last June at
the Consolidated Exchange Harry 8. Morris,
one of the firm, made the acquaintance of |
J.R. Lewin, a telegraph operator, who was
not a member of any exohange. Lewin,
it is stated, suggested that Morris & Wil- |

Albany and Boston were getting its quota- |
tions very prompily. The quotations are ;
sent out only over Western Union wires, |
the Western Union being under contract
to supply them onlv to customers approved
by the board.

The matter was reported to Mr. Hill, who |
has for years made a specialty of running |

ast night how he arrived at the conclusion, |
but he determined that the leak was in |
this city and he sent three men here to }
investigate.

His men, Mr. Hill said last night, learned
that the leak was in the branch office of
Morris & Wilmarth, but that that firm
knew nothing of it. Then he came on him-
self, arriving here on Monday night.

By Tuesday noon, according to Mr. Hill,
he had ferreted out the whole scheme, but |
how he refused to say. 1

*The second of the two rooms,” said Mr. |
Hill laat night at the Waldorf-Astoria, |
“was sub-let to a man who described him-
self aa C. B, Addison, but whose real name |
is Baldwin. In the office used by Lewin
the blackboard faced the door leading to
Baldwin's room adjoining. The top of the'|
door was shaved off for the fraction of an
inch and part of the moulding or cleat war
removed. In Baldwin's room against the
door was a table with achair on it. Sitting
in the chair, a man could see the biack-
board and also hear the quotations called
off.

“On the wall and beside the chair was
a bracket holding a telegraph instrument.
A leased Postal Telegraph wire ran to’
Boston. Inarolltop desk was a telephone
on a leasegi wire to Albany, and in addition
there wasa telegraph wire to the same city.”

Mr. Hill notified Mr. Morris on Tuesday
night and asked for his cooperation in
stopping the leak. Yesterday morning
the two men met at the Imperial Hotel,
and after talking the matter over sent word
to the Tenderloin station that a couple of
policemen were needed to make a raid®
Mr. Morris had decided to raid his own
office.

Capt. Cottrell sent Detectives Morton
and Drennan. After talking with Mr.
Hill they decided that they didn’t under- °
stand the game, and went back to the sta-
tion house, Then Capt. Cottrell went to
the hotel himself.

Mr. Morris, the captain and Mr. Hill
went to 1269 Broadway and got a duplicato
key to room 620 from the janitor, When
they entered the room they found a man
sitting on the chair on the top of the table.
He had his hand on the telegraph key be-
side him, He was arrested. and Mr. Morris
went into his branch office and told his
marager, Lewin, toclose itup. The branch
office, Mr. Hill said last night, was closed ~
for good.

was Michael H. Wate?s. Magistrate

Philip Weinseimer, president of the Bullds ;

the labor unions which is fighting the Buildes

arrested yesterday afternoon on a charge '
of extortion. Weinseimer, who ia some<,;
times called “Diamond Phil,” is also presi- ,
dent of the Steamfitters and Gasfitters*
Union. He is a plumber by trade, bub
those who know him well say that it is som@e
years since he has worked at it.

The complainant against Weinseimer ig

| George J. Essig, a boss plumber at 20 Han-

cock place, The specific charge is the ex-
tortion of $1,000, but it is alleged that Wein-
seimer got in all $2,700, the reat in promise
sory notes, the last of which, one for $250,
Essig says, he paid yesterday.

Immediately after Essig paid the money,
{n marked bills, as he says, Welnseimer
was arrested by Central Office detectives
who were in waiting. He was searched
in a Broadway building, but the money
was not found.

Then he was hustled over to the Tombs
police court, where there was a dramatic
hearing, in which District Attorney Jerome
personally appeared against Weinseimer,
saying that if the information in hia pos-
seasion was such as he believed {it to be
Weinaeimer had committed “an ordinary,
vulgar felony.”

ESSIG'S STORY OF THE BLACKMAIL,

The charges made by Essig have been
under investigation in the District Attor-
ney's Office for some time. Essig had the
contract for doing the plumbing work on
Chatsworth, an almost completed
apartment house at Seventy-second street
and Riverside Drive. In December, he in-
formed the District Attorney, the plumbers
employed by him went on strike, Then,
he alleges, he was approached by Wein-
seimer. ‘That was on Dec, 29.

‘wo days later, he swears, he paid to
Weinseimer in the latter's office at 96 Nassau
street $1,000 in cash. He was induced to
pay this money, he says in his complaint,
because Weinseimer told him that other-
wise there would be no plumbing done by
Essig on the Chatsworth,

So much is embodied in the complaint
on which Weinseimer was held yesterday.

giving one note for $200 and six others
for $200 each. Six of these notes were paid
and are now said to be in the hands of the
District Attorney. The other note fell
due several days ago

Essig says thet when he made the agres-
with Weinseimer it was with the
understanding thet his work on the Chats-

' worth was not to be interfered with. Never-

theless one of the strikes ordered by the
Building Trades Alliance on Tuesday was
on the Chatsworth, and Essig's plumbers
went out

It could not be learned yesterday that

‘ this strike precipitated the arrest of Wein-
