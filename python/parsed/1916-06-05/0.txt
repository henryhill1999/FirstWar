Tells of Threatened Attacks,

would be attacked,’ he sald, “that the}

would be undermined, and I would be}
broken down, This whole attack is only |
part of a very well conceived plan.
Whatever I had said—even if God Al-,
mighty had put the words in my mouth
—I would have been maligned and at |
tacked, because it was part of a plan/|
| which had been carefully worked out. . |
| “Whoever can assert that 1 have ever |

| Voice; “whoever can say that I have not!

and accuse me.” Not one among the
crowd that filled the hall arose.
{ Mr. Schiff then declared that he had |
| been misrepresented in the English and
| the Jewish newspapers that reported his!
; Speech two weeks ago at the Central
Jewish Institute. He did not mean or
‘even say, he said, that the Jews had
| brought Russian persecution upon them-
| selves by living too much by themselves, |
He did say that their troubles were due
lto the segregation enforced upon them
| by Russia. He read them exactly what
he had said, as follows:
| “If the Jews of Russia and Poland
| had not been kept as a separate people,
| discriminatory laws, the prejudices of |
| persecution to which they have been sub. |
| jected, would not have reached the stage
|to which we all regret they une
| fortunately have come.” \
| ‘Now, my friends,” sald Mr. Schiff,
| “there is not one word fn this I am not)
| prepared to stand by,” !

|

Hash as Schiff Reminds,

| There was a hush tn the hall, usually
| buzzing with anfmation, when Mr. Schiff
; recalled to the Kehillah his services to,
| the Jewish people, whether in Russia;
or the United States, and reminded them |
that he had told the President of the
| United States that our treaty with Rus-
sia should be abrogated and Russia
compelled to permit Jewish {mmigration.
Then, amid silence still more profound,
he explained his unexpected presence |
| tp saying that he had come “to deliver

up the sword of dissension.”
“T may

say this by way of valedic-
he ended, slowly. “If have been
; hurt to the core, and hereafter Zionism, |
(nationalism, the congress movement and
| Jewish politics, in whatever form they
come up, will be a sealed book to me.
li shall continue to work for the uplift |
of my people in all constructive work,
in procuring full civic rights for our
brethren in the war zone, But beyond |
this, my friends, my duty ends.”

There has been dissension about
plan for a Jewish congress. For his
| opposition to the plan Mr, Schiff has been
| criticised by an element in the Kehillah,
| and this element made more trouble yes-
terday, At one time a hundred dele- |
gates, after a stormy .cene, threatened
to leave the hall. Finally siatsen did
leave, During the excitement Cyrus L.
Sulzberger, Judge Gustav Hartman and
Louis Lifsky made speeches.

The convention opened with an address
by Rabbi Magnes, the chairman, who
quieted the early # uabbles among the
800 delegates by appealing to them to
show that the Jews of New York really
can work together.

Tempest Starts Again.

Almost tmmediately, however, trouble
started over the principal bone of con-
tention, the Jewish congress, the Ameri.
can Jewish Committee’ attitude toward
{tt and the Kehillah's relation to both.
A letter from Louts Marshall, chairman
‘of the committee, read to the Kehillah
on Sunday night, said that the commit-

Cuicaco, June 4.—The Progressive
National Committee will meet at 10;
o'clock to-morrow morning. The chief |

purpose of this meeting is to arrange |
the credentials which have been sent /
here by the secretaries of the so-called |
State conventions or brought in person |
by the delegates A roll is then to be!
prepared There are no contests.

Raymond Robbins of Illinois will be
selected ae the temporary chairman of |
the convention. Mr. Robbins ts credited |
with more or less radical tendencies, |
On the other hand, it is on the slate
to name Walter Brown, State chairman ,
ag permanent chairman, and |
Mr. Brown !s one of the leaders who
is ready to take Hughes j

It is quite possible that the com-!
mittee will discuss the question of strat- |
egy, but whether it will indorse ;

A ma-
jority of the committee {is not at all
convinced, it is said, that Col. Roose- |
velt cannot be forced upon the Repub- |
lican convention.

Many leading Progressives flocked into
town to-day and [it is apparent that the
Bull Moose people are to have a real)
convention, both committeemen and del
gates taking their duties very seriously. |
In the afternoon the Progressive board
of strategy held an Smportant conference
in Mr. Perkine’s suite at the Blackstone, |
which lasted several hours, Those pres-|
ent were, in addition to Mr. Perkins!
himself, FE. A. Van Valkenburg, editor of

  

the Philadelphia North American; Oscar |
Straus, chairman of the New York Pub- |
He Service Commission, Gov, Hiram |
Johnson of California, Gifford Pinchot,
William H. Hotehkiss, Henry L. Stod- |
dard, Bainbridge Colby and W. L Ran- |
som, They went over the situation with |
Mr. Perkins. “They all professed to be
holding fast to Col, Roosevelt |

Mr. Perkins admitted to-day that he had
been in touch during the day with some
of the Republican leaders. “These cone |
fevences were all in the spirit: of the
Sabbath,” he said

Oscar Straus made a flat declaration
to-day that he was for Justice Hughes tf
the Republicans would not toke Roose-
velt

““But if the Republicans nominate Mr.
Root, from what many of our delegates
have told me, I firmly believe,” said Mr.
“that a majority

“Mr. Hughes has made the strongest)
argument himse.f against the bench be |

Roosevelt is certainly the man be |
nominated, Who hus made this issue”
Who has inspired all these preparedness
parades? Mr. Roosevelt and not Mr
Hughes. 1 do not see how Mr Hughes
ean be taken before he defines his posi-
tion.’

As to the question of whether the
delegates to the Progressive rs

to

could be brought to take Justice Hughes
should he meet the conditions, Mr
Straus, who is a delegate at large from
New York State, said “TL think it will
be hard work to control, but I think
it is likely we can do so”

New York Progressives generally share

E A. Van Valkenburg and William Flinn
of Pittsburg are said to hold to thie

But all of these men, who are power-
ful in the Bull Moose council, let it be
known that they most emphatically
would not take Mr. Hughes under the
present conditions; that no man as silent
as the jurst would receive their sup-
port and votes in the convention.

Meantime the radica) Bull Moose are
saying that they will not take Hughes
under any conditions, They are look-

The Governor is keeping very quiet as
to his views. He is not even a delegate
to the convention, but
merely as a spectator.

Nevertheless, he is regarded ag having

some of the strategists serious concern,
How potentially troublesome the Pro-
gressive convention appeara is shown
