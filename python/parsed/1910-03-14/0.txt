Mr. Hedley said yesterday that in some

PARKHURST TO WADSWORTH.

 

Get an Answer, bat He Wen't Tet! Con-
Gregation What It Was.

Dr. Charlies H. Parkhuret in his sermon
yesterday morning at the Madison Square
Presbyterian Church anid:

*l wrotea letter the last week to Speaker
Wadsworth of the Assembly as follows:

1 am informed that the statement

Becond Lieut. Janney enlisted in the
regular army from Virginia in 1008,
when he was 22 years old. He served
successively as private, corporal and
sergeant of Company |), Sixteenth In-
fantry and later as battalion sergeant-
major. These steps took about four
years. He became a Second Lieutenant
on February 28, 1907.

While he was stationed at Fort Jay in
1998 he was tried by court-martial for

and carried away through a doot before

The painting was loaned to the museum
and was valued at $10,000. It wag 27x18
inches, but was not protected by glass

The thief slipped into the European art
room after the janitor had dusted the pic-

duced confusion, but at no time in the
two weeks Was there an idea of postpon-
mg vesterday’s conference, which was
really catied im the firec place to take up
the situation at Albany, especially the
legislative programme.

To ali of Senator Root's visitors yes-
terday he made it emphatic that he had

been asked to make that request, that |

that Chairman Woodruff and hie friends
io Albany and elsewhere would be made

Then he evidently rolled the can-
vas on a cane and carried it away without

in stations and the largest carrying
capacity, and from them we arranged the
schedules.”

The crux of the present difficulty, Mr.
Hedley said, was in the etation stops.
In order to stick to the minute and forty-
eight seconds headway a train can't
stop more than forty-five seconds at a
station.
| “But they do stop longer than that.”
|eaid Mr. Hedley. “and we can't avoid it

you do or do not consider thie a matter of
sufficient importance to merit your con-
sideration and action.

“I got an answer,” said Dr. Parkhurst
after a pause, “but I won't aay what it
was”

Returning to his theme Dr. Parkhurst

\enid: “That ie an example of the way in

The letters came from persons all the way
up to Secretary of War Luke E. Wright.
Lieut. Janney was reprimanded and
sentenced to be confined to the post for
six months. This sentence was returned
in January, 1909.
