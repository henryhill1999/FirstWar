that 1t would be a good idea to paint up
some new cages and give the loveliest of

misture that eonmtained shellac. The
fumes of the aloohol in the mixture rose
upward in the 100 degree temperature.

th great king cobra, the several cobra

were moved to the new quarters yester-
day: The fact that the interior of the
few cages had been painted a light green
