' The Baltimore Censorship,

Baltimore is to have a board of the-'
@trical censors if an ordinance drawn |
by City Solicitor Pog is approved. The
board is to consist of six members: the
Mayor, the Collector of Water Rents |
and Licenses, the president of the Police,
Board, the president of the Marviand
Society for the Protection of Children, |
and two other members to be appointed |
by the Mayor. They are to serve with- |
out pay, and the Collector of Water
Rents and Licenses is to be secretary.
If the suspicions of the six censors are.
aroused or complaint is made a theatri-
cal manager will be required to give a

te performance at which two mem-
of the board must be present.

Mayor MaHoo. and Mr Spencer
CLARKE, Collector of Water Rents and
Isicenses, have very decided opinions
upon the subject of improper theatrical
productions. [It was orginally proposed
to make the Collector of Water Rents
and Licenses censor, but opneosition de-
veloped. The Hon. SPENCER CLARKE is
thus quoted in the Baltimore Sun

Another cause is the monotony of go rrt.

the absence of the canteen. The cantery

Moreover, some of the profits could be ."\t }
ized for other benefits to the men, such as
amusements of various kinds, which also
tended to relieve the monotony of daily
routine. The high wages paid in civil |ife
in prosperous times, especially in regions
like the Northwest, where laborers are oo
very plentiful, have undoubtedly tempred
enlisted men to desert. In his report ‘he

The principal cause of the evtis ta question

of the measures proposed. Our people. althours

Part of this feeling te due to the ‘uct that

he violates that oath. Hence tt becomes.
