A. Eckert of Nurnberg, or Nuremberg
as the English and Americans call it,
ie at the Imperial. Mr. Eckert says that
Nuremberg makes other things than the
toys and lebkuchen for which it is mainiy
famous. Bor one thing there are pipes. |
Mr. Eckert is in the pipe business and he |
says that hie firm is one of the oldest |
pipe making concerns in the world. In
fact they were making briar pipes scores
of years before the Germans who were
hot interested inthe business got on to it. |
And the briar pipe did not originate ia |
England at all, according to Mr. Eckert,
but in France. The English used to get |
their short pipes from France and Ger-
many until comparatively a few years
ago. when they took up the manufacture
themee! ves.

For years the Nuremberg product was
shipped outside of Germany and the
native clung to the common wooden or
clay or meerschaum pipe with ite long
