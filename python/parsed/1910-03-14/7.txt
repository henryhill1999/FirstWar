THE FINANCIAL SITUATION.

 

Obviously
Stocks were ective and strong last |2¢¢d for such expenditures there once |
the | was. Very likely, however, the change §

\ lous period of the year. They amounted

_ indeed for the eleven business days of

this month to about $125,000,000, as com-

of March last year. The new offerings

were absorbed with unexpected rapidity |
and eagerness and at the close of the
week negotiations were under way for
; quite as important and extensive flo-
| tations as were announced in the week

then closed. All these offerings are
obvionsiy made or contemplated in re-
sponse to a healthy demand from in-
vestors here and also to an urgent for-
sien demand, for it is well known that
much more than the customary portion
f recent iasues has been placed abroad,
and two or three inferences from the
movement also occur logically and ob-
It ie naturally obvious that the

demand for bends among investors

_ demonstrates a great growth of con-
‘fidence in the securities of the big cor-

porations. If the objection ie made that
the sale of bonds by a big banking house
or a banking syndicate means principally
a distribution of them among other finan-
institutions and banking houses
here and abroad it is plain that the big
and little bankers believe in the seourities
they are taking or else would not load up
with them. And it is even more apparent
that the corporations irsuing the new
securities are supplying themselves with
fonds with the intention of disbursing
those funds for labor and materials in
such a manner as must inevitably con-
Anee to the general advantage of business.
Idle money is returning to business uses

‘ts a greater extent than at any previous

time of the year That euch a return of
funda ts conducive to new and increased
prosperity i of course another matter
not subject to dispute. The only question
that may be raised is as to the continua-
hon of the demand for bonds, as to the
companies to
finance their requirements. Here is pre-
sented the element of uncertainty as to
the continuation of the foreign demand.
Undoubtedly toa largeextent that foreign

demand is conditioned on the contro- |
versy over Government finances in Great |
Rritain, for it is from capital alarmed |

over radical tendencies there that comes
much of the vast amount of foreign
capital recently invested
securities. In this respect the moment
is peculiarly opportune for advantageous
sales of high class American securities,
and the avidity with which our bankers
and corporations are responding to the

| demand indicates that they are entirely

alive to the opportunity. It is a demand

that may ebb with a change in the po-|
| litteal tide, and it is generally advanta-
| geous that it has not been overlooked or

release of large amounts

It has been one of the peculiarities of the

| present improvement in the bond market
that the foreign investor came in first. |
ata time when American capital with the |

experience of 1997 in mind was becoming
almost as timid as in the early part of that
year. and that the idle funds here only
began to come out after the foreign de-

mand had been in considerable measure | '

None too frequently does the Interstate |

establishing the average level of prices.
Whether or not the relative cheapness
of stocks as compared with former periods |
of normal prosperity or relatively higher |
dividends is to be the fashion there is
no doubt that the numerous statements
of railroad and industrial companies |
iaaued last week encouraged the idea that,
equities in the stocks of practically all the |
well established companies are increasing. |
or at least have recently enhanced ma- |
terially. Almost without exception state- |
ments for January were unexpectedly |
favorable not only by comparieon with |
the poor railroad statements for Decem- |
ber but by comparison with the high |
January records of all the reporting sys- |
tems. For February returne of only gross |
earnings of the railroads are available.
but a compilation embracing the roads
thus far reporting shows a gain of 96.000. -
