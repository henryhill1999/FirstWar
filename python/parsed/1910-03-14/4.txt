HERE AND IN GREAT BRITAIN
MUCH DEPENDS ON VIEWPOINT.

 

Travis and Hiltem Difer in Internationa!
Debvate— Americans at Gaadwich Net
the Gert te Vielate Playing Etiquetic

@rniers Alter Dates of Tournament.

What Travis has printed about the
treatment of himeelf and his friends at
Sandwich when he won the British cham-
pionship and the comment by H. H Hilton
cabled to this country have been interest -
ing in the dull days while spring turf is
getting strong enough to be golfed o ver
Travie’s statement regarding the inade-
quecy of the locker accommodations in the
St. George's clubbouse is indorsed by
Hilton. He has plared in six champion-
ships at Sandwich and has never had a_
locker, while all golfere over there solemniy
complain of the Sandwich accommodations
Furthermore, the cablegram makes Hilton
remark that “Travie’s taciturn manner and
abrupt style of meeting any advances
made people chary of a pproaching him
He would not aliow men to understand him ~

Tell it not in Gath and cable it not to
Engiand, but Hilton should know that
there are golfers and golf clubs in the
United States that have made complaint
regarding Travie's taciturn and abrupt
manner. Other individuals and clu be say
thet when the chestnut burr of Travie's
reserve is opened he is the most companion-
able and ciubable of men. To «a great
golfer many idiosyncrasies may be for-
given. there have been persons to ob ject
to Hilton's incessant cigarettes—but the
variance as (o deportment between the
two is a mere tempest in a teacup But
where ihe American golfers will rise in
their wrath ie over Hilton's remark that
“Travis might well have been spared from
his friends at that meeting ”

“They would persist in beating a big
drum for a little man with a big cigar
Morning, noon and night it was the same
old gong sung in no measured tones by an
orchestra amall but notey It wae rough
wueage, certainiy, to give to a big cigar
even if it created a pwan of ioy Winndére
wil ever be cheerful and the Americans
at Sandwich, nearly ali reverent pilgrims
to an English golfing shrine. may hardly
be blamed at the exuberance of their delight
in the continued and unexpected successes
of their own champion

To take direct issue with Hilton, Travis
could not well have epared from the meeting

Mr. Phillips of the Apa wamis Club, to whose,
presence was due the gift of the Schenectady |

putter that didsomuchtoheiphim Among
others who are known \o have been present

when Travis won were James L. Taylor.
