WILSON SUMMONS NATION’S
‘BOYS OVER 16 TO THE FARM;

Calls on All Not Permanently Employed to Enlist for

WashtNncton, March 14,—President
Wilson to-day called on all American
boys of 16 years of age and over not per-
manently employed to enroll in. the
United States Boys Working Reserve.
The letter follows:

The Department of Labor has set
asidé the week beginning March 18 as
National Enrolment Week for the
United States Boys Working Reserve,

The purpose of this national enrol-
ment week is to call the attention of
the: young men of the nation to the

y

Neither labor shortages nor strikes
} among waterfront workers will be per-

iment of troops or supplies from this
‘port. To guard againet such contingen-
cles Uncle Sam is even now forming a
regiment of stevedores for “emergency
service” about New York harber. If the
experiment works well here there is little
doubt that the same method will be ap-
plied in all the otner major ports of the
country.

Coming inthe midst of the unrest that
exists among the marine workers in this
telty the report of the Government's ac-
‘tion caused some uneasiness

Uncle Sam to embark in the strike
breaking business and predictions were
made that it could not fail to start
| trouble.
On the other hand, it was learned that

bigger union officiala, but even is being

i nor, international president of the long-

| To Offset Enemy Agitation.

From an authoritative source it was
learned that the regiment would not be
| called into action in the case of ordi-
| nary strikes along the waterfront affect-

ing private interests, but would be used
‘only to cope with situations that pre-
| Vented the loading of transports or mili-
‘tary supply ships. It was made plain
‘in this connection that the Government's
fdea was not to enter into competition
' with free labor, but to provide some
| effective means of combating possible at-
| tempts on the part of enemy agitators
|to stir up trouble along the waterfront.
| The idea of organizing the longshore-
| men's regiment was conceived last Feb-
|ruary during the labor trouble on the
| Morgan Line plers. Major-Gen, Goe-
thals was entrusted with the details of
l the organization and he !mmediately set

jabout getting a suitable head for the

‘regiment. When Mr. O'Connor declined
ithe colonelcy Gen. Goethals selected
j Lieut.-Col, P. M. Mersig, a Regular

| Army officer, who had served under him
'in Panama.

| The regiment, which according to one
| story has already secured about half the
required complement of men, is being
‘made up both of drafted men and re-
‘cruits. It will be quartered “somewhere in
| Staten Island” and will be made up en-
i tirely of men who have become experts
|in the handling of bale hooks and trucks.

| Would Prevent Strikes.

One distinct advantage which the Gov-
ernment will derive from the mobiliza-
{tion of these soldier-longshoremen lies
in the fact that any attempt on the part
of disgruntled strikers to interfere with
them in the performance of their duty

will be tantamount to insurrectfon and |

will unquestionably be treated as such,

Mr, O'Connor admitted yesterday that
he was conversant with all the details of
the formation of the regiment and youch-
sated the rather vague explanation that
it was being organized to handle “any
emergency that may arise in New York
harbor.”

“Would a strike be considered an
emergency?" he was asked.

“Yes,” he replied, “if it affected Gov-
ernment work. The regiment will not
be used in competition with free labor,
| but will only be called into action in
; the case of strikes or labor shortages

|which threaten to interfere with the
{loading of transports) or munition

| ships.”
| “Will the regiment be used to cope
with strikes among the longshoremen?"
| Mr. O'Connor was asked.

| “If in the handling of Government
‘work the longshoremen should turn

| will most certainly be called upon to
proyide the required number of labor-
ers,’ was the reply.

“There are only about forty or fifty
'men causing all the trouble along the
' waterfront,” continued Mr. O'Connor,
| “and we intend to drive them out of
| business.”

| Trouble Belittied.

| The situation among the tidewater
'men and the lightermen which nearly
‘precipitated a strike a few days ago
! was belittled by Mr. O'Connor, Condl-
‘tions among these workers, he said, were
! not nearly so bad as they had been
| painted,

Definite announcement was made
| yesterday that the demands of the tide-
| water men, the lightermen and the har-
| por boatmen would be taken up at a

| meeting of the Board of Arbitration of

diplomata here. The agreement which
the Allies now propose is therefore op-
posed by Holland primartly because of
German threats to retallate if she
signs it.

Fighty Ships Are Here.

These threats were pointedly «mpha-
sized only a few days ago through the

offictal German Norddeutsche Allege-
maine Zeitung, which warned Holland
just as negotiations in  Londén were

about to be satisfactorily concluded. Ger-
many demands that Holland obtain an
agreement that none of her ships be
; used by the United States or her allies
in the war zone. It is understood that
the Allies find it necessary to make

such use of at least a part of Dutch
shipping.
Of the 1,000,000 tons of shipping

which it is proposed to
mately 600,000 tons—eighty ships—are
in the United States. It is not proposed
to seize the passenger steamship Nieuw
Amsterdam, now at the port of New
York, because that vessel came here un-
der a special agreement under which she
was to be allowed to return to Holland.
Germany had threatenel to sink the
Nieuw Amsterdam unless assurances to
this effect were given.

In seizing the ships of a neutral and!

friendly Power the Allies propose to act
under a well known right in internae
tional law, In the Franco-Prussian war
Germany made similar seizures of mer-
chant vessels and at the beginning of
this war seized a Greek cruiser building
at Kiel. This Government already has
exercised the same right in confiscating
the foreign owned ships buitding in
American yards.

Delayed in Holland's Interest,

The delay in not putting the pro-
rainme into effect before has not been
due to interpretation of international
law, but a desire to meet the wishes of
Holland, which adoutted!y has been in

WITH THE AMERICAN ARMY TH
FRANCE, March 14—(10 PP. M.)—

American troops in the Luneville sector
have occupied and are holding enemy
trenches northeast of Badonviler,
which they foreed the Germans .to
abandon through recent raids and con-
centrated artillery fire.

_—_———_—

The trenches have been consolidated
with ours. This, though a small for-
ward movement, marks the first perma-
nent advance by the American army fn
France,

The Germans made only

feeble at-
tempts to retake the position, but each
time were repulsed,

By the Associated Press
WiTH THE AMERICAN ARMY IN FRANCR,
March 12 (delayed).—Four groups of
German gas projectors, in addition to the
| group of 200 projectors already reported
destroyed, have been discovered and like-
wise blown to pieces by the American
| artillery, which continues its smashing
; destruction. Probabie German plans for
a gas attack on a comparatively large
scale against the American positions

northwest of Toul thus have been upset.
The new groups of projectors were dis-

by American observers in French air-
planes, The effective action taken against
them was due to the quick work of the
observers, the intelligence officers and
the artillerists in turn,

The American artillery on this front
has been mare active than ever in the
last fifteen hours, and its shells also
found lodgment in a number of ammuni-
tion dumps, which were blown up. Many
extensive explosions are reported.

standing on a hill, witnessed one dump

! gaps in the enemy wire and levelled va-

Details of the recent raid, which have

| numbers of Germans were killed by
; shell fire while the box barrage was in
feffect and others later by the creeping
