An annual pension of $25,000 for

This announcement wae made by the
trustecs of the Carnegie Corporation of
New York at the close of their second
annual meeting in Mr. Carnegte's resi-
dence, Fifth avenue and Ninety-first

of former President Harrison, and ex-

President Theodore Roosevelt would

have become the only other beneficlaries

under the terms of the endowment, for

Mrs. Cleveland, by her approaching

marriage to Prof. Thomas Jex Preston

of Wells College, would have put herseif
beyond its scope,
It is believed that the trustees antici-
pate the time when the national Gov-
‘ernment wil! make some provision for
those who have once served as Chief

Pxecutives, and their present action is
intended to bridge over the Interval.

It was decided also at yesterday's
meeting that a statement of the alms of
the (Carnegie Corporation should be
published. According to this statement
the following paragraph from “Gospel
of Wealth,” printed in the North Amer-
fean Rewmow in 188%, gives Mr. Carne-
gie’'s chart of Iffe's voyage as then re-
vealed by him:

“Men may dle without incurring the
pltv of their fellows, still sharers in

RIGHTS OF AUTOS AND DOGS.

Court Asked to Decide What Is a
Reasonable Warning.

 

 

The question of law as to the reason-
able warning @ dog in the éetreet Is en-
titled to recefve from an approaching
vehicle is to be decided fn a suit brought
by Carl H. Smith of Islip, L. |, against
Harry L. Bradley, tel'er in a Manhattan
bank, who lives at 7994 Ridge Boule-
vard, Brooklyn, and Richard L. Green.

Smith asks $500 damages on the
| ground that while his dog was lawfully
'on the highway at Islip the defendants
| drove a motor car so recklessly that his
(dog didn't have a reasonable chance to
get out of the way. The dog was run
over and killed.

Persons whose dogs have heen killed
by automobiles will watch the outcome
of the case with interest.

of this in the case of the World. The prop-
erty was owned originally by Jay Gould,
and because it was owned by him and
because be could not with all his other
invest mente arouse confidence in it he was
vlad to sell it at a very great loss to Mr
Pulitzer.

I have not any doubt that if Mr. John D
Rockefeller should buy the World to-day
he could destroy its value in thirty days
That is not a refection on Mr. Rocke-
feller, but he has other interests which
are large.”

In fixing the value of stock in the Preas
Publishing Company at the time of
Mr. Pulitzer‘ateath on October 29, 1011,
the appraiser was aided by figures sub-
mitted by N. H. Botsford, auditor of
the company, as to the groas revenues,

expenses and net profits for the four
years preceding the date of Mr. Pulitzer's

death. For 1908 the groas revenue was
$5,597,678; the expenses, $5,040,198; depre-

ciation and bad debts, $103,908, and the,

net profits, $333,673. In 1909 the gross
revenue was $5,506,660 and the net profit
$562,891. In 1910 the revenue was $6,288,857
and the net profit $702,374, while in 1911
the revenue was $6,382,137 and the net

four years was $2,251,321.

The auditor reported that during the
years named bonuses of $140,000 were
paid, and during three of those years
Mr. Pulitzer paid them out of his own
funda. The total he paid was $105,000.

Vlorence D. White, financial manager
of the company, said in an affidavit that
enormous expenditures are at all times
necessary, “even when there is no com-
pensatory increase in revenue and when
increased circulation owing
interest which must be setisfied actually
means increased losses. The year 1898
may be cited. After a long and n-
interrupted series of highly profitable
years the great expense of reporting the
Spanish American war and great demand

Boutell| for news attendant thereon caused a,

deficit of $43,000."

Mr. White said that at the time of Mr.
Pulitzer’s death seventy-three libel ac-
tions were pending against the company,

| and the amounts paid out in verdicts and

settlements of libel in four years were as

follows: 1908, $60,788; 1909, $79,087; 1910, |

$70,450, andi 1911, $114,105.

Mr. White also said that shortly after
Mr. Pulitzer's death a new contract for
the purchase of print paper had to be

made and under this contract the cost |

of the paper is increased between $250,000
and $400,000 a year.

In the formal report of the appraiser

erties: Pulitzer 'uilding, $2,000,000;
