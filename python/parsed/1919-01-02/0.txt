Will Renew Conferences.

The conferences in Rome with the
‘talian statesmen will be, in a sense, a
continuation of those held here when
King Victor Emmanuel visited Paris
and the President also talked with Pre-

 

mi Oriando and Foreign Minister
Bonnino. The results of President
Wilson's conferences with the British

Premier, David Lioyd George, and For-
een Minister Baifour, which have not
et been fully disclosed, probably will
ave an important relation to the con-
tnuation of the conferences with the
Tallan leaders.

The working machinery of the Ameri-
can Commission has been thoroughly or-
renized during the President's absence
‘n England and everything is practically
ready to begin business when he re-
lurns from Italy. There appears no
Jeason for altering the forecast made
four weeks ago, that President Wilson
intends to be back in Washington be-
fore the closing of the American Con-
gress on March 4, or that, if necessary
re will return to France early in the
pring to continue his work. There are,
however, some indications that the Pres-
igerts hope that his return will not be
recessary may be realized.

Copyright, 1918; all righta reserved,

LONDON, Jan. 1. The
Munich “Nachrichten” offers a
novel “defense” for Germany's
part in precipitating the world
war. It says:

“He whose senses are not
diseased will never admit that we
alone were responsible for the
tragedy. No observer in those
fateful August days can fail to
come to the conclusion that other
nations are equally guilty, for
had they been united, instead of
torn by internal strife, they
would have had the power to
prevent those among us who were
blinded by false glamour from
unleashing the dogs of war.

“The only guilt that lies on us
rather than on our leaders is
that once the sword was drawn
we saw that our salvation lay
only in trying by every favorable
opportunity to use the. sword to
tread the narrow path of peace.”
