TO ENJOIN NATIONAL SALT.

Shall It and the North American Trust Be
Allowed to Transfer Ite Assets?
Supreme Court Justice Dickey in Brook-
lyn has reserved decision on a motion made
to enjoin the National Salt Company and

the North American Trust Company and ,

' fowa Central Railway Co.

Counsel aaid that the National ;

President Oakleigh Thorne of the latter com-
pany from transferring ‘he assets and prop-
| erty of the National Salt Company to 4
syndicate knows as the International Salt
Company
Salt Company in October, 1590, bought out
| the United States Salt Company and agreed
to pay a certain eum down and after five
years to hand over ita own certificate of
| stock The plaintiff claimed that for over
a year and a half it has paid its certificates
of indebtedness
In February last the officers in their re-
i pert to the New York Stock Eachange
stated that the money so paid was lawfully
owed and that the certificates of stock were
valid obligations of the company. On the
| strength of this report many persons pur-
Chased rights as to stock and certificates
Subsequently a syndicate representing
the Internaticnal Salt Company endeavored
to secure the National and the Caited States
Salt companies and the National Salt Com-
pany began an action last April in Ohio to
repudiate the ract, alleging (nat the
International and the United States comm-
panies had entered into a conspiracy for
the purpose of contreliing the ‘walt U ade
The defendauta in that action were tl
persons who had innocently purchased
the mghts to stock in the National Salt
Company, having bought on the repre-
eentationg of the officers of the company

a sentence for rape and twice previously
accused of assaults on women, culminated
this afternocn in a mass meeting in the
town hall. The meeting, which was called
by thirteen leading citizens, had for its
object the instituting of measures look-
ing to the removal of all prisoners and
convicts from the farm to some more se-

oure place of confinement
The meeting was largely attended and
resolutions were adopted reciting the lax
methods of caring for persons cortmitted
to the institution. A comroittee was ap-
tec to lay the matter before the County
missioners and ithe Governor and if

Wasutnaton, Oct. 2%--The supply of
dilver bullion in the Treasury has dwindled
until only about #42.000,000 worth is left.

| Under the Act of 1890 the Treasury pur-
| chased 168,674,082 ounces of silver for $155,-

| 941,002, but this has been constantly depleted

| by coinage and the depletion is now going
on at the rate of about §72,000.000 a vear
In two years there will be no silver bullion
left in the Treasury. and if coinage is con-
tinued the Government will again have

to become a purchaser of silver bullion
This will require a special act of Congress

FINANCIAL AND COMMERCIAL.

Turspay, Oct. 29.

The feature of the speculative eltuation
to-day was the disappearance of the dis-
turbing rumors that were circulated yee-
terday with the view of depressing prices.
As none of them was confirmed, and as
those who were responsible for them were
unable to produce a fresh crop, a more |

 

cheerful feeling gradually prevailed. The
only definite news of the day was in the
monetary situation. It consisted of an
easior foreign exchange market, lower
discount rates abroad and an advance in
exchange on London a: Paris. Notwith-
standing these developments, announce-
ments were made (ust at the cloae of busl-
ness that $7,600,000 goid had been engaged
here for shipment, to Poris on Thursday's
steamer These transactions were un-
doubtedly arranged for vesterday, when,
for a short time, the rates of exchange
between Paris and London and between
this centre and London showed a very
slight profit on shipments of epecio from
New York to Paria

It appears that the alight relict obtained
from this ce has already affected the
at Puris, and at the aame
time the renewing of maturing bilis in this

tre

market and a more abundant supply of
cotton bills depressed the rates for atarling
Now that gold ehipments, much dreaded
in speculative iarters, have virtually
been made, it appeara that the stock mar-
ket bas a8 sua liseounted them Al-
though there was no news regarding the
aovallied Northern Pacifle controversy,
