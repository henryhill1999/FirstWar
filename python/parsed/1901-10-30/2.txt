BILL POSTING ON BLUFF ALONE

TAMMANY HAS NO RIGHT TO PUT
POSTERS ON SUBWAY FENCES.

 

 

Rot Tammany ts Deing It and Making
the Pollee Arrest Citizens’ Unien Bil-
pesters Whe Do the Same Thing —C. U.
Wil! Call the Biull in Court To-merrew.

Squire Croker became so indignant on
Monday night, efter causing the arrest
of T 8S. Winans, the head billposter of the
Citizens’ Union, for daring to put a fusion
poster across a Tammany advertisement
op the Subway fence in Union Square, that
he sent out, through the chief of his con-
stabulary, an order to all the police to arrest
men who interfere with Tammany posters
on the Subway boardings. Thies is not
exactly bow the order ts worded, but the
police don't have to have a diagram with
the orders they get from Deputy Commis
sioner Devery to understand them.

As a result of the order two more Citizens’
Union billposters were arrested yesterday
morning. They are Timothy Coffey of 128
Fourth avenue and George Houghtaling
of Thirty-firet street and Ninth avenue.
A. Tammany billposters continued to make
ue of the Subway fences and stone piles
after the arrestof Mr. Winansatthe Squire's
order, Coffey and Houghtaling decided to
get in a few licks for Low and fuston. They
went to work right in front of the Citizens’
Tnion headquarters at Union Square and
Sixteenth street, and they hadn't got a bill
up apiece before Policeman Schoill of the
Fast Twenty-seoond street station descended
upon them

At the police etation Capt. Arthur F.
Cosby protested against the arrests. He
said that Tammany men were permitted
to post bills on the Subway without Inter-

ference and that the Cidzens’ Union men

had the same right. The sergeant was |

very courteous

We have an order to arrest Citizens’
Union men who put their bills along the
Subway,” he sald

“Oh, you have," eald Capt. Cosby; “may
1 ask who sent out such an order?®

“Why, it comes from Police Head-
quarters ”

Well, L would like to eee it.”

You can't.” said the sergeant. “You
eee. it came over the telephone.”

roll me as nearly aa you can whas the
order is,” said Capt. Cosby

Well, said the sergeant, ‘my orders
as that Tammany Hall has the exclusive
right to use the boards along th: 5.“bway,
having made a contract with the firm in
charge of the Union Square work, and
that anybody else who puts bills there is
violating the lawfand is to be arrested.”

Capt Coaby tried to get the sergeant to
say that Devery had personally sent out
the order, but the sergeant was wise
enough not to admit that. The captain
and Robert Fulton Cutting went with the
prisoners to the Yorkville court, where,
after hearing all the facts, Magistrate
Meade granted an adjournment until to-
morrow. The two men were paroled

After leaving court Capt. Cosby went
to the office of Holbrook, Cabot & Daly,
the contractors who are doing the Subway
work from Great Jones street to Thirty-
third street. Capt. Cosby asked Mr. Hol-
brook if he had given Tammany the right
to use the fences along the Subway.
! certainly bave not,” said Mr. Hol-

brook “I have not given anybody the

ight ‘o put up these bills. Every time
ie oakn a poster at work | have had
him driven away, but it took so much of

me time that I made up my mind that the
work on the tunnel was of more impor-
tance than the constant pursuit of buckets

of paste, and eo 1 have done very little |
the city from Tammany Hall, the eynonym

interfering in the last few days. But I
assure you my firm has not given any per-
mission '¢ Tammany or to anybody rme
te post bills anywh on our work

Cay Cosby next went to John B
McDonald's offices, where he saw Mr
McDonald's Secretary The Secretary de-
elared that no permission had been given
to anybody to place advertising bills along
the Subway, and that any Tammany claim
te exclusive righta in the matter waa with-
out foundation. Now Capt. Cosby is well
prepared for the defence of his men to-
morrow. He will endeavor to have the
Devery order brought into the case, and
the Deputy Commissioner may be sum-
moned as a witness

4 SUN reporter tried to eee Devery yee-
terday and find out the exact nature of
the order sent out by him, but the Deputy
Commissioner had been gagged by that
time and could not be seen. Commis-
sioner Murphy was more accessible. He
was surprised to learn that the fact that
an order had been sent out waa known

The fact is.” said he, “that we have

ad a great many complaints from citi-
vens about this bill posting and we have
chowided to stop it ‘he billpoeters have
ne reapeet for any reon's rights. They
are sticking their bills everywhere and it

cine. ‘ wt any billpoeter putting
eta ‘here be had no right to put it
should be arrested) There was no men-
' f Tammany in it. Not a word about
evher «ide was mentioned in the order.”
When the cose of Winans came up in
the Y court, Ike Fromme, the
Bquir vididate for President of Man-
hea! ti wth, tried to make out that
le tre <iipess against Winans and not
the plainant romme doesn't like

the idea of being sued for false arrest
nevertheless, he is going to be sued, and
for heavy damages, too. He didn't get
much chance to extricate himself from
the fix he got into on Monday night, be-
cause Henry De Forest Baldwin, counsel
for Winans, asked for and secured an ad-
journment until) to-day

Fromme made a statement in court to
the effect that Tammany had acontrarct
for the exclusive use of the subway fences
and he was backed up by MB. Bimberg,
better known as “Bim, the Button Man,”
who declared that he persenally made a

contract to nail posting boards along
the Sulway fence from Union Square to
Thirty-fourth «treet with Holbrook, Cabot

 

& Daly. and that the boards were for the
exclusive use of Tammany

Assistant Chief Engineer George 8. Rice
of the Kapil Transit Commission, said
yesterday that when the Subway work
war begun a number of bill posters wanted
to get the exclusive use of the fences for

TIM SULLIVAN MAKES MEN GOOD.

Game as Shepard —it's the Tammany War
Cry —We De You Good.

The Hon. Tim Sullivan, one of the spokees-
men of the Hon. Edward M. Shepard, in
his campaign for the redlection of Squire
Croker, said yesterday that he thought that
he had done a great deal of good and that
he was cruelly misjudged by Justice Jer-
ome, who has made a number of attacks
on hi

m in his speeches

t was used by Inspector Byrnes a
years ago,” sald the Senator yester-
“Do you know why Byrnes attacked
? It was because in the Assembly I

opposed a bill of his that would have allowed
| prisoners to be remanded to the police for
any length of time. It amounted to a
suspension of habeas corpus. Jerome said
that Byrnes said that I was « receiver of
| stolen goods. Byrnes never said that
Hyrnes said that I was the associate of
thieves, but that was all.

“Then Jerome said something about
striking and hitting bard. Why, that
‘ fellow couldn't strike a blow that would

knock a hole through @ pound of butter

Now, the folks that I associate with are

the same now that they were when Byrnes

talked about me. Some of them were

wrong, but that was no reason why I

made 300 honest men out of 300 crooks

response to a circular letter iasued to the
women of the borough to rally for the
purpose of influencing the vote of their
husbands, brothers and sweethearte to

M’CULLAGH MEANS TO DRIVE
THE FLOATERS OFF.

 

lagh, hie deputy, Van Dusen, and Chair-
man Robert ©. Morris of the Republican
County Committee, had a conference at
County Committee headquarters, 1 Madi-
son avenue, last night, at the conclusion of
which Supt. McCullagh issued subpanas
for 600 persons who are registered as voters
in the Second Assembly district. These
subpanas wili be served this morning by
Mr Van Duzen and a large force of deputies
from Mr. McCullagh’s office, and they are re-
turnable at once

Supt. McCullagh anticipates little trouble
in showing that a large number of the men
who are to be subpanaed are floaters, and
have no legal right to vote from the places
they have registered Those who are not
found by the deputies to-<ay, will be
watched for closely at the polls on election
day If they “ne to vote they will be
arrested Supt. MeOullagh said to « Sun
reporter

We have evidence that there are 600
illegally tered myey in Beoond
. we mean ves te care-
fully each individual case. We do not
mean to allow these men to vote if we oan
prevent ther. As a sample of the way
yare dolig things in that district let

me say this. Down in the section along
the waterfront Kaown as the Basin, where
all the canal boats tie up, we find some
300 men registered. They are registered
from canal boats, which are at present
boarded up and absolutely uninhabitabie.
In one lodging house, from which we had
returns according to the primary law of
Oct. 5, twenty-one men Hved then. The
registration books show forty-two men
registered, from that house twenty-
one of these must be fraudulent. From
a flat of Just four tiny rooms, we have
thirty-four men registered on the books

“I might go on this way and give a
number of instances, but they wo all
be on the same general line. Suffice it to
oy that the district is fairly honey-coombed
with colonizers and floaters work
confining the vote of this district to those
who are legally entitled to vote from it,
will not stop with these 600. I have men at
work there all the time and between now
and election I expect to have the whole
| district cleared up of floaters. And I don't
} think that after the way we treat them,
there will be any attempts, or at least not
many, to vote floaters on election day.”
