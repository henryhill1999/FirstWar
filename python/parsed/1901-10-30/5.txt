The End of the Anarchist.

The execution of CzoLoos7 yesterday

'to have been remarkable as a

t y well-managed and success-

ful execution by the method of the

electric current. It was conducted with
dignity and great celerity.

Thus had died a wretch whose existence
on the @arth was no more tolerable by
eocisty than if he had been a noxious
reptile. He had an absolutely just trial
and the law was vindicated.

Let no physical trace remain to show
that such a creature over existed on the
earth.

' Notes of » Night.

Here are some atriking ant!-Tam-
many utterances of Monday night.

The case presented by a telling
speech was thus summed up by Mr.
SzTH Low:

* Tammany Hall ts charged with crime against
Uberty, 8 ts charged with crime against govern
ment, and Mt ie charged with crime against morals
If you want to condemn tt and If you want to infuse
@ New epirit into the elty government from top to
bottom, then your course ls clear. Elect the ant!
Tammany fusion ticket and we are pledged to do
everything to our power to bring to an end those
things @ith which Tammany Mall is charged.”

The incisive rhetoric of the Hon.
Fraxk 8. Back was first heard on
Mop4ay:

* SHEPARD Ws not # candidate, be & an accom:
plice. He te the man who ts put in through the
window while his associates stand outside on the
around. Me inserted throved the opening,
not because he is better, but because be le newer
aed may avert suspicion ~

Justice JnnomME read this letter on pool-
rooms as having passed between two
Tammany members of the State Senate:

“My Dear Senator: Please don't forget to speak
to Mr. PaRmBis about that place for my brother
8 106th street and Columbusavenue | understand
that 10 will begin business next week. My brother
has bad saperience tn the work and knows all the
patroms im the neighborhood. If you can piace
bim you may send me word to the Senator's office
and 1 wOl ceed my brother word ~

Here is the sixth paragraph of the
addreas with which the Steckler Demo-
crates amnounced their adhesion to the
Low ticket:

- If Mr. SUmpaRD were against Caogmn he would
bot secceps his Bemiuetion, for every one knows
thet without Caomma’s consent he could not have
been nominated. as CROERA controled the majority
of the delegates.”

And this was the close of a speech
delivered by the President of the Frank-
lin Association of Pressmen’'s Assistants,
Waiter W. STOKES:

* Ge down into the tenement districts and you
will pee under the protection of the men whom
we ate paying to protect us the worst forms of vice
end aim Gaunted tn the faces of your wives and
chidgea. Tammany bas endeavored to pul im
morality tn the tenements throughout the city.
end i wil] be rebuked by the workingmen, to whom
potiving is dearer than the innocence and the virtue
of thetr women and children. The organization
that te responsible for this great shame cannot
escape thelr vengeance.”

These are only sparks of a great con-
flagration. It is a fire that should burn
out completely the Tammany domina-
tion of the city of New York.

 

 

 

Kdward M. Shepard on the Rate of
Taxes.

Last Friday night, when Epwarp M.
BHEPARD addressed a meeting at Long
Island City, he found himself in a peculiar
position. As he was addressing voters
in an outlying borough it was necessary
for him to commit himself fully to the
building of an unlimited number of
bridges, though, at the same time, for
general purposes of the campaign, he
desired to say something in favor of the
limitation of taxation; while of course,
the two propositions were not consistent,
and could not be made consistent by any
casuistry or false reasoning

Mr. SHEPARD said: “ The rate of taxes,

to which the chairman has referred,
the rate of taxes in this greater city,
must not be increased. The burden

upon the industry of the city ia already
quite sufficient for the means of the
citizens, whether richer or poorer, who
pay the taxes.” This proposition of
the Tarmmany candidate is undoubtediv
sound, but it is utterly and absolutely
inconsistent with the city Democratic
platform, which proposes to extend
municipal ownership to the “docks
and wharves along the city’s water.
front in all the boroughe,”” and “the
taking control and management of all
the ferries,” either of which propositions
would necessarily involve an enormous
sdditional outlay of city moneys

Mr. SHETARD i* not satiefied with the

four bridges now either built or in course

of Manhattan with the two boroughs
on the Long Teland side of the Fast Liver
but he called the attention of his auditors

——_—

this feat by declaring that public im-
provements such as Rapid Transit lines,
tunnels and bridges give the city a reve-
nue by returning property.

He then found that he had géne a
little too far, for it would not do to tell
the citizens of Long Island City that they
must pay toll on the bridges, and on
second thought he found that he muet
give up the idea of tolls, and must make
the bridges profitable to the taxpayers
on some other theory, and this he en-
deavored to accomplish by stating that
‘when the public money is invested
in a bridge, the construction of which
enhances enormously the rental-paying
value of property, the city itself is made
directly richer with larger resources,
and with larger revenue.” Ho said the
city may legitimately invest in a bridge
or in Rapid Transit construction, be-
cause the immediate effect is ‘to en-
hance the practical and rental-paying
value of property.”

Now this sort of talk is all very well
for effect on a Tammany meeting at
Long Island City, but we should like to
have Mr. SuxparD explain how the ex-
tension of the Rapid Transit system to
the borough of Queens and the building
of more bridges over the East River can
be of any possible benefit to the tax-
payers of the borough of Manhattan.
Their rentals, certainly, will not rise by
virtue of these public improvements,
for the history of the past shows us
that the only rentals which rise by the
extension of a Rapid Transit system or
by facilities of transportation are the
rentals of property lying on the outer
limite of the remote boroughs, while
property in the central borough, such as
is that of Manhattan, either remains
dormant and stagnant in rental value, or
decreases in income-producing power

Let Mr. SHePARD abstain from any talk
about the necessity of not increasing
the rate of taxation. Let him rather
favor the unlimited and wanton expendi-
ture of public moneys under the guise of
unlimited so-called pubhe unprovements,
the very promise of which may serve
to capture some unthinking voters.

——

The Prospects of Reciprocity.

The enterprises of the McKinley Ad-
ministration in the way of reciprocity
treaties with several foreign Govern-
menta were not undertaken upon Presi-
dent McKinuLey's initiative. It is im-
portant to remember this. He made
no sudden departure from accepted
Republican policy. In opening nego-
tiations he was only obeying the positive
mandate of the platform upon which
he had been elected

In the Repubiican platform of 1806 |
appeared this clearly worded resolution:

“We believe the repeal of the reciprocity ar-
rangements segotiated by the last Republicaa
Admiptstration [President Hanawon's) wae «
national calamity, and we demand thelr renewal
and extension on such terms as will equalire our
trade with other mations, remove the restrictions
which now obstruct the sale of American products
im the ports of other countries, and secure enlarged
markets for the products of our farms, forests and
factories ’

“ Protection and reciprocity are twin measures
of Republican poliey and go hand in hand, Demo
cratic rule has recklessly struck down both. and
both must be re@stablished.

* Protection for what we produce: free admis
sion for the necessaries of life which we do not
produce; reciprocal agreements of mutual Interest
which gain open markets for us in retvarn for our
open market to others. Protection bullds up
Gomestic industry and trade and sccures our ows
market for ourselves, reciprocity builds "p foreign
trade and finds an outlet for our surplus ~

No platform ever contained anything
clearer, more definite, more imperative
than this. The plank was the practical
incorporation into the body of Hepublican
doctrine of the principle asserted several
years earlier with such uncommon vigor
by that life-long protectionist JaMES
G. BLAINE

Even at that time Mr. McKrner,
then chairman of Ways and Means,
was generally believed to be in full
sympathy with Mr. BLAINE's view of
the subject. Yet it was not he, as Presi-
dent. who afterward led the party in
the direction of reciprocity, The party
itaelf, in convention assembled, and
independently of the circumstance of
his nomination as its candidate in 1896,
laid out in advance for him the pro-
gramme

In accordance with the declaration
of the Republican platform of 1894, the
Dingley revenue law, enacted in 1897 by
the votes of the Kepublican majorities
in House and Senate, made the foliow-
ing provisions in section 4:

“That whenever the President of the United
States. by and with the advice ar 4 conscnt of the
Senate, with a view to secure reciprocal trade with
foreign countries. shall within the period of two
years from and after the passage of this act, enter

THE SUN,

on certain free-listed articles, accord-

ingly as in his judgment reciprocal

—ee are by other Governments
or withheld.

The words italicized in the section
printed above exhibit the very impor-
tant, but frequently overlooked pro-
visions to which our Washington cor-
respondent called attention on Tuesday
when speaking of Senator ALDRICH'S
conference with President RooskvELtT;
namely, that the reciprocity conven-
tions require not only ratification by the
Senate as treaties but also affirmative
action by both houses of Congress as
tariff legislation

Thus the series of proposed commer-
cial conventions commonly known as
the reciprocity treaties and negotiated
largely through the agency of the Hon.
Joun A. Kasson rest squaray upon
a law passed by a Republican Congress
in furtherance of a policy distinctly
declared and demanded by the Repub-
lican platform of 15806

Yet at the same time, in enacting
this reciprocity policy, the Fifty-fifth
Congress did not make over the business
entirely to the Executive or to the treaty-
making power. It reserved for the legis-
lature the final power to approve or
reject the details of that policy, even
after ratification by the Senate,

The law providing for the negotiation
of these treaties finally passed the
House with the votes of 187 Republicans,
and without a single Republican vote
recorded against it, It passed the
Senate finally with the votes of 40 Repub-
licans. No Republican Senator op-
posed it. ‘The list of Republicans voting
for it was headed by the name of Sena-
tor ALDRICH

It is proper to say that the Republican
National Convention of 1900, which met
at Philadelphia and nominated Mi:
McKINLEY for his second term, fell far
short of the St. Louis convention of
four veara earlier in the positiveness
of its declaration for a reciprocity poley
The Philadelphia resolution merely said,
after renewing faith in the doctrine of
protection:

“We favor the associated polley of reciprocity
eo directed as to open our markets on favorable
terms for what we do not ourselves produce, in felura
for free foreign markets.”

Such are the broad facts about the
effort to incorporate in the Republican
party creed, and to enforce by legisia-
tion, Mr. BLAINK’s idea that a protective
tariff should be used not only directly
for the protection of American industry
against foreign competition, but also
indirectly to extend the foreign markets
open to American products. President
McKINLEY obeyed the Republican plat-
form and followed the law enacted by
the Republican Congress in the first
year of his first term. At the eve of the
meeting of the Fifty-seventh Congress,
likewise Republican in beth bodies,
not one of the commercial treaties ne-
gotiated by him has yet passed even the
preliminary step of ratification by the
Senate. The status of reciprocity 4«
a Republican doctrine in not 60 well
defined as it was five years ago; and
it cannot be said that the prospect of
a practical application of the mar-
ket-opening theory, on the lines orig-
inally contemplated, is anything but
misty at the present time

 

 

The Pottawattomies Want to Strike.

The Hon. CRARLES CURTIS, Repreeen-
tative in Congress of the First Kansas
district, has an interesting petition to
present to that body, Some two hun-
dred Pottawattamies, whose reservation
ia north of Topeka, ask Congress to let
them sell their lands and be wards of
the Government once more. They are
weary of labor. They are weary of
shifting for themselves Civilization
palls on them. They are sick of houses
They want to pass the rest of their
dava with their uncivilized brethren,
the Pottawattomies of Wisconsin. The
hereditary instinct reasserts itself. Why
should an Indian work? That is squaw
business, unworthy of a brave. The
\\ swoonsin Pottawattomies have enough
to eat and they don't have to degrade
themselves by toil. Plenty of grub,
plenty of dances, plenty of initiations
and mysterious medicine: that is the
life for a self-respecting Indian Why
should the Great Father compel the
Pottawattomies to the monotonous and
menig! grind of labor?

“ab. why should !tfe all labor bet”

It is possible that the Great Father
may hold that if work is good enough
for white men, it is not too bad for the
copper-colored race with high cheek-
bones. From all the friewds of the up
raising of the Indians there will be a
sound of sighing sent. But let us not
be unjust. Is work anything more than
a habit that has been acquired by many
persons, civilized and savage? Much
of the work of early man must have
been play to him. Fishing and hunting,
the sports of highly civilized men,
were also the sports of the savage. It
may be said that he needed the flesh
and the skins. But there were other
wavs of feeding and clothing himeelf,
and the savage always killed and «till
kille more than he needs, Sporting
blood dates from dim ages when primi-

ltive man was chasing or being chased
Il by the cave bear or dangling his legs

over the piles of hie dwelling fishing

being speared if she doesn't bring
a fine collection of witchetty grubs
when she comes back with the spoil of
her digging stick.

Do many civilized men really like to
work? There is much humbug poured
forth as to that, the dignity of labor
and so forth. How about the dignity
of reet? There are some men, many,
if you like, but still few in comparison
with the rest, who cajoy the particular
sort of work they have chanced upon
and would really be unhappy if they
were deprived of it. Perhaps there
is something unnatural and excessive
in this devotion. The child likes to
play at work but he hates work and
accustoms himself to it because he has
to. Some grown-up children never do
become accustomed to it. Most per-
sons would like to do something else
than they are doing. That something
would be play.

There is a good deal of Kansan Potta-
wattomieiem in most of us.

  

A Constitutional Collapse.

Night before last Sneranp's ‘ Con-
atitutional "' excuse for not declaring his
policy concerning Deputy Police Com-
missioner Devery collapsed, after the
strain of sixteen days of life. It was
on Oct. 12 that Sueranp pronounced
himself forbidden to make any such
declaration by the Constitutional amend-
ment of 1874, which ‘' requires a success-
ful candidate before he may take office
to solemnly swear that he has not made
any promise to influence the giving or
withholding of a vote.”

Two days ago Police Commissioner
Devery bluntly asserted that be had no
fear of removal; and smarting at this
show of independence, as well as at the
ridicule which has followed hia former
bunkum argument, Mr. Seepanrp in his
speech of Monday denounced DkvERY'S
remarks as “unfit to an extreme degree"
and ‘' deserving of severe reprobation.”

What has become of the Constitution?
If that forbade Surpann, the candidate,
to give DEVERY warning, how does it per-
mit him to reprobate him, to announce
his pre-official hostility to him?’ We
leave it to Mr. SHEPARD to answer, re
marking that for people who like his
kind of a politician he is about the kind
of politician those people like

A Sign of Defeat.

The state of the Tammany campaign
was disclosed by a Shepard spellbinder
on Columbus avenue on Monday night,
‘*Remember,” he said, in effect, ‘that
the issue is on the Democratic party
That ia not responsible for CROKER, or
for Devery or for red light. Vote the
Democratic ticket.”

That has been Sugrann's plan of cam-
paign. It is the last stage of effort that
is staring in the face of defeat, and it
ia nonsense. The issue is not on the
Democratic party, but on RKicHanrp
Croker and Tammany Hall, with which
the Shepard ticket is inseparably iden-
tified from now to the end of its career.

The alternative to the Tammany dom-
ination is administration of the city
government by Set# Low and his asso-
ciates on the fusion ticket. They are
the men to vote for.

Football.

Tt fe satisfactory to see that the Colum-
bia football men have appreciated the
desirability of at once setting at rest the
current rumors of Columbia profes-
sionaliam, started in New Haven after
the Yale team had won its hard-earned
vietorvy of Saturday. No institution,
apparently, bas striven harder than
Columbia since the football scandal of
two years ago to keep her athletics
above reproach

Unlike baseball, professional foot-
bull teams never have flourished in
this country. Football is distinctly an
amateur sport, and the athletic directors
of Columbia or of any other college
against which there is a breath of sus-
picion owe it to the thousands of ad-
mirera of the game that they should
be on the alert to keep it free from any
taint of professionaliam

goed and heval New Yorker to untie his
purse-strings and send what money he

publican County ¢ ommittee and the other

SHALL THE PRESS BE MUZZLED?

Let us hope that Americans will not be
led by their horror at the murder of the late
President to do themacivese a mischief
greater than tho lows of the best of men.
The consequences will not be confined to
themselves. The influence of American

 

opinion has increased, erpecially in Eng- {

land. It is even doubtful whether, if
American sentiment bad been in ite nor-
mal state, we should have had this hideous
South African war. In Europe there are
plenty of reactionists who would hail the
signal for repression of opinion helt out by
the American republic.

Is there anything in the murder of the
late President pointing to the necensity
of much a change of principle as the re-
striction of the freedom of the press? Have
we any reason for thinking that Czolgoss
imbibed hia evil inspiration from the
newspapers? He appears to have = im-
bibed it from the lectures of Emma Gold-
man. If Emma Gokiman incites to crime,
put her down, Put down any ove who in a
newspaper or elsewhere incites to crime
But eriticiam of the acts or public charac-
ters of persons in authority, though it may
make those persons objects of odium, is
not inciting to crime. The antidote to un-
just criticism grows, in a free press, beside
the bane

Does there appear to have been a single |

case of political assassination traceable to
criticism in the press? Did Junius, the
keenest as well as the bitterest and most
malignant of critics, breed or show any
tendency to breeding an aseassin? Was
George IIL, the Duke of Gratton, or any
other vicim of Junius, for a moment in
danger of his life?

Three Presidents, cry
restriction, have been assassinated
single generation. They mught
add to the list the assassination of Julius
Cesar or Henry IV. There is not the
faintest connection between the
cases, nor do they together form any ground
for exceptional legislation

It is coubtful even whether
of persons in authority would be increased
by the suppression of criticiam, You muglit
be only closing the safety-vaive

If dangerous conspiracies of any kind
are on foot, let us increase the police and
the detective force, not renounce
ciples and discard the great

The Couneil of Trent declares that a mar-

Pius VI issued a reseript in 1785 and in it
he stated that Protestants, or a Catholic and
