CROKER RAZEFS HIS FIGURES.

80,000 or fo the Utmost Plurality He

Expects in This County.

The Squire, who used to rent Moat Houre,
Wantage, but has bought it, now, for a
| permanent possession, has been warbling |
| for several days on the proposition that he
made at the beginning of the campaign to |
the effect that he would be able to give a
plurality of 60,000 for his city Ucket in this

county

Yesterday his intimates were tnformed |
that all that the Tammany organization
hoped to give for the ticket was from 30,000

| to 85,000

These figures have to do, of course with
the head of the city ticket and it is under-
stood that all of the energies of the Tam-
many campaign workers are to be directed

to the euceess of the county ticket

The figures which the Squire ie now
; banking on have been gathera! br the
| Assernbly district leaders Mr Croker

was slow to accent them but he at last made

up his mind that the men who had made the
| can vasses were better able to judge the real

, feeling of the people than were the men
| who «it close to him in the Democratio
Club, and predict that the victory will be
the test that was ever won by any
litle organization. These same men
n 1@00 told Mr Croker that he would be able
to give a plurality of 80,000 or 100,000 for

the Bryan ticket, and Croker went down |

land told this to James D. Richardson in
the Hoffman House to tell Chairman Jones
, of the Democratio National Committee
| in Chicago

Richardson sent the iree along and
it was not until a personal friend told him
of the utter madness of the estimate that
he was aware that he had been fooled) Then
he «ent a rush meeaage to Mr Jones, say-
ing that the real plurality to be expected

was one-quarter of that named by the Tam- |

many chief

It will be remembered that the Repub-
liean campaigners, after &@ canvaas of 14

of New York by 20,500. It is regarded as

ENGEL’S GANG DYING HARD.

 

Meb an Adier Truck and Make a Rew That

the Felice at Last Stepped.

An Adler truck full of speakers arrived
at Grand and Ludlow streets at 10:45 o'clock
last night and stopped directly under the
windows of the Engel Association. Henry

Assembly had never done any thing in the

mediately contradicted the statement.
“How about my Court House till?" he

asked.

“Was the Court House ever built?" an-
awered Melrose and the crowd which was
in sympathy with Adler cheered

Cohn trotted back into the Engel rooms
and soon afterward a nolsy crowd of En-
golites appeared and tried by yelling and
hisses to break up the meeting. Failing
in this they began to throw and pota-
toes at the speakers. H. G skius, one
of the Adler men on the truck, was struck
in the breast by a potato, and an egg hit
Bernard M. Mitkin

The Adier men say that they appealed
to the police to stop the disturbance, but
that nothing was done

In the crowd was Abraham Feinberg of
48 East Tenth street. He shouted loudly
for Adier and an Engel man hit him in
the face knocked him down and kicked him
in the stomach. Several of the speakers
say that they jumped from the truck and
pointed out the assailant to a policeman
who thereupon opened a way forbim to
eacape

A Cohn truck with a band on it was rent
for and anchored alongside the Adler truck
After that nobody could be heard on

Word was telephoned to Republican head -
quarters and Adler appearxi He waa
greeted br cheers from the majority of the
crowd and hisses from the Cohn and Engel
delegation. He mounted his truck and
talked for ten minutes at the top of his
lungs Finally a squad of police from the
Eldridge street station arrived and ordered
both trucks to move on. The Adler truck

chard e#treets. Moet of the crowd followed
it and the Cohn truck went out of business.

COUNTESS DEMANDS APOLOGY.

un | Eart Russell's First Wite Cadiee Demand

to Assistant Seeretary Taylor.

WasitisoTon Oct 20 - Mabel Edith, Count-
ens Russe! f Lomion., England, has de-
manded « public apology from Henry A Tav-
lor, Assistan’ Secretary of the United States
Treasury She has cabled to him @ re-
newal of the declaration that she ia the
only lawful wife of Earl Russell, despite

ithe alleged fraudulent divorcee obtained
under the lows of this country, and despite

hie allowed bigarmous marriage. She re-
sents toe reported se aternent of Assistant
Secretary Tavior that she waa legally noti-

flad of the divorce

Thi international incident was brought |

about by ay order issued from the Immigra-

' tien Bureau in Washington a few days ago,

and the suleequent rescinding of the order
by Mr Toclor The crder directed the
immigration officers at New York to ape-
eclally examine Earl Russell upon his ex-
pected appearance at Che port with regard
to his right to enter the country. It was
held that he was a criminal within the scope

| of the Immugration laws, unfit to enter the

United States Assistant Secretary Taylor
reacinaed the order because he thought a
man should not be regarded as a criminal
in this country who had merely acted under
a decree of our courts, even though the laws
of England were such as to hold him dis
graced and an outeast. This brought

COMO OF OEMOHOHH HOE HOOF

 

MRS. GEBHARDS ALIMONY.

Arranged Long Before the Diverce —-New

York Residence Not Included?

Sioux Fauus, 8. D., Oct. 29.—It is learned
to-night from the best authority that the
alimony in the Frederic Gebhard divorcee
case was in reality settled before Mr. Geb-
hard came to South Dakota last April
According to this information, he and his
wife mutually agreed to separate some
months before he thought of coming to
Sioux Falls to obtain a divorcee, and he
placed in the hands of trustees in New
York city a certain sum of money, reported
tu be $185,000, the interest upon which should
be paid to Mrs. Gebhard during her life

Puring the brief time that Mra. Geb-
hard was in Sioux Falls last Saturday the
only money transaction between ber and
Mr Gebhard was the payment by him
of the $1,000 awarded to her by the court
to cover the coats of her trip to Sioux Falls,
attorneys fees, Ac Nothing whatever
was done here in reference to the question
of alimony, which bears out the statement
that this matter was settled before Mr.
Gebhard came to Sioux Falls last spring.

Acoording to this same authority the
New York residence of the Gebhards was
not included in the alimony as has been

| reported. Had it been. the deed would

have gone on record prior to last April,
when Gebhard came to South Dakota.
