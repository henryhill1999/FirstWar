WORK OF U. §. SIGNAL CORPS.
PROGRESS IN ALASKAN AND

PHILIPPINE TELEGRAPHS.

Mistary Cable System of Philippines Now
Covers 749 Miles—-Upper Yukon in
Commoantication With Skagway New.

Wasutnoton, Oct. ®.—An interesting |

feature of the annual report of Gen. Greely,
Chief Signal Officer of the Army, relates |

 

to the work of the Signal Corps in Alaska.
He says

“It is not generally understood that the
Alaska telegraph systems, while placing
all.the Alaskan posta in connection with
theCommanding General of the department
when completed, would not afford means of
communication with any other part of the
world. To increase the value of the Alaskan
syatem, the Chief Signal OMcer of the Army
cogferred with the authorities of the Cana-
di Giovernment at Toronto with a view
to the extension of the existing Canadian
telégraph lines, and the establishment of
coéperation in telegraphic work between
the@'Alaskan and Canadian systems

“The @anadian Government courteously
pli in conference with the Chief Signal
0 of the Army, Mr. J. B. Charieson,
Astistant Superintendent of Public Works
in the* Yukon district, who was charged
with the extension of the Canadian tele-
graph line from Quesnelie to Atlin. The
Canadian authorities had the longer line to
construct, but they performed their work
with euch expedition that, on May 5, 1901,
the telegraph line was completed between
Daweon and Fort Egbert, thus bringing the
upper ger of American territory on the
Upper Yukon in direct telegraphic commu-
nication with Skagway, wheace by steamer
news could reach Washington, or any other
part of the world, in four days under ordi- |
nary conditions. On Sept. 24, 1901, telegraphic
communication was established between
Fort Eebert and the Upper Yukon region,
via United States military telegraph and
Canadian land lines. and messages were
oxeban, between the commanding offi
cers at Fort Egbert, Skagway and the au-
thorities in Washington

Referring to the work in the Philippines,
the report save

“At the beginning of the fiscal vear there
vas only one military cate south of Lavon

ebout fifty nilles in length, connecting |
Cebu and Leyte. This condition of af-
fairs caused Major-<len MacArthur to |

represent to the Secretary of War the mili-
tary and economic advisatility of putting
Manila in direct commeanication with the |
principal points of the ielauds The rili-
tary cable eystem of the Philippines now

ment of theae cables there was scarcely

cotntaunication from department  head- |
quarters at Zamboanga in less than two |

*The United States and its remote colonies

Congress in his special message of February
1399 «dt im only a matter of time when |
Legon shall be connected with Japan and |
Tonkin and the Chinese Empire. The |
Philippine islands are now only accessible |
telegraphically over a short cable of about |
0 mi of the Eastern Extension Com-
pany between Manila and Hong Kong.”

As to the wireless telegraphy, Gen. Greely
says:

In wireless telegraphy the Signal Corps
has lected ita own system, which was
the firet one ever successfully operated inthe
Nnited States, on yy 20 1800, between
Fire Island and Fire Island Lightsiip, a
distance of ten miles. There are now in anc:
comful operation two stations in San Fran-
ciaco harbor, one at Fort Mason and another
at Aleatraz Island) Arrangements have
heen made for theestal:lishinent of stations
in the Philippines at suitable points. The
Chief Signal Officer adheres to the opinion
hat this svatem has its limitations, which
are not entirely dependent on distance. ®

BROWNS SENTENCE DEFECTIVE.

Georetary Root Refers Back Case of
Ldeutenant Convicted of Mansiaughter.
WASHINGTON, Oct. 20 —Secretary Root has
decided to refer back to the court-martial
which tried Lieut. Preston Brown in the
Philippines, on a charge of killing 4 native,
allthe papers in the case = Lieut Brown
belongs to the Second Infantry, and dur-
ing an engagemen: with Filipinos he killed
a native, who, it is alleged, permitted an
American soldier to drown without making
an effort to save him. Lieut. Brown was
tried by court-martial! and convicted of man-
slaughter He was sentenced to a short
term in prison for the offence

When the papers reached the War De-
partinent a defect in the sentence was im-
mediately noticed and called to the atten-
tion of the Secretary of War The army |
regulations provide that a sentence pro- |
nounced by court-martial for a civil offence
shall not be less than the sentence provided
by law for the same offence in the State or
Territory in which the crime ts committed
Aa the crime of manslaughter i# punishable
in the Philippines under the Spanish penal
code by imprisonment for not lew than
twelve years and the sentence imposed
by the court-martial was much under this,

ENOUGH MEN IN PHILIPPINES.
Military
drawn, Not increased.

Wasaixoton, Oct. 29.—Seoretary Root
has decided after a careful consideration
of the reports from Gen. Chaffee, that the
wituation in the Philippines will not re-
quire an increase of the military force
there. He made this statement to the
President and Cabinet to-day and explained
that the recent disturbances in Samar,
Leyte and other parte of the Philippines
were not so serious as to warrant the send-
ing of reénforcements to Gen. Chaffee

On the contrary, he believes that there
can be a gradual reduction of the military
force, month by month; not by the bring-
ing home of any special regiments, but
by not sending to Manila to replace the
short-term men as many soldiers from the
United States as are brought home for
discharge

He haa had several plans laid before him
for bringing homethe short-term men and
replacing them with troops from the United
States, and his present intentions to follow
the plan of ordering home from the Philip-
pines from time to time one of the regi-
ments which has been there about three
years and which is composed la vy of
men whose term of enlistment will soon
 *

hould the regiment contain men whose
term is not soon to expire they will be trans-
ferred to some regiment to remain in
Philippines, and any short-term men in
regiments not to come home will be trans-
ferred to the ones under orders to return,
to the extent that the returning regiment

will be recruited to ite maximurn eprengen
It will then be

 

with short-term men.

brought back to San Francisco and replaced
by a regiment which is recruited only to
its normal strength, eo that month by
month the total force will be slightly re-
duced

Acting upon the recommendation of
Gen. Chaffee Secretary Root will not, how-
ever, cause any reduction in the near future
to 26,000 men, but will endeavor to keep a
force of 35,000 men in the isiands for some
time vet

Just what regiments will be selected to
go to San Francisco has not been de
termined upon, though in all probabiltiy
Secretary Root will send the recently or-
ganized regiments of infantry and probably
several regiments of cavairy

by the advent of the squad of police

Yesterday afternoon Hopper himself
went to Capt. McClusky of the West 104th
street station and had a talk with him in
the captain's private room! As a result
the policemen appeared last night under
Sargeants Murphy and Delaney

} One of the Hopperites appeared at the
door, his arms full of lithographs of the
Tammany candidates, and tried to enter
the room, which wae hung with fusion
pictures. James Singer, the sergeant
at-arme, stopped him at the door and told
him to keep out. A policeman put the
Hopperite in and he threw the hthographs
all around the room

Lonvon, Oct. 2.—The Admiralty Court
to-day rendered a decision in the case of
the collision between the White Star Line
steamship Oceanic and the Waterford

occurred in the Lrish Channel during a

Kincora and the loss of seven or eight of

her crew

The verdict of the court ia that the Kin-
because of faulty navi-
gation, and also for not stopping when
it was possible to do so after hearing the
Oceanic’s whistle The court also decided
that the Oceanic, although most skilfully
navigated, was going at the immoderate
rate of speed during the dense fog, in «
dangerous spot, of 6 1-3 knots an hour
This «peed had been admitted by the navi-

 

 

gators of the Oceanic For this reason
the court held that both vessels were to
