VOL. LXIX.—NO. 60,

TAMMANY HALL IS IN PANIC.

OUT THEY GO, CROKER, DEVERY
AND ALL THE RKkOOD!

 

 

 

The Swing Is With Low —The Peopic Are
Tired of the Monep-Grabbing, Black-
mating Crew That Are Working the
cny for Their Peckets All the Time.

“The ewing is with Low.”

“The sewing is with Low.”

“Make it a landslide!”

“A landslide’ A landslide’

These were the chants of the anti-Croker
men in all the bo of Greater New
York yesterday. All js are working
like nailers. All the anti-Croker men want
to be in at the political overthrow of the
Squire from Wantage, the English landlord
who has spent half of the last seven years
8,99 miles from the domain he has ruled
to the advantage of himself and his kitchen
cabinet, Andy Freedman, Ike Frommo
and others who care no more for Democracy
than a pig does for a pocket

Tammany is in a panic.”
Croker is dazed.”
He is trying to bluff it out.”

Many Tammany men made these utter-
ences yesterday concerning the municipal
election. There were some who even said
that the Tammany city ticket will be thrown
overboard at the last moment in the hope
of saving the county ticket. Over in Brook-
lyn some of the brightest lighte in the Demo-
eratic party are fearful that Shepard can-
not possibly carry through their county
ticket. There is no mistake in these state-
ments. They are gathered from Dero-
crate Whoee names cannot be mentioned,
but who desire occasionally to tell the
truth-—-in confidence

“They are beaten, sure *

“Croker ie done up foreve:.*

“New York is to be redeemed ”

These were the warwhoope of ~ fusion-
feta. They know full well that (Toker and
his kitehen cabinet are on the run. Some
of these fusioniasta went #0 far as to my
that Low and all of his associates on the
borough tickets in Greater New York will
win by anywhere from 9,000 to 60,000
The aim now in the fusion camp is to make
the defeat of Croker and Tammany over-
whelming.

These fustenista, with their Republican
allies, asked yesterday what had become
of Lewis Nixon and his Vice Committee of 5,
and why they were called off. The answer
waa that Nixon was sincere in his efforte—
too sincere to suit Tammany Hal!

It became known that Democrats who at
first believed that Shepard might be able
to reform Tammany Hall had thrown him
over because of hie recent speeches.

*Croker’s Tammany the source. Shep-
ard is the spouting fountain. *

*The fountain cannot rise higher than
the source.”

*Low and hie associates al! anti-Croker.”

® and all of his associates for
Croker.”

Go where you would yesterday, talk with
cabmen, saloonkeepers, small merchants
erd others, who in the past have been
{riendly to Tammany Hall, and there was
but one answer: They were tired of sup-
porting a man who spends most of his time
in England, who gets his revenues in New
York city, w ho buys a home in Wantage
and who pays Boer war taxes to the English
Govetoment. Yet ail the time he runs
Tammany Hall and on the witness stand
proclaimed:

*I am working for my pocket all the
time.”

The fusionieta proclaim that Low and
the coufty and borough tickets are surely
elected, and all the campaign managers
request that every mother's son opposed
to Croker and Tammany Hal) shall push
hardand make it a fine old landslide. They
raid that the battle ory from now until
eleotion should be

“Alandalide! A landslide *

“Soak Croker and Tammany every time.*

“Soak them for fair and forever.”

Frederick H. Brooks bet yesterday $2,250
on Low to 82,500 on Shepard. Senator
MeCarren has not yet been around to take
Mr. Brooka’s offer of $1,000 to $400 or $10,-
000 to $4,000 any number of times that Sen-
ator MoCarren pleases that Low carries
Brooklyn. Mr. Brooks said that before
the week was out the betting on Low and
Shepard would be even. It was even,
in spots, yesterday. Mr. Brooks called
attention to the fact that last year Mr.
Croker and his friends were betting very
heavy amounts at ail sorts of odds that
Bryan would carry New York city

“If Mr. Croker is so eure of carrying
the borough of Manhattan this time,” said
Mr. Brooks, “why are not the odds in favor
of Shepard as big as they were in favor
of Bryan last year?"

 

SHEPARD SILENT AS TO DEVERY.

Tammany Candidate Refuses to Talk Fur-
ther About the “Big Chief.”

The Squire's man for Mayor, Edward
M Shepard. went through his usual question
dodging yesterday morning, but in the
afternoon he declined to submit himeelf to
interviewers. At his Brooklyn headquar-
ters he declined to answer a number of
questions. He had nothing to say about
Deputy Commissioner of Police Devery,
although on the previous night he had
proclaimed boldly and regardless of the
Constitution that he thought if Mr. Devery
had said what he was reported to have
satt he should be “‘reproved.* When he
was asked to discuss this question he said
that it was political and he could not talk
about it

The reporter who was interviewing Mr
Shepard showed him an advertisement in-
serted in the newspapers by Tammany
Hall in which it was declared that all the
arsaulte on Devery were political lies,
bitter and unreasonable Mr. Shepard read
the advertioement carefully. Then he said

“That has to do with polities and the

Mrs. Black Didnt Declare It Husband
v 824,000 Duty.

Harry 8 B , President of the Puller
Construction Company of 135 Broadway,
went to the Custom House yesterday and
had a long interview with Collector Pid-
well. After his. visit a tale went about to
the effect that the customs officials had
seized a pearl necklace valued at $40,000,
the property of Mrs. Black, who had brought
it with her from Paris ten days ago with-
out paying the duty on ft. Mr. Black told
all about it at his bore, ® East Eightieth
street, last night.

Mrs. Black is wealthy tn her own right
and often p iry without con-
sulting ber husband about it, and he doesn't
mind, They spent the summer in Europe,
returning on Bet. 19, on the Teutonic
While in Europe Mre. Black made several
yvurchases of jewelry.

“A day or two ago,” said Mr. Black, “she
told me she had bought a necklace con-
taining forty-two pearls in
not pay the duty on it, so I went down to
the Custorn House to-day for the purpose
of paying theduty I don't know the valine
of the necklace, but I was told it was worth
about $40,000 and that the duty would be
about $24,000. I explained the matter to
Collector Bidwell and left the money with
him. There was no seizure in the case.”
Collector Bidwell said that Mr, Black's
statement was true in wey porneeee
The Collector said that he had reported
the matter to the Treasury Department

ment acted in the case

 

ROW 4€ CASINO DOOR.

Peliceman the Participants.
One ticket speculator, one theatre outpost
for the suppreasion of the former and one
cop for the suppression of both, were the
participants in a rough-and-tumble fight
at the entrance of the Casino last night just

eas.” The combatants in the order named
were Ollie Cringle of 142 Weet Thirty-sixth

| street. James Canary of 585 Eighth avenue

and Policeman Farrell of the West Thir-
tieth «treet «tation The result was that
Cringle was locked up on @ charge of dis-
orderly conduct, Canary received a black
eve and cut ear and Farreli’* uniform was
very much soiled

The row came about through Cringle
trying to purchase two tickets Tor apecu
lative purposes. Canary who is em loved
byw the theatre to warn the box offlee on
euch occasions made a signal to the box
offiee man «ho refused to sell Oringle the
seats. Cringle had seen Canary’s signal

JUSTICE HINTS AT ONE, COOKED
BY GLENNON ET AL.

Talks of Conferences Between Devery’s
Man, Wardman Devanney and One
“Blink” MeGovern—-Knews Their Pur-
port — Seores Fashionable De-Nothings |

At a meeting In Conrad Stein's garden
on Weat Fifty-seventh street, Inet night
Justion Jerome made some remarks which
were perhaps the most significant that he
has made throughout the campaign. He
didn't explain these remarks, but they
indicated, as apparentiy he intended them
to do, to what extent Tammany men may
a to get rid of the fusion candidate for Dis-
trict Attorney who has threatened to put
them in jail and who has the proofs to back
up that throat

A littl rhetorical flight of the chairman

of the meeting gave Justice Jerome the
cue for his remarks. The chairman told
about the monument to Nathan Hale in

City Hall Park and after repeating Hale's
last words anid: “If Juastion Jerome should
lome Die life in this fight I know that his
last words would be that he regretted that
he had but one life to lose for hia city *

Then Justice Jerome got up. He said as
a preliminary to his address “As far asa
losing life is concerned | want to say right
now-—and [| hope the newspaper boys will
get it eo that it may be understood by those
who apparently do understand the
extent of my information that I am per-
fectly cognizant of the transactions that
have taken place between Edward Glennon
and Mr. Devanney of the Nineteenth pre-
ctinet and a certain gentieman named ‘Blink’
Mctiovern and all that crowd there Now
ae far as my losing my life ia concerned |
value it very mu f and have a great deal
more use for it. I hope you will put me
in office so that I can use it in your business,
too, and then I think you'll see that it was
worth saving.”

“We know it's worth mving, Judge,”
yelled the crowd “We'll protect you
We'll elect you ”

After this meeting the reporters asked
Juatice Jerame what be meant Ly the hint
at a conspiracy on the part of the Tenderloin
wardmen and “Blink” MeGovern He re-
plied that he had said all that he could on
that point tin his speech

Justice Jerome addreswed four other
audiences last night. Two of them one
in Madison Square Garden Conoert Hall
and ove in Durvea’s Assembly Roome in
Weat Beventy-ninth street were what
might be described as fashionable Mr
Jerome hinself referred to ther in a not
altogether complimentary manner as “well

groomed *

He grilled the Madison Square aucience
He grilled the Seventy-ninth street aud
ence on both sides and sprinkled it with
vinegar to boot His talk the other day
to the members of the Women's Municipal
Ivague was honey to what he said last
night. But what he said seemed to go t
the hearts of all his hearers, men and wornen

alike. They didn't cheer hin or anmplaud
much during the speech at Duryea brut
such a demonstration in response to sur

@ apeech would have indieatedd that the
epeech had not had its effect

4nd the audience all seemed to fee! that
thew were hearing things a4 true as they
were bitter.. Men sat .here for the half
hour of the epeech with their flet= clenehedt
Women bit their lips and looked straight
ahead but those devices did not keep back
the tears

One onthtsiastic littl woman in black
ant out in the hall where she couki hear
Jerome but could not see him. She had
a amall American flag on a stick, When
the Justice came in she waved the flag
with one hard and her handkeretiot with
the other, The fact tha she was in an out-
of-the~way place did not detract from her
enthual asi But that wae all changed be-
fore Jerome had spoken for five minutes

She furled the flag and for the rest of
the meeting stood with ber head bowed
And she had plenty of use hand-
kerchief without waving 't

The speech was a surprise to the * well-

roomed audience” of the Nineteenth

assembly district. It began with a refer
ence to Asa Bird Gardiner as “that pict-
ureaque old wet hen who has lost every
thing that makes for American citizenship
through too much talk about hie ancestors
The crowd laughed, but it was the only
laugh the Justice got out of that meeting

Washington, L. I., shortly before 5 o'clock
yesterday afternoon. He had left his home
mounted on his favorite horse at half-past
3 o'clock. It te not known exactly where
he went, but when on his way home his
horse beoame frightened at some object
in the road and became fractious. Some
persons at a distance noticed the actions of
the horee, and aaw the rider fall beavily
to the ground. They ran to his aadetance
and found Mr. Cockran prostrate and un-
conscious in the road. A stretcher was
hastily improvised and the tnjured man
was carried to his home and placed in a
bed. Several physicians were summoned
and Mr. Cockran was finally restored to
consciousness

A reporter who called at the house «shortly
after & o'clock last night was told that it
was impossible to learn the exact details
of the accident, as Mr. Cockran was the
only one that knew and he waa in no con-
dition to answer questions

 

lt was understood, however, that the
accident happened while Mr Coekraa
was about a mile from his home. To the

Question, who first came to his aid the reply
was that so many persons came to the
house with the injured man that nothing
definite could be determined from their
statements. The hysicians Jad given
it out that it would not be known how
seriously Mr. Cockran had been injured
for several hours

Later it was given out from the house
that he was not dangerously injured. He
was bruised all over the body by his fall, it
was said, but no bones were broken. In
explaining the accident Mr Cockran merely
said that his horae had bolted and throwa
him. Dr... Forbes of this city arrived
at the bouse last evening

In the last campaign Mr. Cockran started
out to make several apeeches for Col
William Jennings Bryan, but lis voice
failed after the first speech, and he had to
give up the trip

SPECTATORS COULD SCARCE RF.
STRAIN THEIR WRATH.

clarei: “1 Mhet the President.
Pid 1 Heeause I Thought It Weuld
Benefit Poor People and fer the Name
of the Working People of Ali Nations”
—Ttree Times Current Was Turned @n
—Bedy Buried in Quicktime and Acid.

Aveurn, N. Y., Oct. 20.-Caolgoes is
with Booth and Guiteau, wherever they
are. His body is being consumed by quici
lime, as it lies in a grave In the cemetery
attached to Auburn Prison, a grave
will never bs marked In any way to
it from the two or three hundred other
graves in that yard

That which was called Leon F.
was exterminated this morning
tricity at the sgrvice of the law and there
nothing to remember the creature
except the unforgettable significance
that vault in Canton. The being whose
body fills the newly made nameless prisca
grave bere died as be had lived, an
archist. He knew if he went to hie
with truculent words on his lipa, tn
where Anarchists gather, ‘remember
Caolgoes" would be a watclwprd,
he sat in the chair this morning he panted:
“I shot the President, and I did it because
I thought it would benefit the poor people
and for the name of the working people
of all nations —I am not sorry for my crime
~ that is all I have to my.”

The poor fool died in the flush of
and he filled with anger the hearta of
who heard him. It was Czolgoss's message
to anarchy before he passed out of life
unshriven, for he would have no priest,
to leave his corpse to be buried in unbal-
lowed ground. There were some of the
witnesses o/ the execution who said that it

E

of

sever have been heard. Another man
said: *I would have been sorry if he had
been gagged These rantings will show
America that anarchy did not die with this
follow. It will be a good lesson for us,
coming when wrath over the damnable crime
at Buffalo ia dying out. I want our people
to wake up and go after these fellows It
aeems to me that this thing will do more
than anything that could have happened
to make anarchy more unpopular here than
ever, It makes me writhe to think that
there should be any place in this country
where such a apeech could be an acceptable
utterance, Yet there are euch places,
That was why the speech was made *

In the talk that went on in Auburn to-day
after the sentence imposed by the court
in Buffalo bad been carried out, views and
expressions similar to this were heard on
all sides, many of them emphasized by
tones and words’ expressive of intense
indignation. Czolgoaz might have evoked
pity as deluded and foolish, but he suc
ceeded at the last in precluding any euch
emotion, and aroused, instead, a revengeful
spirit toward hia kind, so that his dying
testimony may go far toward defeating
its own purpose,

Strangely enough, the physicians who
performed the autopsy to-day found that
apparently Crolgosz did not have a diseased
brain nor a diseased body to account for
his distorted intellect. Superficially, at
jeast, the brain had all the appearance of
health. The following summary of the
result of the autopsy was issued by thess
who performed and conducted it:

“The autopey was made by Mr. Edward
A. Spiteka of New York, under the tm-
mediate supervision and direction of Dr.
Carlos F, MeDonald of New York and Dr.
John Gerin, prison physician. The autopsy
occupied over three hours and embraced
a careful examination of ali the bodily
organs, including the brain. The ex-
amination revealed a perfectly healthy
siate of all the organs, including the brain.

| All of the physicians who attended the

exccution were present at the autopsy,
and ali concurred tn the findings of the
examiners.”

Drs. McDonald and Gerin and Mr,
Spitzka signed thelr names to this doce
ment, which made it appear that degen-
eracy is not a general condition to as
eepousal of anarchistio tenets. There may
be another lesson for Americans in this.

The assassin'’s last night among the
living was not an uneasy one, according
to the statements of Warden Mead, In-
dustrial Superintendent Hall, Dr, Gerla
and others. There was a report that the
condemned man had epent the night rest
lessly on his bed, talking a great deal te
himself, a report credited to a guard, but
denied by the principal authorities of the
prison, who assert that Czolgosa “aleps
like a baby” from 1 o'clock to 5:30, when
the warden, went to his cell, had him
awakened and read the death warrant to
him. Crolgoss arose from his bed and
liatened in a dull waY and dropped beck
when the reading was over. The warrant
was a8 follows,
