tereat” combinations that have lately be-
come so popular with railroads. The par-
ticular combination that has been the sub-

WOMAN PHYSICIAN'S SUICIDE.

Dr. Elizabeth A. Darby Shoots Fierself at
& Hotel in Providence.

Provipence, R. I., Jan. 2.—With a cry
of “Oh, lam going to end it all,” Dr. Eliza-
beth A. Darby, a lodger at the Narragansett
Hotel, sent a bullet into her brain, as she and
her female companion, Dr. Kate E. Flan-
agan, had just ended a conversation in their
room last night on the third floor of the
hotel. The woman left a note asking that
her body be sent to Bordentown, N. J., and
saying that despair led to the suicidal act.

On Dee. 15, Dr. Darby and Dr. Flanagan
registered at the Narragansett Hotel and
were assigned to a large room on the third
floor. Yesterday Dr. Darby paid a visit
to Boston, according to Dr. Flanagan, and

returned early last oxsning, During the early
part of the evening Miss Flanagan says that
she and her companion remained in the
room and talked on various subjects, Dr.
Darby being apparently in good spirits
and showing no signs of depression.

As near as Miss Fianagen can remerniber
it was about 10 o'clock, and she was busyin
when she hearc

 

herself about the room
Dr. Darby exclaim; “Oh, I am going to
end it all.” Almost instinetively, Miss

Flanagan said, she knew what was about
to happen, and she rushed toward the
door screaming for help. Before she had
gone far the sound of a shot rang out, and
turning she beheld the form of Dr. Darby
lying across her bed with a revolver be-
side her. The bullet passed through the
woman's brain.

Miss Darby was a native of Bordentown,
N. J., where her father and brother still
reside, Financial stringencies are be-
lieved to have Been responsible for the
deed. She was a graduate of the Woman's
Medical School at Baltimore. She was
32 years old

NEW YORK, FRIDAY, J

BRIGANDS FREE MISS STONE?

on Sept. 3, So Prisoners Have Been tn
Captivity Four Months to a Day.

VIENNA SOFIA

o

Spectal Cable Despatch to THE SUN

LONDON, Jan. 2.-A despatch to the Cen-
tral News from Vienna says it is reported
there from Sofia that Miss Stone, the ab-
ducted American missionary, has been re-
leased by her captors.

The Telegraph's Sofia correspondent
says that an unconfirmed rumor ia cur-
rent there to the effect that Misa Stone
and ‘er companion, Mme. Tsilka, were
released on Wednesday on Turkish ter-
ritory by their captors. Those who ne-
gotiated for their release consented to
the brigands’ stipulation that the ladies
should maintain absolute silence respect-
ing their captors. If this promise is broken
the brigands threaten to wreak vengeance
on the American missionary establish-
ment

WASHINGTON,

*°
«

Jan The State De-
partment to-day received advices from
the United States legation in Constanti-
nople that Miss Ellen H. Stone, the captive
American missionary, and her companion,
Mme. Tsilka, were alive and well
Dec, 28

An official of the State Department said

received of the reported release of Mins |

Stone. “I will sav,” he added, “that the
last word received to-day was favorable
to auch a result; that is, it was fairly reason-
able to conclude from what was telegraphed
that terms of release might be agreed
upon very soon, and it may be that this
has happened.”

Miss Stone was abducted by brigands
on Sept. 3, last, while travelling between
Bansho and Di;umao in the mountainous
country lying between Turkey and Bul-
garia

and Mme. Tsilka, the wife of a preacher
The death of the latter while in the brigands’
hands has been frequently reported and as
often denied. A report of Miss Stone's
death, about a month ago, caused great
anxiety, and was not proved false until
several days had passed

Miss Stone was born in Roxbury, Mass.,
and went out asa missionary of the Amer-
ican Board in 1878, It that it
was on account of her connection with the
American Board that the brigands selected
Miss Stone, as they counted on the mission-

is believed

ary association providing a ransom for her
reseue, This the board at first refused to
do, holding that the offer of a ransom would
be a bad precedent and endanger the lives
of all ite missionaries
The American Board laid matter
| of the abduction before President Roose-
velt, and one of bis first acts as President
was to set on foot plans for Mias Stone's
release. The diplomatic side of the matter
was not neglected, and strong representa-
tiens were made to the Governments of
Turkey and Bulgaria. Direct efforts look-
ing toward Miss Stone's release were in-
| trusted to the hands of Consul-General
Dickinson, at Constantinople, who, as a
diplomatic agent, went to Sofia and con-
ducted negotiations from there
On Sept. 27 Miko Stone got a letter through

the

to Consul Dicktason, saving that the brig-
ands demanded a ransom of $110,000

 

  

   

  
 

   

The American Beard adhered to its
«etermination not to pay a ransom for
its missionarv’s release until th early
vart of October On Oct. 2 the brigands
let it he known that they had fixed Oct. ‘
as the last dav on which a ransom we ld
he received, and on Oct. 4 the American
Board issued an ayy ) “to Christian
America® for contributions Three davs
later $52,000 had been contributed, whieh

Lonpon, Jan. 2.~ A despatch to a news
ageney from Berlin confirms the report
that Emperor William has requested that

his new yacht, which is being built in the

United States

WASHINGTON, Jan It was given out
at the White House to-night that an an-
would be made to-morrow
in regard to the reported intention of Kaiser
Wilhelm to ask Miss Alice Roosevelt, the
daughter of the President, to christen the
German imperial yacht, which is
built on Staten Island.

Officials of the White House declined to |

invitation had been re-

yesterday signified his intention of asking
Miss Roosevelt to act as sponsor for the

This invitation is taken by many in Wash-

intended to pay a graceful
to the daughter of the President, but also
to anawer in an emphatic way the reports

PERRYHOUSE SENT TOPPLING.

INTO WEST STREFT.

Bumps the Liberty Street Siip Pretty Hard
and Batters Half the Anctent Ferry-
house Askew--Police on Guard Lest
It Fall—Passer-by Hart in Smash.

The Jersey Central's new ferryboat
Lakewood bumped into her Liberty street
slip a little harder than usual last night,
with the result that she nearly landed her
passengers in Broadway instead of in West
street. Manhattan Island is pretty solid
and that stopped her. The ferryhouse
and fittings, which are ancient, did not
help much. Some parts of them are left.

The ferryboat hit the end of the slip
full in the centre, The impact drove the
heavy wooden bridge forward for nearly
half its length, piled up the flooring be-
yond it in a heap at the entrance, tore up
a strip of the paving of West street and
left that side of the antiquated ferryhouse
leaning over the street at an angle of 30
degrees. One man who was passing the
ferryhouse was injured. The passengers
on the ferryboat were lucky enough to
escape.

The Lakewood was on her 9:15 trip from
the Jersey side. She was then to have
tied up for the night in the slip which she
demolished. The police explain, that in-
stead of hitting the bulkhead as the pilot
intended shq@ should, the nose of the Lake-
wood just m@ssed it and bumped the bridge,
which didn't give, as the bulkhead would
have done. Some of those who wituessed
the accident say that the boat's engines
had only just begun te back when her head
crashed into the end of the bridge

There were about forty passengers onthe
Lakewood and most of them were outside
the cabin preparing to get off. Four bag-
gagemen who work on the Jersey side
were having a discussion on the deck near
the gate and some of the passengers were
when the crash came. It
hurled the baggagemen in a bunch on the

| deck and piled a few passengers on them

compliment |

} his hand and bruising himself badly

Those who kept their wits enough to look
ahead to find out where they were going,
saw what seemed to be the whole anti-
quated ferryhouse being literally pushed
ahead of the boat into West street

The ferry bridge, being made of heavy
timbers, wasn't injured, but it served as a
battering ram upon the rest of the ferry-

house, so that when the Lakewood got
through pushing most of the house was
out of kilter

The beams of the flooring were piled one
on another at the edge of the pavement
and far into the street
were torn up, The gate posts and gates
were left mere lumps of débris, and part
of the roof nearest the street carne down
on top of them

Just as the Lakewood started to plough
her way through the ferryhy Hubert
Gibson of Thirtyv-ninth street, Bavonne,
which the Jersey Central runs a few trains,
reached the gate on his way to the ticket
office Suddenly he thought the whole
ferrvhouse was going to fall en him.

A beam hit him in the side and he
thrown down in a heap of splinters, cutting
Iwo
policemen ran to his assistance and ex-
tricated him from the wreck, He was
taken into the ferrvhouse. Though an old

use

 

was

an ambulance, and took a cab to the home

of his son uptow: The police had an

idea that he was injured internally
Inside the ferryhouse people were shaken

up even more than were the wm the boat
The whole building was sent swaving as
if it would fall, they said. Some of them
went out and didn't go back As 8O00n AS

VAGUE RUMOR OF COPPER DEAL, |
|
A Story That Amalgamated Has Secured |

Calumet and Heela.

 

When the Amalgamated Copper Com-
pany began reducing the price of copper
after what had the appearance of a series
of bear attacks upon the stock of the com-
pany, it was predicted in tome quarters
that the result would be absorption by
the Amalgamated of its chief rivals in the
business. *

Accordingly, reports that it had absorbed
one company or another would not come
as a surprise. Coincidently with reports |
of the forming of a bull pool of $1,000,000 |
in Amalgamated Copper stock, came from
Boston yesterday a rumor that the direc-
tors of the Amalgamated company had

 

in” Calumet and Hecla.

It was added that the story was not
generally believed, that none of the Calu-
met and Hecla directors could be found
and that Thomas W, Lawson refused to |
discuss the report. In this city no one
could be found to confirm or contradict
it after the rumor arrived from Boston.

 

STAGE BLOW FLOORS ACTRESS.
“Villain” With Indian War Club InJjares
Miss Overton's Spine.

Mount Vernon, N. Y., Jan Miss |
Bessie Overton, who is playing the part of
Paul in “The Octoroon” at the opera house
in thiis city, was badly hurt last night while
on the stage. In the second act the villain
is supposed to kill Paul by striking him
on the head with an Indian war club
Eugene Ordway, who plays the part of
the villain, etruck a blow which he gauged
to fall just behind Miss Overton's head,
but he miscalculated, and the club hit Miss
Overton with a thud that was heard allover
the theatre

The girl fell and the audience broke into
applause at what they supposed was her
realistic acting. For several minutes Miss |

9.

 

realized that she was hurt. Then the |
curtain was rung down. At the close of
the performance Miss Overton was taken
to the home of Dr. George C. Weiss in a car-
riage, where it was found that the blow
had injured her spine and that she might |
he permanently incapacitated. The actor |
who struck Miss Overton is overcome with
grief.
