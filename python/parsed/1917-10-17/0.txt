Lonpon, Oct, 16.——The London Prize
Court has condemned wool valued at
$700,000 which was sent by Swedish
ships from) Buenos Ayres under consign-
ment to the Swedish army administra-
tion at Gothenburg. It was shown to
the satisfaction of the court that the
wool was not intended for the Swedish
army. No claim was filed by the army
administration in the case.

The wool was seized at Kirkwall last
May and June. Intercepted documents
had disclosed a clumsy plot to send the
wool to Germany. There {is nearly $1,-
000,000 worth of wool more which has
been setzed under similar circumstances
awaiting the decision of the Prize Court.

At the session of the Prize Court to-
day the Crown asked for the condemna-
tion of articles seized from passengers

on the Danish steamship Frederick VIIL.,
from New York to Copenhagen. The

two boxes, each containing $5,000

through the 6hip that the boxes had

his property. He claimed that the rub-

for a Swedish firm, and that the money
belonged to the Scandinavian American
Trading Company, of which he is presi-

| : Special Deepatch to Tae Scx.
WASHINGTON, Oct. 16.—The ‘Swediah
Legation is trying to bring pressure
to ‘bear on the American Government
to get Great Britain to turn over the
Swedish diplomatic pouches which, as
told exclusively in Tizz Sun to-day, are
being held at the British Embassy here,
following their selzure at Halifax. Hints
are being dropped of the possible re-
fusal of Swedish diplomats to continue
negotiations with the United States un-
less the pouches are turned over un-
opened to Swedish Minister Ekengren.
The pouches, in the form of a bulky
bag and six odd looking boxes, remain
with the seals of the Swedish Foreign
OMce unbroken. In them, according to
the Swedish officials, are the credentials
of Dr. Hjalmar Lundovohm, the special
Swedish envoy, authorizing him to take
up ‘important matters on behalf of his
Government with Food Administrator
, Hoover, a fact which is causing him
| great embarrassment.
| Efforts so far made by Minister
Fikengren have eucceeded only in ex-
pediting the torwarding of the pouches
to Washington, but have not solved the

ence of British officials.

would only he resorted to in extreme
circumstances,

| Intimations were received from Swe-

dish sources that Dr, Hjalmar Lundo-
| vohm would have to cable for new cre-
| dentials unless the pouches were se-
| cured.

| Mr. Ekengren made a late visit to the
| State Department to renew his pleas
| for the pouches.

j The explanation from State Depart-
i ment officials was necessarily guarded

| fringe on diplomatic information {m-
| parted to them by foreign representa-
i tives and not to attempt interpretation
| of the policy of uny foreign government.

| Britain Chiefly Concerned.

Tt was explained that primarily the
ease did not involve the United States
Jovernment officially, but concerned the
Government of Great Britain and the
Government of Sweden. Whatever as-
| sistance Mr. Ekengren had asked of the
| State Department was not commented
upon,

It was explained that the British in-
| tercepted the pouches at Hallfax after

the proved charges of Swedish duplicity
and bad faith.

It is explained that Sweden's diplo-
matic privileges so far as sending cipher
jeable messages are concerned are now
withdrawn by both Great Britain and
France. The Swedish Legation here, in
this respect, ts cut off from the Stock-
holm Foreign Office because the British

that they would have to break the seals
