SUICIDE LEFT A WARNING,

“Don't Light a Match,’ Salida Note Written
by G. W. Tice, Who Lost His Fortune

PLAINFIELD, N. J., Oct. 5. George W

 

”
Tice, at one time one of the wealthiest
men in Westfield, was found dead in the

| bathroom at his home on Dudley avenue

SS AS SS NS Me

last night by Mrs. Tice, who was attracted
to the room by the odor of gas. Her hus-
band was lying on the floor and the gas
was turned on, On the door was a paper
on which was written:

“Don't light a match,”

Dr. R. R. Sinclair, the family physician,
was summoned and he said that Mr. Tice
was dead,

Until a few years ago Mr. Tice was the
head of the big manufacturing concern of
Tice & Jacobs on Water street, New York.
Business reverses, however, caused him to
lore most of his fortune and he became
desapondent. He was obli to sell most
of his property at a sacrifice. A widow and
nine children survive him.

CHICAGO GETS THE ANTIQUE RUGS,

A. H. Revell & Co. Purchase the Entire
Collection Meant for the Darlington

Store.

Out of the loot of Pekin, when the allies
broke in, museums all over the world gath-
ered curios that save for the Boxer uprising
would probably have rested in the silence of
the Chinese temples for several hundred
years more, The big “Darlington Store” in
Brooklyn, that didn't happen, has been the
Pekin of American merchants, The tre-
mendovus collection of beautiful furniture,
china, porcelain, silke and every other sort
of rich merchandise got together fer the
huge Brooklyn department enterprise which
at the eleventh hour its promotera decided
not to open, has been distributed among the
retail establishments of New York and scat-
tered broadcast in a fortnight.

In this accumulation of expensive , stuff
from everywhere there were something like
$100,000 worth of Oriental rugs and carpets
imported specially for the Darlington Com-
pany.

While the other linea have been bought
up greedily this immense lot of Oriental
tes:iles has lingered, as the money involved
in ita purchase was great, Announcement
was made yesterday (hat the firm of Alexan-
der H. Revell & Co, of Chicago had purchased
the entire collection, anteques and new-
mades, Feraghans, Jooshaghans, Shirazes and
Caucasians, Mosque carpets, tent mata, tem-
ple hangings, prayer-rugs and grave-carpets,
and are going to make of it a rug holiday
for Michigan Boulevard and all the rest of
Cook County.

This ia not the firat time that the Revell
establishment has gone down deep in its
pockets to show Chicago what was the real
thing in ruas, At the time of the sale of
the John Kimberly Munford collection by
Silo at the Fifth Avenue Art Galleries there
was spirited bidding over a prayer-rug which
the author of “Oriental Rugs” valued at
$10,000, The top bid was Revells’, and the
rug, which was over 300 years old, went to
Chicago. A month later Mr. Munford bought
it back from Revell at an advance over the
price paid at Silo’s, and six months ago sold
it to a Crossus on the Pacific Const,

The Darlington collection has been shipped

 

from the city and will be dieplsyed by the
Revells to Chicago people this weok.— Adv.

Francia G. Landon for the Republicans
and Edward EF, Perkina for the Democrats,
have signed an agreement whic. dupli-

courage the use of money for improper

An old timer mourn-
the compact waa an-
nounced.

“This means a light vote thie fall,” he
said, “a very light vote, particularly in
the rooral deestricts.”

The new arrangement restricts the
amount of money to be placed in the field
by the organizations or their candidates
to $40 a district. Each party pledges
that no ®xpenditures of money or promise
of money ehall be made on election day
or prior to or after said election day for
the purpose of purchasing or influencing
votes, nor for any purpose other than the
legitimate expenditures for the organiza-
tion and educational work of the cam -
paign, All agreements in violation of
thia arrangement are by mutual consent
cancelled,

To enforce the law against bribery both
parties have arranged to offer a reward
of $100 in each election distriot for informa-
tion resulting in the arrest and conviction
of any person for bribery.

The compact was urged upon/ the two
parties by Isaac Wheaton, a member of
the Reform Clubin New York. Mr. Wheaton
lives in Dutchess county and is interested
in local affairs.

AHEARN HEARING ADJOURNED,

 

Gov. Hughes Coming to the City Tuesday to
Register From His New Homme.

ALBANY, Oct. 5.—Late this afternoon
Gov. Hughes adjourned the Ahearn’hearing
until 11:30 A. M. October 14. Ahearn's
counsel expects to close the defence in two
days time, so that the hearing may be
completed possibly by October 17.

Gov. Hughes will go to New York Tuea-
day morning for the purpose of registering
from hia new home in the Hotel Astor
and incidentally to help on election day
with hia vote his friend, Beverly R. Robin-
son, who has been nominated by the Re-
publicang in that district for the Assembly.

At the close of this afternoon's session
Nelson 8. Spencer, one of the attorneys
for the City Club, attempted to get in evi-
dence certain letters found in the office
of the Metropolitan Equipment and Supply
Company in support of the claim that the

company was an avenue through which |

the Manhattan Borough President's de-
partment was furnished with supplies at
extravagant. prices.

Gov. Hughes sustained Mr. Littleton's
objection, as the letters were not authenti-
cated, the Governor decidi: that they
would have to be proved. He referred
to the leniency of Mr. Littleton in not ob-
ecting to the Supply company vouchers

ing admiited, which otherwise would
have taken two weeks to prove, and said
Mr. Littleton’s good nature should not be
im; upon further.

t the conclusion of to-day's seasion
Gov. Hughes complimented counsel on
preserving the amenities on all occasions
during the long proceedings of the week.

RABIES A REAL DISEASE.
—
Savants of the Department of Agriculture

Say It May Be Generated by Germs.
Wasninoton, Oct. 5.— Experiments have
just been completed by savants of the
Department of Agriculture to determine
the contention that hydrophobia or rabies
was an imaginary disease purely and had
no germ basia. The conclusion reached
ia that rabies is a real disease which may
be generated by germs
The experiments were conducted at an
experimental station at Bethesda, Md.,
near Washington. The scientists claim
| to have successfully isolated the germ in
dogs supposed to have been infected. A
healthy horse bitten by a dog four months
| ago developed rabies last week at the sta-
| tion and battered himself to death. This
case showed the necessity of detaining a
bitten animal for a_ longer period than
| three months, the time ordinarily fixed
| by veterinarians for the development of
the disease. In every case of rabies inocu-
lated with a particle of the brain of a aup-
posed infected animal the subject has died,
while the animals from which the particlea
were taken have recovered.

WaSHINGTON, Oct. 5.—Mrs. Roosevelt,

Roosevelt spent the day to-day in the
country home of Surgeon-General Rixey,

Roosevelt and Quentin drove over, but
Mins Ethel rode her favorite mount. ‘They
left the White House just before noon
and returned in the early evening.

The Hell We Are,” Read a Sign Carried by

PRINCETON, N.J., Oct. 5.- Not since John
Topley resigned his job on the campus
police force to go into a different line of
work haa Princeton seen such
sights or heard such noises as it did to-day

There were a football game, a freshmaa-
sophomore baseball game and the senior
“peerade,”

The last was made up of s\ sdents in as
grotesque and weird costumos as ever
adorned undergrads. They bore signs
which evidently were aimed at a newly
launched policy here. One read:

“We're for the quad system--the bell we

FORD JURY DISAGREES.

Failure to Convict a San Frelsco Cor-
poration Lawyer of Bribery

San Francisco, Oct, 5. The jury in the
case of T. L. Ford, leading counsel of the
United Railroads, on trial for bribery, was
discharged to-day, having failed to reach
an agreement. After thirty ballots the
jury stood as it did at the outset, eight
for acquittal and four for conviction,

The case of the prosecution was weak
in that it did not connect Ford with the
giving of money to the Supervisors to in-
fluence their vote in favor of granting a
franchise to the United Railroada. The
prosecution expected to prove the actual
payment of money by Abe Ruef, but at the
eleventh hour Ruef refused to give the
testimony expected and declared that
any money he received was in the nature
of a legal fee and that nothing was said
about bribery of Supervisors,

This failure to convict is a blow to the
prosecution, Prosecutor Heney declared
that he will press another trial and is con-
fident of conviction.

Cuban Engineers Try to Get Back to Work
—May He Trouble Ahead.
Spectal Cable Despatch to Tuk Son.

Havana, Oct. 5.—The coming of strike
breakers from New York to work on the
railways has caused considerable feeling
and appeals have been made to the Gov-
ernment to prevent their landing,

While some of the engineers are asking
the companies to take them back in antici-
pation of defeat by the strike breakers,
most of the strikers are angry over the
coming of the latter and have entered
protests with Gov, Magoon against their
admittance, claiming that it is unlawful.

The Government will not prevent the
entrance of the strike breakers and trouble
is expected on Monday when they arrive.

Manager Orr of the United Railways com-
plained to Gov .Magoon to-night thata brake-
man who was sent from here to San Felipe,
twenty miles distant, was prevented by
strikers from entering the yards there and
compelled to return to Havana, Mr, Orr
says phe police gave him no protection,

The Bartlett men got in first and = prac-
tically filled the place. Some Whitney men
got in after a struggle, but most of them
were left outside and did not get inside
until after the Bartlett men had named
Daniel J. Kiley, chairman of the executive
committee of the Demnu..auc State come
mittee, to be chairman of the convention.
Indeed many of the Whitney delegates
couldn't get into the convention unti! after
George Fred Williams had read the Bartlett
platform and the Bartlett ticket had beea
practically completed,

The row began when John B. Feeney,
chairman of the State committee, waved
his gavel and announced that Mr. Kiley had
been nominated as chairman. William 8,
MeNary, Representative John A. Kelleher,
ex-Representative John A. Sullivan and a
dozen Whitney men proposed Joseph A.
Conry for chairman. Mr. Feeney gave no
heed to them, but went on with the Bart-
lett programme

The Whitney men dragged Mr. Coney
from a box, placed him upon a table in the
rear of the theatre and the Whitney dele
mates began doing business. Charles 8,
Hamlin read the Whitney platform and the
Whitney ticket was then nominated. All
this Was not accomplished without riotous
scenes. Hoarse cries of “Put him out!”
“Soak him!” “Punch in his face!” “Gouge
hiro!” and the profanest and wretchedest
oaths were heard amid the screeching and
wailings of a band playing “A Hot Time in
the Old Town To-night.”. There were cat-
calls, hisses and yells and howls. Canesand
umbrellas whizzed through the air and the
two sets of delegates roared unceasingly.

Few heard either Mr. Hamlin or Mr,
Williams read the platforms. Neiiher could
apeak above a whisper after he had finished.
The shouts and jeers led a gentie Came.
Lridge delegate to say:

“This is hell.”

It was ameélée, Itwasa riot. It wasa
mob. Compared to it a Tammany primary
was a Sunday school picnic. The police
force, although the reserves were out,
didn't interfere. One police captain said in
plaintive tones:

“It's anly some Democrats quarrelling;
why should we meddle wid 'em?”

After this scene had lasted for nearly
two hours the Bartlett men pulled out and
returned to their headquarters, the Haynes
House, where there were plenty of placards
reading, “DEMocRATS--I was defeated in
1906 ‘by Henry M. Whitney, William 8.
McNary, John A. Sullivan and Josiah
Quincy,

“JouNn B. Moran, candidate for Governor
in 1006.”

Gen, Bartlett, George Fred Williams,
Daniel Z, O. Connell, Mr. Feeney, Mr. Kiley
and most of the Bartlettites left town al-
most immediately. All proclaimed that
their ticket was regular, that it had been
nominated according to the election lawa
of the State and that the Whitney people
had no case to present to the ballot law
commission of the State. Thousands of
lithographs of Bartlett with the legend
“Principles va. Money” were flung about.
Gen, Bartlett had only a few words to say
