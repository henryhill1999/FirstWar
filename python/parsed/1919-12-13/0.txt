Burin, Dee. 12.—An optimistic view
of the German financial problem is
held by Mathias Erzberger, the Finance |
Minister, who points out in an inter- |
view with the correspondent of THE
Sty the need for consolidating foreign
demands upon Germany and for the
extension of long term credits. He
said:

“Onee our tax reforms are estab-
lished other financial questions can be
more easily answered; naturally, there-
fore, we are working with the greatest
energy upon this problem. With the |
fidating debt materially cut down by
direct taxes inflation will be appre-
clably reduced, =

“The exchange rate on marks places
us in a grave situation, but this isnot
so much a financial as an industrial
question. Germany had been so long |
isolated and in such need of foodstuffs |
and raw materials that it is small |
wonder the lifting of the blockade re- |
sulted in heavy imports, which natu- |
rally led to a tumbling exchange rate. |

Reform Work Partly Finished. |

“The chief task now is to create _

great demand for’ German money in
{ureign countries and to receive credits
with which to make imports. Our tax
veformg are making rapid progress, al-
though our financial needs are very great.
A satisfactory part of the reform work |
already has been finished. Under the |
two great tax laws now before the Na- |
tional Assembly, a tax on turnover and |
a one time national emergency tax, we
shall have, with the tax adopted at
Weimar, a new annual income of 7,800,-
(00,000 marks; to this must be added |
12,000,000,000 from the one time war |
taxes passed in July. These two one)
time taxes will help to cover the deficit
of 19,000,000,000 marks in the current
ear,

“The income, rental and interest tax |
now before the National Assembly is |
expected to yield more than 10,000,000,- |
}00 marks. This will meet our chief)
needs and only a few billions more will !
2 necessary,

old direct taxes will produce 16,000,- |
100,000 and indirect taxes 11,000,000,-
000,"

The tax question and organization are
‘he principal domestic problems before
the German Government. Herr Erzber-
ver, who generally is considered the}
inost powerful man in the Cabinet, has;
een since the armistice the chief ad-'
voeate of accepting peace on whatever;
terms so ag to bring back relatively nor- |
mal times and give the nation work, |

His tax reforms have made him gen- |
erally unpopular with the property own- |
ing classes because of his insistence |

that the burden of the restoration of the | make suitable provision for her if she} tion of the promise of political and|

horniel order shal! fall not on the work- |
érs, but on the well to do and on Bree |
erty. He has been subjected to venom-|
ous attacks, more so than any other)
person in public life in Germany, but}
despite this the former Catholic school |
teacher not only holds his office but has |
dominated the situation ever since he!
first formed a “Ddloc” with the Social-|
ists and forced through his no annexa- |
tion and no indemnity resolutions in the |

Reichstag in the summer of 1917.

|
Summary of Tax Plans.

Following is a, brief review of the eI
isting and projected tax laws of the
iovernment:

A one time tax upon the Increase in
property during the war, which is ex-}
pected to yield 10,000,000,000 marks. j

A specialetax on war profits, which is;
calculated to raise 2,000,000,000 marks.

4 10 per cent. population income tax, |
Including new provisions, to raise from |
4,000,000,000 to 8,000,000,000 marks, it,
heing impossible at this time to estl-
mate what German incomes will yield
when exchange has been stabilized.

The tax begins with an income of!
2.000 maks, allowing certain exemptions |
for dependents, with a rate of 5 per,
eent. On 3,000 marks the rate is 7
ner cent., 5,000 marks about 9 per cent.,
10.000 marks over 12 per cent., 20,000
fiarks nearly 18 per cent., 50,00) marks |
more than 26 per cent. and so on up|
until_an income of 1,000,000 marks will|
Ay 55 per cent This is the only one,
oc the new tax laws that hits heavily
t e workers, who now are paid from |
*,000 to 9,000 marks.

The one time emergency property tax
exempts 5,000 marks and is payabie in
irty years. It begins with 10 per
ent. on all amounts up to 50,000 marks. }

by the law such property thus paying
an income tax is exempted from the
personal property assessment.

“In view of this change in taxation
legislation the amount of property for-
merly subject to the assessment has been |
greatly reduced and Mr. Rockefeller ac-
cordingly filed his application to fave |
amount more |
nearly representing that part of his
property actually subject to this particu-|
lar assessment.” ° j

Jacob A. Cantor, president of the Tax
Board, added his denial to that from
Mr. Rockefeller's office that the applica
tion was due to a determination by him
to stand strictly on his rights in ali deal-
ings with the city administration be-!
cause of Mayor Hylan’s hostility to him
and to movements in which he has an in-
terest. :

Mr, Cantor said the city will not lose
through the reduction because It will re-
caive its proportionate share of the re-
celpts of the income tax.

If prophectes made by officials of the |

Soviet Russia within nine days. Harry
Weinberger, her lawyer, notified the}
Attorney-General’s office yesterday
that his client had decided to abandon
her fight against deportation.

From her Ellis Island cell she is-
sued a lengthy statement to the effect
that she has “no confidence in Ameri-

to waste their money in a futile fight |
in her behalf. |
She probably will leave this country
on the same boat with Alexander

to information received by her lawyer,
be a transport bound for Kronstadt.
From that port the pair will be given!
a safe conduct to Petrograd, the city |
which she left thirty-five years ago. |

Michael Mislig of 155 Hast Hightieth
street, former secretary of the Russian
Socialist Federation, all of whom have
refused to answer pertinent questions |
of the committee, The procedure will |
be through orders requiring the trio to
appear before a Justice of the Supreme}
Court early next week and show cause}
why they shall not be punished. It will

From testimony which Nuorteva gave
before ths committee in City Hall yester-
day it was learned that Willian Cc, Bul-

current intelligence of the American dele-
enation at the Peace Conference and who
gav+ sensational testimony before the |
Senate Committee on Foreign Relations |
regarding the private views of Secré-
tary Lansing, was on the mailing list aft
the Bolshevik propaganda bureau here. |

Nuerteva testified that he made the
acquaintance of Bullitt in March, 1919,
in the State Department at Washing-

Student Tells Facts.
‘estimony of a nineteen
sear old Columbia studient seized in
the Communist raids last month the!
committee acquired evidence that L. C.

recently, and a member of the Swedisa |
Parliament named Strom, who is acting |
as LEolshevik representative in =

holin, has also been in communication
with the Communist party here. They
also learned that the witness has seen
masses of Communist literature, which |
had been printed in Mexico City, lying
around the loca: headquarters of the
“Lett Wing” Socialists.

The witness was John Chabro of 1414
astern Parkway Brooklyn. He said
that his brother, Nathan Chabro, started |
for Russia last summer as courier of |
the Communist party, but that he was |
unable at first to get further than Swe-
den. When he was stranded in Stoek-
holm without funds he communicated
with A’s brother, who prevailed upon
Martens to send 2 cablegram to Strom
in the Communist’s behalf. John Cha-
bro testified that Martens also informed
him that he had sent “credentials” to
his brother, who later wrote that all of
hig difficulties had been overcome and
that the situation was “fine.” |

PLATFORM PLAN

Selieves Better Results Will
Yollow Pre-Convention
Discussion.

 

 

 

HE CONFERS WITH HAYS

 

Says Experience Demonstrates
Unsatisfactory Results of
Eleventh Hour Plan. |

 

Special Despatch to Tue Scy,

Wasuindron, Dec. 12.—Henry Cabot
Lodge (Mass.), Republican leader in
the Senate, expressed to-day his ap-
proval of the plan of the Republican
National Committee whereby the party
platform and policies shall be consid-
ered during the intervening months be-
tween now and the assembling of the
convention in Chicago rather than that
the platform be left to the eleventh
hour formulation of a group of hot,
tired and busy delegates.

While the plan has not received full
approbation, it is believed here that
Senator Lodge’s tempered indorsement
will go far toward subduing the unrest
which the creation of the special com-
mittee seemingly occasioned, The ex-
perience of the Massachusetts Senator
in platform making covers no fewer
than seven ‘national conventions, at two
of which he presided over the platform
committee as chairman and at two
others in which he presided over the
delierations of the convention itself.
Senator Lodge held a long conference
with Chairman Will H. Hays to-day,
after which he gave out the following
statement:

“I was very much interested in the
plan of the national committee to have
a committee appointed consisting of
twelve members of the national com-
mittee and forty or fifty outsiders who
represent different interests in the coun-
try, such as the farmers, labor, business,
&c., to consider different questions to be
dealt with in the resolutions adopted at
Chicago. I think that in this way a
great deal better results will be ob-
tained. It so happens that I have been
a member of seven national conventions.
I have presided over two of them and I
have served four times on the committee
on resolutions, twice as chairman of
that committee. I therefore have some
{mmediate and practical knowledge of
the making of declaration of principles
in a national convention.

“The committee on resolutions usually
sits two days and two nights continu-
ously. They work under great pres-
sure. They are overwhelmed with all
sorts of crude propositions hastily pre-
pared and with constant pressure from
local and special interests here and
there. The result is apt to be in many
respects, apart from the very leading is-
sues, a series of more or less confused
compromises, I think the question of
what is to go into a national platform
ought to have longer and better con-
sideration than this, and all those who
represent serious interests and who de-
sire some declaration in the platform
ought to have an opportunity to prepare
ft and bring it before the committee.
Resolutions prepared in this way woula
represent care and thought and prepara-
tion by the people who have given long
and especial consideration to the ques-
tions.”

Special Despatch to ‘Tite Sox.

Wasiinaton, Dec. 12.—Various Mw
gional railroad directors of the coun-
try have it in their power to modify
or lift the stringent fuel conservation
orders of the Railroad Administration
under instructions issued by Director-
General Hines to-day, The instruction
states that that fuel conservation is
still necessary, but that the regional
directors may use their discretion in
lifting the restraints on business as
fast as conditions in their regions war-
rant.

Discretion also is given regional di-
rectors in the restoration of passenger
train service cut off, as conditions
permit. General issues for lifting re-
strictions will not be issued for the
present at least.

Immediate action on rescinding the
coal restrictions was taken In several
sections of the country on receipt of
the order of Director-General Hines,
In Philadelphia L, W. Baldwin, region-

| a) director, announced that all restric-

tions on heat, light and power in the
Allegheny district were removed and
that complete passenger service on
the Pennsylvania Railroad, Eastern
lines, with the exception of the Broad-
way Limited, the twenty hour train
between New York and Chicago,
would be restored on Monday.

Pittsburg Ban Off To-day.

In Pittsburg the committee of the
Railroad Administration announced
that restrictions on the use of soft
coal would be raised to-morrow, while
the regional coal committee in Atlanta,
Ga., issued an order permitting the
freer use of coal in that section,

Fuel saving restrictions were can-
celled in Baltimore by C. W. Cal-
loway, regional director, and it was
announced there that Maryland cities
would return to normal conditions at
once. In Boston ©, N. Snider, chair-
man of the Eastern regional coal com-
mittee, modified orders restricting the
use of coal. The order permits stores
to use light, heat and power for eight
hours a day, but there must be an
actual reduction of 25 per cent. in the
amount used, James J. Storrow, New
England Fuel Administrator, estimates
that normal conditions will not be
restored in the northeastern States
until January 6.

Regulations to save coal in Tlinois#
were cancelled and normal conditions
are expected there by the first of the
week. Detroit «expects a 50 per cent,
resumption of industrial operations by
the first of the week.

In St. Louis B, F. Bush, the region-
ai director, announced that train ser-
vice would be restored to normal] at
midnight on Sundey. Mr, Bush ex-
pressed the opinion that the fuel situ-
ation would be normal in the St. Louis
district by Monday.

Statement by Director Hines,

Director-General Hines authorized the
following statement:

The conservation order of Decem-
ber 8, 1919, restricting the use of
heat, light and power generated or
produced from bitum{nous coal or
coke was issued to make uniform
in all parts of the country the re-
strictlons which had already been
adopted in many parts of the country
and to save coal and coke, Until the
production of bituminous coal be-
comes normal it ts vitally necessary
that It be conserved In every way
possible, and even after production
reaches normal it will be necessary
to continue to conserve coal because
of the loss In production of between
30,000,000 and 35,000,000 tons during
the coal strike. It is important,
therefore, that the public exercise
the greatest caution [n the consump-
tion of coal.

It being the desire to remove re-
strictions just as rapidly as possible,
the conservation order of December
8 has been modified to-day to permit
the resumption as conditions warrant
of the supplying of light, heat and
power restricted by this order, Coal
is now being moved and will con-
tinue to be moved from the East to
the West {n as large quantities as the
relative situation in the two sections,
permits.

The first increase in production
that has resulted from the termina.
tlon of the strike of the coal minera
has been tn the East, where already.
the bulk of the production was being
obtained. Conditions in the several
regions differ, and accordingly the
order of December 8 will be modl-
fied on recommendation of the
regional directors as their respective
situations may permit.

Regional directors have been in-
structed to-day to restore all train
service removed or curtailed because
of the strike situation as soon as the
general coal supply in their respec-
tive regions justifies in thelr judg-
ment doing so, subject to such excep-*
