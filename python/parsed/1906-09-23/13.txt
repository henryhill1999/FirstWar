80 HOURS ON CAPSIZED BOAT

TUTTLE'S CREW CLUNG TO THE
RIGGING, SEA WASHED.

 

Go Exhausted When the Seguranca Came
Up That They Could Not Move to Help
Themselves—One Steamer Had |Passed
Wreck Apparently Without Seeing It.

The Ward Line steamship Segurangca,
which arrived here yesterday from Cam-
peche and Havana, brought to port the
crew—Capt. George W. Heath and seven
men—of the schooner Charles F. Tuttle,
that wee wrecked off the coast of South
Carolina in the hurricane of Sunday and
Monday last.

Capt. Heath sailed from Charleston on
September 15 with a full cargo and deck-
load of lumber for New York. The storm
came up early the next morning, the wind
blowing from north-northeast. By dawn
of the 17th it had risen to its hurricane
force. The vessel was severely strained
by the pitching and her seams opened.
The steam pump was set to work, but the
water gained until there was five feet of

it in the hold ard then the crew was put |

to work at the hand pumps.

By 9:80 the decks were awash. The |
deckload was jettisoned. The wind mod- |
erated and blew from the southwest. The |

echooner waé headed inshore to make
smooth water if possible, but at midnight
tegan to go down by the head. She set-

t rapidly and the crew had to run aft |

in a hurry when the bow went under.

}
the schooner rolled on her beam ends with |

her port side under water and the crew
was compelled to scramble to the star-
board mizzen rigging.

The position of the men here was perilous
in the extreme. The masts lay almost on
the water and with every sea the seamen

were tossed about like straws. They had |
a hard time keeping their hold. re |

was no way of getting lines with which
to lash the men to the shrouds and for
sixty hours, without food or water, they
clung to the rigging while seas washed
over them almost every moment.

On Wednesday they saw a steamer
headed toward them, but it pussed a mile
away and apparently did not see the cap-
sized achooner, or else thought that no
living creatures could be clinging to it.

It was not until Thursday at 9:30 o’clock
that the Seguranca bore down to them

that time the men were all but lifeless.

»y were so cold and stiff from their long

exposure that they had to be lifted into

the small boat that put out to them from

the Seguranca. Warm drinks, food and

clothing were obtained for them, and the

ngers and crew made up a purse of

$30. which was turned over to the men
upon their arrival here yesterday.

The Charles F. Tuttle, 646 tons burden,
was owned by the Benedict Manson Marine
Pomeuay of New Haven. She was built

in 1886.
