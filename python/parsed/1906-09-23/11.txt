PINANCIAL AND COMMEROIAL.

’ SaTusDar, Sept. 22.
fe a dull market and on a relatively
Bmnited volume of trading to-day prices of
stocks declined. The attendance on the
foor of the Stock Exchange was emall and
the general market appeared to be one in
which little interest was taken by the rank
and file of speculators and which was
almost left to itself by the large holders of
stocks. Greater strength than has been
poticed for some time in the United States
Steel shares attracted attention and led
to rumors that the arrangements between
the Steel Corporation and the Great North-
exp Railway Company regarding the lease
of ore lands were once more on the point
of being settled. Elsewhere dealings in
@ke market were inconsequential. A fall
af 24. roints in Reading stock weakened
the market, perhaps, as much as anything
else, although the recession in the price of
the stock was small compared with its re-
eent advance. The weekly bank state-
ment was favorable, as it was almost cer-
tainly known that it would be, since it was
wel] understood that there would be made
ap in this week's statement the large actual
gein in cash that was not shown in last
week's return. Cash reserves of the banks
as they appeared in to-day’s exhibit increased
$12,220,500, and loans increased $7,400,000. The
gurplus reserve was enlarged by $7,700,000,
bringing the total surplus up to $11,316,000,
which is the largest surplus shown at this
Gate since 1901, with the exception of the
wo years 1903 and 1904, when business
throughout the country was at a much
lower ebb than it is now and demands for
money were comparatively slack. It cer-
tainly can be said that a review of the bank
condition and of stock market prices here
does not bear out the statements s0 com-
monly made that the current tightness in
money is due in chief degree to Wall Street
speculation. Bank loans here now are
$40,000,000 less than they were a year ago
at this time, and the average price of stocks
fs no higher than it was last January. It
may be true, so far as the loan account is
concerned, that our borrowings are now
larger in foreign countries than they
were twelve months since; but the fact
remains that by reason of the inoreasing
profits of business and the magnificent re-
gults of the season's harvests that gen-
eral credit position is much stronger than
{¢ was last year, and that more substantial
reasons exist than were formerly pre-
sented for a rise in prices of securities.
Bpeculation in stocks under such circum-
stances is unavoidable an! is as logical a
consequence of the state of the country’s
businesd as is the joy felt by the farmers
over their splendid crops or ‘the pleasure
jenced by stockholders in railway
and industrial corporations over the receipt
of an increased distribution upon their
ebares.

The feeling has become very strong in
the financial district, however, that it is
high time for the Secretary of the Treasury
to release some part of the $43,000,000 of
the people's money that has been with-
drawn from circulation by the Government
in the course of the present year and along
with nearly $30,000,000 more stands idle in
the Treasury vaults. The first of October
fs always a time when dividend payments
are heavy and when large amounts of
money have to be called in by the banks
to prepare for these disbursements. The
local trust companies must also on that
date place $10,000,000 more to their reserve
account in accord with the provision of
the State law, and there are a good many
instalments of payments on stock and
bond subscriptions that must then be mace.
The impression has strongly prevailed in
good quarters in the last few days that the
Sect etary of the Treasury would next week
come to the relief of the money market in
@ more positive way than he has heretofore
done. It is only to be hoped that the Secre-
tary will bear in mind in whatever action
he may take that it is the mercantile bor-
rowers in the large cities that are more
burt by the present money stringency than
anybody else, and that assistance, if it is
to be given to them at all, should be given
through the banks in the central reserve
gities. The bank statement to-day fur-
nished the only important item of news
presented for Wall Street's consideration.
Further engagements of gold for import
brought the amount of money disbursed
by the Sub-Treasuries here and in Boston
on this account to nearly $83,000,000. The
state of affairs in Cuba has not figured at
all of late as a stock market factor, nor has
any notable influence been exerted by
Gomestic political matters. It can hardly
be accounted as other than a favorable
circumstance, however, that all indications

t to the fact that in this State the party
of socialism is losing force.

Narrow Changes, Closing Easier —Weather
Favorabie—Leng Liquidation.

Wheat closed at a small decline owing
mainly to favorable weather at the North-
west and lower cables. The fluctuations were
narrow with the trading inactive. At tne
opening the tone was somewhat easier owing
to fair weather at the Northwest, bearish
cables, liberal estimated world’s shipments
and liquidation. Liverpool declined %d.;
Paris, & to 10 centimes, and Budapest, .2 kr.
The world’s shipments were estimated at
10,800,000 bush., against 10,352,000 last week
and 10,768,000 last year. Broomball reported

| good rains in the Punjaub, India, which will

inally 4c. lower. Closing prices as followe:
Open- High- Low- Clos- Pree,

liberate large quantities of wheat for export.
The indications point to an increase in the
visible supply on Monday.

But later on the tone became firmer. The
receipts at the Northwest contimued light and
the apparent intention of the spring whees
grower to market his crop slowly tends to
make the bears cautious, at least for the time
being, especially as the export trade Ras in-
creased of late. It is insisted by some of the
bulls that there is a steady inquiry for export,
and that the sales are not being fully reported.
Commission houses bought to some extent
and the Northwest was buying at Chicago.

There was an absence, however, of striking
developments in the trading, which, as already
intimated, was on a very moderate scale.
The short. interest is believed to have been

considerably reduced - the $y nee of late
and man ore disp to h aloof for
further developments, both aa re e the
export situation and the attitude of farmers
at_the Northwest.

tude is much of a factor in pri

for Eur to draw upon. It thus appears
the holding of wheat has dangers to t
price aa well as probabilities in ita favor.”
Corn declined a fraction early in the da
owing to liquidation, larger receipts, bearis
pressure, favorable crop r rta and a lack
of support. Liverpool declined ‘% to ‘sd.
Chicago received 443 cars, including 277 of
contract grade. Some are enpectiag large
receipts shortly on the ground that farmers
hold more corn than usual as a result of a
large crop, a mild winter, an abundance of
oats and hay for feeding and small exports.
Oats were easier, though selling was held
in cheok by the fact that leading interests at
the West®seemed disposed to give support.
Yet the cash market was *; to Ic. lower and a
larger country movement is expected, wh

AD unexpected decline in Liverpool, favor-
able weather, selling for short acoount here
and across the water and an absence of any-
thing |.ke aggressive support caused some de-
cline. Bears predict a gradual fall of prices
owing to the fact that the weather is gener-
ally favorable and that speculation is dull,
and they maintain that thecrop is likely to be
more than ample for all requirements. They
also loc k for an increase in receipts this week.
The bull points are small receipts, recent de-
terioration im the crop, comparatively light
world’s stocks, evidences;that the South is
beginning to hold back cotton for higher
prices, and the worldwide prosperity of the
cotton goods trade. But there is little or no
speculation and so the bullish eloquence goes
for nothing. Yet it must be coptessed that
in thetr efforts to depress the market of late
the bears have also met with indifferent suc-
cess. Pending some striking change in the

position among many to hold off for further
developments. Thecables were rather better

ered, but, on the other hand, there was more
or leas long liquidation and the receipts were
liberal, The arrivals at Rio and Santos thus
far this season are 1,140,000 bags more than
for the same time last year, and 697,000 larger
than two years ago. Toward the close prices
weakened under liquidation.

strong demands for steel inaking iron whieh

activity is witnessed in all channels of the
foundry iron consuming trades. [n 1 he tee)
trades makers are pushed to the !inits of

capacities, and few are the manifactorieg
which are not from three to four months
behind as to promised deliveries. As foundry
iron makers forecast the situation the littl

go higher. For contracts for deliveries
within the coming year higher prices are not
anticipated, As to steel making iron the opin.
ion is general among makers and consumers

Bar tron is in large demand and ample
supply at unchanged prices. Old material
is strong for whatsoever is consumed hy
steel workers. No. 1 railroad wrought scrap
is in enormous demand. Prices are strong
at $19@$19.50. An early advance is pre
dicted.

Coke is in larwe demand. A eécarcity of
prime foundry grades for early shipments
is reported at Northern and Southern ovens
Several important producers are not able
to work to full capacity because of scarcity
of labor and inability to secure cars. These
conditions are likely to be intensified. Prices
are firm and unchanged at $3.75 for best foun.
dry grades, and $2.85 to $3.20 for prime fur
nace grades.

In the steel trades conditions are normal
and prices are unchanged. In railroad ma-
terial a great deal of new business is coming
forward. In rails, cars, locomotives and
heavy machinery for railroad shops the de-
livery books for 1907 are filled well into the
second half. In structural steel makers
report @ great many important specifications
soon to shape into contracts for shipments
through the summer of the coming year.
The demand for steel billets is acute. A vear
ago the official price of bessemer billets at
Pittaburg was $21, with the market paving
$25. To-day the official price is $28. and pre-
miums are ruling that make the cost $32 and
upward.

COPPER, TIN AND LEAD.

Strong Position of All Base Metals—Um
precedented Demands for Copper.

The international kets developed ad-
vances in nearly all metals during the
past week. There is no base metal which
during the last twelvemonth has receded
to the prices held a year ago. Antimony
holds the record for the highest advance
within a year, present prices being almost
double the rates that ruled the last of
September, 1905. The word's copper mar-
keta went from strength to strength last
week under the impetus of increased demands
from consumers here and in a dozen Eu-
ropean countries. The abnormally low fig
ures set forth in the mid-month statistics of
the total visible supply in Europe induced
heavy buying in this market for account of
foreign consumers. The week among the
great copper producers represented in the
local market ended as it began, buoyant and
strong. The last sales of the week in very
large tonnages were as follows: Electrolytic,
December and January, 19\c. to 19%.« , net
New York; lake, November and December,
19\c. to 19%c. One sale of lake to_a large
amount for January shipment to England
was recorded at 19%c. Casting copper,
prime grades, for nearby shipment is scarce
and firm at 190. to 19%c. in large lots. Prime
casting copper for spot delivery commands
19%. to 20c. under the requirements of art
bronze and brass founders.

Pig tin is in good demand and sma!! supply
at 40c. to 40%c., spot. Pig lead quiet at 5%
@6c. spot; spelter is active at 6.3076 4%.,
antimony is in large demand at 25@25':*;
aluminum is in increasing demand at 56.
