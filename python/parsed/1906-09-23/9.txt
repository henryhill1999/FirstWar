ORESTES WINS THE REID CUP.

DEFEATS SOYA IN TWO RACES |

SAILED OUTSIDE.

 

Yachts Race in a Strong Easterly Wind |
—Boston Champion shows Her Quality
in All Points of *Sailing—Foul Com. |
mitted at Start but Restart Is Made.

The Orestes, champion 2? footer, of Boston |
captured the $500 cup offered by. Commodore |
D. G. Reid of the Atlantie Yacht Club. She
defeated the Soya, owned by W: A. BarstOw, |
in two races yesterday and after the vachts-
men returned to the clubhouse Mr. Barstow ;
and Clinton H. Crane, who sailed the Soya,
declared that the Orestes had won simply
because she was too fast. Mr. Crane said
the weather suited the Soya to perfection.

“It was just. what wa, wanted, but’ the |
Orestes slipped through the water in @ way
that was a surprise to all, and her performance
will give food for thought to all interested in
vacht racing and the workings of the present |
rule of measurement.”

Charles Francis Adams 2d, who came on
from Boston to sail the Orestes, was con-
gratulated by all and was well pleased with
his success, Starling Burgess, who designed |
the Orestes, was also heartily congratulated, |
and many yachtsmen remembered how, |
twenty-one years ago, his father, the late |
Edward Burgess, designed the Puritan,
which taught not only New Yorkers but |
yachtamen all over the, world a lesson which
will never be forgotten

The visitors returned to Beston last night.
They are well pleaged with the result of their |
visit end it is pleasing’ to them to realize that |
the Orestes ia the first boat of this class to have’!
been builtin Massachusetts waters, while there |
are several that have been biilt and raced |
arcund here

Two races

were sailed yesterday as the

astern men wanted to get back home. The
firat race was early in the morning. The
yachts went out to the starting line soon
aiter 9 o'clock, and as the wind was east
one-half south, the start was made from a
point two miles east of Coney Isinnd point

and the turning mark Was the buoy off Rocka- |

wav Inlet. ‘Ine lew was three and three-
quarters miles long and to windward and
the course was sailed twice over, or tifteen
miles in all The wind was quite fresh and
the sea ro'ih and the further the yachts
went to the east the rougher it got, ‘The

start was made at. 10.40 o'clock and the Soya,

well handled by Mr. Crane, crossed on the

weather quarter of the Orestes
The Boston boat soon showed

 

that she

was the better boat in the going of yester- 4,

dav. She at once forereached on the Soya |
and twenty minutes alter the start crossed |
that vacht’s bow From that time on the |

race Was a procession, with the Orestes get-
ting further and further ahead all the time
At the weather mark on the first round she |
had a lead of 1 minute 27 seconds. |

it was arun with spinnakers home. First
they were set to port,but a few minutes later
the spinnakers were (akep in. and set again |
on the other side, At the home mark the |
Orestes had increased her lead to 2 minutes |
» seconds, so that down the wind she had
gained 35 seconds,

On the second time turning to windward
the Orestes gained 1 minute 20 seconds. This,
too, was in a wind that was much atronger !
than at the start, and running home again |
for the second time the Orestes gained 32 |
She won the race by 3 minutes 50

After a short rest during which the yachts-
men warmed up with some lunch, the yachts
prepared for the se« ond race over a triangular
course. Each leg of this course ‘was two |
aod a half miles and the first,to windward; |
Was east one-half south. Just as they wére
approaching the line the Orestes on the port
tack fouled the Soya. The Orestes appeared |
to be in the wrong, but Mr. Crane_and. Mr.
Barstow at once hailed the committee and |
asked that the race be restarted. Mr. Adams |
had no objection and so they were sent off
again at 2:45 o'clock, and again the Soya was |
on the weather quarter of the Orestes

It was the same story again. The Boston
boat soon took the lead and at the weather |
mark led by 1 minute 19 seconds, With apin- |
nakers they ran to the next mark and before
the wind the Orestes gained 4 seconds. |
Pearhing hon the orestés added 16 seconds |
toher lead. By this tiing.the rajn was falling |
“heavily and it waa getting very thick oustide, |
ihe Orestes had proved beyond a doubt that
she was the better boat and ao the committee |

James Couzens, secretary treasurer of the Ford
Motor Company, visited all the principal Ford
branch stores and agencies east of the Mississipp!
in the last four weeks to discuss with the various
representatives the plans and the policy of the
company for the coming year. Mr. Couzens states
that no new agencies will be taken on for next sea-
son, as the company's facilities will be taxed to meet
the demands of Its old agenctes. The six cylinder

| touring car and the four cylinder runabout will

|

be the Ford leaders for 1007. Contrary to general
expectations, Mr. Couzens states that the Ford com
pany will not turn out an intermediate mode! this
season. Ford purposes manufacturing 1,000 of the
six cylinder touring caré, and this with the 10,000
runabouts now under course of construction con
etitutes a contract such 4s no other concern has
yet undertaken

of John G, Perrin. When the Lozier company
first began experimenting with
thelr former Toledo works in 1808 Mr, Perrin was
active in this department, and later received full
eharge of the designing and experimental work
wf the automobile department; and much of the
vueccess of the Lozier car has been due to Nis genius.
About one year ago he severed his connection with
the Lozier company, but has now retumed and is

Lafayette Markle, who is thoroughly familar
with metropolitan trade conditions, having been
previously located here tn connection with the
importation of foreign cars. It was principally
Cirough the enterprise of Mr. Markle that the
Corbin was chosen as the oficial car of the Vander
bilt race committee. Chairman Jefferson De Mont
Thompson was bighly pleased with its good work
during the strenuous week just past.

Ed FE. Robertson, general manager of the Hart-
ford Suspension Vomeeny, has received a letter from
Robert Graves, whose Mercedes will compete fn
the Vanderbilt cup race of October 6, in which
that well known automobilist speaks very highly
of twe Hartford shock absorbers which he has
used on his 40 herse-power Mercedes In the past
year. During that time he has run 7,000 miles with -
out an adjustment. Last week Mr. Graves had his
car overhauled and suggested to the nares
company that the shock absorbers be inspect
as well

A few years ago it was commen practice to be-
stow upon a motor car a oickname, such as Colum -
bia “Old Betsey,” Packard “Grey Wolf,” “Old Pa-
cific” and the like. The Glidden tour In one instance

best, following, as it does, the Mercedes construc
tion. This 1907 model embodies all the latest tn
novations that have been adopted by the forcign
makers. (Greater attention has also
body design. Here also the manufacturers closely
follow the latest foreign practice. The engine ts
rated at 45 horse power and can ¢asily make 60
miles an hour. The Chadwick agents also handie

Although the 1907 Aero car touring runabout
has only been on the market for a month, the com
pany has already made a doven minor improve

is as (rouble proof as possible. The touring run
about recently delivered to Cornellus Spencer
incorporates, for instance, such minor tmprove

usual wood and rubber combination and several
