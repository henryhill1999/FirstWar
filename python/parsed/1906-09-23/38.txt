‘rough an Interpreter--@pent the
Time Discussing the Question, De

c English Women Drink Whiskey?

A diplomatist recently accredited to the
p describes in the London 3

how he once secured an’ audience of his
Majesty and how he fared.

His object was to obtain the confirmation

of an already chosen Archbishop to a

onian see. For weeks he was
ghwarted by officials of the court, and then
for more weeks by the Sultan himaelf,
who professed to be too busy to see him.
However, at last he was really received,
and thie is what happened:

*flis Majesty awaited mein a emall but
richly furnished room. He stood in the
yniform of A Turkish Colonel by a low
gota, with his gloved left hand on the hilt
of hiseword. His rather long, melancholy
countenance Was curiously and subtly
lighted by a sort of good humored latent
nile. Even in his dark and usually sad
eyes the same strange laughter seemed

to lie. In them one could read either
scapresned merriment or irony.
he was foretasting the humor of the diplo-
matic transaction which was to follow,
and enjoying it quietly!
as ao te coke Sultan, who took
place alone on the sofa. About a yard
aaa on his left the accomplished drago-
man of the palace, Ibrahim Bey, occupied

g emall chair, and on my left was my own
bagowan Looking me straight in the face,
Abdul Hamid said a couple of phrases in
musical Turkish, speaking very low. Tbra-
him Nev bowed low, made the Temena'a
and began to trauslate. This he did afresh
each time the Sultan spoke, till, at the end
of the audience, he was quite weary with
the gvnnastic exercise. He began thus:

“His Majesty commands me to say how
much he regreta not having been able to
receive vou sooner. Jt was @ great an-
norance to him, as he had a subject he

tienlariv wished to discuss with you.
is Majesty is pleased to see you, and

gible of the honor conferred on -_S t' ue mare
go as my Government had char;

especially delighted to find his easiest
po ready to enter upon details.

*The Sultan bent his head slightly toward
me and murmured a few words with a
phintlike smile. ‘Before his Majesty
Pegins to talk about that matter he wishes to
know how long you were accredited to the
Court of St. James's.’

*This seemed a curious introduction to
the decision of the Archbishoprio in Mace-
donia question, but I replied that altogether
J had been about seven years in London.

‘Then you must be well acquainted with

English society?”
*T replied that in my modest or. I thought
J knew something of the English.

‘Very well! His Majesty is most anxious
fo have your opinion on English women.’

*In spite of ey lf I cried out ‘What?’

wif who in familiar with English society,
thinks of the ladies.’

“They are good and pretty,’ I answered
briefly, wondering what the qualities of
English *omen had to do with the case of
my unconsecrated Bishop.

“His Majesty says that when he was in
England he saw many beautiful women.’ I
opened my eyes wider and wider, and ven-
Peete a ‘Was his Majesty ever in

wt ertainly; I and my elder brother, Murad,
accompanied our uncle, Sultan Abdul
Aziz—Heaven rest his soul—to England to
visit Queen Victoria.” His Majesty wieeeed
these words scarcely above a whispe
boking very serious y ond sadly at the anor.
We were all silent for a minute, in defer-
ence to the recollections of his uncle and
brother awakened in his pious memory.

“Then, however, he broke into a long
speech, which Ibrahim rendered quickly
into French.

“His Majesty says that a tall and fine
officer was attached to his suite; a very
agreeable officer. His Majesty fancies
to have read or heard that this same officer
fell like a brave soldier on the battlefield
later. When we were in England the officer
ordered a bottle of Scotch w ichey ane soda
water to be placed on a little table fn the

anteroom, and made a speech to my brother

and me on the sovereign virtues of this
drink. He also tried to convince us that
it was impoasible that the Koran should
forbid its,use. When he found he could
not persuades us he concluded by trust-
ing thatethough we did not partake our-
ves we. would not take it ill if he did.’
“Evidently the Sultan understands French
perfectly, as Ibrahim Bey had no sooner
ended the translation of one phrase than
he began another, punctuating here and
there with audible laughter.
“His Majesty says that the officer often
Tepeated these tactics, At last, says his
Majesty, when my brother and T'saw bottle
after hottle of Scotch whiskey disappear
we said to ourselves, ‘The officer is a nice
fellow and a fine soldier; he is our friend,
and we are his friends. We are not
doing our duty as friends if we don’t tell
him that he drinks too much.’ So we re-
monstrated — him; and what was

which means that if he is allowed to do #0 he canhot

player finds he is @ card short he may look for tt,
and if he Onds it om the floor, or elsewhere, be can

of any player but dummy, he would be liable for any
revokes made while the card was not in bis band,
but the law distinctly says dummy is exempt from

next the turn of either adversary to lead

The meaning of the rule is to ‘eatede cases in
which it was the turn of neither adversary to lead
when the error occurred, but if the lead is withthe
adversary at the time, the penalty must be en-
forced from the player whose proper turn it ts
to lead.

FE. A. C.eeys: The score was 28 ali, and ft wae

If the dealer had one of dummy's cards, dummy
could not have had his right number, and if the
adversaries played against a dummy with a short
hand they should not complain when the error was
discovered and the deal was declared void. Had
it been the dealer who was certain of winning the
game he would have been compelled to ) abandon
the hand in the same way.

dice. A gets three tens on the first cast, Dut in
making his second cast with the two rema
dice he knocks one of bis tens off the table.
bets that only the two on the table count.

All three count, just as much as if one had been

knocked over by @ player's elbow.

Euchre. C. A. wants to 5 to know © exact mean-
ing of “sesiet” and if it deprives the player on the
dealer's right of the chance to say something.

To assist is to order your partner to take up the
trump, and is an intimation that it suits you better
than anything etee. When the dealer is “assisted”
he cannot play alone, but the player who assists
may play alone. In many of the big euchre tourna-
ments it is compulsory for an assisting hand to
play alone. As to what “say” the third hand could
have after an assist it is dificult to imagine. He
cannot play alone, except in railroad euchre, and
as all he can do is to order up he ought to be well
satisfied when he is sure that the trump will be taken
up, because if he can make his point he can aa
the dealer's side.

Pokes. R. D. R. says: A bets that tf he holds

this correct?

Yes.

F A picks up his han 4 and finds he has
ox aan 7 Tot a dead band or a mi edeal, and why?
A dead hand, because he picked up his cards
wiles counting them.

M. D. says: A asks s tor | three cards and turns
up the corner of each as !t comes to him. The
Sere neice Sr fhe saber have
Hoody et iB bets he must take the card, as he
looked at the other two.

A's looking at the first two cards would not affect
anything but an incorrect draw. Had the dealer
given him four cards, for instance, A's looking
at the first two would kill his hand. As !t is, A is
right.

JI.E.0°C says: Why y does tt make a difference th
showing only openers whether the opener has been
called or not?

It is not exactly whether or not he has been called,
Dut whether or not he has drawn cards. If A opens
and no one comes in against him, the amount he
puts up to open must be his, as no one bets against
it, and he might as well take it down again. In
fact, if he sald, “I open,” without putting up any
actual chips, and all the others threw up their cards,
it would be the same thing. It is therefore evident
that the opener has paid no more for the five cards
on which he opens than any other player at the
table has pald for his five cards. This being so,
all those who have paid just as much for their cards
as the opener has paid for his have a right t see all
those five cards, just as if they had called him by
betting an equal amount. But when a player puts
up to draw, and the opener draws also, it ts no
longer a question of equal payments, and if you
want to see how the opener draws to 46 handyou
must pey Ww see it. That is, you must cali the
amount he put sup, because when he put that up he
was betting on what he drew, or on the impression
his draw created, and that part of his game you
cannot see unless you pay t to see It.

FE. Cc. R. says: A opens, B comes tn and draws
one card, the 0) ae standing pat. B calls and
shows a flush. The mer lays down a bobtail
straight, showing | that e did not hold the openers
he thought he had. Does B win the pot?

Yes. A pot once oat, even if wrongly, just
be played for if any one comes in against the false

openers.

S. S. says: The last pot took aces to . A
opened, several came in, drew and bet, and om the
showdown {t was found that A had only kings
when he opened. What happens?

A is out of It; the best hand tn the final call wine.

G. 3. A. says: Taree men tn the call. A ways,
“Two pairs,” but does not show them. B says,
“Three aces,” and lays them on the tabie face up.
C says to B, “You win” and B scoops in the chips.
Then Asays, “Hold on, My two paissare all kings.”
Who gets the pot?-

If B is very polite and thinks he can pick out just
how much there was in it, he may hand it over
to A; but tf B chooses to stand on the ground that
there is no longer any pot, it having been mized
with his chips before A showed his hand, !t will
serve A right for not following the rules of the
game and showing bis hand to the table when he

is called.

THE SILENT OPINION.

 

What Men Think of Women and Women |

of Men.

From the Londan Spectator.

Most men have some silent opinions about
women and most women about men. There
are certain types of face, certain kinds of |
manner, certain methods of expression even,
for which many men and women are utterly
condemned in the minds of some of their
brothers and sisters. A disposition to dislike
certain types of face is at times so strong
as to suggest & previous existence.

We do not conte gay that all women with
such and such eyebrows are hard hearted
or that a man must be a charlatan if the
color of his eyes and hair contradict each
other; but we act continually upon notions
hardly less unreasonable. Educated men

with small vocabularies, for instance, are |

divided as a rule by clever women into fools
by birth and self-made fools, according to
whether their want of equipment be ascribed
to nature or to affectation.

To the first they are indifferent; to the latter
they have almost always a more or lesa active

dislike. Such men are often able, a fact |
their own sex invariably recognize. The |
man whose words are few and ill chosen ,

may bea man of prompt and reasoned action,
who having been brought up among the silént
wise or the garrulous silly deprecates the
waste of pains occasioned by the game of
talk. All mental athletics bore him just as
physica! athletics bore Others.

In the same way the fact that a man pre-
tends to know no more words than a savage
may be a matter of awkward though genuine
humility—a fear of pretending to a culture he
does not possessor an act of superficial con-
formity to a passing fashion among a amall
set. It may have no more to do with his real
mind than an ugly figure or an ill cut coat.
Circumstances will sometimes convince even
aclever woman of these facts so far asa given
man is concerned, but she will never alter her
silent opinion as to the generality.

Clever women are very hard on the men
they imagine to be fools. Able men, on the
other hand, are not at all hard on women they
knowtobe stupid. Where youthand beauty
are concerned the fact is easily understood;
but youth and beauty by no means explain the
whole of this phenomenon. Many men are
inclined to think that the kind of mental power
in women which we colloquially call brains
exists in inverse ratio to their common sense

and serves only to carry them with fatiguing j

rapidity through verbal fallacies to a false
conclusion.

TRAVELLING WITHOUT TIPS.

Result of an Experiment Made by a Ger-
man Hotel Keeper.
From the London Daily Mail.

Herr Grauer, a wealthy German hotel pro-
prietor, has carried out an experiment with
amusing results on the tipping custom. He
had a theory that all hotel employees should
be paida living wage and that tipping should
be abolished in hotels.

So he started, accompanied by his wife
and daughter (the Lausanne correspondent
writes) on a three weeks tour of the chief
German and Swiss hotels, determined not to
spend a sou on tips, in order to test his opin-
jons.

One week's experience of the consequences

 

was enough for his wife and daughter, who }

returned home disappointed and indignant
with Herr Graver for the discomfort and in-
sulte to which he had led them.

Mysterious hieroglyphics and secret signs—
known only to hotel employees--announced
the arrival of the Girauers—“the non-tippers”

the various resorts they visited. The
result Was always the same—nobody seemed
to want them.

At the stations they were told that the
particular hotel they wished to stay at was
full; the hotel omnibus was merely “waiting
for a few old clients to depart.” When they
insisted on entering the omnibus there was
nobody to carry their luggage and fPailway
porters had to be employed and paid. Ar-
riving at the hotel their heavy baggage was
unceremoniously thrown on the ground and
the boxes were damaged.

The maid took half an hour to answer the
bell, and the “hot water,” when it did arrive,
was cold, At table d'’hote the Grauers were
always served with the last portion. The
cohcierge “did not know” of any interesting
trips in the neighborhood, and was generally
“busy” when they descended to the hall,
Complaints to the manager Were futile.

Herr Grauer, who persevered with his
three week" tour to end end, sums up his ex-
periences as including the following:

Lost three trains; luggage unable to be
found.

Had four pairs of boots, two being new,
ruined; “cause unknown.”

Two suite of clothes, one dress, three
blouses mysteriously contracted ink stains.

Herr Grauer now bel.oves that tipping isa
