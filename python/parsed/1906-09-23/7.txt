GOSSIP OF TAR RACBTRACK.

SALVIDERE HAS WON SIX RACES
AND $48,955.

—

Belvidere Griding Has a Clear Title to

First Honora Among the Two-Year
> Olds—Dave Johnson Wins Big Wagers
f —The Bookmakers Have a Losing Day.

After Salvidere’s signal victory yesterday
there was no longer any doubt as to his right
to the title of champion. Not a turfman
could be found who did not join in the general
praise of this remarkable young racehorse.

“He is a second Hamburg,” said Dave
Johnson. “Who can beat him next year?
The way he collared De Mund when the latter
was at his bast showed us that Madden has
the best two-year-old that has been to the
races in many seasons.”

“I think Salvidere, barring Sysonby,” said
Senator McCarren, “is the best two-year-old
gince Hamburg’stime. He impressed me the
first time I saw him run and I have bet on
him in all of his races. He is not only a typi-
eal racehorse with a wonderful turn of speed,
but he is also a bulldog and has a heart of
steel. He will make «4 great three-year-old.”

"There should be no longer any donbt
about Salvidere’s real worth,” was the way

*his trainer, John E. Madden, put tt. “He
met the best two-year-olds in training and
beat thém easily. He has done all that has
been asked of him and is entitled to a rest.”

; T. Hitchcock, Jr., his owner, was greatly
‘pleased over the result of the race. Mr.
Hitchcock never beta, but his share of the
etakes was equal to a successful plunge, for
Balvidere picked up $13,475. The Belvidere
gelding, by the way, has won six straight

: paces, all stakes, for Mr. Hitchoock, his gross
winnings amounting to $48,955. His only

\, defeat was in his first start, when Fountain-
Blue took his measure by a short margin.

b Be was insured yesterday for $50,000.

. Salvidere was heavily played by the publto,
but the most extensively backed horse in the
| pace was De Mund, who caught 6 flood of
| Support from the clubhouse. Sydney Paget
| had @ $500 wager on Water Pearl, who made
his first appearance after a long rest. Ballot
was an added starter. The Junior Champion
Stakes was run in 1898 for the first time,

day’s race was worth 94,600 to the winner.

Dave Johnson did some heavy betting
yesterday with muc h success. He began

with a solid wager on Keator in the first
event. Then he plunged on Salvidere,
Running Water, Astronomer, Senator Clay
end James Crawford in succession, his com-
mission on’ Crawford alone amounting to
$20,000. It was said in the ring that he won
close to $60,000 on the day.

Nearly all of the books lost extensively.
Beginning With Keator’s success they were
busy paying off on favorites, six of them going
over the plate succesefiliy. Big money Was
dropped by the public on Hylas in the steeple-
chase, but Expansionist and Yama Christy
were both solidly backed straight and place.
In the Junior Champion Stakes Salvidere re-
mained steady at 6 to 5, with De Mund taken
both ways, so that the ring received a hard
blow. There was rnother setback for the
layers when Running Water won the Second
Special, as a ton of money was placed on the
Bir Dixon filly at odds on. It was the same
thing over again in the fifth, the weight of the
support accorded to Astronomer keeping his
price steady at ito% with Belle of Jessamine
@ strong second choice. Monterey was
backed down from 15 to 10 in this event, with
good backing for Proposer three ways

“Will Astronomer win?” asked Senator
McCarren of David Gideon.

“The betting would indicate that he ts a
cinch,” repHed Gideon, with a laugh. “The
colt has worked well and is in fine shape. He
ought to beat the others easily.”

As a matter of fact the plungers who got
aboard of this sure thing did not consult
/Gideon at all. They knew that Astronomer
\was a mudiark of rare quality, and for that
reason they believed that any price was good

4 enough to accept.

If the track had been dry Dave Johnson
and Frank Farrell would have had a tre-

‘ mendous wager on Senator Clay, who ran in

iz O. Appleby’s colors and was saddled by
Trainer Weir. But with heavy going to con-
tend with Johnson and Farrel! did not feel
@0 confident of success and consequently
did not bet on the Goldcrest colt so extensively
as they had intended. But Senator Clay
fairly revelled in the mud and won so easily
Renat Johnson and Farrell must have mentally
kked themselves. There was a solid play

nm H. P. Duryea's Prince Fortunatus, a full
her to the noted mudder, Major Dainger-

id, in thig event, his odds tumbling from
to 1 to 13 to 5, but the black colt was outrun.

James R. Keene's Philander, a Ben Brush
gelding, was taken both straight and place,
PA. b. Aste’s Herman, a colt by;Handsome-—
belie, was play ed down from 8 to 6 and
ot third money under Martin’s whip.
If Manana, a filly by Kilmarnock—Edith
Gray, had won the last race, the books would
have received a beautiful trimming. The
Ally opened at 20 to 1 hut was soon backed
down to 7. She was ridden by W. Doyle, a
nadian jockey, and had a lotof early speed.
Raut James Crawford, who went back in the
ting to 7 to &, ran over her. Lally, who
pened at 2, went up to 3, while John San-
Word's Rockstone, a supposed good thing,
was backed from 6 down to 4. This race was
n in a pouring rain, with plenty of lightning
Mashes through a thick gloom that made it
Aampoasible to distinguish the colors.
‘The Picket, winner of a Brooklyn Handicap,
eras sold at auction before the races yester-
y and was knocked down to William Lake-
for the paltry sum of $1,500. Fantastic,
two-year-old filly by Galore, went to Fred
*Burlew for $3,400. Barney Schreiber got
Prudential Girl, a recent winner, for $1,000.
Baymet, a colt by Handspring, went to F. A.
Clark for $1,200. Lakeland was the purchaser
of Rose of Gold, a filly by Top Gallant, for
$1,600. W.D. Millard got Mandarin for $2,100.
Duenna, of the Newcastle Stable’s string,
was knocked down to Frank McCabe for
$1,100. T. F. Coles, who formerly trained
for Get Rick Quick Ryan, secured Rob Roy
for $800.

Miller enjoyed something of a field day.
He rode Keator, Salvidere and Running Water
to victory and was third with Lally. Radtke
had a winner and two seconds and Martin
handled a winner and a third.

At least 4,000 persons did not reach the
track in time to see the first race. The Long
Island Railroad and the Brooklyn Rapid Tran-
sit were both blocked,so that it was not until
after the steepechase had been run that
the last batch of racegoers arrived on the
scene.

The stakes to be run at Oakland during
the winter meeting of the New California
Jockey Club will close on October 29. Blanks
can be obtained from C. H. Pettingill at the
Gravesend track.

FAST vee ae BY W.J. LEWIS.

Gelams Makes & Record s Record With Three Heats
in 2:06 1-4 at Columbus.

CouumBrs, Sept. 22.—W. J. Lewis, owned
in Wilkesbarre, Pa, and driven by Lester
Murphy of Columbus, trotted two miles,
each in 2:06%, yesterday and came back this
afternoon with one in the same notch. This
feat gave him victory over Oro and the world's
record for the fastest three heat race ever
won by a gelding. Rain about the middle
of the afternoon rendered the extremely
fast track unsafe for further racing. After
declaring off the free for all trot, the judges
ordered the money divided in the other races
as the horses stood. Lady May took two
heats in the 2:08 pace, doing her best in the
final one, when she made a record of 2:04\.
The winner was overlooked in the betting.

in the first heat.

Grayley Wins the Clab Scuiling
Championship.

The Harlem Rowing Club held its four-
teenth annual regatta and ladies’ day on the
Harlem River yesterday, and despite the
downpour which kept -up unoeasingly the
whole afternoon the programme was run
off in time. A feature of the fixture was
the single scull championship, but it was
robbed of some of its interest by the ab-
sence of Jack Nagle, J. J. Ryan and John
Schultz. The winner turned out to be L. W.
Grayley, who had previously won in the
junior gig event, and the same sculler stroked
Nagle’s crew to victory in the octipede sculls.
The octipede race was a stirring event,
but Gaiten, bow in Crew No. 3, broke his

oar about 100 yards from the Paik. and this

T. Hitcheock, Jr.'s, Salvidere, by Belvidere
—Sallie of Navarre, proved conclusively at
Gravésend yesterday that he is far and away
the best two-year-old of the, year. Salvidere
won the Junior Champion kes, at_ about
six furlongs, in the most impressive manner.
The track was heavy, but that made no dif-
ference to this remarkable youngster, who
was pronounced after the race the best two-
year-old, barring Sysonby, that has been
shown since the great Hamburg’s time. Sal-
videre picked up 124 pounds, meeting Paul
J. Rainey’s De Mund, Sydney Paget's Water
Pearl and James R. Keene's Ballot on even
terms, at the sais time conceding ten pounds
to August Belmont’s Okenite and seventeen
to H. P. Whitney’s Dinna Ken. He ruled
a steady favorite at 6 to 6, while De Mund
was heavily played from 5 down to 3. When
the gate went up De Mund, with his usual
great turn of speed Jrushed to the front, out
Salvidere, Miller up, was after him like &
flash. At the middle of the far turn, where
De Mund was travelling at top speed, Miller
made his run with the champion two-year-
old. In a jiffy Salvidere pan Be a yo the
fleet footed De Mund and him so
easily that the spectators uted out in

enthusiasm. De Mund was game, however,

MILLER SCULLS WELL.

New York A. C. Crack Finishes Third in
Handicap at Clab Regatta.

The annual club regatta of the New York
A. C. at Travers Island yesterday was com-
posed of four evente—a handicap singles,
doubles, centipede and eight shells. The
winged foot oarsmen had a miserable time
of it. ‘Rain came down in torrents during the
afternéon and there were sevéral narrow
escapes from swamping. A strongly touted
event was the six oared barge race between
two factions of the Huckleberry Indians,
but the tribe became afraid of the water and
the race was postponed to the first Saturday
in October. The races were about half a
mile in length.

A very close race occurred in the handicap
singles. Durando Miller, the crack young
souller, figured on the scratch mark and his
opponents had pretty stiff handicaps. For
a while Miller looked to be completely out of
the hunt, but in the last dozen strokes or so
he came with a great rush and was less than a
length behind Kusche, who had a start of
18 seconds. Hicken, who had 25 seconds, just
nosed in ahead of Miller in second place.

The centipede final was stubbornly fought
out, but the crew stroked by Kusche proved

a little better than that stroked by Dr. Keane

sod won by half a lon Less than a length
separated the eight oared crews at the
fin ish.

Consecutive Innings—All of the Eastern
Teams Fall by the Wayside in the West.

All of the Eastern teams of the American
League fell by the wayside in the West yes-
terday, the New Yorks getting « hard bump
in Chicago, The result pute the clans of
Griffith and Jones on exactly éven terme for
first place. Orth has pitched more games
this season than any other big league boxzman,
and he did not last the game through yester-
day, which fact calls attention to the
ous state of New York's pitching corps.
Barring the box weakness, the New Yorks are
the strongest team in the American League.
Their work has shown that. The Washing-
tons dropped two games to the Detroits, the
Clevelands shut out the Bostong, and 8t. Louis
Wou #o uphill! game from the makeshift
Philadelphia team. The results:

NEW HAVEN ROAD DIRECTORS.

 

 

Decision to Reduce the Number by Twe
—McCurdy Likely to Go.

New Haven, Sept. 22.—It was announced
this afternoon that the New Haven rail-
road's board of directors, at a meeting in
New York to-day, had voted to reduce the
number of directors from twenty-one to
nineteen. No information as to why the
board was cut down was given out. The
annual meeting of the stockholders will he
held in this city in October. It is believed
the two directors who will be dropped are
Richard A. McCurdy of New York, and
Percy R. Todd of this city, vice-president
of the road.

To Mr. Pedd there was voted a vacation
of a yearayearago. He had had no active
connection with the road since. There is
considerable feeling among many of the
stockholders against. Mr. McCurdy because
of his prominence in the insurance scanda!s
in New York. At the annual meeting it is
believed that two directors will be simply
dropped.
