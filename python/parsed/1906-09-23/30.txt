eson’s Raid Due to Misplaced Period
~Typhold Fever From & Cont Blankets
Insects and Weeds Which, Allowed an
Eotrance, Have Cost Enormous Sums.

gometimes the moet insignificant piece
of carelessness haa produced resulta which
have shaken continents, The misplace-
ment of a period was the cause, it te said;
of the Jameson raid and therefore indireotly
the cause.

When there seemed @ prospect of a con-
fict between the Boer Government and the
Uitlander population a letter was sent to
Dr. Jameson from Johannesburg, signed
by Col. Rhodes and others. ;

Acoording to the Grand Magagine the
eriginal contained the following sentence:

*We feel we are justified in taking stepe
to prevent the shedding of blood and to
insure the protection of our rights. It is
under these circumstances that we feel
oonstrained to call upon you to come to our
aid should disturbance arise here. Ciroum-
stances are so extreme that we cannot
avoid this step, 4c., &o.”

ln the message Dr, Jameson received
the full stop was placed after the word
aid,” instead of after “here.” Thus the
qualifying clause was cut off and became
apart of the next sentence, The Rhodesians
came instantly galloping across the frontier
on their il fated mission.

Carelessness pure and simple was the
cause of @ shocking catastrophe near St.
Petersburg during the army manouvres
four years ago. A sham fight was in prog-
reas, and an officer in command of a cavalry
regiment was ordered to movearound the
fank of the opposing force. Instead of
throwing out scoute and proceeding cau-
tiously he calmly trotted off in the direction
indicated and when the regiment reached
point where eome of the opposing force
were supposed to be awaiting them ordered
one squadron to charge.

The troops put spurs to their horses and
galloped furiously forward. The result was
appalling. The supposed enemy’s trenches
turned out to be a narrow but deep, swift
running river into which the whole squadron
rode at fullapeed. Men and horses crashed
over the almost vertical bank in a living
torrent. Of more than ninety dragoons
barely forty reached the opposite bank
bank alive.

One summer morning in July; 1008, the
peaceful little vill of Collo was
startied by a mage ooieet descenting ap-

tly from the skies with a terrific thud
Othe contre of the main street. A moment
after, witha shrieking whistle, came another
of these alarming visitants, which struck
the church roof, knocking a hole in it.

The terrified inhabitants fled for their
lives, pursued by shell after shell. Many
houses were struck, but by a miracle no one
was killed. Afterward it turned out that
this yorions a was the sous

and had been firing with a reckless dave.
gard of consequences.

In May, 1903, eleven 8 on board the
training ship Cornwall, lying off Purfleet,
were suddenly struck down by typhoid
fever, and inquiry proved that the out-
break was the result of their anes be-
tween fever infected blankets brought
from South Africa. In flat contravent
of army regulations no fewer than 200,000
blankets returned from service had been
sold to two dealers at the Cape at five cents
each, and of these 15,000 dozen wereshipped
back to London, those that were ted
being indiscriminately mixed with those
free from suspicion. Carelessness of this
ons in very truth a crime of the deep-
est dye.

While on the subject of infection, the
American town of St. Paul, Minn., got an
unpleasant scare two years ago. An
English doctor was travelling acroes from

San Francisco to New York when, at St.

Paul, a negro in charge of the travel-

ler's bag car ly mislaid it. -

CHARLES JAMIBON.
The reference is to the use of the upper jomt of
the thumb ae a convenient measute of aninch. As
that jot varies within a considerable range in
diferent individuals it is only a very rough approxt-
mati to’ measuring rod. Of two such units

Urement and the other rejected to serve asanex- |
Pression of all that is essentially inaccurate. -The |
foot bas become fixed, its standard beam ispreeerved
with the utmost care and the comparison of secon-
Gary standards therewith ea work of the most paine-
taking Sicety. Yet the thumb Inch, once of equal
euthority with the foot, has not only never been
standardized but is expressly reserved for the ex-
Pression of loose measurement. This in English
measurement. The French, however, in their
ecale before the wntroduction of the mathematical
met ©, refined the thumb joint to one-tweifth of the
standardized foot and jretatned for the inch thus
regularly ests bilshed the name of the thumb, pouce.

4 Can @ man after taking out the declaration of
intention to become a citizen of the United Stat
accept an ot in a foreign country, stil
clatming residence in the United States and betng
single apd without other home? é. 0
The declaration of intention confers no rights
of citizenship withip the United States or abroad.
Before an alien can acquire citizenship he muet
have resided here at least five years (Revised
Statutes 2165). This residence must be continuous
(Revised Statutes 2170). In its more restricted
meaning the word “residence” denotes a person's
habitual physical presence in a country or place.
In ite broad sense {t means a place of abode, selected
with the tntention of remaining permanently or
for an.indefinite period. Taken in its broader sense,
temporary absence from the United States, upon
business or pleasure, might not be Incompatible
with continued residence here. To determine
this {t would be proper to take into consideration
the length of the absence, its purpose and the ctir-
cumstances surrounding the case. So far Van
Dyne, “Citizenship of the United States,” 20. Many
courts have ruled adversely to the postulant in
Cases similar to that presented in this question.

What event is known as the battle of the kegs?
O. H. WaRNzgR,

The Incident was a elight event in the history
of the. British occupation of Philadelphia in the
Revolutionary War, which might never have been
remembered had it not served as a peg on which
to hang the verses of a patriotic satire by Francis
Hopkinson. The British had learned that the
Patriots were planning to blow up Philadelphia
by sending against the town @ fotilla of floating
mines. Aovordingly the Britieh cannon thundered
all day long at every chip of driftwood in the Dela-
ware.

Suoh feats did they perform that day
Against those wicked kegs, sir,

That years to come, if they get home,
They'll make their boasts and brags. e'r.

“The Little Done, the Vast Undone.’’
From the New Orleans Times-Democrat.
The little done sustaineth no man's soul;
It knows it for an atom of 6 whole,
A tiny atom scarce worth heaven's seeing,
Or man’s acclaim or c’en a moment's being;
And this although a fellow or a State
Hold the accomplished thing as truly great.

Nay, not the thing that’s done, but what's undone
Gives strength and comfort underneath the sun;
The poems that the poets never write,

Yet dream and drink through many asummer night,
The statues chiselied when the imperial mind
