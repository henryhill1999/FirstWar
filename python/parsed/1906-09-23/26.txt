IS IT NOT F OOLISH?

For any one to pass judgment upon something about which they know nothing? To say
this or that is impossible without first investigating?
18 IT NOT FOOLISH to believe hearsay statements concocted and circulated by
unscrupulous would-be competitors and their associates?
18 IT NOT FOOLISH to carry the slightest facial digad vantage al! through life when
it can F Sautrecls be corrected if you go to the right place?

      

Defects or deformities of the face and features, whether from birth, disease or accident,
can be auccesefully and permanently corrected within a few moments without trace or in-
convenience; so why tolerate the slightest imperfection, even for a singleday? HAVEA
PERFECT FACE and make the most of life.

Keep your BROW pleasant, and free froin uals frown-furrows
oi Your LIPS shapely and attractive; not too thick.
Your CHEEKS round and free from furrows or hollows,
Your NOSE straight and becoming.
Your NOSTRILS small, regular and equal: not big and unsightly.
Your EYES free from crowsfeet and baggy lids.
Your EARS regular and close to the head.
Your CHIN shapely and regular.
Your FACE without wrinkles, pimples, blemishes or age lines. It pays!

8UCH A FACE will help you along in the world, make friends and hold those who are
dear to you; bring you attention, courtesies and happiness in many ways. “The power of a
handsome face is greater than gold.

SAGGING CHEEKS is the one staring mark of advancing age, which absolutely
destroys all the beauty of contour of the Cheeks, Chin and Neck. In fact, positively ruins
the attractiveness of the entire face, resulting in repulsive excessive skin about the neck.
By Dr. Pratt's Improved Hethod the fallen or sagging Cheeks can be immediately lifted up

and permanently retained in their original and natural position as in youth. Is not this
atatement worth investigating? (The results are positive, immediate, permanent and abso-
lutely harmless. Book and particulars Free. If you cannot call, write.
