ej. Mr Harburger here?” a fat man at
the Coroners’ office in the Crim-

oy ite Building was asked by the re-
ter yesterday afternoon.

“Ho is busy just now,” was the answer.

“Mav | eo him for a few minutes?”

“Well, he is now having a conference.”

*W will he be through?”

"He way be through in five minutes, or
be tnay take an hour, I can’t tell.”

*Suppose 1 wait?”

*Yos, (uke a seat there inside.”

S the reporter waited for a quarter
of an hour or 89. Thon the door of the
private fice of the Coroner was opened
and forth i sued half a dozen Jewish looking

in
Oole ia Mr. Harburger,” said that fat
man at the desk, pointing to one of the men
that had just come out. A short, thick set
man in his shirt did not notice the reporter
but stood by the railing of the office with
bis back turned toward the callex,

*Mr Harburger, I presume?” and the
man turned his face toward the speaker.
Small, bu’ sharp eyes like those of an eagle
glowed in his face, as if he were surprised.

“May | see you for a few minutes?”

“Yes, certainly. Walk inside, please.”
Just then he was called upon to answer tele-
phone calls In the meantime an elderly
person walked in and eat down on a chair.

“Hallo, you are my friend,” addressed
Harburger to the newoomer from the tele-

phone booth
“What do you wish to see me for?” asked
the Coroner of the reporter.

“I wish to speak with you for a few min-
utes if you can spare your time.”

“Yes, ves, | can spare my time.”

“I represent a Japanese paper in Tokio,
and wich to interview you. But don’t you
want to sea that gentleman before you
give me the interview?”

Coroner Harburger motioned the reporter
to his private office. There the Coroner
came in after a minute or two, and ad-

dressed the interviewer:

*Do vou say you wish to interview me?”
asked the Coroner, as if to reassure himself
of the fact, and he seated himself on a re-
volving chair in the centre of the office.
Just at that time there was a knook at the
door. Two or three men entered, as they

were invited to doso by Coroner Harburger.
*Now what are you going to do; are you
going to take it down?”

When the reporter produced his note
book and a fountain pen Coroner Har-
burger said in a howling voioe:

“Now, put my name down; Julius Har-
burger, Coroner. You may say President
of the Coroners,” and he added, “Do you
want me to spell my name? J-u-l-i-u-s
H-ar-b--r-g-e-r.” Then he began to
harangue on the duties of a Coroner, bring-
ing in the historical facts about the office
of the Coroner.

“The office of the Coroner is the oldest
position in history. It originated in the
time of King Solomon. In England the
office of the Coroner was created in the time
of King Alfred VII., and was the mainstay
of English Government in dealing with
the cases of inquests, murders and ao forth.”

Here Coroner Harburger was interrupted
by one of the men in the office who at-
tempted to suggest something. But upon
being requested to continue o*-give his
own views the president of the
oontinued

“Besides, the English Coroner had king’s
and queen's jewelries in charge. His pres-
tige was a very great one; he was a poten-
tial power in England. men-
tioned the fact of existence of the Coroner
in one of his works; it is in Hamlet. Do
you remember, doctor?” he asked of one
of the men in the office, who was apparently
aphysician. Before the doctor answered,
the reporter butted in:

“Yes, I do remember.”

Then Coroner Harburger went on:

“Where the gravedigger buries the body
of Ophelia, Shakespeare pute in the mouth
of Hamlet the words ‘crowner’s inquest.’ ”

After these historical references were
over Coroner Harburger entered into the
recital of what he and his assistants have
douw,

“Dr. Phillip F. O'Hanlon. my assistant

ere present, has during a year conducted
6.000 otopres, a fact unprecedented in the
historv of the world.”

“In the world, did you gay?”

“Yes, inthe world,” answered the Coroner,
with an emphasis op the last word.
., ere in our city,” continued the Coroner,
“in this Borough of Manhattan. wa have
four Coroners, who divide their time of
the day among themselves, and ‘cover the
entir v of twenty-four hours in the office.
During cur term of office so far we have
inst!uled many reforms, such as estopping
the transfer of the dead or dying body
from one hospital to another. We have

laced a man in N. Y. Central Rail

ad and a motorman in a traction com-

pany, who have been implicated in the

Cases of death, under the heaviest bond,

killing of men and women t railroad

Mmpanies, e give spee trial to men
who cannot furnish Genes te acco oe

and of the State of New York.”

Here the Coroner was interrupted by
his assistants for immediate duties of
the office

“Just excuse me for a moment. Now,
I went as far as the Constitution of the

Taited States and of the State of New
ork

He repeated the last statement three
times uring the interval while he was
attending to his duties, so as to keep the

stor inected. Coroner Harburger, in

talking th his assistants, several times

Catarrhal ailments vary according to the season of the vear, and
it is thus that we have winter, spring, summer and autumn catarrh.
Catarrh of autumn is likely to assume a systemic character, that is,

the internal organs of the whole system become slightly affected, pro-
ducing a condition closely resembling chronic malaria.

Sometimes an epidemic of catarrhal fever will pervade a locality,

simuiating Typhoid fever.

It is sometimes difficult to distinguish

between catarrhal fever and the genuine Typhoid.

A congested condition of the bronchial tubes producing a cough,
with the usual symptoms of a cold, are frequently associated with
systemic catarrh. A cold or a cough during the autumn season has
special significance and Peruna should be promptly used according

to the directions to be found on each bottle.

Peruna is not only a

preventive, but a reliable remedy for systemic catarrh.

After Coroner Harburger, Phillip F.
O’Hanlon gave out the following state-
ment: a :

“An affection exists between the pups

to the office and familiar with the rules that
when death robs them of their own the

is their friend in the hour of distress. They
have the utmost faith in his promises.
There is a lot of common sight to see Cor-
oner Harburger console by his kindness
and good advice thirty people in a day.

“He is a man known intimately to hun-
dreds of people in the district of which he
is the leader, a man whose repenaten, for
honesty shines forth as one of the bright
stars of the poe organization of Tam-
many Hall, of which he is an active member,
amanready to defend the individualsagainst
merpsome trusts and monopolies, ready at
all times to make any oes of his per-
sonal position in his defence of the rights
of the humblest citizens, the cases which
pass from the millionaires to the paupers,
and among the former, whose bodies have
been for were the great railroad king,
W. H. Vanderbilt and Cornelius Vanderbilt.

“The system of medical examiner as it
exist in. Connecticut and Massachusetts,
P as it does power in the individual,
does not compare with the Coroner's jury
‘syatem in the State of New York. The

roner’s office is the poor man's court,

listen with equal patience and attention to
what the well read and the illiterate may

“I believe you have enough story,” asked
Dr. O'Hanlon.
“Yes, I think I have. But won't you
tell me when Mr. Harburger was elected?”
“He was elected in 1905, for four years
term of office. During his administration
all grafts have been utterly destroyed, with
no hope of resurrection.”

WOULDN'T LET AUTO PASS.

 

W. D. Warren of New York Fined #75 For
Striking a Chauffeur With a Whip.

Boston, Sept. 22.—William R, Warren,
a wealthy New York manufacturer, with a
summer home in Weston, was fined $75
in Waltham to-day for an assault with a
whip upon Robert W. Jameson, chauffeur
for ex-Congressman Samuel L. Powers of
Newton, in Weston on June 3. The testi-
mony showed that the Powers party was
riding in an automobile along a-road in
Weston when the defendant and his coach-
man in a buggy were overtaken. The
auto wished to pass and the chauffeur blew
his horn, but no attention was paid to this
notification to drive to one side.

Then the chauffeur opened the muffler
of the automohile in the expectation that
those in front would allow the auto to pase.
When this proved unavailing the auto-
mobile speeded up and passed the carriage
where the road was a trifle wider. When
the motor car went by Mr. Warren grabhed
his whip from the socket and struck the
chauffeur across the head and, shoulders.

In Gi" a reason for his action at the
time Mr. Warren eaid that he was exaspe--
ated at the noise made by the automobile.

all their doors and the restaurants served
nothing stronger than tea and coffee.

FIERCE FIRE RAGES NEAR STATE
STREET HOMES.

Tar Paper Factory Packed With Combuas
tibles Gives Firemen a Two Hour Fight
—Plight of a Lambkin—Old Van Rens
selaer House in Peril of Destructiena.

A fire which wasn’t seen until it had
gutted the building and burst through the
roof of a paper manufacturing plant at
16 Pearl street caused a panic last night in
three immigrants’ homes directly behind
in State street, and threatened for a time
to destroy the old Van Rensselaer mansion
at 7 State street, one of the oldest buildings
in the city. - Two alarms were sent in on
account of the threatening nature of the
blaze. 3

The fire apparently started on the fourth
floor of the six story paper factory, owned
by J. B. Prica, which was stored with a lot
of inflammable oils, tar paper and other
materials which burned fiercely. The build-
ing was equipped on all sides with iron
shutters, and when the blaze was first seen
it was shooting skyward from the hole it had
eaten through the two upper floors and the
roof .

Ten feet behind it was a two story ex-

tension used as,a kitchen and dining room
by the mission éf Our Lady of, the Rosary,
a home for Irish immigrant girls, in the
old Van Rensselaer mansion. Fifty girls,
half of whom arrived yesterday on the
steamship St. Louis, were at supper in the
dning room whena shower of sparks and
thick clouds of black smoke from burning
oil descending to the ground blew in at the
open windows.

Instantly the girls pushed aside their
chairs in terror and made for the stairs.
The Rev. Father Henry and his assistants,
Fathers Brosnan and Grogan, were hur-
riedly called, and succeeded in getting the
girls out into the hallway of the home and
on the wide piazza before they were hurt
in the crush. The clergymen thén saw that
if the walls of the building fell, as seemed
likely from the volume of flame from the
roof, they would crush in the extension
and part of the main building of the home.
All the valuable vestménts in the priests’
rooms and the sacred véssels in the chapel
on the first floor were removed to the piazza
at the risk of being damaged by rain.

The Rev. Father Urban Nageleisen, di-
rector of the Leo Haus, a home for German
immigrant girls at 6 State street, next door,
had lots of trouble quieting the alarm of
twenty-five girls in his home. All the women
insisted on carrying their trunks and lighter
baggage out into the street,and their pre-
caution really proved wise, because the
entire house was fi with water to
prevent harm from deseending sparks. At
the Lutheran Immigrant Home, at 8 State
street, also a small sized scare was on for
a time.

When Andrew Nealon, a watchman on a
new building being erected in State street
first saw the flames at 7’o’clock he ar
the neighborhood, and with a number of
employees from a nearby livery stable
tried to force an entrance. While they
were working they heard piteous cries
from inside, which sounded human. They

nded away with clubs of all kinds, and

Chief Croker arrived the second alarm
as did the fireboats Ne# Yorker, Boody and
Hewitt. The latter stretched lines of hose
clear across the Bat and fought the fire
from the rear. The firernen all worked at it
for two hours before it was quenched, and it
was voted one of the nee stubborn fires
the department has had to fight in the lower
end of the city for a long time. It worked
up and the firemen were driven back half

after an hour and a half of work that they
were able to gaim a footing on any one of

GRAFT IN SAN FRANCISCO.
ExeMayor Phelan Charges Mayor Schmitz
With Seeking It in Water Supply.

San Francisco, Sept. 22.--A lively con-
troversy is being carried on. between ex-
Mayor Phelan and Mayor Schmitz regard-
ing the water supply of San Francisco. Mr.
Phelan yesterday charged that the Mayor
and Supervisors were open to the charge of
grafting because they refused to adopt
the plan of securing a water supply from
the Tuolumne River in the Sierra Nevadas.
He charges that Secretary Hitchcock was
directly responsible for the destruction of
San Francisco, as he refused to grant per-
mission for the city to use the flood waters
of Tuolumne River, which isin the Yosemite

‘forest reserve.

Mayor Schmitz this morning came back
with a rambling statement in which he ao-

these bitter words:
