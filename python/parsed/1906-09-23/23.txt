TO THOSE WHO ARE

‘SHOOTING AND OUT-

DOOR LIFE GENER-
ALLY: s « s' @ €.,8

Are you a busy man? Too busy to spend
much time far from New York? Wouldn’t you
like to have a little summer place, a simpie but
tasteful Bungalow or Cottage, which you could
reach in an hour from New York, and where you
could enjoy excellent fishing, shore bird shooting
and delightful salt water bathing on a clean, sandy
beach; where, in fact, there is everything for those
who love the water—or the country—or who
like good things to eat, fresh from the farm or
from the sea? And where the cost will be but a
trifle. Wouldn’t you like sucha placeif the neigh-
bors were your own kind of city people, if it were
reached by a delightful sail in a magnificent boat,
as well as by train, and if it were not in a desolate
waste of sand, but in a fertile and productive
country ?

You CAN have just such a place. The one
and only place where it is possible is at KEANS-
BURG BEACH. The way to go about it is to
select your lots at once (there are not many left
and no time to lose). Prices $200 to $400 each.
Terms easy if you prefer. A neat Bungalow or °
Cottage can be built for a. few hundred dollers,
and can easily be ready for next season's use.. We
issue an illustrated booklet, telling. all about
KEANSBURG BEACH—send for it,

Jamaica Park

Everything favors a rapid increase in values here. Population in

In spite of the large number of new houses which hs.ve been built
in and around Jamaica, there’s not a house for rent anywhere.

All the great transportation improvements converge at Jamaica.

sirable resident‘al site. The place is beautifully developed. In the
centre of the park is a fresh water lake over two miles in length.
Building sites around this lake are as attractive as the Riverside of
New York.

» LOTS $400 AND UPWARD.

Jamaica Park is one block from the new “Power Place" station on the Rocka-
way Branch of the ‘Long Island Railroad. Electric trains are now being operated
onthisroad. Trolley lines to New York City Hall also passalongthe Park. 5-cent
