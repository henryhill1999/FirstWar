BANK LAWS PASS

Jfouso Approves Issuance of
Federal Reserve Notes in
Largo Denominations.

 

 

Special DespatcA to Tap Scx.

Wasninoron, April 24—Bills author-
{eing ‘smuance of Federal reserve notes
in large denominations and amending
the banking law im several other par-
ticulare were passed by the House to-
day. The legislation primarily is to au-
thorize the Federal Reserve Board to
group member banks of each district

into three divisions without the present
requirement that each group shall con-
tain as nearly as may be One-third of
the aggregate number of banks of the
district.

The committee report explains that
this “is to make as secure as possible a
fair and equal representation on the
G@irectorate of the Federal reserve banks
tor each group of banks, the large, the
medium and the small. The modification
will enable the Reserve Board to group
the banks {n a way to carry out better
the plain intent of the Federal reserve

Another amendment to the national
tanking laws extends the fiduciary ca-
pacities permitted to national banks to
include “guardians of estates, assignee,
receiver, committee of estates of
junaties” and such other fiduciary ca-
pacities as are given to State banke com-
geting with the national banks. A sepa-
rate record of fiduciary accounts and as-
gets is required. Amendments simplify-
ing the manner of selecting representa-
tives of member banks to participate in
election of reserve bank directorates
were also included in the bill.

The bill aleo authorises the issue of
Federal reserve notes in denominations
of $800, $1,000, $6,000 and $10,000 for
the accommodation mainly of banks. The
highest denomination now authorized is
$100 Larger notes, {t was argued, will
also tend to maintain larger gold re
serves in the financial centres.

Other amendments included in the
bills amending eections of the revised
etatutes Included ;

“The amendment to section 5,187 puts
a limitation upon the amount of money
that a national banking association may
hereafter invest in a bank or office build-
ing and site, the requirement being that
the amount so invested ehall not exceed
the paid in and unimpaired capital stock
of the association.

“The amendment to section 6,147 re-
quires a director of a national banking
association ¢ oqualify within sixty days
after election unless prevented on ac-
count of illness, absence or other good
cause approved by the Comptroller un-
der penalty of having his position as
director vacated and himself rendered
ineligible for reelection for the current
year.

“Section 5,172 is amended so as to
association to qualify within sixty days
to notes of issue to be engraved as
well as written and also omits the de-
nomination of three dollar bills from
the notes authorized to be issued under
this section.

“The amendment to section 6,223 re-
quires @ national banking’ association
which goes in liquidation to deposit
within ninety days instead of six months,
as at present, with the Treasurer of the
United States lawful money sufficient to
redeem all its outstanding circulation.

“The amendment to section 5,230 au-
thorizes the Comptroller of the Currency
upon the faliure of such association to
toake such deposit to sell sufficient of
its bonds after the prescribed time limit
to redeem its outstanding notes.”

FROST DAMAGE TO.
GRAIN IS LIMITED

Weather Is Causing Some Con-
cern, but Outlook Is Re
garded Favorably.

 

 

 

 

Sufficient time has elapsed since the
cold snap of about a week ago to en-
able authorities to guage the extent of
the damage to the crops. Nearly all of
the private reports that have come to

(hand indicated that the frosts in the

 

and other impediments; @ result of increased packing in the

northwestern parts of the country and
in the southern districts did only lim-
ited damage, principally to the early
fruit crops, to early corn in the South,
and also to the early cotton. In most
cases there will be replanting, eo that
@reas will not be entirely lost. The Gov-
ernment survey of weather conditions,
just iasued, te of virtually the~same
tenor as these private advices.
It was stated officially that vegetation
in the great plains States, the Missis-
eipp! Valley and the western Lake re-
gion was retarded by the recent cold
weather and there was ecattered dam-
age. In Colorado and adjacent States
Peaches and apricots were dam
Quite a little clover was winter killed
in Wisconsin, and there was aome win-
ter killing of wheat in the western Lake
region. The bulk of the corn damage
occured in Texas and Oklahoma, Arkan-
fas and parts of Kansas. It wae re-
ported in the weather bulletin that the
cotton belt needs warmer weather and
generally dry conditions for the present
to enable planting operations.

The planting of corn is somewhat be-
hind the average in the central States
but the soil fe in excellent condition. A
late etart in the corn crop naturally
makes for apprehension toward the ond
of the season over the possibility of
early frost. It is noteworthy that the
Government its quite optimistic as to
foil conditions throughout the moat im-
portant grain States, and specific men-
tion ig made of good subso!l moisture for
winter wheat and spring wheat. The
rains in Kansas last week have resulted
in the crop making excellent progress,
and some of the aréa that it was thought
necessary to abandon has ehown up
green.

Other details of the Government's
weather analysio are that spring wheat
{s nearly all seeded in North Dakota,
that the early crop is three or four
Inches high, and seeding of spring rye
and barley has also progressed well.
Winter rye continues to improve as a
whole, and oats, in common with the
other winter cropa, were retarded in
their growth by the cold spell, but no
especial injury was done.

Ohio's winter wheat crop does not
seem to be doing so well, and the corn
start ts a little behind the normal, but
none of the reports from there take a
real gloomy view of the crop outlook.
Qats are reported in fine condition.

Since the reports were sent to the
Government the weather has been more
favorable throughout the country, it
having turned warmer, with less precipi-
tation throughout Northern and South-
ern districts and !n the West generally,
although another moderate drop in tem-
perature oocurred in the Northwest yes-
terday, with promise of extension tu
Southern districts; furthermore, rains
are predicted for various parts of the
country, where warm and clear weather
would do the crops most good.

 
 

 
 

    
 

 

Chicage Grain Market.

Cricaco, April 24.—Planting delays
and a falling off in arrivals made the
corn market to-day show considerable
strength at times. The close was ner-
vous, at the same as yesterday's finish
to % higher with May $1.27%, and July
$1.49% to $1.49%. Oates lost a shade
to 1 cent net. In provisions the outcome
was unchanged to 45 cents lower.

Government advices that planting in
the chief sections of the corn belt had
been seriously interfered with by recent
low temperatures rallied the corn market
after an early advance had been more
than offset by sympathy with weakness
which developed in the oats trade. The
initial gains by corn were aacribed to an
evident decrease in the movement from
rural sources and to a acarcity of offer-
inga On the late upturn the principle
demand came from shorts. More favor-
able weather present and prospective
counted to some extent against any im-
portant lasting advance.

Refusal of exporters to follow up-
turns in the price of oats Inepired much
selling of that grain. Besides, messages
from the East regarding the domestic
distributing trade were very pessimistic
as to the outlook for new buying in
the next fortnight.

Mark IL. Requa Announces
Jobbers Are to Be Licensed
Hereafter.

 

Mark L. Requa, director of the off df- ||

vision of the United States Fuel Admin-
fetration, has decided to extend the
licensing of o!l jobbers, according to a
statement issued yesterday from his
New York headquarters, 43 Broadway.
Thie decision was reached following con-
ferences with members of the Petroleum
War Service Committee and representa.
tives of the Jobbing interests. A sub-
committee representing the oll well eup-:
vily industry was also present.

The new rules and regulations govern-
ing the extension of licensing of ofl job-
bers are now being worked out and man-
ufacturers and distributers of oll well
supply products may be included in the
latest restrictions.

Mr. Requa stated that the committees
are making every effort to secure the
installation of additional storage factll-
tiles by the consumer, in view of having
as much of thie storage aa possible filled
between now and next fall, in order to
anticipate and prevent if possible the
unsatisfactory conditions that existed
last winter.

It developed at the conference with
the of] well supply committee that it
will be necessary to secure a larger
allotment of plates for the ofl well fn-
dustry for the manufacture of boilers, of
which there is a scareity threatening un-
less the manufacture ts stimulated,

UNITED LIGHT EARNINGS RISE.

Serplus of $509,013 im 1917) a
Gain of $1,533.

Operation of the United Light and
Railways Company in 1917 resulted tn
& surplus of $599,018, compared with
$597,480 for 1916,

Gross earnings increased §831.850
during the twelve montha, but larger
operating charges and interest almost
offset this gain.

Frank T. Hulswit, president, says the
grone of the subsidiaries showed a ma-
terlal increase in all departments, Sut
owing to the increased cost of materials
and labor, as well as larger general an@
Federal taxes, the net did not show a
preportionate expansion.”
