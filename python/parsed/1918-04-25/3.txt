Reporte received by the commercial
banks and trust companies committee
show that several hundred thousand ap-
plications for bonds of the third loan
are held by various financial institu.
tions in New York in expectation of
initial or complete payments by sub-
ecribers. The application bianks give
May 4 ae the Inet date on which the

yments may be made. Many people,

t. Mitchell said yesterday, are under
the impression that this is the date on
which the payments should be made, but
that fs not the fact.

In many parte of the city yesterday
celebrations were held by groups of
workers to mark the raising of indus-
trial honor flags won by them. In al-
most every case the workers were ad-
dressed by their employers, and where
the flag was not a ten star, or a 100
per cent one, the workers were urged
to keep at it until every one in that
particular place was the owner of one
of the third tesue of Liberty bonds. In
several places the ceremonies were elab-
orate, there being, In addition to the
epeaking, musical programmes.
