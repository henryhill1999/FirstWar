LUGGING YANKEES
NOSE OUT SENATORS

jocal Team Wins Its Firat
Polo Grounds Opening Since
1914, by & to 4,

 

 

 

fy FREDERICK G. LIEB,

For the first time since 1914, when
qarty McHale, now a Lieutenant in the
qwenty-second Regiment, downed the
tn mighty Athletics, the Yankees yes-
terday won a home opening on the Polo
grounds, Murderers’ Row, ae the clean-
yp lads in the Yankee batting order

uilling reputation and emote Doo Ayres
of the Washington pitching staff for
wyrteen bingles, At that {it took a
ight aqueese to beat the Senators, but
nearly New Vark lead offeet the effects
of a late Washington insurrection, and
the Yankees pulled through by a score
of 8 to 4.
tie defeat shoved the Washingtons
nto the pit of the American
anere they are likely to spend much of
the summer.

There were not as many folk out for
the Yankee debut of Miller Huggina,
Derrill Pratt, Ping Bodie and Truck
Hannah as had been expected. The
ect that the Yanks got flogged five
dmes in eight starte before opening at
heme may have put a little damper on
the enthusiasm. About 10,000, exclusive
of the Army and Navy guests, enjoyed
the unique spectacie of seeing the Yan-
xes win an opening game. The fact
that the Yankees did not {esue any invi-
‘tions to Miller Huggins’s Snaugural
also had ite effect, as many opening
crowds are padded by a large free list.

What the crowd lacked In size it made
up {n patriotism. Either that or the

larly the beauties from the Winter Gar-
den, are unusually good bond sellera
Sobecriptions for Liberty donds reached
$111,350, of which Col, Ruppert took
care of $63.000 worth.

Prior to the start of the game a com-
pany of regular infantrymen from Gov.
ernors Island and a battalion of Naval
Reserves from Pelham Bay paraded
around the fleld and stood at attention
while Managers Huggins and Griffith
raised Old Glory and the Yankee service
fag to the top of the centre field flag-
sole. The flag contained eleven stara
lt is the duty of Clark Griffith, the orig-
inal Yankee manager, to usher in all his
euccessors. He helped at the inaugura-
tions of Chase, Chance and Donovan be-
fora assitting at the Huggins celebra-
tion, and yesterday he suffered his first
defeat on one of these large occasions.

@rig.Gen. William A. Mann, com-
mander of the Department of the East,
threw out the first ball, as he did at the

himself this spring, knocked out a double
and two singles, But for a great one

have been a homer. ’

BROOKLYN OPENING
A GIANTS’ TRIUMPH

New York Bats Out Victory at
Coombs’s Expense in Eighth
Inning—Score, 6 to 2.

 

 

For seven innings’ at Ebbets Field
yesterday afternoon victory dangled be-
fore the eyes of the Dodgers like food
before a famished Tantajus, only to
vanish in a tornado of base hits by the
Giant invaders. When the Flatbush bat-
talion was aroused from its dream of
triumph the ecore was 6 to 2 in favor of
New York and Brooklyn had auffered
{ts seventh successive setback, while the
Giants had made it seven in a row.

Qld Jack Coombs teid the Giants
to four hits and one run in seven itn-
nings, but was bombarded for five hard
thumps and five runs in the eighth, los-
ing the game then and there. The vet-
eran remained in the game juat one in-
ning too much, and the result was bis
fifth successive defeat at the hands of
the McGraw clan. Previous to this rec-
ava nt beatings Coombs had registered

who attended the opening game were
rewarded by a eplenuid exhibition of
military drill by 1,000 trim looking
sailors from the Brooklyn Navy Yard
and by 600 drafted men who had re-
ported for duty at Fort Hamilton on
April 8. The satlors went through the
manual of arms to the accompaniment
of fife and drum time, and their per-
formance was strictly high class,

The official scorer of the Brooklyn
club made an effort early in the game
to keep track of the number of foul

boys in the upper stands, but after the
total passed fifty the scorer gave it up.

When the sailors and soldiers were all
comfortably seated Umpire Klem an-
nounced the batteries and the battle was
on. J. Coombe proceeded to dispose of
Young, Kauff and Burne on easy files in
quick succession,

Trouble With Umpire Kiem.

Following this cheering performance
Ole Olson opened by smashing a clean
eingle to left and O'Mara did the ac-
cepted thing and sacrificed, putting Ol-
son On second. Then trouble arose.
Daubert hit a grounder to Holke, who
toseed to Barnes at first in time to get
the runner. Olson had started for third
at the crack of the bat, and when he
saw the play at first was a hard one
he legged it for the plate. Barness

g0od and beat the runner by three feet,
but Klem asserted the runner was not
touched by the ball. McCarty vehe-
mently protested that Olson would have
a black and blue mark where he was
touched, but Klem was unmoved. Ex-
cept to notify McCarty that he would see
the remainder of the game from the
bench.

Fletcher argued with Klem and the
umpire yawned. Then McGraw reasoned
with Klem and the official suggested that
moving the clock forward would be of
little avail if so much valuable time was
wasted in useless argument,

MoGraw finally signalled to Bill Rari-
den, who succeeded McCarty. The run
scored. :

Myers followed with a grounder to
Fletcher, who threw into the centre of
Holke's glove. While the first sacker
was feeling about with his foot for the
bag the runner crossed {t. Holke ar-

incident until the fourth inning, when

He scored on an out at first, which

Pitcher Foster May Be Lauded by Yankees.

Some days. ago we were informed that the Yankees were after George
Foster, the pitcher traded by the Red Sox to the Reds for Dave Shean. Foster
is a holdout and demands $8,000 for the season. Now it appears that negotia-

Miller Huggins’s assistant, has just come back from a conference with Matty.
Connery does not say who the player wanted is but it is safe to take a chance
on Foster.

the Cincinnat! club should not balk at sending Foster here, particularly since
it is unwilling to-yield to his financial demands. Some time ago Huggins told
Matty that he would settle all claims if Russell Blackburne, the infielder
{bought from Toronto, was transferred to the Yanks, but Blackburne appears
to be a Red fixture at shortstop.
