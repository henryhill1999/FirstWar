London Housewives Ask
Lloyd George for Food

LONDON, Jan. 21.—A crowd of

fifty or sixty’ housewives
hailing from the poorer districts
gathered in front of the residence
of Premier Lloyd George this
afternoon. They said they
wanted to see the Premier and
ask him: “How long must we
stand in queues for food?”

Some of them said they had
been standing in line for many
hours and their patience was ex-
hausted. Attendants told them
Mr. Lloyd George was engaged,
so they said they would wait.

After waiting about an hour
several of the women went to the
House of Commons, where they
explained the matter to some of
the members, who said every-
thing possible would be done to
alleviate the situation. Return-
ing to the Premier's residence
they stood around for a time and

   

then all dispersed without having

seen the Premier.

WastttneTon, Jan, 21.-—-Partisanship,
dormant since the declaration of war

fanned into flame in the Senate to-day.

Within the period that has elapsed
since President Witson came to the
Capitol on an April evening and told
Congress the hour had struck beyond |
which America could maintain neutrality |
no longer, down to to-day, there have

been occasional outbursts of partisan
spirit There have been casual refer-
ences, sarcastic animadversions and

mild criticisms. To-day the vividly vis-
idle spirit of intense partisanship stalked
the Senate, and Senator Stone (Mo.) led
it there and placed it first on exhibition.

AS a result of Senator Stone's par-

the era of non-partisan
in the legislative work of
From now on it mas

debates will submerge the merits of
many of the issues in the wild seas of
partisan politics

Senator Stone delivered a speech whic

‘for the last fortyight he has been threat-

ening to deliver, and which many of
the more moderate of his party asso-
clates have urged him to postpone. In
it he attacked members of the Repub-

lican party. charging them with infidelity :

Special Cable Despatch to Tue Scx from the London Times
Copyright. 1918; al! rights reserved.

ONDON, Jan. 21.—The Times announces the resignation of Sir Ed- |:

ward Carson from the British War Cabinet as a result of the im-
minence of the Irish question within the Cabinet, both the Cabinet and
Sir Edward desiring to have a free hand in the went of Cabinet action
during or after the convention. ‘

Premier Lloyd George in a letter to King George has advised the
King to accept the resignation. Recently there has been a series of
clashes between the former Ulster leader and the Government.

Sir Edward has been a storm centre in the Ministry since he was
appointed on July 17. Previous to that time he had held for séme
months the post of First Lord of the Admiralty, where he also drew
the fire of a large section of the British press. One of the chief
facts cited against him as a Cabinet member was that the man who

organized the Ulster revolution should find a place in the Government.

Criticism by War Cabinet Advocate Called Unjustifiable

special Deapatch to Tur St»

WASHINGTON, Jan, 21. —President Wilson to-night replied to the
specch made hy Senator Chambertain, chairman of the Senate Afilitary
Committce and advocate of the bill for the creation of a War Cabinet, at the
Security League luncheon in New York on Saturday, Later Senator Cham-
berlnin anawered the President, defending the charge made in his New
York apecch. The President's announcement follows:

When the President's attention was called to the speech made by Senator
Chamberlain at a luncheon in New York on Saturday he immediately in-
quired of Senator Chamberlain whether he had been correctly reported,
and upon ascertaining from the Senator that he had been the President
felt it his duty to make the following statement:

Senator Chamberlain's statement as to the present inaction and inef-
fectiveness of the Government is an astonishing and absolutely unjustiflable
distortion of the truth. As a matter of fact the War Department has per-
formed a task «©: povtalleled magnitude and difficulty with extraordinary
promptness and <«‘) ieney. There have been delays and disappointments
and partial miscuri have been drawn into the
foreground and exaggerated by the investigations which have been in prog-
ress since the Congress assembled-—investigations which drew indispensable
officials from their commands and contributed a great deal to such delay
and confusion as had inevitably arisen, but hy comparison with what has
been accomplished these things, much as they were to be regretted, were
insignificant, and no mistake has been mace whieh has been repeated.

Nothing helpful or likely to speed or facilitate the war tasks of the

   

iges of plan, all of which

Government has come out of such criticism and investigation. I under-
stand that reorganizations ty legislation are to be proposed.-1 have not

been consulted about them and bave learned of them only at second hand---
but their proposal came after effective measures of reorganization had been
thoughtfully and maturely perfected, and inasmuch as these measures have
been the result of experience they are much more likely than any other to
be effective if the Congress w!!] but remove the few statutory obstacles of
rigid departmental organization which stand in their way.

The legislative proposals I have heard of would involve long additionei
delays and turn our experience into mere lost motion. My association and
constant conference with the Secretary of War have taught me to regard
him as one of the ablest public officials 1 have ever known. The country
will soon learn whether he or Its critics understand the business in hand.

To add, as Senator Chamberiain did, that there is inefflefency in every
department and bureau of the Government is to show such ignorance of
actual conditions as to make it impossible to attach any importance to bis
statement. IT am bound to infer that that statement sprang out of of; po-
sition to the Administration's whole poley rather than out of any serious
intention to reform its practice.

Commuters Catch

Trains by Chance

 
   

CHAOS prevailed for com-

muters and for railroad men
charged with operating suburban
service as well yesterday. The
former had no idea when a train
would arrive or depart, and the
latter were groping in the dark
as to the time when traffic would
be heaviest.

The whole situation being ex-
perimental, the result was that
some trains were badly over-
crowded and others were oper-
ated with plenty of empty seats.

Every read doing a large com-
muter business reported traffic
much heavier than had heen ex-
pected.

Adjustments of the ‘‘Monday
closing” schedules based on the
experience gained yesterday will
be made hereafter, so that it is
expected better service will be
ures on the nine succeeding

ondays.

Washington yesterday: ‘We must have

Ahearn characterized the coal situation
for the Borough of The Bronx as “des-—

It is but fair to etate, however, that
next Monday things may run more
smoothly and greater net results may be

shown, as unending confusion an4@ ab- ee

perience will not permit repeating.
Some of the developments yesterday
which tended to cast doubt upon the eue-
cess of a “blue Monday” in attaining |
the end desired when weighed againat
the vast disturbance of normal life were:
1. Less coal eame into New York cits
than in many days past At Aa-
ministrator Reeve Schley'’s «office
was estimated that less than 20,000
tors of anthracite had come in aw:
compared with a daily average @f
20,000 tons previously this month.

°. Freight congestion at local railroad
plers and sheds was tneressed be-
cause truckrien intsunderstood the
intent of the fuel conservation order
and few worked

3. Coal dealers felt no good effect from
the order. A representative of
Burns Broa. said: “Things are as
bad with us if not worse. Some oar
our yards might as well he closed
