Miniting in the fight between Ameri- -

can and Mexican troops at Carrizal,
Mexico, appeared to-night to have
been dissipated by the amicable note
from Gen. Carranza, presented during

the day by his Ambassador Designate |

here, Eliseo Arredondo.

The note proposes that the differ-
en between the Governments be
settied either by mediation or by di-
rect negotiations. It is remarkabie for
its brevity, its restrained and friendly

es

tone and for the absolute iack of any:

of the strong, even insolent language
which characterized the last two com-
munications from the de facto Govern-
ment. It treats as a closed incident

the exchange of unfriendly communi-
cations which brought war almost
Within sight.

It is belleved at both the Embassy
and the State Department that the re-
piy was personally dictated by Gen.
Carranza.

Text of the Note.

The note as transmitted by Mr. Ar-
Pedondo is as follows:

Wasutnoton, D. C., July 4, 1916.
My. Secretary:

| have the honor to transmit in
coltinuation the text of a note I have
just received from my Government,
with instructions to present it to your
Excellency:

Aly. Secretary:

Referring to the notes of June 2
@nd 25 last 1 have the honor to say
to your Excellency that the imme-
Giate release of the Carrizal prisoners
Was a further proof of tne sincerity
of the desires of this Government to
reach a pacific and satisfactory ar-
rangement of present difficulties. This
Government is anxious to solve the
Present conflict, and tt would be un-
just if its attitude were misinterpreted.

it was also the Mexican Government
that earnestly suggested a plan for
cantonments along the boundary line
Guting the conferences of Ciudad
Juarez and El Paso, This Government
is disposed now, as it has always
been, to seek an immediate solution
of two points which constitute
the true causes of the conflict between

the

  

) tie two countries, to wit:

c The American Government believes
Feasonably that the insecurity of its
frontier is a source of difficulty and
the Mexican Govertfment on its part
believes that the stay of American
troops on Mexican territory, aside from
being a trespass on the sovereignty of
Mexico, is the immediate cause of the

cts. Therefore the withdrawal of

‘rican troops, on one hand, and the

Protection of the frontier, on the other,

@re the two essential problems, the

Solution of whieh must be the direct-

jl ing object of the efforts of both Gov-
@riiments,

Ready for Quick Action.

The Mexican Government is willing
to consider in a quick and practical
Way, and prompted by a spirit of
concord, the remedies which should
be applied to the present situation.

Several Latin American countries
have offered their friendly mediation
to the Mexican Government and the
latter has accepted it in principle.
Therefore the Mexican Government
Only awaits information that the Gov-
ernment of the United States would
be disposed to accept this mediation
for th purpose mentioned above, or
Whetler it fs still of the belief that
the sume results may be attained by
Means of direct negotiations between
both Governments,

In the meantime this Government
Proposes to employ all efforts that may
be at its disposal to avoid the re-
Currence of new incidents which may
‘Onpoeate and aggravate the situa-
t At the same time it hopes that

inspectors were watching trains from the
East. In New Jersey several institu-
tions announced they would not receive
children until danger from the scourgs

Kr

 

in New York has passed.

The plans which Dr. Emerson and ois
staff have worked out for fighting the
disease involve two distinct phases.

First, the Health Commissioner wants
to have all possible attention and care
given to babies in the hospitals and the
best of supervision of the cases reported
in homes. That was the reason for ast-
ing for additional funds.

Thinks Disease Commanicable.

Second, he is determined to put into
effect every possible measure to prevent
the spread of the disease. He is work-
ing on the theory that the disease is

'communicable; that the germs live in
{the nose and are wafted about in dust,

The most important measure adopted
yesterday was the issuance of orders
by George H. Bell, Commissioner of

| Licenses, to all theatres and motion
| picture houses forbidding the admission
of children under 16 years. Dr, Emer-
son desires to keep children away from
closed places of assembly. He fears
that children may get the disease by
| breathing bad air.
| This order affects more than 800 play-
houses and motion picture theatres
! throughout the city. Commissioner Bell
and Assistant Commisioner Kaufmann
visited the East Side and parts of
Brooklyn yesterday, laying emphadgis on
the order. He said that any violation
would be followed by rescinding the
license.

Sunday schools and churches may be
affected. Dr. Emerson wrote fo every
pastor In the city yesterday calling at-
tention to the prevalence of the disease
and asking the co-operation of the
preachers. It is possible that Sunday
school sessions may be discontinued in
the infected districta, Dr. Emerson
mede it clear in his letter that the
Heaith Department expects each school
to have a doctor present at each session
to inspect children who attend, The or-
ders are to exclude any child who comes
from an Infected house.

To Inapect Excarsions.

Dr. Emerson sald that the department
will not interfere with the regular sum-

It is estifiated that after the year

described as an “estate tax,” will yield
about $54,000,000 in every twelvemonth
period. For the current year only
$17,000,000 is expected from this source.
It is explained that the initial yield will
be small owing to an expected delay in
putting this new law into operation.

the Ways and Means Committee voted |

 

 

on the measure. Two Republicans, Gard- |

voted for it. They justified their position
on the ground that the features of the
bill relating to taxation were warranted
on account of the unusual conditions con-
fronting the Government, and contended
that the proposal] to create a tariff com-

Committee Explaina Action,

The report points out that in framing
new tax law the committee decided
make the levy largely against In-
comes, inheritances and munitions, on the
theory that those concerned were beat
able to bear this additional burden. The

| report saye in part:
“Great Britain, before the European | Gen.

war, during her fiscal year ending
March 31, 1914, collected from income
taxes $230,000,000 and from ‘death

duties’ or inheritance taxes $132,000,000. | Minister of Militia,

Great Britain's total revenue was $620,-
000,000 and of this amount taxes upon
incomes and inheritances yielded $362,-
000,000, or 58 per cent. of the total. In
other words, Great Britain in times of
peace, collected 68 per cent. of her rev-

| enue from the taxation of incomes and
one-half |

inheritances. With less than
the population and wealth of the United
States the revenues from income and
inheritances, including ‘death duties,’ in
Great Britain were more than four times
the revenues derived from these sources
by the United States,”
