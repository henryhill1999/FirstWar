TREMENDOUS CROPS IN SIGHT!

FRANK VANDERLIP” REPORTS
ON HIS WESTERN TRIP.

 

  
  
  

 

  
 

western Banks Very Strong, He Learns,
and Able to Finance the Crop Move-
ment—Made Most of His Observations
From the Car Windows, He Explains.

Frank A. Vanderlip president of the
National City Bank, was in his office
yesterday after an absence of several
weeks, most of which he has spent in
hunting through Colorado, Idaho, and
Montana. Mr. V anderlip said that business
was not concerned with the tariff and that
he was glad it was out of the way.

“Business is so good,” he said, “that
we'll soon forget all about the tariff. The
tariff is largely a matter of personality
and locality.”

His trip was purely a vacation, Mr.
Vanderlip said, and was not concerned
with business in any way. But he had
yi been raised on a farm and he had noticed
from the car windows the remarkable
condition of the crops. In Nebraska he
was particularty interested, where corn
is the principal crop. The oats crop is
being harvested there now, he said.

In his talks with the farmers and rail-
road men throughout the West Mr.
Vanderlip said that he gathered only
one opinion about the crop, and that
was that it would be tremendous and
that they are making every effort to
handle it. The Western banks were very
strong, he thought, and would be able
in a large measure to finance the crop
movement.

24,000 TAILORS NOW OUT.

tailors reported yesterday that 1,500

Thirteen arrests of striking coat tailors

GOssiP OF WALL STREET.

y the stockholders of the Missouri
Pacific Reiwer will meet in St, Louis to go
through the preliminaries of executing a
plan of homogeneous financing. It is|
planned to wipe out the corporate existence |
of twelve subsidiary companies and to!
authorize against the system a blanket |
mortgage in exceas of $200,000,000, under |
which bonds are to be issued to retire the
present indebtedness of the system as fast
as possible. In order to execute this mort- |
gage it will be necessary to form a new
company with $240,000,000 capitalization,
as the laws of Missouri, under which the!
company is chartered, prohibit the creation | &
of bonded indebtedness in excess of capi- |
talization. Apparently the new financing |
is taken to be a development of favorable
import to the stock, traders buying on the
theory that the company will now receive
strong and continuous banking support,
while the road will also be benefited phys-
feally by large expenditures upon it.

Last week Chicago Great Western com-
mon sold at \% and as recently as Tuesday
it was as low as \%. Yesterday the stock |
opened at 4%, 2 points up from Wednee- |
day’s closing, or an advance of almost 100
per cent. between sales in this market. Yes- |
terday's high opening was due toa ‘sharp |
advance in the stock in the London market,
where it was very strong before the opening
here. After halfa dozen sales here the stock
sold up to 5%, at which price it showed
a gross profit of $500 on 100 shares purchased
at the low price last week, or 1100 per cent.
All of which goes to show that opportuni-
ties to make Wig profits quickly are still
around for those with nerve to take achance.

A woman with five full shares of Lacka-
wanna received yesterday in payment of
the extra dividend including the cash divi-
dend a check for $920, which was at the rate
of 184 per cent.

In congection with Lackawanna one of
the old timers recalled that 8. V. White sus-
tained one of the hardest reverses of a career
full of ups and downs while trying vainly
to run Lackawanna up from 83. After his
movement collapsed Mr. White insisted that
he was right in believing Lackawanna
to be worth more than its seUing price at
that time.. “I'll live to see the time,” he
declared emphatically, “when Lackawanna
sells at 125!" He still lives.

When former Gov. Odell sailed for Europe
the papers had it that Mr. Harriman had
sent for him to talk over the poliiical cam-
paign in this city. Some of Mr. Harriman’s
associates at the time expressed the opinion
| that the papers were wrong. If Mr. Harri-

man wanted to see Mr. Odell on politics they
said it probably had relation to highways
near Mr. Harriman’s home in Orange
county. The despatches from Newburgh
yesterday announcing the sale of a highway
to Mr. Harriman by a town board in Orange
county indicates that his friends here had
the correct idea.
