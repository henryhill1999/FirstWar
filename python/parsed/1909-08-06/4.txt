For the benefit of folks in the tall timber

Jet it be said that George Henry Payne
ja editor of the Bronx Republican, ex-
dramatic critic (right down here in Man-
pattan at that), ex-candidate for Congress,
ex~antidate for Assemblyman, and-
after his party last night especially—
the most pop'lar man in the Thirty-fifth
lassembly district, which is in The Bronz,
which is up above the Arrowhead Inn,
which is above the Abbey, and just south
of Woodmansten—which is as far as an
gutomobile may go.
. Every year George Henry entertains
The Bronx. Dancing and games are
indulged in and flashlights are taken,
after which a light repast is served until
a late hour.

The Bronx looks forward to these
annual events. In fact it is said that if
it were not for George nobody would live
in The Bronx. Last year George Henry
took all the politicians of the Thirty-
fifth down to a lot of box parties at the
“Three Twins” at the Herald Square
Theatre. lt was an enjoyable night for
one and all. Many of his guests of that
night couldn't get over the fact that the
old Aquarium that stood there the last
time they'd bin tuh town had been reno-
vated into the Herald Square.

Last week, however, George Henry
(his last name is Payne, as has been said)
‘decided that when he pulled his party
this year he would be original.

“I will bring Broadway up to The
Bronx,” he said. “It's their only chance
to see it.”

Wherefore he invited many sterling
voters like Raymond Hitchcock, Harry
Williams (who votes in Michigan), Seven
