day for the Aster Cups—Notable
Yachtsmen Meet Commodore Arthur
Curtiss James on Flagship Aloha.

Newport, R. I., Aug. 5.—The squadron
of the New York ‘Yacht Club formed here
thie evening. There are about a hundred
yachts in the harbor, but others are due to
arrive, and it is expected that the fleet
to-morrow morning, when the Astor cups
are to be sailed for, will be much larger.
A high easterly wind kicked up quite a sea
outside and every vessel arriving here
reporta rough weather and some had
to putinto other porte and wait for the
worst of the storm to blow over before

proceeding

This has meant that about half the squad-
fon ia in the harbor. The yachts that are
here are among the bes¢ that are in com-
mission. There are sev eral large steamers,
some of the best of the auxiliaries and «
racing fleet that cannot be beaten anywhere,
eo that with fair weather, winds not too
high or too low, the sport will be of such a
character that yachtsmen will jong talk
gbout the cruise of 1900.

One of the first to land in the morning
was former Commodore James D. Smith,
who arrived here on his auxiliary schooner
Viking Commodore Smith is the oldest of
the ex-commodores. He is looking well,
and greeted his old friends, He is going

erick G. Bourne, who is on the steamer

MASKETTE’S ALABAMA STAKES.

Meene’s Gtar Filly Beats Mies Kearnty
in the Mud’ at Saratoga.

Sanatooa, Aug. 5.—With the weather
threatening and the track deep in sloppy
mud James R. Keene's Maskette won the
$5,000 Alabama Stakes, for three-year-old
fillies, one mile and a furlong, to-day
without being let down. She opened at
1 to 5, but receded to 8 to 10 because of the
smart play on John E. Madden's palr,
Miss Kearney and Lady Bedford. H. P.
Whitney's Petticoat and C. L. Harrison's
Sun Dance, both mudders, were added
Starters. Scoville took Maskette to the
front as usual, and, packing 124 pounds,
she set a fast pace. Bun Dance, 50 to i,
rushed after the Keene filly and was the
runner up for more than three-quarters
of a mile, when she chucked it up. Then
V. Powers made a bold attempt to overhaul
Maskette with Mies Kearney, but the daugh-
ter of Disguise drew away easily, and had
such a sure thing of it as she neared the
wire that Scoville eased her up, 1o win by
