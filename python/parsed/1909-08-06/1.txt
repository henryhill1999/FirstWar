House a lively parliamentary struggle
was in progress on the floor over the dis-
position of the McCumber joint resolu-
tion and Chairman Payne was on his
feet in an effort to have the resolution
Preferred to the Ways and Means Com-
mittee, which he succeeded in having
done. Meanwhile the tariff bill was held
in the House until Representative Payne
had chloroformed the McCumber resolu-
tion, after which a procession was formed,
headed by Representative Wilson of
Chicago, chairman of the Committee on
Enrolled Bills, which started through the
corridors for the President's room. Sena-
tor Aldrich joined the procession en route
and members of the Conference Com-

arrived at the White House the rain

It was with a feeling of general satisfac-
J that Senators assembled this morning
at 10 o'clock to complete the work of
considering the tariff bill. Everybody
seemed tired out, and even had there
been an Gepousies to delay, the spirit
of fight had disappeared under the ener-
vati influence of August weather in
Washington.
, Benator Dolliver seemed the most
ga and he opened the discussion
with a vigorous’ condemnation of the
bill, denounctng it as a cheat and a de-

berate attempt to deceive the people.

Senator Elkins made a brief speech,
oot Senator Warren of Wyoming paid

compliments to the boot and shoe

ufacturers in New England who

made way with the 15 per cent. duty
on the hides of Western cattle. He fre-
quently referred to the boot and shoe in-
terests as a “second Boston tea party,” |
and declared that the whole
centred in a little colony east of
Hudson River, which might be detached |
at any time from the mainiand and float
away to the eastern hemisphere to find |
more congenial company. |

The concluding speeches in the debate
were by Senator Bailey and Senator
Aldrich. Mr. Bailey charged that the
conferees on the tariff bill had kept the
increa tax on tobacco in order to
make up the deficit in the revenues that
would he occasioned by cutting the tax
en corporations from 2 per cent. to 1 per
cent.

In closing the debate Senator Aldrich
defended the bill and ventured to predict
that the country would be prosperous
under it and that it would prove a pop-
ular measure. He said that he was not
moved by the diama! forebodings uttere’
% Senator from Texas and ctuer

mators. He said that he had heard
them before. He asserted again that the
bill reduced duties substantially and that
it fulfilled party pledges.

e roll call followed immediately on
conclusion of Mr. Aldrich's speech.
was attended by no particular incident
out of the ordinary. As soon as the

Tesult had been announced Senator Aldrich
called up the concurrent resolution,

g@ the wording of the boot and

shoe paragraph in accordnace with the

ent made with the Western Sen-

re by which they refrained from

ing out their threat to recommit

the bill because of alleged broken faith
on account of the free hides compact.

Senator Culberson offered his amend-
ment to the resolution placing cotton
bagging on the free list. On motion of
Mr. Aldrich it was promptly tabled by
& yote of 43 to 26.

The concurrent resolution was then
passed and sent to the House for action
there. Following that Senator McCum-
ber of North Dakota, who has heen com-
plaining because the conference commit-
tee omitted from the report an amend-
ment which he had put into the bill in the
Senate changing the drawback provi-
sion in order to meet a situation in the
milling industry in Northwestern States,
reintroduced his amendment in the form
of a joint resolution to change the tariff
act. The resolution provoked some dis-
cussion but was finally adopted and
passed after being amended to place
cotton bagging on the free list.

After the passage of the McCumber
resolution the Senate had nothing to do
except to mark time until the hour for
adjournment

the session, but some of the oldest mem-
bers of the House declared that it was the
first time they had ever seen the hands

of the clock advanced.
When the House convened at noon

there was nothing to do and a recess was

taken until half past 2. During the in-

terim most of the members went over | ®

to the north wing of the Capitol to wit-
ness the passage of the tariff bill at 2
o'clock. When the House reconvened
at 2:30 o'clock a message was received
from the Senate announcing the adop-
tion by that body of the conference re-
port on thes tariff bill. There was an
outburst of applause from the Republican
members. There was another interval
of waiting for the Senate to pass the con-
current resolution correcting the hides
schedule.

Representative Livingston of Georgia
moved that the House take a recess until
the Senate had passed the resolution, but
the House leaders assured him that the
passage of the resolution would be accom-
plished in a few minutes and that it would
expedite matters for the House to re-
main in session until the Senate had passed
the resolution.

At about half past 3 the Secretary of
the Senate notified the House that the
concurrent resolution correcting the hide
schedule of the tariff bill had been adopted.
Mr. Payne asked unaniinous consent,
which was granted, to begin the con-
sideration of the resolution immediately.
He made a short explanation of the scope
of the resolution. ‘After the debate had
continued for about three-quarters of an
hour Mr. Payne moved the previous
question and the resolution was a
to on a viva voce vote amid great =
plause from the Republican side of the
chamber.

The tariff bill was signed by S ker
Cannon at 4:18 o'clock and laid before
the House as a report from the Committee
on Enrolled Bills. There was another

riod of waiting, which lasted only a
ew minutes, however, when Speaker
Cannon announced the committee as-
signments for the present Corgress.

r. Payne presented a resolution pro-
viding for final adjournment at 6 P. M.
which was paowed enous, Messrs.
Payne of New York, Fordney of M
and Clark of Missouri were appoin to
meet a similiar committee from the Senate
to notify the President that Congress had
completed its work and was ready to
adjourn.

There was a tilt between Mr. Payne
and Mr. Livingston of Georgia when the
Senate resolution authorizing the yee
ing of 50,000 copies of the new tariff law
was laid before the House. Mr. Payne
asked unanimous consent for the im-
mediate consideration of the resolution.

“I object!” said Mr. Livingston.

ar well,” Mr. Payne retorted, “but
we will find a way of adopting the reso-

A hurried meeting of the Committee on
Printing, which had just been appointed,
was called, the Senate resolution as
referred to it and a few minutes later
Representative Cooper of Pennsylvania,
chairman of the committee, made a fa-
vorable report on the resolution, which
was adopted without further discussion.

Shortly after 5 o'clock the notification
committee returned to the House and Mr.

dent Taft and had been informed that he
did not desire to send any further com-
munications to Congress, There was
nothing more to do but await the hour of
6 o'clock, when final adjournment was to

SOLDIERS STOOD\ INERT DUR-
ING BARCELONA CRISIS.

Then Anarchist Leaders Gave Free Rein
to Burning and Pillage—Causes of
Hatred of the Religious Orders—The
Moors Nearly Caught Gen. Marina.

Special Cable Despatches to THE SUN.

Lonpon, Aug. 6.—The Barcelona cor-
respondent of the Telegraph, reviewing
the events of the last week, says that at
first the authorities had scarcely eight
hundred soldiers and an_ insufficient
number of civil guards. The gendarmes
were weakened by subdivisions, but
made immediate use of their arms. —

Soldiers later entered into action.
Civil guards were at the head of each
group of soldiers. The latter were re-
ceived with applause and cries of “Long
live the army!” The troops were uncer-
tain. When they approached the rioters
|the latter cried: “This demonstration
i for peace is in your favor. We do not
i : .
}want you to go to die in Africa. The
| war was brought about by the mine pro-
| prietors, not the nation.”
The demonstrators Were seen to offer
| cigarettes to the soldiers. The latter did
h the rioters, but they
did not fight. They rather remained
inert. There was a tacit armistice with
the _—revolutionists. Companies and
| squads silently obeyed all orders except
the last supreme order to fire. They car-
| ried out evolutions and occupied strategic
| points, but then remained motionless
Without replying to the friendly words
f the revolutionists, without giving a
jsign of hearing the applause, y
watched the development of events. At
the order to fire some of the soldiers dis-
| charged their rifles [in the air. From
| that moment the situation became des-
|perate. The insurgents instantly under-
| stood that they were masters of the town,
that the barriers of the law had fallen
before them and that they could act with
impunity.
| fter the first taste of battle anda
|simulacrum of victory the fury of the
mob was turned against the religious
institutions. The hatred of the democ-
| racy against the clergy has been of long
standing because the latter are privileged,
jare exempt from taxation and possess
| enormous wealth. In Barcelona partiou-
| larly the convents have multiplied in an
extraordinary way in the last fifteen

the Philippines and emigrated from
France took refuge in Barcelona, where
they crowded the best quarter of the
city. Moreover, many of them have
become industrial establishments, pro-
ducing everything from table linen to
liqueurs under conditions which their
exemption from taxes, which are very
heavy in Spain, renders very favorable.
Military action only became effective
on Thursday, when the first reenforce-
| ments arrived. On Thursday, Friday and

A despatch to the Telegraph from

TAFT SIGNS THE TARIFF BILL.

He Says It Is Not a Perfect Bill, but Is as
Geod as Could Be Expected.

WASHINGTON, Aug. 5.--President Taft
is pleased with the new tariff law, al-
though he says frankly that it is not a per-
fect measure. Perfection, he believes,
could not be attained in tariff legislation,
but he regards the new law as fulfilling
the party platform pledges and the as-
surances which he gave to the country
last year when he was a candidate for
the Presidency. In a statement given
out at the White House to-night the Presi-
dent said:

“I have signed the tariff bill because
I believe it to be the result of a sincere
effort on the part of the Republican party
to make a downward revision and to com-
ply with the promises of the platform as
they have been generally understood and
as I interpreted them in the campaign
before election.

“The bill is not a perfect tariff bill or a
complete compliance with the promises
made, strictly interpreted, but a fulfil-
ment free from criticism in respect to
asubject matter involving many schedules
and thousands of articles could not be
expected. It suffices to say that except
with regard to whiskey, liquors and wines
and in regard to silks and as to some
high classes of cottons—all of which may

as the United States, or unitarian, as
France. The difficulty was solved by
agreeing to make laws after a referendum
|to the people. The President then ap-

'

} peared on a baloony at the town hall and

the | Payne reported that they had seen Presi- | puf this question to the people outside:

|; “Will you have separation of the
| Church and State?”
| “Yes,” replied the people.

The President went back and told the
secretaries of the desire of the people.

The next question, passed in the same
way, was the appointment of Consuls.
The Chief of Police was nominated
| Spanish Consul. After he had held the
| post a few minutes he was arrested on
| the ground that the republic was at war
| with the rest of Spa in.
| In Sabadell a republic was also pro-
claimed. By a referendum similar to
} that at Granollars two convents and a
{church were burned. The President
from a balcony of the town hall then
|}announced that the people had agreed
that religion, not being an article of
first necessity, was prohibited.

He said the curate could open the church
on Sundays and feast days because the
people considered the church an industrial
| enterprise. When the republic had lasted
| forty-eight hours the comedy was ended
| by the civil guards arresting fifty of the
|sanguinary revolutionists and seizing

about 225 rifles.

At Mataro the republic organized a
militia, headed by two of the chief revolu-
tionists. They burned the court house
and murdered a Judge.

Treasury MacVeagh has directed that the |
initials “V. D. B.” be removed from all |
the Lincoln cents hereafter issued. Tho

; coins on which these initials have been

been very few increases in rates. There |

have been a great number of real de-
creases in rates,and they constitute a
sufficient amount to justify the statement
that thie bill is a substantial downward
revision and a reduction of excessive
rates.

“This is not a free trade bill. It was not
intended to be. The Republican party
did not promise to make a free trade bill.
It promised to make the rates protective,
but to reduce them when they exceeded
the difference between the cost of pro-
duction abroad and here, making allow-
ance for the greater normal profit on
active investments bere. I believe that
while this excess has not been reduced
in a number of cases in a great majority
the rates are such a8 are necessary to pro-
tect American industries, but are low
enough in case of abnormal increase of
demand and raising of prices to permit
the possibility of the importation of the
foreign article and thus to prevent exces-
sive prices. :

“The power granted to the Executive
under the maximum and minimum clause
may be exercised to secure the removal
of obstacles which have been interposed

|by foreign Governments in the way of
undue and unfair discrimination against
American merchandise and products.

“The Philippine tariff section I have
struggled to secure for ten years last
past, and it gratifies me exceedingly by
my signature to give it the effect of law.
I am sure it will greatly increase the
trade between the two countries and it
will do much to build up the Philippines
in a healthful prosperity.

“The administrative clauses of the bill
and the customs court are admirably
adapted to secure a more uniform and a
more apeedy final construction of the
meaning of the law.

placed will not, however, be recalled.
About 27,000,000 have been issued. Only |
the last initial of the designer will appear |
on the coin, placed in such a way that it
will be inconspicuous.

After a conference to-day with Presi- |
dent Taft Secretary MacVeagh instructed |
the Director of the Mint at Philadelphia |
to discontinue the coinage of the new
Lincoln cent until the dies from which
they were struck are changed #0 as to
make the modification he has ordered.
The only objection to the initials, Mr.
MacVeagh said, was that they were too
prominent and gave the coin an adver-
tising and commercial aspect which he
did not approve. There would be no ob-
jection, he added, to the initial of Mr.
Brenner's last name appearing on the
coin where it would not be too con-
spicuous.

Secretary MacVeagh's order to dis-
continue the issue of the cents will have
the effect of making them more popular
with coin collectors. They will not be-
come rare, however, because of the great
number already issued.

THE ARTIST WON'T STAND IT.

Mr. Brenner said yesterday that he
had not heard from Secretary MacVeagh
or anybody else in authority in regard
to the banishment of two of his initials
from the Lincoln cent. To him the
report seemed incredible. He did not
believe that the Government would take
any action of the sort without consulting
the designer or that there was any reason
for tampering with the design at all.

“I have seen it stated,” he said, “that
the use of the designer's full initials is
unprecedented. furely the Government
must know how untrue that is. The $5
and $2.50 gold pieces are marked ‘B. L. P.’
the initials of Bela L. Pratt, and on the
new $10 and $20 coins are Saint Gaudens's
initials, ‘A. 8. G.’

“If Mr. MacVeagh really has issued
this order I shall do all I can to have it
countermanded. I shall appeal to him,
and if he does not see the injustice of the
act I shall appeal to President Taft and
then to the press, and through the press
to the public. If that doesn't work I shall
go to the courts. As I told Tus Sun yes-
terday President Roosevelt and Secretary
Cortelyou told me my full mame should
be on the coin. At the mint they reduced
it to the mere initials; but I said nothing,
knowing that there was no t
in this country for the use of the artist's
full name on a coin-—although there
should be—and having confidence in the
good judgment of the Superintendent of
the Mint. But when it comes to squeez-
ing me down to a mere ‘B’ I think I am
justified in protesting. The rights of all
artists are in question.”
