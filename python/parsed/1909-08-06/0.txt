LIGHT PUNISHMENT METED OUT
TO INSURGENTS.

The Heads of Cooper of Wiscensin, Fowler
of New Jersey and Gardner of Massa-
chusetts Lopped Of —New York State
Gets Seven Chairmangehips, City Nene.

Wasninoton, Aug. 5.—Just before the
House adjourned to-day Uncle Joe Can-
pon shook the plum tree. For weeks and
weeks the House membership has awaited
with keen expectancy the announcement
of the list of committee assignments.
The tariff bill was pending and the leaders
agreed with the Speaker that it would be
infinitely better if the makeup of these
organizations were withheld until that
measure had been passed.

The session of Congress that ended to-
day was one of the stormiegt known in
many years. Partisan feeling ran high
in both branches, but in the House par-

‘ ticularly there was a great deal of trouble
and excitement. The Republican major-
ity was im hard straite at all times
and at the very beginning of the session
the leaders found it extremely difficult
to adopt the rules that had governed for
many years. After a bitter struggle the
Speaker and his lieutenants finally won
out.

There were wild reports that the
Speaker intended to punish the insurgents
Ly giving them assignments ‘that would
rbhaolutely deprive them of any part in
the business of the lower branch of
Congress. When the committee list was
announced to-day it wae disclosed that

+Speaker Cannon had punished the in-
purgents, but that he had adopted a
moderate course. No Republican insurgent
was promoted, a few were demoted and
changes were made in the committee
assignments of others, but in nearly all
such cases places were given the bolters
cs good as those they held in the organiza-
tion of the Sixtieth Congress.

Among those whose heads were placed
on the block were Representatives
Cooper of Wisconsin, Fowler of New
Jersey and Gardner of Massachusetts.
These gentlemen were among the busiest
of the Republican insurgents. Cooper
was chairman of the Committee on In-
sular Affairs, Fowler chairman of the
Committee on Banking and Currency and
Gardner chairman of the Committee on
Industrial Arte and Expositions. Each
was succeeded by a man that has es-
poused the cause of the regular organiza-
tion. Olmstead of Pennsylvania wae
named chairman of the Insular Com-
mittee, Vreeland of New York placed at
the head of the Committee on
and Curtency and Rodenburg of Iilinois
succeeded to the chairmarship of the Com-
mittee on Industrial Arte and Expositions.

In punishing the insurgents’ leaders
Speaker Cannon visited his displeasure
almost entirely upon Messrs. Cooper,

_. Gardner and Fowler. Murdock of Kan-
sas, more O6Biloxious to the
than any of the three named, was let off
easily. Im the preceding Congress he
had a place on the Committee on Post
Offices and Post Roads. He still holds
that place.

On the whole Speaker Cannon's com-
mittee list this year was generally ao-
claimed. When the committee were or-
ganized at the beginning of the Sixtieth
Congress the insurgent movement had
not assumed definite form. By the time
the new met in March there
was a revolt confronting the
Speaker and his lieutenants. In making
up the committees the Speaker had to
take into consideration that on a number
of them the insurgent Republicans held
the balance of power. ly it
— necessary for him to make trans-

ers.

The New York delegation fared. well

* 2 committee assignments. It secured
‘even chairmanships.

Early in the session the New York dele-
mation became concerned about the
chairmanship of Rivers and Harbors.
Alexander of Buffalo waa in line for it,
‘ut the fear was expressed that as the
hate already controlled Ways and Means
‘cry would be raised. For some years

Tesentative Southwick of Albany has
chairman of the Committee on Edu-

wick holds his
mittee on Territories, and in addition se-
cures a place on the Committee on Indus-
trial Arte and Expositions.

Contrary to general expectations, none of
the Republicans frém Greater New York
landed a chairmanship, although the three
of them got good assignments, as follows:

WON'T ACT ON

INCOME TAX.
Georgia Semaic Will Take Its Time te
‘Think Over the Propesed Amendment.

ATLantTA, Aug. 5.—The Georgia Senate
to-day by a vote of 37 to 2 refused to con-
sider the income tax amendment to the
Federal Constitution, although to-day
had been fixed upon for ita consideration
The action of the Senate means that
there will be no action at this session
and indicates that there is strong op-
Position to it.

Senator Burwell and other Senators
in opposing action declared that it was
@ grave thing for the States to confer
such power on the Federal Government.
They feared that if the power to levy
an income tax was given the result
would be more wastefulness at Wash-
ington without any decrease in tariff

|taxation. It was asserted that the South

was alread hardly dealt with
in the matter of el ae Rae
the tariff, and they were reluctant to
give the Federal Government power
to wring additional taxes from this
action.

The opinion was aleo expressed that
it would probably be better for Georgia
to adopt an income tax law for herself
and reject the proposition for a national
income tax.

Senator Perry in urging consideration
of the amendment asserted that lobbyista
were at work to defeat the amendment,
and urged that the Georgia Legislature
redeem the frequent declarations of the
Democratic party in favor of an income
tax. Senator Perry refused to name

the lobbyista or their employees, but
insisted that sinister influences were at
work to prevent the adoption of the
amendment.

BANK ROBBER KILLS PURSUER
A

md is Killed After Fatally Weunding

Another Member of Attacking Party.

Wuire Brar, Minn., Aug. 5.—Following
a bold'robbery of: the First State Bank
of this village to-day Henry Paul, the
bandit, and Fred Larkins, one of a pur-
suing posse, were shot and killed, and
William Butler was fatally wounded.
John Christie, another pursuer, received
& wound in the thigh, and Richard Deron
was shot through ‘the wrist.

The robber, who had been employed as
@ laborer on some building work at White
Bear for three days, received his pay
check for $ this morning and went to
the bank to get it cashed. Cashier Alfred
Auger was the only man in the bank.
Paul offered Auger the check, and while
the cashier examining it he drew a
revolver. Auger looked up he waa
told to hand out all the cash in the bank.
As Paul had the drop Auger was oom-
pelled to obey, and passed out all the our-
rency in the office, amounting to $750.

The robber then backed out of the door
and fied in the direction of Bald Kagie
Lake, about a mile distant.

Auger gave the alarm and in a few min-
utes the population of the town, armed
with revolvers and rifles, was in hot pur-
suit. Seeing his pursuers gaining on him
the robber took refuge in an outhouse
about two blocks from the bank and when
the posse drew near opened fire.

Larkins, who was leading the pursuers,
paid no attention to the shots or to the
warnings of the robber and went boldly
to the outhouse. He fell dead on the
threshold with a bullet in his heart. This
caused a halt among the pursuers, who
retired to whatever sheltered points
offered and opened fire onthe house. The
fire was briskly returned for a few minutes,
when Paul was killed.

SHIP LOST HER TARIFF RAGE

PENNSYLVANIA IN BEFORE MID.
NIGAT, BUT TOO LATE.

Orders Were te Clese the Custom House
and Step Entries at the Usual Hour
—Lete ef Steckings Taken Out of
Bend—A Recerd Week in Duties.

The Hamburg-American liner Penn-
sylvania, which was urged by wireless
to burn up her oval to reach port before
the new tariff law went into effect, did
not win her race against the tariff. She
was reported 258 miles east of Sandy Hook
at 6:40 A.M. yesterday, and 4 throng of
Custom House brokers representing im-
porters of hosiery and of champagne
and other wines besieged Collector Loeb,
urging him to keep the Custom, House
open until midnight so that they might
have a chance to save for the importers
something like $20,000. They wanted
to know if the law could not be construed
so that the appearance of the Penn-
sylvania within the three mile limit might
entitle the importers to call her in port.

The Collector told them that unless
otherwise ordered by the Treasury De-
partment he would close the Custom
House at the regular hour, 4:30 P. M.,
and that he would not consider the Penn-
aylvania's cargo a subject for entry until
the ship herself had been entered at the
Custom House.

. Under further urging the Collector
sent a despatch to Washington and
later got an answer that went to all other
porta where importers were expecting
cargoes or had them in bond. The
answer was that the Custom House should
close as usual. With the answer came the
news that the President had signed the
bill at 6:06 P.M. Brokers anxious about
cargo in bond who had been in line when
the doors were closed promptly at 4:30
were still within the Custom House
ttending to withdrawals of merchandise

t.

The Pennsylvania was reported off the
Hook last night. As the law goes into
effect at midnight this morning and as
the ship will not be oleared until after
daylight, the Government will receive
a fat purse in duties that it would not have
got if the liner had been half a day ear-

value of hosiery withdrawn from bond
and entered at the Custom House was
$400,381; hosiery to the value of $440,005
was imported in July. The withdrawals
of merchandise from bonded warehouses
for Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday
of this week doubled the values of with-
drawals on the same dates a year ago,

entire customs receipts for this week, not
including yesterday, were $5,068,2535.26,
or more than a million a day, which beats
all records.

NEW TARIFF LAW IN EFFECT.

Estimated Duties Will Be Collected Until
Copies of the Act Are Received.
Wasninoton, Aug. 5.—The Treasury
Department fully three weeks ago began
preparations for the prompt administra-
tion of the new’ tariff law. General in-
structions were sent out to collectors of
custome in all parts of the country direct-
ing that immediately after the receipt of
telegraphic advices from the Department
of enactment of the new law, estimated

the receipt of official copies of the law.
Collectors on the Pacific Coast and at
other porte distant from Washington will
not receive their copies of the act for sev-

on the rates named in the old law. No
entries of merchandise will be liquidated
until collectors have received their copies
of the act, but with as much promptness

BEAR STEALS A BABY.

Mother Had Left Little One With Older
Child While Picking Berries.

CuEeporoan, Mich., Aug. 5.—Reports
reached the city this morning that -a
black bear bad carried off a baby 18 months
old while the mother was picking huckle-
berries on the Macintosh plains, about
ten miles out of town.

The mother, a Polish woman, whose
name was not learned, left the child sleep-
ing in charge of another child, 8 years
old. The bear suddenly appeared and
started away with the little one, frighten-
ing the older child. The mother became
hysterical and was hardly able to tell
what had happened.

Sheriff Clute sent ten men in charge of
Deputy Sheriff Finn and County Surveyor
Bowen to the scene, but they were unable
to find any trace of the child or the bear.

DO NOT WANT BILLY SUNDAY.

Muncie Business Men Object te Excite-

Monors, Ind., Aug. 5.—The Muncie
Merchants Association has adopted a
protest against bringing Billy Sun-
day, the ex-ball player evangelist, to this
city for a series of meetings. The protest
sets out that the merchants are not op-
posed to church services, but they don’t
need any undue excitement in the city
and above all things they want quiet and

oe.
PeThey say that for two years business
in Muncie has not been good, but that
conditions are now much better, and they
desire that nothing be done to hurt the

. | improving situation. The street car riota

of a year and a half ago, the general
election last fall, the option election last
spring and the prospective city election
next fall have all tended to disturb the
city, and they want to avoid anything that
tends to distract the .publio.

ELEVATED CARS TO BE GREEN.

Repainting in “Pullman Standard” Coler
to Begin at Once.

The color of the cars on the elevated
roads is to be changed from red to olive
green. Three cars were freshly painted

another with what is known as the Alton
standard, the color used on the Chicago
and Alton Railroad, and a third with olive
green, or what is known as the Pullman
standard color. These three cars were
inspected by the directors of the company
on Wednesday and it, was unanimously
decided to adopt the green color. The re-
painting of the cars will be begun at once.

BOY’S WIT SAVES HIS MOTHER.

@ver Roof and Down Fire Escape te Shut
Om the Gas in Her Reom.

Mrs. Clementina Berliner, 39 years old,
of 1698 Madison avenue, a sufferer from
melancholia, shut herself in her room
yesterday afternoon, inserted a rubber
tube in her mouth and turned on the

gas.

At 5:30 o’clock Mrs Berliner’s daughter
Isabella, who was about to take one of
the younger children for a walk in the
park, asked her ten-year-old brother
Mark to go upstairs and get a shawl.
When Mark reached the fourth floor,
where the Berliners live, he found the door
locked and smelled gas. Without wait-
ing to call aid he ran up to the roof,
ecrambled down the fire escape and
entered the flat from the kitchen window
in the rear. He ran to his mother’s room
and after taking the tube from her mouth,
turning off the gas and opening the win-
dows, be summoned Policeman Nihil! from
the East 104th street station.

Mrs. Berliner was taken to the Harlem
