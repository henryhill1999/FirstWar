MRS. WILSON SELLS

| HER FOURTH PICTURE:

 

Request Is Sent for More Paint-
ings for New York
Exhibition.

 

 

“Old Lyme.” a Connecticut
Landscape, Bought by San
Francisco’s Ex-Mayor.

 

The demand for paintings by Mrs.
Woodrow Wilson, wife of the President,
was greater than the supply at the exhibi-
tion of the Association of Women Paint-
ers and Sculptors in the Arlington Gal-
leries at 274 Madison avenue, so more
were sent for.

In response to a request two more
pictures by Mrs. Wilson were sent to the
association. They were put on view
yesterday afternoon and almost at once
one of them, a landscape called “Old
Lyme,” was sold. “Old Lyme” is a study
of the rolling Connecticut country, with a

The telephone and telegraph records

The Rubino affidavit makes the specific
charge against Commissioner Carlisle that
the words “solid, natural concrete” were
put into the specifications contrary to the

highway contracts shall not be drawn so
that there can be no competition.

Pictares Bring $150 Each.

The price paid for each picture was the
same, $150, which is certainly modest,
considering the demand, The sum realized
by the sale is to go to the Berry School,
an industrial tnstitution for boys and
girls near Rome, Ga., which has many
Northern people among its officers and di-

rectors. Among others Miss Anne Mor-
gan and Dr. Albert Shaw are vice-presi-

The purchaser of “Old Lyme" was ex-

Stadted Art in New York,

An intimate friend of Mrs. Wilson,
speaking last night of Mrs. Wilson's art
inclinations, said that the President's wife
\had first studied art before her marriage
to Mr. Wilson at the Art Studenis League
of New York and that her work as a
siudent was highly thought of. After
her marriage she abandoned her brushes
for some years. At the time of the
‘tragic death of her brother a few years
ago Mrs. Wilson was prostrated. She
was then Induced by friends to take up
her painting again as a distraction and |

to its happy influence her friend at-
tributes Mrs. Wilson's restoration to
health.

As a result of this reawakened Interest
in painting Mrs. Wilson spent several suc-
cessive summers in tha celebrated art
colony at Lyme, Conn., where she studied
in the outdoor classes of Frank Vincent
Du Mond.

swerable argument of the bare title|
“Treasurer of Tammany Hall" on the |

holds that such points are relevant.

It is no new thing for Donohue, treas-
urer-advertising agent, to have publicity
and official scrutiny. As far back as:
1911 six lawyers appeared before the
grievance committee of the Bar Associa-
tion empowered to investigate frregulari- |!
ties in professional conduct. They had,
been referees appointed by Justices who
were elected on Tammany tickets and
their advertising in foreclosure proceed-

were alleged to have charged adv ertising |

once counsel for the Lawyers Advertising
Company, will be a witness in the case,
it is understood.

Plaintiffa Claim $1,940.

The complaint sets forth that on Decem-
ber 31, 1907, the plaintiffs entered into a
contract with the defendant by Everett

. Blanke, its secretary and treasurer, to
ee their best efforts for one year to ob- |
tain legal, financial and commercial ae
vertising, in return for which they were
to receive 35 per cent. of the defendant's |
gross income monthly. The one year was
extended subsequently and = terminated
February 15, 1910. The plaintiffs say |
the gross income was around $45,000 and
that with certain allowances for advances
made they are entitled to the $9,940,

The answer is that Kiernan, who was
then the company's lawyer, and Donohue
came to Mr. Blanke representing that
Donohue as treasurer of Tammany Hall:
was in a position to wield considerable in- |
fluence, and that ‘Kiernan and Donohue |
were in a position to control or influence |
a large volume of advertising business,
; financial, political and otherwise, from

\firms and corporations with which saig | took two hours to put him on his feet.

Kiernan and Donohue had connections as|
would insure said advertising business.”
The answer said that Donohue promised
to deliver the advertising business of the
Equitable Life Assurance Society, all cor-
porations in which Thomas F. Ryan had
controlling interest, August Belmont,
Joseph P. Day, the Corporation Coun-
sel, business men, wine merchants and
cigar manufacturers. He also had a
connection with the Law Journal by
which he could obtain a special adver-
tising discount,

The formal answer says that after
two months it was found that no new
advertising came to the company, where-
upon Kiernan and Dennin withdrew and
Donohue went on alone, this time at a
salary of $333 a month, his services to
consist mainly of efforts to obtain the
advertisements of referees in Supreme
Court proceedings.
