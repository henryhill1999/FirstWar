THE REAL ESTATE MARKET,

BETTER DEMAND SHOWN FOR
HIGH GRADE PROPERTY.

 

 

Maiden Lane Business Parcel and a New
Private House in the Fifth Avenue
District Figure in the Brokerage
News—Few Tenements and Flats Sold,

Though few in number, yesterday's
brokerage sales included a couple of trans-
sections in high class property, An ex-
pensive private house in the upper Fifth
avenue section was sold to an {Intending oc-
cupant, and buyers were found for a valu-
able parcel in the downtown office building
district. These deals, taken in connection
with several reported earlier this week,
seem to indicate a broadening tendency on
the part of the realty market,

In any event, the speculation in flats and
tenements is less conspicuous than it was,
Brokers generally believe that trading
{s about to branch out into new diree-
tions. The mortgage loan situation no
longer presents unusual difficulties in the
way of important deals, and inquiries for
high grade property are becoming more
frequent. Buyers, however, are unwilling
to consider the quotations which prevailed

a year or two ago.

Girl Said She Would Wed the One Whe Got

There First—Sprint a Tie.

PoTTsvILLE, Pa., Aug. 10.—Miss Alex-
andria Seagar, unable to choose from a
score of ardent suitors for her hand, to-day
told two of them, Dominick Godlews and
Anthony Mulcar, that she would marry

with the request, but both applications
were received by Register Herb simul-

CARDINAL ATOLLI SAILS.

Many Clergymen Bid Him Farewell at the
Pier—Other Passengers.

Cardinal Satolli sailed in the rain yes-
terday noon on the Sardegna, bound for
Naples. With his nephew, the Rev. Ubaldus
Maravelle, his cousin, Ercole SatoJli, and
his two secretaries, the Rev. Father Giu-
seppe Marucchi, ani! Signor Don Giovanni
Giontoni he arrived in a carriage at 10:15 and
immediately went aboard the steamer.

Following closely upon the Cardinal's
arrival came Archbishop Farley, Bishop
Hoban of Scranton, Pa., Mgr. O'Connell,
rector of the Catholic University of Wash-
ington; Mgr. O'Keeffe of Highland Falls,
N. Y., Mgr. John Edwards of the Immaculate
Conception Church in East Fourteenth
street, and a delegation of Brooklyn priests,
headed by the Rev. Giuseppe Castellano
and Father Faiticher.

Gen. James R. O'Bierne was the first
to greet the Cardinal as he alighted from
his carriage. Mr. and Mrs. Maloney, Mrs.
E. A. Ashman, Mrs. Mackin and Mr, and
Mra. Fanning were among those who
gathered to shake the Cardinaf's hand
and receive his last blessing.

To a reporter the Cardinal said: “I will
go straight to Rome upon arrival at Naples
and report my visit to the Pope. I really
have nothing to gay, as my trip was en-
tirely for pleasure, and my friends here
gave me such a good time it will be ever
a source of pleasant memories to look
back upon and to recount to my friends
in Rome.”

The Rev. Sipione Tofini, Superior Gen-
eral of the Pious Society of Missions, also
sailed on the Sardegna for the Mother House
in Rome. ,

Father Tofini was formerly pastor of the
Church of Our Lady of Mount Carmel,
in East 115th street, and it was through
his influence that permission was obtained
from the late Pope Leo XIII. to crown in
public the statue of Our Lady of Mount
Carmel.

Mer. Francesco. Marchetti, another
passenger on the Sardegna, is returning
at the end of his service as Apostolic Dele-
gate during the absence of Mgr. Falconio
in Rome.

WEDS MAN WHO CUP HER.

Girl, Disfigured for Life, Says She Is Sure
Her Violent Fiance Leves Her.

The heart of Tillie Matiste, a pretty bru-
nette of 21 years, who lives at 180 North
Seventh street, Williamsburg, went out to
Joseph Salzarulo, her sweetheart, when he
was arraigned yesterday in the Lee avenue
police court, Williamsburg, on the charge
of cutting her face with a knife because
she refused to marry him. Salzarulo is
24 years old and lives at 211 Union avenue.
He and the girl have known each other for
several years and were to be married next

month,

On the night of July 24 while they were
out for a walk he proposed immediate
marriage or an elopement, and when she
declined, he slasbed her face. She is dis-
figured for life.

Salzarulo was arrested and committed
to jail in default of $1,000 bail. Meanwhile
the girl was under the care of a doctor.
She appeared in court yesterday with her
face still bandaged. When agistrate
Furlong called the case Salzarulo sobbed
when he saw how he had mutilated the girl.
Then the girl relented and asked the Magis-
trate's permission to speak to her fiancé.
They were permitted to retire and in a few
minutes Miss Matiste said she had forgiven
her fiancé and that they desired to be mar-
ried at once. "

After Salzarulo had said he cut the girl
accidentally, the couple were taken into
pe Magistrate's room, where he [married

HORGAN & SLATTERY SUE
For More Pay for Designing Sailors’ Snug
Harbor Sanitarium.

" The eanitarium designed for Sailors’
Snug Harbor by Horgan & Slattery has be-
come the subect of litigation in the Su-
preme Court. The Tammany firm drew
the plans and specifications several years
ago, and allege that the Harbor trustees
still owe them $5,893. The trustees deny
owing Horgan & Slattery more than §2,800,
which they are willing to pay. As the
architects have refu to accept this the
trustees have obtained peymission from
Justice MacLean to pay wie $2,800 into
court to abide the outcome of the litigation
which Horgan & Batery have instituted
for the reoovery of the full amount. Au-
gustus Van Wyck represents the archi-
tects and Hawkins & Delafield are attorneys
for the Harbor truatene.

It appears that the original plans were
for an 680,000 sanitarium, accommodating
a hundred patients. Subsequently the

lans were altered so that the cost reached

167,877 and Horgan & Slattery demanded

5 per cent. compensation on the whole
cost. The trustees declared that the archi-
tects’ compensation was not to exoeed.
in any event, 5 per cent. of the original
cost. They paid $2,000 and the rest is now
in dispute.

The matter was referred to Morris K.
Jesup as arbitrator, and he Geclded that
there was but $2,800 due to Horgan & Slat-
tery. The latter refused to accept the ar-
bitrator's decision and began suit.
