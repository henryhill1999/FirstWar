UTLOOK PLEASES J. J, BILL,

LIKES PARKER'S SPEECH—FALL
BUSINESS PROMISING.

 

The Railroad Presitient Says He's Not
Mixing in Politics, but Lamont’s a
Good Man—Crop Smaller Than Last
Year, but the Farmers Are Prosperous.

James J. Hill returned to New York from
the West yesterday and had something to
say about the general condition of the
country and about crops, and a little about
politics, When asked if he was going to
be a candidate for Governor of Minnesota,
M-, Hill replied:

“I never took an active interest in poli-
tics but once, and that was in the campaign
of 1896. I don't intend to get into politica
again if I can help it, and I don't see any
reason why I should.”

“How about Col. Daniel 8. Lamont being
the candidate for Governor of New York?”

“Now, you're getting me altogether out
ef my latitude,” was the answer. “I don’t
know anything about political conditions
in New York and don’t care to express an
opinion, However, { have known Col.
Lamont fora free many years and I know
him to be a mighty fine man.”

“How about national politics?”

“Well,” said Mr. Hill, “I have just been

ding Judge Parker's speech of accept-
anos} ‘ed I fice it. I believe he ts a sound

man.

Regarding crop conditions and the gen-
era! business situation, Mr. Hill Rad this
to aay: ;

“I gee no reason to change my original
estimate as to the wheat COR which was
640,000,000 bushele. That will give us a
emaller crop than we had last year, but that
doesn’t indicate that the railroads will not
do a larger freight business than they did
last year. Up in my section of the country
and further north, reports indicate that
the crop is in very excellent condition,

“Everything points to a Gres fall busi-
ness for the railroads. The Great Northern
fa doing a much larger business than it
did last year at this time and the same is
true of other railroads in the Northwest.

“The farmers, very generally, are pros-

rous. The only depression seems to be in
manufacturing districts. They are having
labor troubles, and the domestic deman
is not as great as the supply. The principal
trouble seems to be that some of onr tariff
achedules are too high, and I believe they
should be reduced. Our manufacturers
cannot dispose of surplus products at
home, and they cannot afford to export
at pga obtainable for their products
abroad.

“I believe that we must come inevitably
to, perhaps, a reduction in the general wage
acale, but certainly to a less extravagant
manner of living. If wages are reduced
the cost of commodities will fall with a
reduction in tariff schedules and the citizen
will enjoy greater comforts, I believe, than
{sa the case at present.”

GRAND TRUNK PAC. ORGANIZED.

Cc. M. Hayea President of Company Which
Will Bulld New Transcontinental Line.

MonTREAL, Aug. 10.—The Grand Trunk
Pacific Railway Company was organized
this afternoon at the first meeting of the

Alfred W. Smithers and John Allan Clut-
tonbrock of London, land; the Hon.
George A. Cox and E. R. Wood of Toronto
John R. Booth of Ottawa and John Bell of
Belleville.

Mr. Hayes eald that surveys for the new
road are now being made on that section
of the road between Winn and the Pa-
cific coast. It will take considerable time

GOSSIP OF WALL STREET.

There has been no change of attitude on
the part of those who bulled the market
conservatively up to a point beyond which
the public would not at the time respond
and then withdrew from the long aide to
await developments. They hold the same
non-committal views that were attrivuted to
them a week or ten days ago. They oon-
tinue to assert that the market is dominated
almost entirely by professional activities
and that it may be expected to move first
up and then down within a narrow range,
according to the whims and impulses of the
trading element, until something definite
happens to give prices an impetus in one
direction or the other. Some go even further
and say that the more substantial interests
of the financial community are out of sym-
pathy with the efforts that are made from
time to time, as in yesterday's session, for
example, to stimulate bullish interest without
the cooperation of those who were responsible
for the recent advance. They point to the
fact that the professional manipulation no
sooner ceases, even temporarily, than the
stocks in which it appeared become stupid
again, with a tendenoy to sag, and that no
buying orders fill in beneath the market to
support the advances. They point also to
the fact that in the leading railroad issues,

 

| while stocks do not come out on the declines,

they are quietly supplied on the advances,
as was seen yesterday in Missouri Pacific,
when Wormeer bid it up to 04, and in other
stocks, notably St. Paul and Union Pacific.

Professional sentiment was rather more
bullish yesterday, but it converged largely
upon specialties, so called. The general
railroad list made but little headway. Most
of the active traders, individually and in
groups, appeared to be ranged on the long
side of the market, influenced by the con-
tinued scarcity of stocks, the absence of sell-
ing pressure on declinee and the general ex-
perlence that within certain limits it is easier
to take profits on the long side than on the
short side. Transactions were very profes-
sional in character, and brokers were able
to report no considerable Increase of general
business, What are known as the speculative
houses appeared to be buying stocks on
balance, and in this class would be included
several of the more prominent Western con-
cerns. Some brokers thought the market
looked at the close yesterday as if it had been
overbought.

There was a very active borrowing demand
for Steel preferred again in the loan crowd
yesterday. Steel preferred had been the most
conspicuous laggard in the market during
the day, and its failure to advance with the
speculative temper, more Inclined to be bull-
ish than for several days previously, no doubt
encouraged fresh selling for the short account.
The general demand for stocks was some-
what more active than was reported from
the loan crowd on Tuesday. Another instance
of the abnormal scarcity of stocks was fur-
nished yesterday forenoon, when Pennsyl-
vania loaned flat for delivery on Tuesday's
sheets. There is not belleved to be so extensive
a short interest in Pennsylvania as to cause
the stook to lend flat on demand alone. The
soarcity of floating stock would account for
it. With money being pressed upon bor-
rowers at 1 per cent. and less there !6 no great
incentive to lend stocks.

The “tipping” which has been a somewhat
too conspicuous feature of the recent specu-
lation in traction shares reached what one
should suppose to be its extreme development
yesterday. The tip to buy Metropolitan Se-
curities for a sharp advance was put out
broadcast before the opening, and it was
made good, as previous tips on Metropolitan
Street Railway had been made good, but the
day's bull tip on the latter stock was at the
same time going wrong, for along with the
tip to get long of Metropolitan Securities
people were advised to buy Metropolitan
Street Railway for 130. It is predicted now
that Metropolitan Securities will sell at par
before the end of the week. The Metropoli-
tan Securities tip was telegraphed out of town
yeeterday to all points where there was likely
to be any interest in it, and the trading ele-
ment here and outside acted upon it freely.
But there were also bear tips on Metropolitan
Street Railway. In the forenoon {it was
rumored that there had been’a hitch in the
“deal,” and traders sold the stock on that
story. Later in the day ft was declared that
the bull crowd had been eelling out under
cover of the strength of Metropolitan Secur-
ities, and the advice was repeated to sell
Metropolitan Street Railway. Just before
the close there came a story from Newark
pretending to tell what the traction deal
would be, making {t out a most magnificent
thing. The day's contributions to the trac-
tion literature of the period was voluminous,
but no real light was shed on the situation,
and after the close of business people were
evidently as much in the dark about the deal

as before.

The most prominent feature of yesterday’s
speculation in the Metropolitan issues was
the diversion of speculative interest from
Metropolitan Street Railway to Metropolitan
Securities. Transactions in the latter in-
creased from a volume of less than 10,000
shares on Tuesday to 60,000 yesterday. The
transsctions in Metropolitan Street Raflway
were also on a much increased scale as com-
pared with Tuesday's volume, but whereas
on Tuesday Metropolitan Street Railway
enjoyed a net advance of 3% per cent. as
against a nominal advance of but % per cent.
{n Metropolitan Securities, at the end of
yesterday's increased volume of transactions
Metropolitan Securities showed a net advance
of 6% pointa, while Metropolitan Street Rail-
way showed the nominal net gain of % per

cent.

There has been a large political speculation
{n Metropolitan Street Railway. Houses
supposed to have political affiliations have
appeared very prominently in the stock on
this advance. One or two of the more prom!-
nent among.them are said to have acquired
lines of the stock around 110 some time ago.
It was thought possible yesterday that this
element was taking profits.

The Gates contingent. has succeded in con-
fusing the entire Street as to its position
on the market Buying ordera supposed
to have originated within its circle were rather
prominent in yesterday's market, especially
in the afternoon. The impression is that
this crowd covered a line of shorts earlier
in the week, seeing how difficult it was to
dislodge, stocks, and that it has since been
working on the long side.

The general character of» yesterday's
buying, brokers said, was not impressive.
Too much of it, they thought, was of a
highly speculative origin. Various groups of
traders went around the room bidding up
prices, confining themrelves largely to the
specialties, but they seemed more intent
upon getting prices up to eell on than upon
getting the stocks. The movement in Amal-
gamated Copper in the forenoon was started
by a group of traders. Those who generally
have trustworthy information on the stock
when operations of importance are in prog-
ress declared that the movement yesterday
lacked substance. The flurry in Rock Island
in the afternoon wan started by Charles Mac-
donald, who bought several thousand shares
around 23%, and then bid safely for any
part of 5,000 shares at 23'5. Charles Min-
zesheimer & Co. started a fresh buying move-
ment in Sugar, traders assisting. Minze-
sheimer had also been active in Amalgamated
Copper, bidding that up in the forenoon.
Gates & Co. also were buyers of Sugar on
the advance at midday. Wormser was
largely responsible for the advance in Mia-
souri Pacific. He got 2,000 sharen at 93;
from Harris & Fuller, and later wae reported
to he bidding 93% for any part of 5,000 shares
The stock sold up to 0434, reacted to 93%
and closed at 93%.

Apart from technical conditions fevorntle
te limited operations on the loug side of the
market, the bull element counted yesterday
upon a strong and sutisfactory letter of uc-
ceptance from Mr. Parker and a good re-

 

 

 

 

 

port from the Government's experts on the |

condition of the corn crop. Its operations
in the stocks of Southwestern railroads,
notably Missouri Pacific and Texas Pacific,
were b upon expectations of a favor-
ible report on corn.

The heaviness of Steel preferred, owing

   

to the extent tc which speculative interest
converged upon other more active stocks,
was not as much commented upon as might
otherwise have been the case. '

 

The extraordinary persistence of bull |

talk on Union Paoific and Southern Pacific,
as to their immediate speculative possibili-
ties, is rather strange in view of the general
understanding that the banking interests
that were lately prominent in these stocks
are not at present active in the stock mar-
ket. It is the belief of persons who are in
touch with them that they are disposed rather
to discourage speculative operations on
any large scale in their group of stocks.
Southern Pacific became the most prominent
feature of the railroad list in the late trad~-
ing yesterday, advancing sharply to 52%
and closing at the highest. Knoblauch and
C. I. Hudson & Co. were reported to be the
Prominent btyers of the stock on this late
advanoe. Union Pacific enjoyed but a nom-
inal advance, closing at a net gain of % per
cent. Southern Pacific’s net gain was 1%
per cent. London houses were said to be
buying Union Pacifio in the forenoon, and
a bull crowd in the board room made a good
deal of noise over the stock, but it seemed
to be very heavy.

FORGED N. Y. CENTRAL TICKETS.

Pasees Issued for Advertising Fall
Counterfeiters’ Hands.

The passenger department of the New
York Central and Hudson River Railroad
has discovered a very comprehensive
scheme for forging and altering tickets
issued by the road on account of adver-
tising.

The tickets were about an inch and a
half wide and four or five inches long.
They were made out in the name of the per-
son to whom they were issued, and the
points between which the ticketa were
good were either written or stamped on
the face of the ticket. On the margin were
the months of the year and the days of the
week, one of each being punched to indi-
cate the length of time for which the ticket
was good.

Several weeks ago a ticket came back
to the office of General Passenger Agent
Daniels which purported to have been
issued to Mr. and Mrs. James Blank and
two daughters. It called for transporta-
tion from Buffalo to New York and return.
It isn’t usual for the road tu issue one ticket
for a man, his family and all his relatives,

and the case was investigated. On the race
of it the ticket looked all right.

Investigation showed that the ticket
had been issued to one man for a trip from
New York to Buffalo and good for a certain
number of days in the month of October.
When the record of the original ticket
was compared with the ticket which was
under suspicion it was seen that the ticket
had been changed in almost every import-
ant particular.

The month and the day of the month,
showing the expiration of the transporta-

 

Into

tion, indicated by black squares on the
Tere, had been filled up, and other dates

had nm punched. The work of og in
had been done by a person evidently skilled
in that work. The name of the person to
whom the ticket was issued had been taken
out with acid. Furthermore, the number
of the ticket had been changed, a new
number being substituted by a bogus stamp.
Beside this, the company's stamp had been
forged to imprint on the ticket “Buffalo to
New York and return.” The acid used had
changed the color of the ticket from a blue-
ish gray to a gray white.

Another ticket, issued at the request of
one of the high officers of the Lake Shore
and Michigan Southern Railroad to two
women, was similarly altered. It is through
this ticket that the New York Central people
nope to be able to get at one of the forgers
quickly, The woinen to whom the ticket
was issued are willing to tell how they dis-

of it and steps have been taken to
ware similar forgeries impracticable in
uture.

THEFTS AT CEDARHURST CLUB.

the Tenderloin of a Former
Bellboy.

James Parker, colored, who has been a
bellboy at the Cedarhurst Hunt Club of
Far Rockaway, was arrested in the Ten-
derloin last night on suspicion. A week
ago some one broke into the lockers in
the clubhouse and atole clothing and other
property valued at $400.
