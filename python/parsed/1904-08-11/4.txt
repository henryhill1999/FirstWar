OLD MAN SAYS HE
HOUSE TO MEDIUM'S WIFE.

—_—_——

Btothers’s Daughters Get Wise and Took

Him to Court—Fear of Death Removed |
Man Worth @200,000 Telis How Horo- }

witz Got His Rents and Coereed Him.

Frank Horowitz, who presses cops’

trousers and claims to converse with spooks
‘ht the same time in

big little tailor’s shop,
at 2635 Third avenue, has again been beard
from. This time Horowitz is accused by

John Stothers, a sixty-year-old real estate

owner, of The Bronx, who is sald to be
worth $200,000.

Horowitz will bave to answer in the
Harlem police court to-day the charge of
Mrs. Anna Richter of 656 East i4ist street,
who says he obtained $1,100 in small sums
from her on the false pretence that he
would get the “spirits” to use their influence
fg securing for her son a lifelong job. Mrs.
Richter had the tailor-medium arrested on
July 22, and the next day he was held by
Magistrate Crane in the Morrisania police
court. Mre. Richter says that Horowitz
said he didn't fear being arrested, as all
he had to do was wink at the Judge, who
would immediately be forced under a
hypnotic spell, and then he, Horowitz,
would be discharged. If Horowitz winked,
{t didn't feaze Magistrate Crane.

Horowitz's second financially successful
mediation became known yesterday when

Stothers was haled to the Morrisania police

court by his daughters, Mrs. Ww. C, Roll

of 325 Trinity avenue, and Mrs. A.C. Rollof
LA

East 142d street. The two women
married brothers. Stothers lives with the
last pamed, The sisters complained that
their father was giving his money to the
trousers pressing spook summoner.

When the old man reached the door of
the court he halted and begged to be al-
lowed to go home. He was trembling and
the court attendants inquired conoerning
the reason for his fears.

“Oh, don't take me in there ” he pleaded,

| Horowitz said last night that the spirite

would strike me dead as I crossed the
threshold of this courthouse,”

The old man was so confident that
death awaited him in the doorway that he
was in convulsions of terror, His condi-
tion was pitiable, but Magistrate Baker
shouted:

“Bring him in!”

Two husky cops used their usual physical
persuasion and Stothers was dragged to
the bar alive.

Once inside and finding that he was still
very much alive, Stothers plucked up cour-
age,anda smile of relief ahone on his hith-
erto terror stricken countenance. He lost
all fear of Horowitz and revealed the game
of the tailor in a full statement.

“I met Horowits a year ago,” said he,
“and he got hie wife to tell my fortune.
She said that I was soon to fall heir to a
fortune of $800,000 that was awaiting me
in Ireland. I told her that would be fine,
as I already had oonsiderable money.
Horowitz and hie wife hecame intereated
and questioned me conoerning my property.
1 told of the houses I owned and the rentals
I realized.

“Horowitz got me interested in sptritual-
ism and finally told me thet the spirits
had decreed that I cease allowing others
to collect my rents. Some time later he
said that the spirits ordered me te allow
him to collect the rents of two of my houses,
One of these, st 440 East 146th atrest, pays
$22 a month, and the other, at 467 Eaet 153d
street, returns a monthly rental of $42.
Horowitz has been collecting these rents
and keeping the money ever sinoe.

“Recently he prevailed on me to deed
ever to him a house I owned in 142d street,
between Willis and Alexander avenues. I
did 0 because he said the spirits would
wreak terrible vengeance on me if I re-
fused. I was afraid of both the tailor and
the spirits, so I transferred the property
to his wife, Charlotte Herowitz. The
house and lot are worth $24,000.

“About this time my daughters began to
get wiee to what I was doing, and made
things lively for me by demanding an ac-
counting. Horewitz, when told of this,
consulted the spirits, and said that my latest
orders were to leave my daughters and
go live in a furnished room near his house.
I did; but my daughters made me come
back.”

"Well, you are a fine old soft mark,” said
Magistrate Baker, who had been listening
to the story with great interest. “Did
you actually deed that house over to Mrs.
Horowitz?"

“Yon,” said the old man.

*I mean, did you release all claim te the
property?°

“Yes.”

Magistrate Baker was silent for some
time, but, finally, turning to the twe Mrs.
Rolls he said:

“There is nothing I can hold your father
on. He is discharged; but I advise you
to take this matter to the Supreme Court
as s00n as possible.”

Burnett in the work of ferreting out fraudu-

‘by lawyers acting for Italian immigrants
whe have been subpoenaed by him to prove
that they were rightfully entitled to the
papers they held, and James F. Brande
has announved that he intends to petition
Gov. Odell to remove Mr. Morgan on the
ground that Morgan is illegally compelling
foreigners to testify against themselves
when they answer to John Doo subponas.
“It is estimated,” Mr. Morgan said last

the last year in the eale of fraudulent
naturalization papers, that over 100,000
fraudulent naturalization papers have been
sold by those engaged in this illicit trafflo
and that 30,000 of there have been issued

“With great frequency immigrants dis-
play naturalization papers upon landing

forgeries throughout, being an exact Sone
of the certificates issued out of the District
Clerk's office for the Southern District of

cases the forged papers have been bovsnt

tary service in Europe.”

As a reenit of the work done by Mr. Mor-

says, a reduction of 30 to 50 per cent.

HAD SUGAR BOWL IN HIS POCKET

Lawyer Lee of Tarrytown Held for Lare
ceny—Sugeests Friend Played a Joke.

John F. Lee, a lawyer, of Tarrytown,
was arraigned before Acting Recorder
Laverty in Hoboken yesterday morning,
charged with the larceny of a silver sugar
bowl from the dining car of a Lackawanna
train that arrived from Elmira on Tuesday
evening. The bow! was found in his pocket
when he was arrested,

In denying the charge, the lawyer ex-
pained that he had been to Elmira to see

ohn B. Stanchfield, with whom, he says,
he is interested in a business matter. W
returning to New York he drank several
giasses of beer with a friend on the train
and the friend remarked that a sugar bowl
would make a nice souvenir of the trip.
Mr. Lee said he slept during the latter part
of the journey and that when he got off the
train in Hoboken he found the sugar bow
in his coat pocket. He said he was on his
way to the train to return it when he was

arrested.

The lawyer was held in default of $200
bai] to await the action of the Grand Jury
on @ charge of larceny. Friends called
upon him yesterday afternoon and promised
to obtain bail, but at midnight he was
atill in a cell.

Tanrytown, N. Y., Aug. 10.—John P.
Lee ia a well known lawyer here and lives
in a handsome cottage in Cobb's Jane. At
his home to-night the maid said that Mr. Lee
started Monday for Albany on legal busi-
neas, and his wife received a letter from
him last night which was dated Albany.
The maid said Mrs. Lee had gone to New
York this morning CeOPR IN and had
not returned yet. None of e's family,
or Mrs. Lee's family, knows anything about
the arrest.

Lee is 30 years old. He formerly lived

EXCLUDED FROM THE MAILS,

Fraud Orders Against the U. 8S. Cercal Co.
and the National Specialty Co. of This City.

WasuiIncton, Aug. 10.—Fraud orders,
debarring the United States Cereal Com-
pany, 27 William street, and the National
Specialty Company, 1183 Broadway, New
York, from the use of the mails were issued
to-day by Postmaster-General Payne. The
United States Cereal Company was a sort
of “get-rich-quick” concern.

Tne evidence submitted to the Depart-

the public to be used in speculation in the
wheat market. It had been in operation
about six months and was paying alleged
dividends of from 2 to 8 per cent. per week
upon all moneys placed with it for invest-

ment.

It was charged that the company did not

use the moneys received by it in legitimately
ating in the wheat market, as it repre-
sented, but that the funds were held by the
company, and ce titious un-
earned dividends declared and paid each
week. The company suspended operations

pearance, and MacKnight and the other

ported that Morey defrauded women with

s advertisement as a bait:

Ladies: Eight to. fifteen paid weekly;
doing plain sewing at home; experience un-
necessary; material sent free anywhere;
send stamps for particulars.

When a woman responded to the adver-
tisement a circular was sent to her which
called for $1 for one “national protector”
and ma to make othera. For thedollar
the woman received the “protector” and
material for one more, by which, when
completed, the “company” was to judge
whether the woman c do the work.
If the work was rejected Morey kept the
money, and if it was accepted material
for twenty-four more protectors was sent.
The Post Office inspectors reported that
the average amount earned the ap-

licants was 96 cents, that Morey had
urnished fraudulent testimonials and that
he was otherwise engaged in an illegal busi-
ness.

Special Cable Despatch to Tux Sun.

CONSTANTINOPLE, Aug. 10.—United States
Minister Leishman received a message
from the Porte to-day saying that a favor-
able communication with regard to the
American demand upon Turkey for rights
and privileges for American residents,
equal to those accorded to other foreigners,
might be expected in a day or two.

Surprise is expressed in ‘Turkish official
quartérs over the threatened action of the
United States of breaking off diplomatic
relations. ‘he sending of American war-
ships to Smyrna has hastened the decision
of the Sultan to keep peace with the Wash-
ington Government.

WasuHincton, Aug. 10.—It can be stated
on authority that the Cabinet at yesterday's
meeting fully approved the plans of the
State Department for forcing the Turkish
Government to accede to the demands of
the United States by withdrawing Minister
Leishman from Constantinople and abruptly
severing diplomatic relations.

It has been decided not to send instruc-
tions to Rear Admiral Jewell, commanding
the European squadron, until the Bureau
of Navigation of the Navy Department
has been advised of the equadron’s arrival
at Smyrna. The vessels left Villefranche
for the Turkish port last Sunday, and, ac-
cording to the calculations made at the
Navy Department, are due to arrive at
their destination some time this evening.

It can be said, however, that the United
States Government will wait but a very
little while longer for a reply to the demands
presented to the Sultan by Minister Leish-
man in personal audience two weeks ago
to-day.

Since that time Mr. Leishman has made a
further demand upon the Porte, which is in
the nature of an ultimatum, and, in the event
of the Turkish Government still remaining
obdurate, it is known that Mr. Leishman
will be instructed to leave Constantinople
and proceeed on board the flagship of the
European squadron.

The acute stage in the Turkish situation
brought about by the decided stand of the
United States has undoubtedly created
considerable concern in the capitals of those
foreign nations which are signatories to the
Paris treaty fixing the status of Turkey.

Baron Speck von Sternburg, the German
Ambassador; Baron Hengelmuller yon Hen-
gervar, the Austrian Ambassador, and a
representative of the French Ambassador
have come to Washington in the last day
or two to confer with the President regard-
ing the Turkish situation. In view of this
fact, It is not considered improbable that,
rather than permit the United States to
take extreme measures in bringing the Sul-
tan to terms, the Powers in question will
bring pressure to bear on the Sultan to in-
duce him to grant the American demands,
the justice of which is apparently admitted
by these Powers without question,

WALDECK-ROUSSEAU DEAD.

Former Premier of France Passes Away
as the Result of an Operation.
Special Cable Despatch to TER SUN.

Paris, Aug. 10.—Pierre Marie Waldeck-
Rousseau, former Premier of France, died
at Corbeil, a suburb of this city, this after-
noon as the result of an operation for liver
trouble.

The operation was decided this morning
to be a necessity. It was begun at noon
and lasted two hours, the patient paasing
away soon after its completion.

 

M. Waldeck-Rousseau was born in Nantes,
France, Dec. 2, 1846. At that time his father
was a prominent member of the Assembly.
The son studied law at St. Lazare and prac-
tised Jaw there for several years before set-
tling at Rennes. There his political career
began in 1879 when he was elected Deputy.
Hoe soon became prominent in the Reo:
lican Union, which did much toward bring-
ing about the present republicanism. ie
was recognized as one of the best orators
in the Amembly. His best work was for
the reform of the judiciary.

In August, 1881, he was reelected, and
three months later, although but 35 years
old, he became Minister of the Interior in
Gambetta'’s Cabinet. But the resignation
of the Government in January of the fol-
lowing year came too soon for him to prove
his ability.

When Jules Fe formed his Cabinet
in February, 1883, Waldeck-Rousseau re-
gained his former post and served for
two years. His attempt to exclude politics
from the business of his department made
him somewhat unpopular with the office-
holders, In 1885 he was reelected to the
Chamber of Deputies. Four years later he
withdrew from politics and resumed his
law practice with distinguished success.

After President Périer resigned, Waldeck-
Rousseau was defeated for the Presidency
by Felix Faure. In 1809 he was called
upon to form his own Ministry, and after
being in office for three years he resigned
{n 1902. His Ministry had the longest
duration of any Cabinet under the Repub-
lican régime. The most important law

in his Premiership was the Associa-
tions bill, in 1901,

Shortly after his resignation illness made
his retirement nec He was operated
upon for internal trouble in May last and
had since been in fl] health.

A woman who was staying over night
ata hotel to be ready for the early morning
sailing of the steamer invited a young
relative to spend the twenty-four hours
in town with her. They decided to do a
little shopping, and after luncheon a hansom
was ordered, The elder woman, getting
in firat, settled herself in the near side of
the seat.

“My English friends have got me into the
way of taking the near seat in a hansom
in getting in first,” the elder woman said,
as they started off. “Although I'm eure
I don’t know just why the women should
always do it over there, except that some-
how it disposes of skirts and saves your
man companion the trouble of keeping
out of the way of them.”

The young relative understood that she
was being delicately instructed in one of
the minor rules of the code, ‘The next
morning she went to see the steamer off
and in the family group saw a cousin who
had been living in England for several

ears,
“Let me take you up to the station,” he
said. “I havea cab here.”

Accordingly, he assisted her into a han-
som, and putting her newly acquired infor-
mation into immediate use, she dropped intu
the near end of the seat, findin t her
full skirts seemed to stow ems elves
neatly in the corner. As her cousin sat
down beside her, he exclaimed:

“Do you know, you are the only American
girl I have yet run across who takes the
proper seat in a hansom? And English
women all dq.”

Special Cable Despaich to THE SUN.

Lonpon, Aug. 10.—The Archbishop of
Canterbury has issued a message to the
clergy and laity of his archdiocese in which
he says:

“During the last two months information
has been steadily reaching me as to the

invitation so cordially and kindly given.
I am arranging, also, to visit a few of the
great Canadian centres,

“My visit will involve an absence from
England of two months, from Aug. 18 to
Oct. 19. The journey is taken with the
belief that it may and will, in the providence
of God, tend to promote yet closer the unity
of our common work and to strengthen
our hands for combating evil fife both in

MRS, GOBLET SUSPECTED NONE

ADVISED TO LOOK IN HER SAFE,
SHE TOOK HER TIME.

 

 

Circular Describing Jewels as Missing
Sent Out Against the Advice of the
Pinkertons, but She Was Sure the
Jewels Ought to Be in Their Case.

The Pinkerton officials in this city seemed
to feel aggrieved yesterday because their
statement as to the manner in which Mrs.
Ogden Goelet recovered her long lost
jewels was not accepted in all quarters
at its face value.

“There never was any mystery in the
matter--at least as far as we were con-
cerned,” said Allan Pinkerton. “It was
simply a case of misplacement, You might
misplace your pocket knife, just as Mrs.
Goelet misplaced her jewels. We did no
work to speak of, simply because there was
nothing to be done until Mrs, Goelet had
completed going over the ground she had
covered since she last saw the jewels. This
of course, included the opening of the safe
in her house here in New York. We simply
sat down and waited for this to be done,
feeling pretty certain from the circum-
stances as related to us that there had
been no robbery and that the jewels would
be found where their owner had left them.

“at no time was anybody under sus-
picion of having taken the gems, and eves
the servants were not questioned, Many
of them have been with Mra. Goelet for
years and she would not hear of anything
being done that might lead thgm to be-
lieve they were suspected, even remotely, of
having a hand in the disappearance o' her
ewelry. She said that if the jewels were

lost she must have lost them herself
aH nig ge oie arate
8 e e
have been sent ped Pout Mie. Goelet was
very gure that she had taken the jewelr
with her te Newport from New York. We
suggested the

search of her safe here, and
she was urged by several others, includ-
ing her brother, Mr. Wilson, to go to New
York and open the safe. She was the
only one who had the combination.

“As to why she waited so long to take
this Hap + bere i say, S I know
nothing ut . ‘a socia) engage-
ments or how she rei planned to spend
her time. After our first mug gestion we
did not mention the matter to . Goelet
or her sepreecnial vee again, knowing that
she would open the safe when she saw fit ,
to do so.

“There was not the slightest excuse for
any one to drag in the name or a man who
had been a pues at Mrs. Goelet's Newport
house. As I told you, we never 6us
any one of stealing the jewels. As for
the man referred to, I never heard his name
before to-day. We stand pat on the state-
ment issued yesterday. That covers the
whole matter. There never was anything

uzzling or complicated about {t. Mrs.
Boelet Wound her jewels just where she
left them, and with that our interest in the
matter ceased. She took her own time
about coming to New York, and as she was
the only person interested, I don’t see why
any one else should get excited about it.”

George G. De Witt, attorney for Mrs.
Goelet, corroborated the Pinkerton version
of the finding of the jewels, which, he said,
had never been out of hia client's posses-
sion. It had been her custom, he said, to
put the pearls, diamonds and rubjes in the
case which she took with her to Newport,
but after she returned to New York from
her son’s wedding she inadvertently put
them in the safe in another package. So
sure was she that she had put them in the
case that she could not be induced at firet
to come to New York and open the safe.
She said she had always put the jewels
in that case and that they should have
been there when she opened it at Newport
on July 19.

Asked if any one had at any time been
suspected of stealing the jewels, Mr. De Witt

said:

“Not at all. Mrs. Goelet suspected no
one.”

Chief of Police Richards left Newport
on the Wickford boat this afternoon, and
it is supposed that he is bound for New
York to confer with Mrs. Goelet and the
Pinkertons.

ROESSLE, HOTEL MAN, DEAD.

Proprietor of the Arlington in Washington
Paéses Away iv Paris.
Theophilus Roessle, a well known hotel
man, who for many years was proprietor
vf the Arlington Hotel, Washington, D. C.,
died at the Grand Hotel in Paris yesterday.

Mr. Roessle's illness dated back six or
seven weeks ago, when he was thrown
into a state of excitement on a very hot
day through the erroneous news that Mrs.
Roessle was seriously ill, Upon the ad-
vice of his piysicin he went abroad two
weeks ago in the hope that a sea voyage
would benefit him.
panied him.

Theophilus Roessle was born on the
Schenectady Pike in the suburbs of Albany
Aug. 31, 1834, His father was a German
from Alsace-Lorraine and his mother was
English, The elder Roessle managed the
old Delavan Hotel at Albany, and when 15
years of age Theophilus started in with him
there to rm the hotel business, He
retained an interest in the Delavan House
up to the time of his death. In 1869 he
went with his father to Washington and
opened the Arlington Hotel. From 1861
to 1890 he ran the Fort William Henry
Hotel at Lake George.

In Gov. Morton's administration Mr,
Roessle served as Quartermaster-General
on his staff, He was a member of the Old
Guard of New York and the American
Colonization Society and for several years
was president of the Hotel Men's National
Association. His real estate holdings in
this city and Washington are said to be
worth nearly $2,000,000.

Mr. Roessle’s first wife was a Mies
Osborn, and their two children, Elwood
Osborn Roessle, who was until recently
lessee of the Gilsey House in New York,
and Mrs, Edward N. Kenney of Albany,
are living. Five years after his first wife's
death he married Mrs. Nellie Taylor of

AENDRICK SCANDAL AGAIN,

WARRANTS FOR A. B. HUTCHIN-
SON AND MRS. HENDRICK.

Rich Boston Man’s Wife Hat Him Arrested
in Scranton, Pa., for Improper Cendnet
With the Wife of the Mam Whe Fig-
ured in the Laura Biggar Case,

ScranTON, Pa., Aug. 10—Arthur Burton
Hutchinson of Boston, a retired lawyer,
broker and investof, said to be a millionaire,
was arrested here to-day at the Lackawanna
Valley House charged by his wife with
adultery. The warrant was secured by
Mrs. Hutchinson, who followed her husbend
to this city, with detectives, from their
summer home in Chester, Vt. The warrant
was issued for Hutchinson and Mrs.
C. C. Hendrick, wife of Dr. Hendrick of

New York.

Mrs. Hendrick is stopping with her sister-
in-law, Mra, Frank Hallen, and the warrant
was not served on her. When Hutchinson
was arraigned before Alderman Ruddy,
Mrs, Hutchinson broke down and forgave
him. As they were leaving the office,
Detective C, B. Hall of New York city stepped
up to Hutahingon and arrested him on a
similar warrant on behalf of Dr. Hendrick.
He was held under 9600 bail for a hearing
Aug. 22, Dr. Hendrick is coming here
to-morrow.

Mrs. Hendrick said to a reporter to-night:

“It is some of the doctor's work. Hutchin-
son 18 my lawyer, and came to see me on
private business. I am suing for a divorce
now. I had been with Hutchinson only
one hour. Dr. Hendrick has had detectives
around the house for a week watching me.”

Agnes M. Hendrick ie the wife of Dr.
Charles C, Hendrick, who was a co-de-
fendant two years ego with Laura Bigger,
the actrees, in a conspiracy trial at Freehold,
N, J., which became notorious. Hen-
drick and the actress, together with Samuel
Stanton, a justice of the peace of Hoboken,
were tried on a charge of _conspir to
get the estate of the Tate Henry M Ben.
nett of Pittsburg by alleging that the
woman was Bennett's widow and that she
had had a child cee

The whole t hinged on whether
such a child by Bennett ever
existed, but the jury of Monmouth county
farmers astonished the country by acquit-
ting the woman and convicting both men.
Hendrick got out on, bail pen a new
trial, and Pies on the vaudeville stage

th ra ar.
™ ay their troubles began the actress
had lived atthe doctor's sanitarium at
Bayonné and Mrs. Hendrick swore out a
warrant for their arrest, but when the Free-
hold trial came on Mrs. rick went there
and ag: to stand by hér husband if he
would pro! to leave the Biggar woman
as soon as the case was ended. His dra-
matic promise to do that, made in the
Monmouth County Jail, with the actreas
standing at the cell door and approving,
was one of the incidents of the case.

All through the trial the wife set beside
the accused actress in the court room with
her arm about her, pissing her at fre-
quent intervals. After the rial when Dr.
Hendrick began to travel.about the country
with the actress, Mrs. Hendrick explained
the court room scenes at Freehold by say-

ing:

f kissed that woman in the court to make
the jury think that I believed in my husband,
but every time I her I whis to
her that I hated her for stealing my husband
from me.”

A year ago Mrs. Hendrick sued her hus-
und for separation and for non-support.
At the same time she sued Laura Biggar for
$50,000 damages for the alienation of the
doctor's jail-worn affections. Orders for
the arrest of both the doctor and the actress
were issued and after that they did their
theatrical stunts in theatres outside of New
York county

The case » Rot another airing last January
when Hendrick went to his wife's home in
Brooklyn and selzed his nine-year-old boy,
Thomas, and got out of the State with him.
Since then Mra. Hendrick has secured her
decree of separation and the doctor has
begun a counter suit for diverce, He has
been living recently with his children on
Laura Biggar’s farm in Chester, Vt.
