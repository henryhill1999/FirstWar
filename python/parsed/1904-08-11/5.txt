SIGLIGHT WINS FOR MADDEN,

PLAUDIT. COLT TAKES 810,000
GRAND UNION HOTEL STAKES.

 

 

Odds of 80 to 1 About Him—Jockeys Red-
fern and Hildebrand Fall . Heavily
—Caughnawaga’s Handicap—Hayes
‘ Stable Takes All the Steeplechase Purse

SaRaTOGA, Aug. 10.—John E., Madden fur-
nished a stunning surprise here to-day when
his colt Siglight, by Plaudit—La Creole, won
the $10,000 Grand Union Hotel Stakes, for
two-year-olds, six furlongs, It was only by
a head that Siglight won, the @nish being so
close that many thought Jack Lorey had
carried the day by a nose until the official
placing was hoisted,

Siglight went up to 80 to 1 at the close, and
by his success the books won thousands of
dollars on the race. Sydney Paget's Cairn-
gorm and Jonquil were coupled favorites at
11 to 10, while Jack Lorey was heavily sup-
ported at fours. James R. Keene's Van
Tromp went up to fives, while there was &
generous play on R.T. Wilson, Jr.'s, Sparkling
Star at eights,

The start was perfect, and 8. 8. Brown's
Glen Echo, a 40 to 1 shot, rushed to the front,
attended by Sparkling Star and Van Tromp.
This.order was maintained for a quarter
of a mile, when Cairngorm moved up to sec-
ond position, In the middle of the stretch
Glen Echo weakened, and Cairngorm took
oommand, looking the winner, but the Paget
colt tired also at thejJfinal furlong pole, and
about one hundred yards from the wire Sig-
light, who was last on the far turn, came on
with remarkable gameness under H. Phillips's
vigorous drive.

Jack Lorey closed strongly, too, and the
trio passed the judges 60 close together that
the crowd was wild with excitement, Jack
Lorey beat Cairngorm a head for the place,
with Sparkling Star a length back. The
others were not far away. Jonquil ran @
very poor race,

There was an accident inthe third race, at a
mile, which was a narrow escape from a
fatality. Just after the start Trepan and
Irascible were jammed together by the crowd-
ing in the big fleld, and both fell, their respec-
tive jockeys, Redfern and Hildebrand, tum-
bling headlong under the feet of the flying
horses. Both boys were severely shaken up
and sustained numerous painful bruises,

F. R. Hitcheock’s Greencrest, even money
favorite, won the race rather easily by three
parts of a length from Newton Bennington's
Kickshaw, 6to1, the latter making the pace
to the last furlong pole and taking place
money from Canteen, 6 to 1, by three lengths.

Another successful even money favorite
was John Sanford's Caughnawaga, who
picked up 119 pounds and galloped off with
the handicap, at a mile and three sixteenths,
beating Claude, 14 to 5, by three lengths in
2:00 1-5. Dalesman, 4 to 1, who ran third,
was in front for a mile, with Mr. Sanford's
horse always within striking distance.

H. B. Duryea took first and second money
in the last race, for maiden two-year-olds,
five and a balf furlongs, with Dreamer and
Artful respectively. He declared to win
with Dreamer, so Shaw took up Artful
in the run home, Dreamer finishing two
lengths in front of his stable mate, who is a
fine looking colt by Hamburg—Martha II.,
and had not faced the barrier before. The
pair were coupled favorites at 4 to 5 and car-
ried all the plungers’ money, barring that
placed on Newton. Bennington's Salvage,
18 to 5, who showed in front for half a mile and
then blew up. Dreamer’s time was 1:08.

Shot Gun, with 128 pounds, was made a
slight favorite over Collector Jessup, 4 to 1,
in the handicap, at six furlongs, but the latter
made all the running and won in a drive
by a length and a half in 1:13 2-5. Shot Gun
had the same margin over Lonpania, a 100
to 1 shot.

H. H. Hayes had three starters in the
steeplechase, Grand Pa, Cock Robin and Hark
Forward, and they took all of the purse,
finishing in the order named. They were
coupled at 1 to 2 in the staight betting only.
Philma Paxton, who was played from 8 to 1
to 8 to 5, broke down at the Liverpool. Four
favorites and a second choice won for the
form players. The weather was threatening
and the track slow.

TO0-DAY'S CARD FOR SARATOGA.

Molly Brant Will Be Played to Win the
Delaware Handicap.

SARATOGA, Aug.-10.—The Delaware Handi-
cap, for three-year-olds and upward, at a mile,
appears to be an interesting feature for to-
morrow., John Sanford'’s Mfily Brant will
probably be heavily backed, with Gold Money,
Graziallo and De Reszke finding much favor,
too. Africander has top weight in the handi-
cap at a mile and an eighth, but Major Dain-
gerfield, Eugenia Burch and Fort Hunter

 

will undoubtedly be played to beat him. |

Of a big field of two-year-olds in the first race,
at five and a half furlongs, Niblick, Cotillion,
Consuelo II., Teacress, Thirty-third and
Tramotor are the best, while in the third
event, a handicap for two-year-olds at three-
quarters of a mile, Burnt Hills, St. Bellane,
Veto, Khorasan and Bulwark figure promi-

nently. In the fifth race, for platers, at a mile,
there are some fair performers, including
Unmasked, Naughty Lady, Stolen Moments
Old England, Dick Bernard, Jane Holly and

O'BRIEN TO CORBETT.

&
Philadeiphian Tells Why He Befused to
Sign to Meet Ex-Champion.

Jack O'Brien of Philadelphia came to town
yesterday for the purpose of arranging the
proposed bout with Jim Corbett. He looked
for the ex-champion and failing to find him
visited Al Smith at the Gilsey House. Smith
holds O'Brien's forfeit of $1,000, which the
Quaker posted a few weeks ago in support
of a challenge to Bob Fitzsimmons and Tommy
Ryan. The money has not been covered,
Smith said.

Regarding his willingness to meet Corbett,
O'Brien said: “When I said Iwould not fight
Corbett unless he came to 175 pounds I meant
it. Why should I give away weight to a man
hke him. He is a heavyweight, while I am
only in the middleweight class. But I will
aplit the difference and agree to arrange a
contest with bim if he weighs 180 pounds.
This is all the concession I will make, and I
think I am_ liberal. In regard to splitting
the purse, I made the request because he
wanted most of the money to fight me, I
think I am as good a drawing card as he is
and that I am entitled to some consideration.

“[ have received two offers for the encounter
already. One is from Charley Haughton of
the West End A. C. of St. Louis. He 1s ready
to give us 70 per cent. of the gross receipts
for a 15 or 20-round bout, as suite Corbett.
The other offer comes from sporting men
who &re ready to give us a4 like sum, hope
Corbett will accept, for I am satisfied we
woulddraw well. {[ would rather fight Corbett
fifteen or Wrenty rounds, but if he insists
six rounds will do me.”

 

 

Questionable Entries in Junior Track and

entries made by the Greater New York Irish
A. A, were questioned, and two were rejected,
One was W: Edgar, who represented the
Atlis A. C. a couple of weeks ago, and the
other was Taylor, who banged to the New
Brunewick Y. M. ©. A., and who wore the
colors of that Br RRnt esr On recently. Goe-
bisch, a basketball player, also Was under

asked to explain who they were. The Irish
A. A. had two pole vaulters and a quarter
mile man, but no one knew whether they
were amateurs or professionals, and al! that
could be said in their favor was that Hjerts-
bere, the professional trainer, said they were
all right, They were only registered when
they urrived at Celtic Park.

INSTANCE OF MADDEN LUCK.

 

Grandpa’s Rider a Boer War Veteran
—More About the Lanterman Case
—-Narrow Escape of Hildc«brand and
Redfern—Artful Better Than Dreamer.

Sanaroaa, Aug. 10.--Jt is an old story
to tell of the luck of John E, Madden when it
comes to winning rich stakes with horses
that look outclassed, yet to-day the surprise
that he furnished must be told of, The vic-
tory came in the (rand Union Hotel Stakes,
of which the winner's share was $8,500. The
money was won by Siglight, a colt that only
the other day Madden himself said was just
an $800 selling plater. The betting to-day
showed how little his chances were consid-
ered, for as good as 80 to 1 was always obtain-

| able against him, and some of the few that

backed him obtained 50 to 1.

That the price was a false one all will ad-
mit. fe was beaten the last time he ran
by a very ordinary lot, but if one could forget
that one race there was every reason that
he should be played. In the race previous

, to the bad one referred to he had run Cairn-

gorm to a head. To-day with the weights in
his favor he was at 30 to 1, while against Cairn-

; gorm, who was coupled in the betting with his
, Stable mate Jonquil, there was even money.

The list was seruti- |

There was a host of strange names |!

There was no reason for this difference, and
after the race the wise ones were disgusted
at their oversight.

Madden thought his oolt had a fighting
chance and sent in a commission of $100
all three ways. Ho adwised some of_ his
friends to bet, too, and some of them cleaned
John A. Drake
was one of the fortunates who accepted the
tip, but he did so with but littie confidence
and his commission was nothing like what it
would have been had he taken the colt's
chances more seriously.

The finish was very close, and some of the
followers of Jack Lory, who was beaten a
head, thought they had won. Those near

quarter had been run,

,| with Light Brigade and he just escaped go-

ing over the fence. He did not fall, but it put
him out of the struggle and:his rider did the
sensible thing, pulled him up.

Some of the bettors who watch the develop-
ments in the paddock were impressed with
the spirit shown by Kickshaw and backed
him. Hé ran a race away above what was
generally looked for, and those who playéd
him for place and to show are now convinced
that this was his day. Yesterday one of the
keenest judges in the country in hie rounds
of the paddock backed Carbuncle and when
asked why he did said: “Why, he is as spry
as a two-year-old.”

It must be the air here that brings this
unnatural spirit, for the rule againet the
use of artificial stimulants is looked after
by a man assigned for that work especially.

Caughnawaga's victory in the handicap
was of a most impressive order, and it looks
now as if this son of Clifford will be a factor |
in all the big events to be run this fall. He

get a big increase of weight. Still he has
proved that high impostes do not bother him,

he must be rated as dangerous, no matter
what the opposition may be. '

the finish agreed with the judges absolutely; ,

in fact, a man who saw the race from the
official enclosure said the victory was earned
by a short neck; that is, was not close enough
to warrant any of the talk that came as an
aftermath. Madden has never rated this
colt very highly, but his showing to-day
seems to make him of the improving order,
and the chances are that he will keep him
out of selling races for some time to come.

opinion over the finish in some quarters and
the slow time gave the faultfinders plenty of
ground for complaint.

Many were surprised to see Yon Tromp

This with the difference of ;

a starter in this race, for when he was cut |

down the other night it was believed he would
be on the inactive list for sore time. This
was the opinion of his own party, but the next
morning the cuts healed nicely, and it looks
now as if the accidents really did not harm
him,

The steeplechase was for gentlemen riders,

and four braved the trip through a4 slippery |
field. Their venture brought the best results, °

for there was but one accident, and this was
not a fall, Philma Paxton, who was ridden
by Mr. Stone, breaking down after taking
the Liverpool the second time and forcing
her rider to pull her up.

The three that were left in were practically
in one interest, Cock Bobin and Hark For-
ward carrying the colors of W. C. Hayes,
and Grandpa, the winner, ran in the inter-
est of Mr. Hayes’s wife, who was described
on the programme as H. H. Hayes. The fact
that the three were coupled in the betting
made the backers of the trio very easy after
Philma Paxton broke down, for as one of
them put it, the three could fall down and
refuse half a dozen times and then come
on and get the money.

Bert Holland, who piloted Grandpa to
victory, is one of the best known of the many
clever riders from Canada. He is a little
fellow, full of grit, and the stiff course here
held no terrors for him. His friends here,
and they are many, tell a story of how his
size kept him from enlisting inone of the
Canadian regiments that went out to the
Boer war. When he was rejected Mr. Holland

Last night when word came from one of
the arbitration committee of the Metropoli-

tan Turf Association that Frank Lanterman '

had settled the claims against him by checks
that had been mailed from New York, it was
believed the incident was closed and that
Lanterman was prepared to get back in line
and make an effort to recoup; but to-day's
developments make it look as if the state-
ment was made with the idéa of stopping a
scandal that came with the affair. Several
of the parties who patronized him on Satur-
day said to-day that they had not received
any checks, nor had any been suggested.
They say that when the settlement comes
it will be in the form of notes and that they
will have a long time to run.

BIG FIGHT SEEMS ASSURED.

All Forfeits Up and Men Training Hard
—Munroe Very Confident.

Word has been received from San Francisco
that all arrangements for the ohampionship
fight between Jim Jeffries and Jack Munroe
have been completed and that the fight will
take place as scheduled, before the Yosemite
A. C., on Aug. 26. The posting of all the
forfeits, a matter which had been overlooked
and which threatened to prevent the contest
from taking place, has been attended to.
Fifteen thousand dollars, representing $5,000
from each pugilist and the club, is now in
the hands of Harry Corbett, the final stake-
holder. This money was placed with him
yesterday. 2

Another matter which fora time appeared
to make the scrap doubtful was the trouble
over a referee. u was originally
named and agreed on. But Munroe’s mana-
ger took a dislike to Graney and said that
under no circumstances would he accept
him. This objection has now disappeared,
and Graney will act.

The rivals are working away with might
and main to get into the best of condition.
Jeffries's condition seems to be allthe more

ratifying in view of his recent Indisposition.
fis trainers say he never was better. The

ig fellow, who naturally carries a lot of
weight, is fast getting down to fighting trim.
It is sald that he weighs only 235 pounds,
which should be reassuring to his admirers,
who heard that only a few weeks ago he
scaled in the paebbor ood of 250 pounds.

Munroe is plodding away. Unlike some of
those who have faced Jeffries before, he is
not in the least afraid of the outcome, In
fact his confidence is of the refreshing kind
and has made him a lot of friends. He is
very active and does not seem to tire, even
after a hard day's labor. He boxes, runs,
punches the bag, and is only happy, appa-
rently, whenonthego. Monroe expects soon
to have Kid McCoy as sparring ner.
McCoy, it is said, is on the way to the Coast.
He will be a big help to the miner, as he
understands him _ thoroug ly. having put
him on edge for his fight with Tom Sharkey
in Philadelphia.

AUTO CUP RACE RULES,

American Clob Makes Radical Departures
in Conditions for 1908.

It was made plain yesterday that, in spite
of its two failures to get together a come
petent team for the international oup race,
the Automobile Club of America has no in-
tention of relinquishing its prerogative in this
matter to the national body, the American
Automobile Association, Instead it has de.
cided to make a radical departure and start
early totry to get entries forthe big race under
conditions that it is hoped will preclude a
repetition of the fizzles of 1903 and 19064.

The announcement of the conditions that
will govern American entries for the race,
which must be made through the Automo-
bile Club of America, was made yesterday hy
that body. They present interesting propo-
sitions. The entries are declared open from
now until Dec, 15, but the entrants will have
until April 15 to place the cars at the din.
posal of the race committee. Each entry
must be accompanied by $600 deposit, as
usual; but this is not all.

In order to prevent the disastrous practice
of having cars completed just in time for the
testa and turned over from the shop to the
committee for trial, it is required that before
April 15, 1905, each entrant must file an aff.
davit, signed by two responsible persons,
declaring that the car has been entirely com-

leted for a period of more than four weeks;

hat it has been driven over 1,000 miles on the
road; that it has been driven over 250 miles
without stopping the engine; that it has been
driven more than forty miles in less than sixty
minutes on track or road.

The foregoing provisions are the mtos
radical in the new set of rules, but the others
are wholly new also. They provide that
the racing committee shall decide which of
the entrants is to compete in the race, and
may do so by a contest, or otherwise, but that
all cars must be at the disposal of the com-
mittee on and after April 15. Entrants who
are not ready on that date, or who decline
to undergo the testa prescribed by the com.
mittee, will be disqualified and their entry
fee forfeited.

Entrants who are ready on time, and who
comply with the instructions of the com-
mittee, but who are not nominated for the
race, will have their entry fee returned. En-
trants who are nominated for the race, but
who do not start, will forfeit their entry fee.
Those who are nomina and do atart, if
there are three of them, will have refunded
to. them two-thirds of their entry fee, less
their proportion of the cost of holding the
race. If only two candidates are nominated,
and they start, they will have refunded to
them one-half of their entry fee, leas their
proportion of the cost of holding the race.

All entrante must submit the names of the
intended driver of their car, and the driver
must be approved by the committee.

These rules laid down by the club are, of

urse, supplemental to the perules rules
ior the cup race, and apply only to the pre-
liminary work of selecting a team to repre-
sent this country.

AUTO TOURISTS IN ST. LOUIS.

Sixty-five Machines in Line, Including Globe
- Croumnavigators.

St. Louris, Aug. 10.—The main body of the
automobile tourists to the world’s fair com-
ing to St. Louis to attend the national auto
meet ‘crossed the Eads Bridge shortly after
4 o'clock this afternoon and moved trium-
phantly up Washington avenue to the Jefferson
Hotel. There were sixty-five machines in
line. The cars had their rendezvous for the
advance across the bridge at City Hall Square,
East St. Louis. They began arriving there
between 1 and 2 o'clock, and the arrivals

at frequent intervals. When it seemed
that all the stragglers had arrived, the start
was made across the bridge.

George H. Lowe, W. G. Schmunk and J. H.
Sheldon, who came from Boston, had, perhaps,
as successful a ride as any other of the tour-
ists. They left Boston at noon two weeks
ago last Monday. On the entire journey
they did not even have occason to tighten
a bolt. All of the tourista reported that the
roads had been found g with the ex-
ception of those between Chicago and East
8t. Louis.

Among the ‘arrivals were Mr. and Mrs.
Charles J. Glidden of Boston, who are on 4
tour of the wend in a 24 horse-power car,
accompanied by Mrs. Hooper of Boston,
and with Charles Thomas of London as their
engineer. Since they started on their trip
they have travelled 17,677 miles and Din
seventeen countries. They have been travel-
ling 150 days, and before t! ey ertite down in
Boston they wili have travelled 40,000 miles.

Theirs is the first automobile to pave crossed

Increasing Wind and Rough Water Tell
Against White Bear.

MonTREAL, Aug. 10.—The Seawanhaka
cup remains in possession of the Royal St.
Lawrenoe Yacht Club, the defending yacht
Noorna to-day winning the fifth and final
raceof theseries from the American challenger
White by 2 minutes 48 seconde. It
was a fine race, and during the early stages
it looked as if the American challenger was

ound to capture the trophy.

When the race atarted there was a fine
nine-knot breeze and the water was smooth.
Then it freshened up to about twelve knots
and with the increase in velocity of the win
the lake roughened considerably and there
conditions told heavily against White Bear.
On the second beat Noorna was able to get to
windward and finally crossed White Bear's
bow'and from this point until the finish maine
tained the lead. Flapsed time: Noorna,
1:57:58; White Bear, 2:00:46.
