segregation ordinance, which has been
in bis hands for examination fora week,
This removes any possible obstacle

hefore the week i ended it will become
a law, as the Mayor has repeatedly ex-
pressed bis intention tostgn it provided
no legal complications arose.

The measure provides that no white
family can move into a block where a
mnajority of the residents are negroes
and no negre can occupy 4 residence
in a block that is inhabited principally
thy whites

There bas been much discussion as
to the legality of such a measure and dis-
Fonmination as charged, but it is pointed
lout by the supporters of the ordinance
jthat of werks both ways and therefore
leannot be called discriminating.

SCRANTON, Pa. Dec 16. ~ Louis Conrad,
Conrad Lotz and W. M. Bingham, operat-
ing the Correspondence Institute of
Amernca at 37 Lackawanna avenue,
were arrested thix afternoon by
United States Marshals Hugh J. Evans
and Samuel Hofford charged with oper-
ating a scheme to defraud through the
United States mails.

The affairs of the concern have been
under investigation by officials of the
Post Office Department for three months
and the arrest to-day of the principals
in it management ts the result.

The complaint against the institution
alleges that these men have devised a
scheme to defraud in conducting an
alleged correspondence school for teaoh-
ing art by mail and that they claim in
therr advertising literature that they
have a corps of qualified artists on the
teaching staff and that a famous car-
tooniat is closely connected with their
instruction

An investigation, it is alleged, shows
that the concern has no facilities for
teaching art by mail or otherwise apd
that the so-called art course is not what
it is represented to he.

The Post Office Department has reo
ceived over 30) complaints from atudenta
throughout the country who allege that

‘they have heen defrauded by the oou-

cern. Nearly 70,000 studenta have been
enrolled in the schools during the las@
