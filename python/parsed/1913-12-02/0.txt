Lonpon, Dee. 1.-The Berlin corre

covery that the Crown Frincess Cecilie

from an American woman who conducts

As there was good reason to

CARRANZA ATD WARNS U,

Constitutionalists’ Foreign Mine

ister Says Intervention

Must Be Avoided.

 Carransa Minister Warns U. S. !

El Paso, Dec. 1.—Francisco Eseu-
dero, Foreign Minister in the pro- |
Visional Cabinet of Venustiano Car-
ranza, who is now here treating
with Villa, to-day sounded a note
of warning from the rebels to the |
United States relative to interven.
tion or mediation.

“The fall of Huerta is inevitable
aud the only slight hope for him
is the United States,” said Escudero. |
“Any arrangement made hy the
United States with the de facto
Government will) work ruin for
Mexico and will not be recognized
by the Constitutionalist party. It
is impossible for the United States
to dominate twenty million Mexican
people, for we are of a rebel race
by right of our Indian and Spanish
blood. Nobody will ever dominate us.

“As Minister of Foreign Relations
[I say that if the United States
knows how to deal with us they do |
not need to worry about the Jap-
anese, for Mexico will be the coun. |
try back of the United States to
defend the Panama Canal.

“We of Mexico do not fear Euro- ,
pean intervention. The only thing
we do fear is the bad will of the
United States toward us.

“Let the United States be our
sincere friend and treat us with pa-
tience and in the end the United
States will have our hearts.

“When we run Huerta out of
Mexico all banking concessions in
| the republic will be cancelled by the
Constitutionalist Government. for
they have been run on a basis of
grafting.

“There is no friction between
Carranza and Villa, for Villa is cone |
sidered the supreme military mil
mander of Chihuahua.”
