THE FINANCIAL SITUATION.

Neotther in respect to underlying condi-
tlons nor to their superficial exhibition
im the security market was there any re-
markable change last week in financial
affairs. The stock market continued its
narrow, hesitating, indifferent and _list-
less course of the month past. The
habitual professional operators sold stocks
one day and bought them the next,
and then on following days reversed this
Policy. All of them without exception
confessed themselves without settled policy
or definite views regarding the future of
the market either for a short space of time
or for a longer period. In general in the
earlier part of the week pessimism over the
outlook was inoreased, which was, how-
ever, modified later on when evidences
were presented that the market had be-
come more or less sold out and oversold;
| and themost specific basis for this conclusion

| was the failure of prices in general to recede
| under the almost sensational decline in the

Gould stocks. It is the time of the year
when the security market normally acts
in Just the manner that it is now doing.
The present is a between seasons period
when important fluctuations in security
prices are usually rare. A large propor-
tion of those who take the lead in financial
matters in the country are at this time
on their winter vacation. There is a
general impulse on the part of the
rank and file of speculators to give
the stock market a rest for reasons
pertaining to mere personal fatigue; and
there is an equally general realization that
the financial forces that will be paramount
during the year, euch as the statejof the crops
and those pertaining to politics, will not
begin to unfold either for good or for bad
until a few monthe later. This year owing
to the universal languor in a financial sense
that prevails as a result of last year’s period
of storm and stress the effect of all these
matters is notably increased. Beyond all
this what the doctors would call the prog-
nosis of certain particular atocks or groups
of stocks has in recent weeks been a de-
cided general stock market factor, and
were it not for the circumstance that a low
range of prices had been established would
undoubtedly prove to be a distinct cause for
unsettlement. What Wa)! Street is wonder-
ing about is whether in the case of not all or
the greater number but of some existing
railway organizations not merely dividend
distributions but bond interest can be main-
tained on the present scale of decreasing
earnings, and naturally enough until greater
light ia thrown upon the question the matter
will be a drag upon general security values.
The partioular drop in the Gould stocks
last week was rather puzzling to the ma-
jority of people in the financial district.
One explanation of the fall was that the
declaration of scrip instead of cash divi-
dends upon the Western Union and Missouri
Pacific shares had brought into the Street
a large quantity of additional stook of each
one of the companies named because of
the desire of the small investors who re-
ceived the scrip to turn it into ready money.
Another story was that a large loan upon
some of the Gould stocks was being closed
out, a theory to which some plausibility
was lent by the fact that the declining move-
ment was not limited to one or two but
embraced nearly all the Gould securities.
The recent earnings statements of the
Missouri Pacific, while they have been poor,
do not indicate that by any possibility a
receivership of the roads is near at hand,
and it is known that the Missouri Pacific
has been toa less extent than that of any
other of the leading railway systems of
the country a borrower of money in the
last few years. The truth probably is
that although all these factors contributed
in some way to the decline, speculative at-
tacks upon the Gould stocks had as much
to do with the fall as anything else.
Stories that the Union Pacific company
was again to appear as ap applicant in the
money market, this time asking for a loan
of $35,000,000 or $40,000,000 to extinguish
ite floating debt and furnish money for
other immediate necessities, were again
heard last week and received a partial and

Pacific shares, which were weak under thie

the commission to enter upon such ag
immediate investigation of the relations
between the railroads of the country and
their employees as would disclose whether
any basis or not existed for a proposed
reduction in railway pay schedules. A
mere order of-plain and simply worded
character to the commission to take this
step would have been bad enough, because
it would have been a totally unnnecessary
act. The Interstate Commerce Commis-
sion has through the medium of the weekly
reports of railways that it has long accumu-
lated and in the vast amount of other similar
data in its possession sufficient information
ready at its hand for its use for the purpose
described; while no such controversies
have as yet arisen between the railroads and
their men as were laid down in the Erdman
act as those alone justifying the interven-
tion of the Government authorities as peace-
makers.or arbitrators. But the President
in his letter to the com mission demanded
that it be shown whether any cause for
reducing pay schedules had its origin in
“misconduct in the past financial or other
operations of any railroad” and whether
“the excuse of unfriendly legislation was be-
ing put forward as a justification for failure
to treat fairly the wage earning employees
of the country.” There were many otber
sentences in the letter of similar import, and
the whole document was in ite legitimate
inferences nothing more or less than
a notification to the railway em-
ployees of the country, and was uni-
versally #o interpreted by them, that in any
contention between them and their em-
ployere the President of the United States
would be on their side. Now whatever
may be thought of the causes remote or
otherwise of the present business prostra-
tion in the country there is no one who is so
poorly informed concerning existing con-
ditions as to be willing to buy for invest-
ment railroad stocks or with any other
than extreme circumspection and hesita-
tion railroad bonds when the railroad in-
terests of the land are menaced in any
sich way as the foregoing. Unless railway
earnings are to increase in the immediate
future the necessity for a reductio: of the
pay of employees, on certain lines at least,
is 80 plain as to be disputed by no one but a
madman. While 350,000 freight cars in the
country are idle and when the volume of
railway traffic in the country has slumped
with a violence never before seen in our na-
tional life railway pay schedules are still on
the level established in the boom times a
year ago. The railroads are at present
standing in this position, that while they are
not allowed on the one hand to raise their
rates for freight transportation and have
even been compelled in many cases tolower
them despite the heavy increase in the
cost of performing the service; they must
on the other hand still continue to pay to
their operatives the compensation awarded
in days when business prosperity was at
its height. What chance have railway
revenues in such circumstances and why
should any one look further for a more
sufMficing reason for the strilaing exhibit
made by all the railroad lines of the land
in the last few months of a decreased gross
business accompanied by increased operat-
ing expense? We have come to this in this
country, seemingly, that two classes of the
community, the agriculturists and the
labor unions, are asserting the right to be
treated by the laws and by publio officials
as entitled to privileges not accorded to
any others. They are to be at liberty to
indulge in boycotts and in agreements to
maintain prices and to continue practices
that when committed by any other citizens
are loudly stamped as crimes; and the
proposition is seriously laid down that the
Government ought to go even further and
avert from these classes as distinguished
from other people in the community the
consequences of natural law and the opera-
tions of the forces of supply and demand
Political demagoguery can go no further
than this.
