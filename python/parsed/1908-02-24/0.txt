FIVE BORNE ALIVE ON PILOT
A QUARTER OF A MILE.
Doung Folks From Spring Valley Run Down

While Driving From Nyack—Three {
ef the Dead Girls—One More Likely |
to Die—Natiroad Men Blame Driver.

A carryall containing five men and four
women who were on their way home to
Spring Valley after having agtended* a |
basketball game in Nyack was hit by the
Ontario and Western Mountain Express
at the West Nyack crossing early yesterday
morning. Four of the party were killed
outright and two died later. gfhe other
three are in the North Hudson Hospital in
Weehawken, and it is likely that at least
one of them willdie. The dead are:

May, NELSON, 23, the driver.

PAUMER, JEANEZTH, 20, daughter of P. B. |
Palmer, the Valley Spring druggist.

ReITA, GEORGE, °°, manager of the Valley
“pring basketball team and of the local tele-
phone company

SINGER, Benrua, i*, daughter of Leonard
Singer, a stone mason.

SinGey, EpivH, 20, sister of the above.

SLINN, GBoues, 35, a carpenter and a mem-
ber of the hasketbail team.

The injured are Warren Palmer, 28 yeara
old, whose sister was killed; Henry Dietor-
lein, 241 years old, a slipping clerk for a
York wine house, and Edith Bird,
laughter of Mrs, Washington Bird, a widow. |

Palmer and Dieterlein were also members
of the team which had met the Nyack five.
Meterlein ig the most seriously injured. |
His spine is affected and he is suffering from |
internal injuries. :

One of Miss Bird's arms
was broken andyboth she and Palmer sus-
tained internal injuries and scalp wounds.

The carryal] with its party of eight and
the driver left the Nyack Opera House a
few minutes after midnight. The Valley
Spring boys had been beaten in the inter-
county contest 32 to 8, but there had been
» dance in the opera house after the game
and ail of the Valley Spring folks had for-
gotten the defeat in the good time that
followed. There was a second stageload
of Valley Stream rooters, but that one
didn't leave until about fifteen minutes
after the carryall, and the occupants of it
were all men.

The carryall was a side seated affair.
Bertha Singer, Reith, the manager of the
team, and the driver sat in front. The
others sat three on each side. Heavy cloth
curtains buttoned at the bottom closed in
the sides and the rear

The Nyack turnpike crosses the West
Shore road, over which the Ontario and
Western rune its trains from Cornwall,
within fifty feet of the West Nyack station. |
The travel on the turnpike is heavy and
a flagman is always stationed at the crossing,
which is further protected by gates.

Conrad Kaufman was the flagnan on duty
early yesterday morning. According to the

tatements which he made to the Coroner
ufier the accident he had lowered the gates,
+s waa his quetom, shortly before 12 o’clock.
He had seated himself in the flag station |
then and eaten his luncheon. }

After that he went over to the station
to fix the fire, which was part of his regu-
‘ar uight duty. It was while he was in the
station poking the fire that he heard the
train rush past the station and then the
«rash as it hit the vehicle.

The Mountain Express ia one of the On-
tavio and Western's through trains. It
was due at West Nyack, southbound, at
*: 6 o'clook, but it was 12:40 when it came
theough. Railroad men estimated that it
was making between sixty and sixty-five
miles an hour when it hit the carryall.

CHURCH.

for Patt
Question te Vote on Sunday.
Morristown, N. J., Feb. 23.—The passage
of resolutions at the service of the First
Baptist Church this morning advocating

LOCAL OPTION IN

 

) the passage of the local option bill by the

Legislature caused a lively exchange of
opinions between members of the church.
The Rev. Oliver C, Horsman, the pastor,

' read the resolutions and immediately called

'
for a vote. Almost everybody voted for |
the adoption. When he called for nega-
tive votes a deacon got up and said he was
against the resolutions because he thought
their passage at that time was a mistake.
He was followed by a trustee who jumped
up and shouted: .

“This is a church, not a political meet-
ing. I vote no,”

The resolutions place the church on
record as in favor of the bill and oppoged
to ite being sidetracked in favor of any
other reform measure, however good. In !
a disoussion that followed the service the
pastor was assailed for presenting the
reeciutiong while presiding and for not
giving an opportunity to those opponnd |
to present their reasons before voting.

“Call a meeting during the week and dis-
cuss such matters.” said one member.
“Sunday morning is no time for play.”

A friend of Mr. Horsman asserted that
the pastor had a right to talk on any re- |
form movement on Sunday or any other
day

 

 

No STAGE KISS THIS,

But en Public View, Nevertheless, for the
Shade Was Up.

Whether it is that persons resident in
Harlem are not now accustomed to kiss,
on a sort of analogy that the electric car
has replaced the bus, or whatever be the
reason, the sight of two persons engaged
in exercising the art of osculation attracted
a great crowd in a Harlem street about 7
o'clock last night. As the persons, male
and female, are to be nameless, so as well
might be the name of the hotel and its
exact location, save to remark’that it is
O®@ 125th street, and so alao were the persons
at the time of the kiss, and afterward, on
the third floor, two windows to the south
from the avenue corner.

It was a long kiss, this, although no
official time waa taken. The curtain of
the window to this room was up when it
began and that is how _ Harlem became
aware that a kiss was in ite midst. One
by one, as crowds do, a crowd gathered
ina street below. Every variety of Harlem
wit was ventured as the size and proportions
of this kiss became momentarily more of |
record magnitude. Eventually after the
crowd grew to about a hundred or so and
the kiss was continuing with no signs of
losing strength some one bethought him-
self of letting the hotel office know.

An involved telephone message, with
hints of the Soul Kise, Olga Nethersole
and the like not inobvious remarks, puzzled
the clerk, who did make out that something
was toward on the third floor that was not as
it should be. So up went a haliboy and
down ceme the shade. FEatimated time of
kiss, about eighteen minutes.

Some time after the eurtain had. been
pulled down a midister, as he said he was, |
called up the hotel on the telephone to say |
that he had been passing et the time the |
curtain was up and didn’t think it at alla |

nice public exhibition on a Sunday. |

{RMED MAN FOUND MURDERED.

Mody Lay Where a Giri Had Been Threat.
ened by a Masked Man,

An Italian girl walking on the railroad
track from Kensico Cemetery to Valhalla
on her way to Sunday school yesterday
afternoon passed a man with a red hand-
kerchief around his throat and a mask
over his eyes just about a mile from Val-
halla. The man spoke to her in Italian
and what he said frightened her so that
she ran away.

About an hour later at 8 o'clock an en-
gineer on a New York Central railroad
train saw a man's body lying on the tracks
at about the place where the girl met the
masked man. There was a bullet wound
in the back between the shoulder blades
and another in the left ear.

Daniel W. Quinn, Justice of the Peace
at Valhalla, and Coroner Squires of Ossin-
ing viewed the body. Sheriff Charles Lane
sent out his men to look for the murderer.
The dead man had on his body a watch
and $7inbills. Ina hip pocket was a loaded
five chambered revolver. There was a
razor in another pocket. From the fact
that the man had no outer coat and the
sack coat he wore was turned up at the back
to get at the revolver, which was half way
out of the pocket, Justice Quinn assumed
that he was walking along all prepared
for an attack.

The murdered man was employed as a
grass cutter last summer in the Kensico
Cemetery. His wife, it was understood,
was out yesterday with a shotgun looking
for the man who did the shooting. She
wouldn't say whom she suspected. A
search is being made for the man with the
mask. .

SPORT AMONG THE ICEBERGS

 

FRESH MEAT WHEN THE SKIP-

PER BAGGED A POLAR BEAR,

 

But the Mate Took First Prize When a |

Berg Torned TRtie with Him and He
Tobagganed Into the Bunt of the
Forestaysall

Through the shorthand expert of the
combination the ultramarine reporters were
able yesterday to enter in their log a few
remarkable adventures that befell the good
Gloucester fishing schooner Oregon, in yea-
terday by way of the Sound and East River
with a cargo of frosted herring from Bay of
Islands, Newfoundland. The adventures
did not occur on the trip from Newfound-
land, which,barring a stab in a tgick snow-

storm at the Brenton’s Reef lightship, was |

placid as you please. The lightehip just
Miss cd a ramming, but Capt. Albert Fly-
gon.’s man at the wheel got the schooner's
helm hard over just in the nick of time.

It was before she got to Newfoundland

happen to her, as faithfully and stenographi-
cally reproduced. She was fishing for

halibut, sometimes with lines dangling in |

300 fathoms of icy water. For days the
crew had been living on fish, canned goods
and salt horse and they were longing for
beefsteak. The schooner was weaving in
and out among a fleet of tall bergs when
Capt. Flygone sighted a white bear on one
of the biggest. He has a shotgun, a single-
barrelled piece, and he went down in the
cabin and brought it up, saying, “Boys,
we're going to have beer steak for dinner.”

He moulds his own slugs for this gun.
They are of brass and never have been
known to mise. The helmsman put the
schooner close alongside the berg and the
skipper blazed away. The bear toppled
over, his spinal column severed just south
of the neck.

The yawl put off and brought the bear
aboard the Oregon. The men wanted to
cut up the carcass in an unscientific way,
but the skipper would not let them, know-
ing that a perfect bearskin acquired under
such peculiar conditions would be valuable.
In fact, the skipper says, he refused to
soll it to a fur company that offered him
$300 for it and now has it at his home in
Gloucester. At any rate he didn’t show
it here.

The men liked the bear steak very much
and the ship sailed on and away from the
iceberg fleet. Many days passed and the
fresh water supply gave out. The skipper
had no distilling apparatus and they de-
pended on the snow foratime. They were
two days without fresh snow when another
berg was sighted. The skipper decided to
chop a few hundred pounds of ice from
the berg.

The schooner hove to as close to the base
of the berg, which was 200 feet tall, as he
dared to go, the yawl was launched and
Mate Ed Hansen and a party of four men
boarded the berg and went to chopping ice.
The mate is an venturesome fellow, and
after the yaw! had bpen loaded down he
told the crew to shove off a bit and return
for him later, as he was going to the top of
the berg to make an observation. He was
about half way up the berg when a piece
of it about as bigas the new Fulton Market
fell off into the sea. The berg instantly be-
gan to turn turtle and the mate to turn
somersaults in his efforts to keep aboard,
He was like an acrobat on a barrel rolling
under him. Fortunately the rolling of the
berg was not so swift as the motion of the
mate in heading against the roll.

At last the berg settled. But between
the mate and the sea where his astounded
shipmates were there was a slippery slide
of several hundred feet at an angle of nearly
forty-five degrees. Crawling down was im-
possible and the mate had toslide. He wore
oilskins, and they protected him a bit as
well as expediting him The Oregon was
hove to directly opposite the mate's po-
sition, with forestaysail beflying to the

headed directly for tife forestaysail and
landed in it like a projectile in a canvas
target in a crack Yankee battleship. And
the remarkgble part of it was that he still
held his hatchet in his hand.

The shock of the impact set the schooner
going before the wind and the mate climbed
out and apologized for his abruptness in
coming aboard.

“The Federai Government, realizing the

regards future developments of the ap-
pearance of such a great body of warships,
decided in December to end a cordial invi-

“If the invitation is accepted the recep-
tions given to the fleet at Rio de Janeiro

CONDEMNED BY ARCHBISHOP.

 

Certain Pretended Priests Who Get Up
Dances and Solicit Money.

A letter was read in the Roman Catholic
churches of the city yesterday from 4rch-
bishop Varley warning the parishioners
against certain persons who are soliciting
money in this diocese. It reads in part aa
followa:

“It has recently come to our knowledge

that persons from outside the diocese call-
ing themselves clergymen, or brothers of a
religious order, arp soliciting throughout
this vity without aify permission from the
diocesan authorities funds for supposedly
religious purposes, about which we have
received no instructions from their Bishops.
“We have learned also that those clerics
and brothers have been organizing dances
in public halls of this city to which they
invite Catholic women and charge for ad-
mission. On the occasion. of. these dances
no restraint is placed upon those who at-
tend and arrangements are being made for
other gatherings in the near future
“This abuse has become so prying a scan-
dal that we are forced to order a public
denunciation .of it in ail churches. We
therefore cannot tolerate persons from
outside dioceses of whom we know nothing
corring to this city and flagrantly violating
the statute of the council, to the scandal
and injury of souls.”

ANARCHIST FIRES FATAL SHOT
WHILE TAKING SACRAMENT.

Denver, Feb. 23.—Father Leo Heinrichs,
pastor of St. Elizabeth's Catholic Church.
was shot dead at the altar at 6 o'clock this
morning as he was administering the sacra-
ment to Alio Giuseppe, an [talian anarchist.

Father Leo placed the sacrament on the
man’s tongue and he pretended to swallow
it, but a moment later spat it out with an
expression of disgust. drew a revover and
shot the priest, who spoke only once before
dying. ‘

The assassin then fled but was caught as
he reached the church door by a street car
conductor and a policeman. He tried to
shoot both of them but failed and was
cluphed into submission.

Giuseppe was among the earliest. to arrive
at the church and hurried to the altar soon
after entering. He has made a statement,
glorying in his act. He said

“I just went over there because I have a
grudge against all priests in general. They
are all against the workingman. I went to
the communion rail Because I could get a
better shot. I did not give a damn whether
he was a German priest or any other kind of
a priest, They are all in the same class.
I am an anarchist, by God, and I am proud
of it. I shot him, and my only regret is
that I couldn't have shot the whole damned
bunch of priests in all the churches.”

Giuseppe was locked up in the county
jail. Soon news of the murder spread
through the city and angry men began to
gather about the jail. There were free
threats of lynching, and to-night the dan-
ger of mob violence became so apparent
that the Sheriff and a party of deputies
took the prisoner from jail secretly and
took him to Colorado Springs for gafe-
keeping.

Paterson, N. J., Feb. 23.—News of the
murder of the Rev Father Leo Heinrichs,
Order of Franciscan Monks, who was shot
to-day by an Italian anarchist while he was
officiating at mass in a church in Denver,
was received by the Rev. Father Edward
Bleake, provincial of the order, at St. Bona-
venture monastery, in this city, that being
the pater house of the organization in this

country.
Father Leo was born in Germany,
August 15, 1867, in tie diocese of

Cologne. When Bi k drove the mon-
astic orders from Germany Father Leo
came to America and enteredethe order at
St. Bonaventure in this city on December
4, 1°86. He made simple profession De-
cember 8, 1887, and took the solemn vow

beth’s Church. He entered upon his duties
there on September 28, 1007.

The news of Father Leo's death was re- |

ceived at the monastery in this city with
calm joy. “Would that I had been in his
place,” said the provincial. “What greater
reward can come to a monk than to die in
God's service and thereby attain to a mar-
tyr’s crown?”

Duel made this statement:

“Following a coMwultation on Mr. Edison’s
case I opened an acute abscess in the middle
ear. The operation was not serious, and

WON'T SHOOT AT THE FLAG,

Confederate Guards Refuse to Play in Sham
Battle If Opponents Carry Stars and Stripes.
Dauuas, Tex. Feb 23.—For several
weeks arrangements for a sham hattle on
March 10 at the National Fat Stock Show
‘in Fort Worth have been in progress The
| participants are to be the Confederate
! Guard of Dallas, an oganization of sol-
diers of the South in the war between the
States and an army made up of Texas
i national guardsmen.

The final meeting for arrangements was
held last night. Capt. Daniel of the Con-
federate Guard announced that his com-
mand would not participate if the militia-

| men used the American flag.

{| “Under no circumstances will we fire
jon the Stars and Stripes, not even in a
| sham battle,” declared Capt. Paniel. “We
| stopped doing that in 1865.”

 

 

Rather than have the sham battle aban- |

doned the managers of the event decided
to have the national guardsmen use some
other set of colors.

The Confederate Guard will carry the
fle, of the Southern Confederacy in the
mimic conflict.

 

BILLY SUNDAY THREATENED.»

 

Detective Guards Famous Baseball Evan.
selist Daring Decatur Crusade.

Decatos, Ill.,Feb. 23.—So many threaten-
ing letters have been received by the Rev.
Billy Sunday, who is conducting a five
weeks religious revival here preliminary
to the local option campaign in April, that
the local pastors’ association has employed
a detective to watch over the evangalist,
guard him to and from meetings and watch
the house he occupies.

In his leisure moments the detective will
look for violations of the Sunday liquor
law and laws against gambling. It is
reported that he has got much evidence of
such violations.

Twelve of the city churches have united
in the meetings being held by Sunday in a
tabernacle holding 6,000 persons. The
purpose is to “clean up” the city, vote out
saloons in the April election, stop gambling
and make Decatur a moral town.

 

FRANCO PLOT DEFEATED.

Portuguese Reactionaries Tried to Stir
Up Riots in Lisbon.
Special Cable Despatcs to Tas Sux.

Lonpon, Feb. 24.—The Lisbon ocorre-
spondent of the Daily Mail. telegraphing
by way of Madrid, refers to the many sensa-
tional reports of plots to overthrow the
Government. He says there was undoubt-
edly a reactionary plot by the followers of
former Prime Minister Franco with the
object of causing public riots, which would
give an excuse for the resumption of re-
pressive measures.

The coup was planned to occur on Thurs-
day night or Friday. It was almost suoc-
cessful. An armed crowd assembled in the
streets, but the authorities, realizing that a
conflict with the troops was part of the re-
actionary intrigue, confined the soldiers to
their barracks and thus averted trouble.

Gerolamo Cela Found Dying tn Office After
Taking Steps te Change His Will
—WPolice Hold His Brother and Step
son—Poison Used to Vell a Crime.

‘

Gerolamo Cella, one of the partners in the
firm of Cella Bros., importers of wines
and wholesale groceries a¢ 528 and 530 Weat
Broadway, went to a lawyer on Saturday
to get advice on the matter of changing his
will. He said at the time that he was going
away from home, never to come back.
At 1 o'clock yesterday morning be was
found by his brother, Domenico Cella,
lying in a heap on the Moor of his darkened
office in the West Broadway store with his
skull fracured by a blow from a hammer,
his throat bruised by the marke of fingers
and an empty vial which had containe/
concentgated sulphuric acid on a table beside
him.

When the police wore called in hy Domen-
ico Cella they acoopted the case as one
of suicide, persuaded, as they were, by a
letter, believed to be in the handwriting

| of Gerolamo Cella and signed with his name,
which said that the writer was going to kil}
himself. Later Coroner Harburger learned
some things which convinced him that
murder had been done. The police, making

a rapid change of front, arrested Domenico
| Cella first as a material witness and later
| rearrested him as a suspicious person.
| They aiso held Cesare Rianchi, a stepson
of the dead man, as a witness,
| Coroner Harburger was supported in his
belief that Gerolamo Cella had been mur-
dered by the opinion of two doctors and
evidences of an unusual character in the
office of the West Broadway store. Coro-
ner’s Physician Schultz, after making an
autopsy on the body, declared that there
was enough poison in the stomach to kill
three men and that no man after taking
that much concentrated sulphuric acid
could have had the strength to dent in his
skull to the depth of an inch with a ham-
mer. F.qually impoesible was it, said Dr.
Schultz, and his opinion was corroborated
by Dr. Murphy, an ambulance surgeon of
St. Vinoent’s Hospital, for any one to have
dealt himself such a blow with a hammer
and then to have swallowed the acid after-
ward.

Aside from the fractured skull and the
poison in th. dead man’s stomach there
was a broad trail of blood twenty feet long
in the office where the body was found
and the marks on Vella’s throat and wrist.

Gerolamo Cella lived with his wife on the
top tioor of a tenement building which he
owned at 25 and 27 Wooster | . the
lower floor of which is occupied by a con-
fectionery factory owned by his
Bianchi. Cella was considered one of the

ys

wealthiest men in the Italian colony. Oa"

Saturday night he bad dinner with his
wife and left his home shortly afterward
in the best of spirits, according to the story
she told the police yesterday, to go to Rigo-
letti’s restaurant at 100 West Houston street
to play cards with friends His nephew by
marriage, C. Razzetti, a cigar dealer on
Broadway, was one of the players at the
restaurant.

About 11 o'clock the. card game broke
up and Cella left for his home. Domenico
Cella, who had been Gerolamo’s partner
for the last forty years, told the deteotives
yesterday that he had rarely known his
brother to visit their office on West Broad-
way at night. In going from the Weat
Houston street restaurant to his home
on Wooster street Gerolamo Cella would
not necessarily have to pasa the store on
West Broadway.

Ae far as the police could learn last nigh’
no one accompanied Cella from the restau-
rant on his way home and the hours be-
tween 11 o’clock and 1 o'clock, when the
wine mercnant was found dying on the
floor of his office, cannot be accounted for.

Domenico Cella, who lives at 124 West
Thirteenth street, dined at Cella Bros.|
restaurant, 157 Prince street, on Saturday

| night and passed his whole evening there.

| This is the story he told yesterday to the
detectives:

He started to go to his home shortly
before 1 o'clock and walked up West Broad-
way. When he reached the store, juat

| noticed that the padlock was off. Think-
| ing that a robber mizht be at work inside
he drew his pass key, unlocked the spring
| lock beneath the padlock and let hinsself
: into the store. He saw a dim light in the
| office, which stretches across the whole
width of the store at the rear.
Making his way down the lane between
| piles of wine crates on eith>»r sida, :
| Cella opened the door at the right hand end
of the glass partitioned office. The office is
not more than six feet wide and oo
a safe, near the door, a long desk a
sink at the further end.
Between the safe and the long desk
| Domenico saw in the light of the single gas
burner that wag lit the form of hia brother
| Gerolamo, in a half sitting posture against
| the back wall beneath the windows that
| look out on the blag wail behind th» store
| Back of his shoulders was a cughio. taken
from one of the office chairs and his folded
overcoat.
| Abeavy clawhammer, stained with blood,
| lay on the floor of the office some distance
| away, and on the edge of the desk was a

| small bottle ceatalning the droga of & yellow-
| ish white fuid. Domenica told the datec-
tives this story of what followed imme-
diately after his discovery:
“My brother was stil] alive and breathing
heavily. Blood was all] over his head aad
face and blood was on

“He not speak, but he lifted his
hana and pointed to himself several times
Then he became unconsciaus.”

Domenico Cella ran out of the store after
summoning an ambulance from St. Vincent's
Hospital ny telephone and fond Policeman
John C. Kluber on post at the corner of Weet
Broadway and Bleecker street. He told
Kluber what he had,feund and Kluber noti-
fied Capt: Miles 'Reilly of the Mercer
street station. Detectives Michael Lon-
dregan and Michael Fitzgerald were sent
down to Cella Bros.’ store,

When Dr. Murphy of St. Vincent's arrivgd
with the ambulance Gerolamo Cella was
still alive but unconscious. A stomaap
pump was used and efforts made to revive
him, but he died before he could be moved

” the hospital. The doctor fuund tnat he
