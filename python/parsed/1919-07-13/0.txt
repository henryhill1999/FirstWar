WASHINGTON, July 12.—The deposing |
‘of Senator Hitchcock (Neb.) as leader |
| of the Administration forces in the |
{Senate fighting for the League of Na- |
tlons and pubilcation of this fact to-!
day caused a small cyclone in the!
, Democratic ranks. Denials galore were |

Joseph P. Tumulty, the President's |
secretary, although not in the city,|
caused a statement to be issued over!
luis: signature to the effect that the;
reports “of a disagreement between |
President Wilson and Senator Hitch-
cock ‘are without the slightest found-

ator Martin (Va.), the real Demo- |
cratic leader who is ill at present, also)
issued a denial of the published re-!
ports. He sald, “This is entirely a!
,mistake,” and then added a number
‘of pats on the back for Senator Hitch-
icock’s conduct of the league fight |
\leretofore. He asserted that Senator |
'fUitehcock would remain in charge of

}the teaigsuc fight. t
}, From the office of Senator Hitchcock |
a statement was issued which wis not
in any sense a denial of the reported
snubbing of the S: by the Presi-
dent on Thursday, which was witnessed |
by a number of persons, nor of any
other part of the stories appearing in
| this mornims’s newr;apers. It merel? |
told where Senator Hitchcock is
j when he will return, that he h
relinquished his interest in the
/and that he has worked very hard for
it hititerto.

Mr. Tumulty in his denial was at);
pains to call the important conference!
| with the President at the Capitol on
| Thursday an informal meeting and to;
'potnt out that Senator Hitchcock was
| present. It is true that the Nebraska
‘Senator was there for a few minutes.
'The real conference was with Sena-
,tors Swanson, Phelan (Cal.), Williams
(Miss.) and Pittman (Nev.). {

It was regarded as significant here}
that the White House dental of the
| friction between the President andj
Senator Hitchcock was issued by Mr
; Tumulty, who {s at Deal, N. J., while
; the President, .in Washington, said
; nothing. For the last two and a half,
| years the rumor has persisted that Mr, {|
; Tumulty is not nearly #0 close to Mr.|
; Wilson as he was in the early days|
j}of the Administration, when Senator |
| Hughes (N. J.) was alive. The first}
{unmistakable sign of this was seen here|
| following the President's reelection,
| 1916.

The latest evidence of this fact was
| seen on Wednesday, when Mr. Tumulty
assured some of his friends that the Pres- |
j ldent’s speech to the Senate would fully

j explain and meet every argument

‘against the League of Nations, which |
‘was not borne out when the President
| spoke Thursday. It caused a great deal
|} of comment when Mr, Tumulty failed to |
jaccompany the President abroad on

j either of his trips.

Another sample of this lack of Matson |
| between the President and his secretary |
{concerned the question of prohibition, |
|Mr. Tumulty giving the clear tmpression |
j; that the President would put ap end to
‘the war time dry act Almost as soon as
| the President reached Washington, how- |

| tg do nothing with that end In view um |

Paris, July 12.—M, Clemenceau sent,
a note to-day to Baran von Lersner,|
head of the German peace delegation, |
officially notifying the Germans that, |
having received official notification of |
the ratification of the peace treaty, the |
allied and associated governments had |
given orders that the blockade of ei
|

{

‘many should be raised to-day.

The French official note authoriz-
ing the resumptien of commercial re-
lations between France and Germany
was issued here to-day, effective to-
day. The note prescribes regulations
providing for the issuance of permits
on certain classes of merchandise.

These regulations require that per-
mits be obtajned for the exportation to}
Germany. of any merchandise on the
prohibited list. No merchandise origi-
nating in or coming from Germany
may be imported into France without
a special permit from the Minister of
Finance and the Minister of that de-
partment of the Government particu-
larly interested in the product.

The German delegation at Versailles
was informed to-day in a letter from;
the Peace Canference that the ratifi-|
cation of the treaty of peace by Ger-|
many had been accepted and the}
blockade would be raised. A French
Government decree regarding the
blockade will appear in the Journal
Official to-morrow,

Lonvon, July 12.--With a view to
raising the blockade the Board of
Trade has {fssued general licenses
under trading with the enemy legie-
lation outhorizing, with certain re-|
servations, the’ resumption of trade
with Germany and German-Austria. |

The licenses do not remove the ican
isting restrictions upon the’ payment |
of debts and the return of property |
due or deliverable to persons in Ger- |

and German-Austria with re-
spect to pre-war transactions.

Great Britain also is preparing to re-
sume her consular service in Germany
soon and to give every facility for}
British firms to distribute goods there,
says the Daily Mail. A special commit-
tee of the Foreign Office is selecting men
that the Ambassador to Berlin will be |
appointed in the near future.

It is expected that Germany will send}
a Charge d'Affatres here, but that no
German Ambassador will be named for
some time. Travel to Germany will be
restricted, the newspaper says, but bona-
fide commercial travellers will be given
facilities to go anywhere they desire.

recent action in reducing the prices of

CONSTANTINOPLE, July 12.—Enver
Pasha, Talaat Bey and Djemal Pasha,
the leaders of the Turkish Govern-
ment during the war, were condemned
to death yesterday by a Turkish court-
martial investigating the conduct of
the Turkish Government during the

| war period.

Enver and his two leading associ-
ates in the Young Turk Government
fled from Turkey several months ago

;}and their whereabouts is uncertain.

Djavid Bey, former Minister of Fit-
nance, and Alusa Metssa Kiazim, former
Sheik-ul-Islam, were sentenced to fifteen
years at hard labor.

The ceurt-martial acquitted Rifaat
Bey, former President of the Senate, and
Hachim Bey, former Minister of Posts
and Telegraph.

Enver Pasha was leader of the Ger-
man militaristic element in Turkey and
was Turkish Minister of War. He vir-
tually was Turkey's dictator after Tur-
key entered the war

Talaat Bey formeriy was Min
the Interior for Turkéy. He was 1e-
sponsibie for the {nternal government of
Turkey, and, therefore, it was held by
the Allies, for the massacre of the Arme-
nians lie was Enver Pasha’s chief
political rival.

Djema) Pasha was Turkish Minister
of Marine. He also was commander in
chief of the Turkish operations in
Egypt.

Enver rose to power from humbte sur
roundings. His father was a carpenter
at Stamboul, and for an act of faithful-
ness Abdul Hamid promised that
son should be educated as an army
officer and the Red Sultan kept his
promise, Enver became a eaptain and
on the Turkish revolution rose from
that position to the leadership the
