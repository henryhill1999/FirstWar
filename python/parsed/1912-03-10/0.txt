Hyde is ecting as his own counsel in the

matter and will continue as his own |

counsel! up to the time of the actual! trial,
when his affairs will be taken in hand by
Max D. Steuer. One reason for the
hange of position on the part of the
former Chamberlain may be that he
was advised that the refusal of a

hange of venue by the Appellate Di-
vision might prove not to be appea lable.
The District Attorney was out of town
ast night.

The meeting of the Comptroller and
the ex-Chamberlain yesterday was ob-
served with interest from the windows of
the City Hall. The two men shook hands
and chatted for several minutes. Many
ef those who witnessed the meeting
were surprised, because they thought
that there was extreme bitterness be-
tween the two, in view of the fact that
Mr. Prendergast was the first to blame
Mr. Hyde for leaving 80 much city money
au the Carnegie Trust Company when
it closed down, The company was in-
debted to the city to the amount of about
suo,000, When Mr. Hyde sought to
throw the blame for the large deposit
on the city’s banking commission the
Comptroller retorted that, while ths
commission was supposed to have super-
vision of the deposits, the Chamberlain
Lad always been allowed to distribute
the funds in his possession as he pleased,
and added:

practice, because the great disparity

that during my service in the Senate I
have by word spoken or vote cast been
untrue to the people of Mississippi.

The Senator refers to an alleged
promise he is charged with having
made that he would resign his seat if
he failed of reelection in the primary.

He explains that his pledge that he
would resign had reference to hia re-
| quest for an extraordinary primary to
|be held in 1910 instead of 1911. His
| offer, he declares, was not accepted.

“Any staternent to the contrary

to a letter received in London from Rabbi

It seems that a Christian boy was found
