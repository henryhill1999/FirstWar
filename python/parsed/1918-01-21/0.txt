Executive Committee of the Workmen's
and Soldiers’ Deputies.

Armed eatlor guards closed around
Tauride Palace, where the Assembly was
held, early Saturday morning and the
effort of the Russian revolutioniets to
organize a stable Government came to a
close. An official statement, explaining
the dissolution, was issued aa follows:

When the Constituent Assembly
voted against the declaration made by
the President of the Central Execu-
tive Committee after an hour’s de-
liberation, the Bolsheviki left the hall
and were followed by the Social Revo-
lutionist of the Left on the Assem-
biy showing its unwillingness to ap-
prove the manner in which the peace
pourpariers were being conducted. At

4 o'clock this morning, the Constituent

Assembly was dissolved by sailors.
To-day a decree dissolving tho As-

sembly will be published.

Meanwhile the All Russian Rai!way-
men's Congress has passed, by a vote of
278 to 61, a resolution supporting the
Constituent Assembly and calling upon
the People’s Commissioners to agree
with the majority with a view to the
formation of a Government responsible

reasons.

Reports of the troop movements fully

indicate that the Germans are preparing
for a double attack at points far sep-
; arated on the western front. The lo-
| calities aleo show that the British would
| be forced to bear the brunt of one at-
tack and the French the other, since the
distances would not permit of the rapid
or immediate transportation of forces
from either section to the other.

A sTeat concentration of German
forces in Belgium, where several hun-
dred thousand fresh German troope have
arrived, composed principally of the best
units withdrawn from the Russian
front, 'ndicates, in their opinion, that
the British line in Flanders soon will be
subjected to intense pressure.

Saloons Will Be Open, but Pa-

Heat or Light.

——$

 

Restaurateurs, saloon men, tobacco
venders and cabaret managery met in
their associations yesterday and de-
vised expedients for restricted business
to~lay under the Garfield order.

The restaurants will provide just
enough heat to keep patrons from shiv-
ering. They ‘will sell Mquor. That is,
they say they will. Reeve Schley says
they won't; that he will see to it that
they don’t. Saloons will be open until
sundown only, because they are not per-
mitted to have elther heat or light.
Barkeeps may keep warm by the simple
process of shaking cocktails. For cue-
tomers the rellef ts obvious.

The tobacco shops will continue busi-
nes@ as usual, except that heat will not
be provided and the only light they ex-
pect to shine is the feeble and fiicker-
ing candle ight. Cabsrets will be open
but will be closed to-morrow,
their managers having adopted the pol-
ley dectdai on by theatre owners

Liguor Sales un Sunday Basie.

The Society of Restaurateurs met 266
Stroug a% Reisenweber’s last evening
and adopted resolutions put forward by
Thomas Healy and Patrick Kyne. These
Yevolutions aet forth that all restau-
Tauts must close thelr bars, must dis-

; Dense with heating and that the fullest

obedience Le given to Dr. Garfield's or-
der. The IHquor selling end of the busi-
ness will be conducted on a Sunday basis
—bDang closed and drinks sold only tn
the dining reams with food.

The Retail Liquor Dealers Associa-
tion met at Terrace Garden and resolved

to meet not only the jietter but the spirit:

of Dr. Garfield's inancate. Their resolu-
tions provided that Nght and heat mus*

; Not be used on Blue Mondays, and that
1 on ordinary days as little of either as

can be got along with be provided. In

{the whole eclty 10,000 saloons are af-

fected by the interdiction. In Manhat-
tan alone there are 4,500 salcons where
the thirsty may seek cold solace. Tho
action taken under the chairmanship of
Willam MeClenaha: was virtually
unanimous,

Hotel Bars to Close.

The bar of the Hote! Manhattan will
be closed to-day. Both bars at the Bilt-
more will be “dark,” as the theatre men
eay. The Ansonia will close ita bar. Tha
Waldorf-Astoria will shut off restaurant
service upon the roof and will discontinue
dancing there, but the rooflesa‘ice rink
will remain open. The Hotel Majestic
will start a soft drink bar as an expert-
ment, going into training for the sad,
sad days of perpetual prohibition,

The theatres will be open to-u'eht and
the Shubert and Keith houses will give
matinee performances. The mannrgers
said yesterday that President Wtlson
had told thern he wanted the theatres
to be “wide open’ on Mondays so that
{Ge poople would have proper entertain-

ment Some managers said that the |
resolutions adonted by the United
Managers Protective Association and

a'gned by Marc Kiaw, !ts president, had
given an impression to the public that
Monday matinees will not be given. One
manager sald that there !3 apt to be a

{Pennsylvania and Other Car

riers to Refuse Freight Of-
fered at Depots To-day.

 

Special Despatch to Tus Bun.

Wasthinoton, Jan. 20.—In the face @&
adverse tdansportation conditions, due te
the recent drop in temperature, Dr.
Harry A. Garfield, the Fuel Adminis-
trator, and Secretary McAdoo, Director
General of Railroads, to-day prepared
for the supreme effort to-morrow—the
firet coalless Monday—to move fuel
supplies and to relieve the freight con-
gestion generally in the East. For
thousands to-morrow will be a holiday

‘for the purpore of conserving fuel, but '

‘or the railroads it will be twenty-four

'
f
| hours of work, with passenger travel re- .

stricted to a minimum that freight trains
may have the preference everywhere and
| coal the priority.

| Just what conditions will prevan
| throughout the many cities and towns
; affected by the fuel order remains to
be seen. If the public accepts the epirit
of the order !t wil] abstain largely from
business effort, for again it was
stressed to-night by Dr. ‘Garfield that
all stores and retail estabdlishmerte
were expected to close, food and drug
stores only being excepted, and that to
| burn lights was to burn fuel.

 

 

| Bamke Will Remain Open.

That the day may not be quite the
holiday it was expected to be, however,
is indicated by the fact that no general
closing of banks seems to have been ar-
ranged for. Legal difficulties apparently
have stood in the way of this.

The principal coa) carrying roads, per-
tieylarly those tapping the mining re-
gions’ like the Philadelphia and Read
Iig, (re Batttmore and Ohio and others,
were cleared as far as possible of al!
traffic except coal. Wherever genera/
freight could he diverted to other lines
in a position to carry it such diversion
was made and efforts of the coal roads,

| particularly the baitimore and Ohfo, are
be'ng centred on coal movement, both {1
‘loads and enipties going back to the
mines. As a result car supply to the
{mines is approaching normal.

Despite the prevalence of zero weather

over a large part of the East and in the

‘central States the Fuel Administration
stated the steady flow of fucl to do-
mestic consumers and to tidewater was
feneral’y renorted

“At southern Atlantic ports 107,700
tons of coal had already been delivered
for Alling bunkers of sh'ps and £99,000
tons were en rovte. At one Southern
port 30,900 tons were delivered for ships
to-day With 150,000 tons of bunke:
coal éither already arrived or en route
for North Atlantic ports railroad offi

_clals reported that these shipments were
being expedited.”

  

Twenty-four Hour Day.

' At both Northern and Southern ports
the organization and machinery for
bunkering vessels was operated all of
last night and to-day wherever possible
Twenty-four hour operation will be con

     
     

tinued throughout the period of ays
pended {ndusiria! activity.

At the Fue! Admin'stration was
said there had been a complete change
of feeling in the country regarding th
necessity for the curtailment of the use
| of coal and that cooperation was practi
eaNy general. Hundreds of telegrams

! came to Dr. Garileld, assuring him that
‘employees would be pald for their time
during the closing period. Chambers of
ecommerce and manufacturers associa-
tions throughout the Fliast wired they
would observe the spirit the order,
Nothing, Fuel Administration offictals
said, ean pre t thousands of evasions
of the order {f the people affected do not
cooperate in the measure. For
instance, iwany bulldings house a aingte
physician or dentist, and {t would be vir
tually impossible to heat office

buiiding. Again, mnany apartment houses
