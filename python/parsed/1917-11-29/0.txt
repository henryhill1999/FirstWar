hypothetical question more than 12,000

The hypothetical problem, summarizing

three others were physicians who had
her after the shooting and
who emphasized her physical condition,
{ ssion of mental abnormalities being
largely reserved for later debate. The
doctors were J. Sherman Wight, Louts

Their testimony was all that the de-

contention that on the night of August,

Justice Manning moved from his chair
to inspect the X-ray ptate, closely. He
asked the jury if they would like to

Drastie Priority Orders to Be

Called Critical.

 

 

Special Déssatch (o ‘Tam Svx,

Waenixdros, Nov 28.—That the
United States is face to face with 4
aisastrous coal famine which would be
paralyaing in its effect on war industries
and would caus intense suffering in
the homes of the nation was the alarm-
ing statement .ssued to-day by the coal
operators of the country throumh their
crmapizetion in Washington. the Na-
florial Coal Association.

Ow the basis of a careful survey of
the pregent stocks of fuel on hand. the.
operator# estimated thdt there is on!
hard in the United States tess than a
week's supply and that with the ex-:
ception of a few sections of the country,
such ag the northwest, the enttre United
States soon will
tute of coal. Ordinarily there
hands of consumers of bituminous coal
a supply sufficient to last them about
thirty days.

An ind@ication that famine conditions
already are beginning to strike in was
received at the Fuel Administration in
an urgent appeal by telephone from A.
H. Wiggin, State Fuel Administrator for
New York. who described the situation
there as desperate, particularly as to
anthracite, and asked for tmmediate aid

from Washington. This was assured
him

Judge Lovett Takes Action.

Early in the day Judge R. S. Lovett,
administrator of priorities, issued an
order suspending the shipment of coal
to the Northweet via the great lakes,
but later It was decided this action
would not release anywhere near enough
coal for the destitute parts of the coun-
try.

With an appreciation of the situation
and the inadequacy of any local meas-
ure, the Fuel A mistration to-night
requested Judge Lovett to fasue an or-
der not only giving preference to al!
rail movements of coal and coke in the
United States, but also to the movement
of all enwpty coal! and coke c This
drastic order in the opinion ofthe Fuel
Adininistration is the only svulutton to
the congestion of fue) traffic ir. virtually

, every railroad centre in the country and

is the only way to prevent a tamine of
proportions no one can predicate.

While sirictlhy army and navy ship-
ments still will have prterity the order
requested by Fuel Administrator Gar-
fiel4 will compel the railroads to place
all shipments of coal and coke ahead of
general freight.

The plan to extend preference to
empty cars returning to mines and coke
ovens would operate to afford § the
greatest possible relief to coal and coke
producera who have been hampered in
keeping up their output by the shortage
of cars.

Garfleld Asks Qeick Action.

Fuel Administrator Garfleld _asked
that the proposed drder be made effective
at the earliest moment possible and that
{t be continued In force until further
orders, This would enable the Fuel Ad-
ministration to expedite the general dis-
tribution of the coal @upply and to
handle the wrniene coal etocks to the

ossible advantage
ar 4 coal operators said to-day if ef-
fective action was not taken Immediately
a rational calamity would ensue.

“The results of a famine would be
disastrous,” their statement said. ‘“Mill-

‘ions of household users of bituminous
would experience acute discomfort |

oa in many cases extraordinary hard-
ship. The great plants manufacturing
munitions in New England and the East
would be compelled to close down or to
run on part time.

“Already in several instances some of
the largest of these plants have on hand
a supply of fuel wholly inadequate for
their needs, Public utility plants, such
as water, gas, Mght and power plants,
throughout the entire country would be
forced either to suspend operations,
probably for days at a time, or to run
with greatly curtailed service.

“The latest report of the United States
Geological Survey shows that for the

of producing.

capable of producing the Geological Sur-

ability was directly due to a shortage of

nises that the railroads are congested
and crowded with freight far beyond
anything ever before experienced by
them, but thia does not change the fact

According to an agreement between

showed that the farmers iad lost money
by selling at $3.30 during December he
agreed to pernrit them to raise the price
at some time during the next six months

that they could not produce milk at

Nov. 28.-- President

since early in the war has exercised over
exports issuing a proclamation re-
quiring the licensing of most of the chief
import commodities

Action was taken under authority of

the public safety requires. Import
licensing will be put in the hands of the

Assumption of control® over importa
gives the Government another powerful
weapon, which will be used to its fullest
extent in the economic war on Germany.
It adda greatly to America’s commercial
power, already the greatest of any na-

both exports and imports, the Govern-

ment is in a position. too, to demand of

One of the chief advantages of im-
port control is that it gives the Govern-

over shipping. If tonnage vitally needed

can decline to issue import licenses and
thus divert the tonnage to essential!

LOSSES ARE TREMENDOUS

Major-Gen. Maurice of British
War Office Says Crisis in
Venetia Is Over,

 

LONDON, Nov. 28..--German first and
second lines have been broken with tre-
mendous losses, the Italians definitely
having defeated the enemy's efforts to
break the line from the upper Piave, ac-
cording to announcemé@nt from Rome.

ja action followed an encircling move-
ment, begun yesterday, when the Austro-
Germans made a massed attack upon
Malga Slappel. In this initial attack of
the day they were forced to retire, leav-
ing cumplete sections of machine guns
in the Italians’ hands.

Detaile of the subsequent fighting,

which ended in a victory for the forces |

of Gen. Diaz. are awaited anxiously.
For several days jt has been known that
the enemy was pieparing for a. still

Crisis Pansed, Says Maarice.

Major-Gen. F. B. Maurice, Chief D!-
rector of Military Operations at the
British War Office, announced to-day
that he was able to say definitely that
the crisis in Italy had passed. He added
that Anglo-French troops are available
in suffiéient numbers in Italy “to satisfy
us that the situation is secure.’ He fure
ther said that there had been no impor-
tant movement of German troops from
the Russian front.

General Maurice pointed out that Ger-

man inability to exploit the Italian dis- |

aster could be regarded as significant of
Austro-German weakness.

“The results which the Germans ai-
tained in their first attack," he said,
“were due solely to the successful
propaganda among the ignorant soldiers
of the uneducated peasant class. This
success far exceeded any German ex-
pectadion But, having gained this suc-
cess, it would be expected that the Ger-
mang would do all possible to exploit it
They have been able to do nothing be-

yond following up the Italian retirement |

Even now there is no sign anywhere of
the vast German reenforcements which
it might naturally be expected Ger-
many would rush up to strike a de-
clsive blow at the enemy. Why?
only answer is they are not there be-
cause Germany !{# unable to send them
She is unable to exploit the opportunity
offered.”

answering the numerous criticisms re- |
garding the Vatican's peace attitude, is- |

sued to the press to-day the following
statement:

“The Holy Father is not preparing
any new appeal looking toward peace.
His earnest desire, many times mani-
fested, for a just, Christian and durable
Peace is unchanged and cannot change.
Who can crave anything else and call
himself a Christian?

“To say that his Holiness favors or
has favored or will favor an unjust, un-
Christian and undurable peace is not
only false but also absurd. Any propa-
wanda for such a peace alleged to be
conducted at the Vatican's inspiration,
eapecially in certain nations, is the
product of pure maliciousness.

“A chain of prayer has always been
reprobated by the Holy See, and Bishops
and priests in the United States of
America and elsewhere are warned

against them, particularly those having |

any such propaganda behind them.

“Species of Saperstition.”

“Also American Catholics and others
are cautioned that such prayers are a
species of superstition.

“The Catholic Church has always re-
garded true patriotism as a Christian
duty and a Christian virtue, and still
so teaches. ‘The fact that the Itallan
Parilament has had warm eulogy for
the clergy should be sufficient to refute
the calumnies which
sons have circulated and are circulating
in the foreign world. Malicious insinu-
ations propagated in America and the
tendency to attribute in great part to the
Italian clergy responsibility for the re-
cent situation must be denounced.
Italy no fair minded person is attribut-
+ ing the situation to the clergy
“When the disruptive propaganda be-
gan to affect the morale of the Italian
army the clergy in general and also
‘ the army chaplains, following the
