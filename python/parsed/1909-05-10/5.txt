CURRENT SPORTING GOSSIP

- RACING. SEASON OPENS HERE
NEXT THURSDAY.

 

 

Persons Who Go to the Tracks to Bet This
Year Will Not Be Molested, as the
Courts Have Mado Some Things Ciear
~—Moeran May Fight Driscoll Abroad.

The metropolitan racing season opens
’ next Thursday afternoon at Belmont Park
| under modified conditions, but with pros-
pects that seem bright to thousands of turf
followers. The passage of the Agnew-
Hart measure last year was a body blow,
while the enforcement of it caused no end
of trouble and inconvenience for those
pérsons who made further attempts to
speculate on the races in a private, incon-
apicdous' manner. Persons who made
“oral' wagers” with one another were ar-
rested and dragged away to police sta-
tions, where they sent for bondamen, and the
next day were held for trials that have
never been placed before a jury. As @
result of all this so-called oppression the
racetracks were soon desolate places to
‘visit, and at the close of the season only
handful of regulars were in at the death,
Since last. fal], however, the Agnew-Hart
law has been taken before high judicial
authorities, who have made certain de-
cisions which are expected to govern the
attitude of the various officers of the law
in whose districts race meetings will be con~

ducted. While the courts have made it | 03-6 secon

clear that the law prohibits “bookmaking,”
defined as the “business of accepting and
recording bets, together with the display
of odds and the use of gambling para-
phernalia,” the point regarding the making
of oral bets or wagers has been settled in
thie war:

The Appellate Division of the Supreme
Court has ruled that a man can make an
oral wager on a horse race, after which
he can pay or collect the amount of his
Wager in cash. The Appellate Division
also has ruled that a man can quote odds
@nd accept as many wagers on a horse
race as he may see fit without recording

, Oa}d Wagers to keep track of his business.
Both of these decisions will be passed on
by the Court of Appeals.

-\oFrom these jega) rulings it is not hard
to get the impression that it is not a vio-
lation of: the law to make or take a bet
on.a horse race without passing ‘money
before the.event. The recording of wagers
is the ‘hinge on which the whole betting
situation turns. The Court of Special
Sessions, Justioa Hoyt presiding, deciddd
last year in the case of Charles Mahoney
of the Hoffman House that it was not a
violation of the law for a bettor to make
a private memorandum of his own wager.
This ‘also was the opinion handed down
bx Justice.Gaynor in the Sterling case,
tried {n Nassau county in the fall.

Although this particular point has not
been carried to the highest courts yet, it
fe a prevailing opinion among lawyers
that it will be finally established beyond
& question of reasonabje doubt that a bettor
can make a record of his own bet. It will

ot be surprising therefore if a test case

welops on these lines soon after the local
season opens.

As the situation is to-day, therefore,

mle can go to the racetracks and bet

orally on the horses without Lee oF arrest.

Although several riderafhave deciaredtheir
{ntention of capturing Frank L. Kramer's
title of national champion biocyole rider,
upto date they have not proved that they
are entitled to it, as Kramer has been win-
ning almost every event he has entered.
Yesterday at the Newark track the East
Orange rider won both of the professional
handicap races and at no time did he have
any difficulty in holding his own. The two
events which Kramer won were the half
mile and the five mile handicap races and

Sheppard Beaten by Hillman in Special

‘ Race at Celtic Park.
A fifteen mile scratch run was the leading
contest in a set of games given by the Monu-
ment.A. C, at Celtic Park yesterday. The

hero of the race was Jimmy Lee, the Bos-

tonian, now sporting the colors of the Mer-

cury A. C. of Yonkers. Lee won by about
a quarter of a'‘lap from Charles Muller of
the Mohawk A, ©. Until the last mile or 80
it was a dingdong affair between the Bais,

but Lee had a little more Hren th left and

it carried him to victory. ime for ten
miles of 55 minutes 50 abade was oe
tionally good for a fifteen mile jaunt. e

full time of 1 hour 27 minutes 57 seconds

is away behind therecord, but it was very

' Owen Moran, the English featherweight,
has just sailed for his home in Rirmingham
to take a much needed vacation. He tried
to get a third match with Abe Attell before
leaving, but theglatiear said he could not
fight because of aniniiured hand So Moran
has gone to theotherside, where, he says, he
will try to get a match with Jam Driscoll
before the National Sporting Club. Dris
c@lt and Moran were under the same man-
e@gement in this country and therefore could
not meet. They never have fought to
settle the question of supremacy, which
has caused a world of speculation. If the
Tandon chib succeeds in tnatching them
for a twenty round bout American sportin
men willawait the outcome with unbounde
interest.

itching of Charles Radbourne for the
