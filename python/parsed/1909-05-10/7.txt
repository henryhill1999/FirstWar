Such {deal weather 00 conditions as pre-
vailed in this neighborhood last week
were not of course dispersed in equal
degree over the entire country, but they
were pretty nearly so and their effect
was in the highest degree favorable to
agrioultural and general business inter-
esta. Our Western friends who are en-

aged in a lively speculation for the rise
f wheat and are trying to bring to the
front anything in the nature of a crop
soare that they can tried to make us be-
lieve that crop prospects were seriously
affected last week by hot winds and dry-
neas in western Kansas, despite the recent
cold weather and drenching rains. But
talk of this kind amounted to but little.
The one great factor in the crop situation
at the moment is that the weather of the
last ten days has allowed seeding opera-
tions in every section of the country to
pass or practially pass to a successful
completion, while the warm weather and
clear skies have immensely helped the
growth of grain already planted. That
substantial reason exists for a high range
of wheat prices in the present year and in
all probability for the indefinite future
is beyond dispute, and the real basis that
has atimulated speculative buying of
wheat has been the premium on cash
wheat that exists in every grain market
in the land. Last week, too, the upward

movement in wheat was assisted by large} jineg,

THE FINANCIAL — SITUATION. | to ‘the great tmaptDvtebedt in the physi-

cal status of railway and industrial plants;
to the circumstances already alluded
to of the increased gold production of
the world and the small stocks of goods
on hand in every section, as well as to
numerous other matters the country was
enabled to withstand a shook that on
like occasions in the past left it prostrate.
In proof of this let any large banker in
the United States be asked as to the way
in which commercial paper obligations
and other indebtedness of the sort has
been liquidated in the last ‘year and a
half and the absence of “lame ducks”
in the business would as compared with
the number seen in corresponding times
in former years.

Just as the report of the United States
Steel Corporation for the March quarter
and the news of an advanoe in the list
prices of many steel producta was the
business feature of the week before last,
so the continuing strength of the iron
and steel and copper metals and the an-
nouncement of the long awaited decision
of the Supreme Court of the United States
in the commodity clause case furnished
the feature of the week just ended. The
action of the Supreme Court still leaves
it open to Congress to pass a law prohibit-
ing a railroad company from having an
interest either in whole or in part in any
producing corporation which seeks to
transport ite products over the company’s
It is highly improbable that Con-

buying for the account of Europe, where) gregs in view of all that has happened

it seems crops are getting along poorly.
On Friday came the Government’s May

will ever enact sucha law. The existing
law by which it was thought to accomplish

crop report showing, as intelligent people| the purpose described was passed with

supposed it would, that the storms and
rains of April had helped the winter wheat
| crop rather than hurt it. A question
{ | still to be answered is whether the Gov-
jernment made a mistake earlier in the
| year in its large estimates of the amount
| of wheat in the country left over from last
year’s crop or whether the farmers are
holding these remnants of last year’s
crop for higher prices. Whatever the
truth is about this matter as disclosed by
the event the truth about the general
agrioultural situation is that the con-
'gumption of foodstuffe in the United
States is outrunning their production
and that comparatively high prices for
wheat must be expected in future.
Further, a fact of even greater impor-
tance is that according to trustworthy
evidences consumption of products gen-
erally is going on all the while in the
country at a more rapid rate than is
either commonly estimated or estimated
by many professional calculators or
| observers. Another way of stating it is
that business in the country is a good
| deal better than it is popularly cracked
|up to be, ‘There is no doubt that one
particular reason for this is that the 1907
panio caught manufacturers and con-
sumers for tho most part with light
stocks of goods on hand. A replenish-
ment of these stocks has been necessary
and was necessary even at the height of
the business depression, and such a
state of affairs was not an accompaniment
to previous panic periods in our country's
history. Aesertions that the country's
| business is still in a deplorable state and
that it will be a long time hence before
prosperity dawns for the United States
continue to be uttered by numerous
| pessirnistic commentators. But people
{in Wall Street, using the word in its
| broadest sense, are beginning to discover |
| that this diagnosis..of the case does not |
| fit the enlarged bank clearings, the
| rising prices for steel and iron and copper
and the daily and weekly reports of in-
| creases in railway earnings. , The figures
show, whutever theories may ‘be, that the
| business of the country is now more
| active than it ever was at any time
| previous to the year 1907, and complaints
‘of poor business undoubtedly have in
| great part a certain psychological basis in
the inability of many people to under-
| stand that business may be very good
j even if it is not quite as good as that of
| the best year the country ever saw.

| Expression is still given to the view in
ithe financial district, although not as
| frequently as it was six months ago,
/that the unexampled recovery in busi-
| ness that has taken place since the 1907
panic has been chiefly due to the presence
| of monetary inflation. The subtle influ-
| ence of redundant circulations, it is said,
| has been the chief influence in bringing
this state of affairs about; and it is main-

 

ground that the measure of prosperity
which the country now enjoys istoa very
| great extent fictitious. If it is meant by
| this contention that the fortunate inci-
| dence right at this juncture of the in-
creased volume of the world's gold pro-
| duction has contributed to holding prices
| of securities and commodities at a higher
; level than might otherwise have been the
case a certain amount of attention must
| be paid to the argument; but the infla-
tion that has thus taken place, if any
inflation has at all occurred, has been
caused by such underlying and primary
forces of nature as not to be inflation in
|the ordinary sense of the word. If it
| is pointed out that a speculative stock
| market may from time to time advance
|so rapidly that it becomes temporarily
topheavy and must suffer occasional and
substantial setbacks no thinking man
|-will deny the fact. But if it is seriously
| held that the renaissance in the country's

| eighteen months is solely a mere froth
of speculation, cannot be expected to last
and must in all probability soon disap-
pear, the opinion is absurd. Those over
+ whose minds it exercises sway are still,
as seems, enthralled in the bonds of those
expectations regarding the course of
business after the 1907 panic, drawn
from the misleading and imperfect analo-
| gies of the past. Let it first be noted that
lee sole ground for the declaration that
| there has been a money inflation in the
| country lies in the fact that there has
| been an increase of less than $150,000,000
‘in the stock of money in circulation
in the country in the two years since May
1, 1907. As pointed out in this column

 

_...._. | last week, more than one-third of this

|inerease has been in gold, $50,000,000
has been gathered into the trust com-
panies of New York alone as dead money
in the shape of additional reserve fund,
and a further large quantity still exists
in shape practically unavailable for use.
To say that the picking up of business

been due to the relatively small amount
of money thus actually provided is to
make an assertion that does not square

with common sense, The cause of the
failure of events in the United States
lin the years 1908 and 1900 to follow the
path taken after previous great crises |
lof capital in the country was a combina-
_ tion of various economic factors never
; witnessed before and by means of which
the country escaped comparatively un-
jscathed. Owing to the prosperity in the
West because of reasons now abup-
jdantly disclosed and which are of per-

manent nature; to the solidarity of capt-
ta] that has come about in recent years |

which enabled the business structure |
to present a firm and united front in|

similarly rivalled to oat ;
al ly rive tbe panic birlwind,

 

little debate or even thought. Now that
the nature of suoh an enact ment is clearly
defined effective opposition to it will
undoubtedly be presented in future. The
essential point established by the Supreme
Court's decision was, however, a right
which has been steadfastly maintained
as legal in this column,-that « railroad
company also engaged in the business
of mining coal or producing other oom-
modities can sell that commodity at the
point of production if it wishes and then
as a common carrier transport the article.
This in itself is a broad and satisfactory
settlement of the matter so far as the
railroad companies are concerned and
one entirely irrespective of all disoussion
as to the rights of holding companies. The
“commodities clause” agitation is there-
fore a thing of the past, and so let us hope
will soon be the tariff debate in Congress.
The time of Congress last week was prac-
tically devoted to the speeches of two mal-
contents who are making a grand stand
play in their opposition to the tariff bill.
But as it is believed that these two men
with two others are the only members of
the Senate who have set out to cause
trouble the chance of a speedy passage
of the bill is really greater than appears.
