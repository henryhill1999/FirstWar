BOYLES STILL THREATENING.

Say They'll Expose Man Behind the Whitla
Kidnapping—Nelghbors Interested.
Mercer, Pa., May 9.—Mercer county
and all this énd of Penrisylvania is greatly
interested to-night in the Boyle kidnap-
ping trial. If Judge A. J. Williams should

* heed the advice offeréd by many he

would grant the convicted Boyles new
trials to-morrow and later grant them
a change of venue. At least, the Judge
would permit Boyle and his wife to make
wtetements. before sentence is passed.
Mercer county wants to know “the man
behind” in the Whitla kidnapping case.
Asked to-day for some explanation of
his expression of yesterday while arguing
for Mrs. Boyle, ex-Judge S. M. Miller
eaid he would add nothing, but would |

stand by what he had said. These are |
his words:

“I have been in this court for thirty- |
nine years, but in no case have J seen |
60 mich money or 86 much influence |
brought to bear to prejudice the minds
of jurors before they were sworn.”

Mr. Miller then specified that the county |

papers, read by prospective jurors, had |
theen filled with biassed matter “by some
one for a purpose,” and declared that |
honest people who wanted to read the
-truth about the case had to find it in out- |
side newspapers.

Late last night in his cell James Boyle
dectared that the one desire of his life
was to expose the man responsible for |
, the kidnapping plot and whose name he}
declares the Court has not permitted |
him or his wife to mention. |

“All 1 want is two minutes on the stand
in that court roorn and I'll make some of
the tony ones of this Mercer county jump
out of the window,” said Boyle. “That
gentleman who framed up this deal but
whoce name is being protected | hear is
not-sleeping well now. He will sleep worse |
before I get through with him, for I in-
jtend to expose him to the world, evan if |
T have todo it from Riverside peniten- |
tiery. He was in court one day and daren't |
.look me in the eye. Why he even sent
letters to this jai! to me threatening to
have me sent to an insane asylum if I
ever mentioned his name. Fine; but I'll |

 

get him.”

Mrs. Boyle said. “ft wish some fair
papers would print this as coming from |
me, that Mrs. Helen Royle thinks kid- |
Depping is not so had as murder, and at |
jeast we did not throw the child from a |
fourth &tory window. This is ambiguous |
of course to the outside world but there |
is one gentleman who understands what }
I pene. Yes, he will understand, and
will grbw more white perhaps. Phe world |

in good time will know all about this too. | °

If they wi!) give me a chance to-morrow
Iiwill uncover the man in spite of fate. |
All those who have busied themselves |
with this case know who 1 mean. Let’)
him stend forth and not permit an inno- |
oent woman tobe sent to prison for his
crime.”

IRVINE HITS AT CARNEGIE.

Says Pittsburg Is the Ready Answer te
the Ironmaster's Book.

The Rev. Alexander Irvine, parlor
Socialist, in the pulpit of the Rev. Percy
Grant's church last evening talked of
“Pittsburg, the Answer to Mr. Carnegie's
Book.” Mr, Irvine seemed to think that
Pitteburg was so much of an answer that
there was nothing left of the book, and he
begged Mr. Carnegie not to perpetrate
another book while the Pittsburg the
world knows is on the map.

“Mr. Carnegie's story of the eight hour
day,” said Mr, Irvine, “does not seem to
hold very well in his own industry, for
out of 17,000 men there only 120 have an
eight hour day; the others work a twelve rep that

PENNSYLVANIA RAILROAD

Bulletin.
RELIABILITY OF THE PENNSYLVANIA SPECIAL.

The test of a railroad time table is the daily perform-
ance of the train. The printing of a schedule is a matter of
ink and paper; the maintenance of it a matter of skillfuf’
operation.

The actual record of the ‘‘ Pennsylvania Special”. between
New York and Chicago is eighteen hours on three hundred
and twenty-eight days out of three hundred and sixty-five.

Such a record means unparalleled reliability. It is of
vital importance to every business man to punctyally keep
his engagements; and when he knows that the train. that
leaves New York to-day at 3.55 P. M. will put him in Chicago
to-morrow morfing at 8.55, and leaving Chicago at.2.45.P. M.
will put him in New York again at 9.45 the next moming, he
naturally selects that train for his trip. That is: why an
, increasing number of business men are using the “Pennsylvania
Special” every day—because it has an unexampled record for
keeping on time.

Reservations can be made until 10 P. M. any day, Sun-
days and holidays, by 'Phoning “Madison 1eg2.”

The Pennsylvania is also the shortest lima between New
York and Chicago, a gs

BOY IN AUTO BADGERS POLICE.

Arrested fer Reckless Driving at Coney,
He Speeds Away, but Is Caught.

Five young men in a touring car had a
lot of fun running around through the
crowd at Coney Island yesterday after-
noon, narrowly missing a trolley and
giving two mounted policemen a hard
tun before they were caught. The boy
who was driving the machine was locked

‘| Edward Morris of 346 Weat Fifty-seventh

street and William Miller of 104 West
Siaty-first street. They ranged in age
from 19 to 24 years.

The machine was firat noted going
through Surf avenue at a ively clip but
without mishap. People sourried out
of the way and Mounted Policeman
Butler took after the car. He caught
up with it, told Tucker he was under
arrest and Tucker. so Butler said, put
on more epeed. He turned into West
Eighth street, slowed up a bit for the
police station and then went ahead faster
than before. As they passed the police
stables Butler was joined by Mounted
Policeman Collins.
