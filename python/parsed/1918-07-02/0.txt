Special Despatch to Tar Sev.

WasHtncton, July 1.—President Wil-
wn wants authority to take over the
telegraph and telephone lines of the |
country as he did the railroads. His in-
dorsement. made known to-day, of a /{
pending measure that would give him
@lscretionary power over such lines is
believed to have been hastened by the
trouble between the Western Union and
some of its employees, although the
President 'n his letter of indorsement
makes no reference to this matter.

The Secreiaiies of War and the Navy
and the Postmaster-Genera)] backed up
the President in urging Congress imme- |
diately to confer the necessary power on ain
the Chief Executive.

Postmaster-General Burleson long has |
heen pressing the President to come out
for Government control of the telegraph |
and telephone lines and it ts generally
believed here that if Congress passes |
the enabling legislation the lines will be |
taken over whether a strike eventuates |
or not,

There is much speculation in aes
ington as to whom the President would
delegate administrative powers for the
operation and control of the wire com-
panies. While Postmaster-General Burle-
son consistently has favored the taking

ver of the wire companies as a natural |
part of the postal service of the country |
the telegraph lines particularly are more |
or lees allied with and follow the right |
of way of the railroads.

'

 

McAdoo May Get Control.

In many quarters it is regarded as
\kely that they will be placed in the
hands of Director-General of Railroads
McAdoo, who has gained a fund of ex+
perlence in the last six months, Such a
course is probable if the Government
takes over the lines as it did the rail-
roads, for the period of the war. |

\ Government administration super-
tmposed on the telegraph companies as
tn the case of the’ railroads is favored if
control is limited.

In the House Representative Aswell ;
(La.) introduced a regolution to-day to
give the Government control. An effort
was made to hurry the resolution
through the House Interstate Commerce
Committee but some of the more con-!
eervative members insisted on hearing |
someth'ng about the proposal before
taking action, The need for haste is the j
strike of Western Union employees set
for July 8 Senator Sheppard (Tex.) in-
troduced a similar resolution in the Sen-
ate. ;

High ofMficiais of the Administration
will explain in detail to-morrow morn-
ing to the House Interstate Commerce
Committee the need for the radical ac-
tion proposed in the Aswell resolution
and backed up by President Wilson. The
hearing will be behind closed doors.

Incidentally as a result of the saanadeel
certain action of the House on the As-
well resolution and the possibility of
water power legislation being enacted
soon the hopes of a vacation for
most members of the House and the |

 

\er

tre Senate, while the Ways and Means
Committee hammerse out a new tax “pill,
are growing dimmer.

May Shorten Recess.

Leaders on both sides are convinced |
the debate incident to the Aswell reso-
lution and the efforts which are sure to
be made to amend Jt will tle the House
up 80 that a recess of euy considerable
tme is out of the quustion. .

The Aswell resolution follows:

Resolved, by the Senate and House
of Representatives of the United States ©
Bates of America in Congress assem-
bied, that the President, if in hie dis-
discretion it is deemed desirable in
order to insure their continuous opera-
tion or to guard the secrecy of mili-

‘ary and governmental communica-
tions or to prevent communication by
*pies and other public enemies or for
Other military or public reasons, shall
have power to take possession and
control of telegraph, telephone, marine
sable or radio systems and operate the
same subject to those conditions of
law. so far as applicable, which are in
force as to steam railways while un-
der Federal control.

There is little doubt that once the
Power js given to the President it will
be awiftly applied. This was made clear
to-day by the communication sent by
the President to the chairman of the
House Interstate Commerce Committee.
This letter said:

ALLIES ARE CONFIDENT |

 

|Pershing Reports Hot Skir-
mishes, With German Ar-
tillery Active.

 

WasHINGTON, July 1.—Resumption of |
, the German offensive on the west front

Officials here. Gen. Pershing’s reports
French and British advices
from the front have shown increasing
enemy activity day by day, Mmdicating
that the Germans are preparing for an-
other assault.

There are great stir and movement
among the Germans before the Ameri-
can lines around Chateau Thierry. Part
of the drive may be directed against this
front in a renewal of the thrust al Paris
through the Compiegne gateway.

shoulder to shoulder
again to block the road.

Secretary Baker disclosed to-day that |

organization of the First Army Corps
under Major-Gen. Hunter Liggett prob-
ably had been completed, although he
made no announcement.

Divisions Are Cooperating.

“I suspect,” the Secretary said in re-
ply to a question, ‘that several of our
divisions are operating together as an
army corps undexy command of Gen.
Liggett. Whether any other divisions
| have been created into an army corps
and a tenative army corps commander
chosen [ have not heard.”

It was learned also that the First,
Second and.Thitd divisions ‘TRégulary,
commanded respéctively by Major-Gens.
Bullard, Omar Bundy and
Joseph T. Dickman, are included in the
first corps, affd ali are either at Chateau
Thierry or at Cantigny.

The corps organization plan, however,
calls for six divisions, four combatant
and two replacement, and with the nec-
essary artillery units and other addi-
tional troops the total strength of a
corps would be nearly 220,000 men. Un-
doubtedly Gen. Liggett has all the ele-
ments necessary for his corps if his
organization is complete.

Blow to Be Heaviest Yet.

With this army corps in the theatre
where great events are believed to be
impendidg the expected German thrust
assumes new significance here. The
opinion is general among officers that
the blow :ow in preparation is to be
the hea\.est yet struck. Unless they
mistake the signs, the Germans are get-
ting ready for the crucial moment
their great effort to wrench victory by
force before full American fighting
power can be brought to bear against
them.

The belief of Gen. March, Chief of
Staff, that the allted situation is “ex-|
tremely favorable.” as expressed in a
carefully weighed statement last Satur-
day, is believed to be shared by the al-
Ned. leaders. The speed with which
American troops have been rushed to
France probably has played a large part
in the confidence, both here and in the
allied countries, that this new thrust of
the Germans will fail, as have the last
two.

There is every reason to believe that
by the Fourth of July more than a
million American troops will have gatled.
An official announoement to that effect as

ja part of the Fourth of July celebration
jis to be expected.

Allied Lenders Confident,

The fact that five American divisions
have completed training with the British

nd been restored to Gen. Pershing since
last March is another sign of the speed
with which Gen. Foch is being supplied
with fighting man power, The recent
stabbing thrusts of the French and Brit-
ish at the enemy lines in Flanders and
southwest of Compiegne are regarded as
showing the entire confidence of the al-
lied leaders in the outcome, although
weeks or months of bitter fighting may
be in store.

Secretary Baker had no advices to-
day to show that formation of the first
field army under Gen. Liggett had been
entirely completed. Gen. Liggett is re-
garded as the logical organizer and com-
mander of the first army, as he was Gen.
Pershing’s selection. The rank of Lieu-
tenant-General probably will go with the
command.

Presumably Gen. Liggett's corps is
regarded now as @ part of Gen. Per-
shing’s mobile forces, as distinct from
troops in the army organization which
is being built up to take over a definite
American sector of the battle front. The
appearance of American troops at five
points along the line between St. Mihiel

and ‘the Swiss border indicates that
this whole stretch of 150 to 200 miles
of the front ts being rapidly Ameri-
canized. The definitely placed American
sector from the vicinity of St. Mihiel to
the Moselle River is included, and at
present is the left flank of the whoie
which the Americans seem des-
tined to hold when they come fully into
; position on the right of the line.

If these indications are correct

lowed by a corps of what might be de-

scribed as

professional burglars—men

armed with jimmies, crowhats and
housebreaking and looting tools of every

accounta of systematic robbery carried
on by the invader.

The officer barons of tie Gerina:

and unwounded warrior, Prince Eitel,
are especially active in looting homes.
Their motto, as applied to their own

“These genteel burglars,” to quote a
pee correspondent, “systematically
rob tight and left as soon as their men
have trampled over the country in front
