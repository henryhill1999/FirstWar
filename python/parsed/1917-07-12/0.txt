Wilson appealed to-night to the coun-
try’s business interests to put aside
avery selfish consideration and to give
their aid to the nation as freely as
those who go-out to offer their lives
on the battlefield. In a statement ad-
dressed to the coal operators and man-
ufacturers he gave assurances that
just prices will be paid by the Govern-
ment and the public during the war,
but warned that no attempt to extort
unusual profits will be tolerated.

“Your patriotism,” says the Presi-
dent's appeal, “is of the same self-
denying stuff as the patriotism of the
men dead and maimed on the fields of
France, or it is no patriotism at all.
Let us never speak then of profits and

Senate Cuts Ont Provision Put-

Wasuincron, July 11.—The portal
for the introduction of political prefer-
ment in licu of merit as the standard
for appointments to the various major |
and minor offices of the proposed food
administration bureau was written into
the pending food control bill to-day. By |
a vote of 38 to 24 the Senate adopted
the provision appropriating $2,500,000
for the salaries of officials and struck
out the provision which the House had
included under which these appoint-
ments were to have been made from
the ranks of the civil service and under
civil service rules.

The proposal was warmly attacked by |
Senator Lodge, who alleged that the |
action proposed in the Senate was a
flagrant and unjustifiable attempt to
load the new bureau with partisans of
the Administration and to pay political
obligations.

“To resort to partisanship, to draw
party lines, in making these appoint-
ments is to put food control in serious
peril,” said Senator Lodge. “It is in-
jecting politics into a war measure in

| the most offensive way imaginable.”

\
Penrose Arraigns Democrats.

Senator Penrose also entered the dis-
cussion and arraigned the majority for
intruding politics or the opportunity for
the Administration to indulge in politi-
cal debt paying.

“It is done to provide sinecures for |

JUNK MAN MAKES HISTORY.

U. 8S. Seizes Stolen Congressional

Journal From Pedler.

WASHINeTON, July 11.—The original |
journal of the Twenty-fourth Congress, |
bearing the long hand account of the’
proceedings of the House during the
Administration of President Andrew.
Jackson, appeared at the Capitol to-day
in the hands of a junk man who wanted |
to sell it to the Government. It was
commandeered promptly by Jerry South, |
Clerk of the House, who said it had been |
stolen from the Government many years |
ago. '

Any payment for its return, he de-
clared, would jeopardize the safety of
other official files, so the junk man got |
nothing. The document came from a}
woman who explained that it had been |

handed down in her family.

OMictal Statements.

The official statements follow:

Russian—In the direction of Dolina
yesterday we continued the pursuit
northwestward (toward Lemberg) of
the retreating enemy, who had been
broken by Gen. Korniloff's army on the
Jezupol-Stanislau-Bogordchan front.

At midday our gallant troops, led
by Gen. Tcheremisoff, took the town of
Halicz, Advance detachments were
thrown across to the left bank of the
Dniester. Toward evening our troops
reached the valley of the river Lom-
nica on the front from the mouth of
the river to Dobrovlany, and advance
detachments crossing over after a
short engagement to the left bank of
the river occupied the villages of Blud-
niki and Babin,

Our troops advancing on the’ Bogor-
dchan-Zolotvin front, having broken
down the resistance o1 the enemy,
reached the line of Posiecz-Lesiuvka-
Kosmacz.

In the course of the day we cap-
tured more than 2,000 prisoners and
about thirty guns. Altogether in the
three days battle from the 8th to the
10th in the direction of Dolina we
took prisoner more than 150 officers
and 10,000 men, Our captures also
include about eighty guns, twelve of
them of heavy calibre, and a large
number of trench mortars and ma+
chine guns and a@ large quantity of
engineering material and mititary
stores,

On the remainder of the front there
has been artillery firing, which was
more intense in the direction of Zloch-
off and south of Brzezany. Pl
