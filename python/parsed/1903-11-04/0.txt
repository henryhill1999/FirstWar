PANAMA IN REVOLT.

Proclaims Her Independence of
Colombia.

WANTS US TO BUILD THE CANAL.

Washington Not Surprised and
Marines Are Landed.

 

The Nashville Now at Colon and the
Dixie at Kingston—Other Warships
Ordered to the Soene After a Con
ferenoe at The White House —
United States Bound by Treaty to
Keep Trafic Open Across the Isthmus
—Defeat of the Canal Treaty at Bogota
Inflamed the People of Panama, Who
Have Long Had Grievances Against
the Gevernment Met at Bogota.

WASHINGTON, Nov. 3.--This cable mes-
aage, received by the State Department,
was given out at the White House to-night
after a conference between the President
and Secretary Hay:

“An uprising took place at Panama to-
night. Independence was proclaimed. The
Colombian army and navy officers were
made prisoners. A government was to be
organized, consisting of three Consuls and
e@ cabinet. It was rumored at Panama
that a sim#ar uprising was to take place
at Colon.”

The following semi-official statement was
issued to-night:

“A number of confused and conflicting
despatches have been received from the
Isthmus of Panama indicating rather
serious disturbances at both Panama and
Colon. The Navy Department has de-
apatched several vessels to these ports, with
directions to do everything possible to keep
the transit open and maintain order along
the line of railroad.”

AMERICAN MARINES LANDED.

As the result of a conference at the’ Bx-
ecutive offices of the President between
President Roosevelt and a number of State
Department and Navy Department officials,
the cruiser Atlanta and the training ship
Dixie were ordered to Colon and the cruiser
Boston to Panama. The gunboat Nashville
arrived at Colon yesterday and has landed
marines and bluejackets for the purpose
of carrying out the treaty pledge of the
United States to prevent interruption of
traffic across the Isthmus.

Not the slightest doubt is felt here that
the acute cause of the insurrection was the
action of the Colombian Congress in
rejecting the Panama Canal treaty. The
people of the Isthmus are almost’ unani-
mously tn favor of the construction of the
canal by the United States, and {t has been
frequently asserted that if the treaty were
defeated at Bogota, the State of Parama,
and probably the adjoining State of Cauca,
would secede and make terms with the
United States for building the {ist&mian
waterway.

CONFERENCE WITH THE PRESIDENT,

The firat news that there had been an
uprising at Panama came in a cable mes-
sage received at the State Department
shortly before 10 o’clook to-night. Its
contents were immediately communicated
to the President, who lost no time in call-
ing a conference of State and Navy Depart-
ment officiala.

These were Secretary Hay, Assistant
Secretary of State Loomis, Assistant Secre-
tary of the Navy Darling and Rear Admiral
Taylor, chief of the Bureau of Navigation.
Lieutenant-Commander Winslow and Lieut.
Belknap of the Bureau of Navigation were
also sent for.

It did not take the President and the
other officials long to determine what course
to pursue. Realizing that the insurrection
was serious, they décided to send warships
to both Colon and Panama for the purpose,
not only of protecting American inter-
ests, but of landing men to preserve
the freedom of traffic between Panama
and Colon as required by the treaty of 1846
between the United States and New Gre-
nada, now Colombia. Instructions to the
commanders of the vessels named were
accordingly prepared, and these were put
inte cipher by Lieut. Belknap and placed
on the telegraph wires.

COLOMBIAN GENERALS PRISONERS.

In one of the despatches received from
Panama it was said that Gens. Tobar and
Amaya of the Colombian Army, with troops
evidently sent to the Isthmus in anticipa-
tion of the revolutionary outbreak, had
landed at Panama this morning from the
Colombian gunboat Cartagena, and that
Tobar and Amaya were made prisoners
to-night.

In addition to ordering the Atlanta, the
Boston and the Dixie to the Isthmus, in-
structions were telegraphed to Rear Ad-
miral Glass, commanding the Pacific squad-
ron, now at Acapulco, Mexico, 1,600 miles
from Panama, to hold his vessels in readi-
ness for service in the isthmian waters.

Admiral Glass has with him at Acapulco
the cruiser Marblehead, Commander T. 8.
Phelps; the monitor Wyoming, Commander

V. L. Cottman, and the gunboat Concord,
Commander C. P. Perkins. The Atlanta,
Commander W. H. Turner, is due at King-
ston, Jamaica, 546 miles from Colon.
WASHINGTON HAD EXPECTED IT.

« several days, perhaps longer, the
st Department has been aware that a

political disturbance was impending on the
Isthmus. Its denial of the report that the
hand of seventy armed men who landed
on the Colombian coast seventy miles north

of Colon within the week were Nicaraguans, |

indicates that it had knowledge of the
purely internal movement. There are
other things which show that the State
Department was expecting trouble on the

eae eee

 
 

 
 

en one oon eee

isthmus, At its instance the Navy Depart-
ment sent the United States training ship
Dixie, with 400 marines on board, to Kings-
ton, Jamaica, which is within two days
steaming of Colon, and the gunboat Nash-
ville was ordered from Kingston to Colon.

So well posted was the State Department
on the’ prospects of an outbreak that yes-
terday it sent an inquiry on the subject
to Mr. Malmros, the United States Consul
at Colon. His answer was received to-day.
It did not surprise the Department
officials. Ina measure it was pleasing news,
fer it justified their action in sending the
Nashville to Colon.

Washington despatches to THE Sun,
some of them sent several months ago, have
told of advices received here from agents
of the Government on the Isthmus that
there was a decided sentiment among the
people in favor of seceding from the United
States of Colombia, and that this sentiment,
might result in an outbreak if the Panama
Canal treaty were rejected by the Colombian
Congress.

There are other reasons, too, which
the people of the Isthmus urge against
the Federal Government. They say that
the rest of Colombia has been assisted
materially at the expense of the Isthmus,
laws having provided for applying Isthmian
revenues to the benefit of other States.
The latest instance of this kind, it is said,
was the revocation of rights which the
Isthmus had in salt mines and the transfer
of revenue from this source to the general
treasury.

All these things have tended to foment
the spirit of dissatisfaction on the Isthmus,
With the rejection of the Panama Canal
treaty the boiling over stage was reached.

OUR ATTITUDS.

Naturally those behind the present in-
surrectionary movement hope to gain the
assistance of the United States, which is
anything but kindly disposed at this time
to the Colombian Government, Under or-
dinary circumstances there would be no
hesitation {n making the assertion that
the Administration in Washington would |
preserve a strictly neutral attitude. in |
view of the known irritation of the Presi-
dent and his advisors over the rejection |
of the canal treaty, it is better, perhaps, |

in this instance to confess ignorance of
what the Government's course will be.

The treaty between the United States
of America and New Granada (the United
States of Colembia, successor), which went |
into operation nearly sixty years ago, pro- }
vided that the Washington Government |
should at all times maintain free trattio |
on the Isthmus of Panama. Under this
treaty the United States Government has
on several occasions landed marines jand 1
bluejackets on the Isthmus during political ,
outbreaks and prevented theinterruption of |
traffic between Colon and Panama. What |
recults from the presence of a large body of |
result from the presence of a large body of |
American troops on the Isthmus at this time, |
with the entire personal, if not the official, |
sympathy of the Adrainistration with the |
revolutionists, may only be conjectured. |
But it is not an exaggeration to say that the j
Administration feels that the rejection of |
the Panama Oanal treaty by the Colombian
Congress was a breach of good faith toward |
the United States. As every one who has |
read history knows, breaches of good faith
have frequently caused war,

After the end of the three years’ tnsur-
rection last year, the Colombian Govern- |
ment withdrew all but a mere handful of |
troops from the Isthmus and conoentrated
them at and near Bogota, While some
estimates place the number of Colombian |
troope on the Isthmus at 500, it is believed
here that there are not half that number.
During a recent abortive mutiny at Panama,
the number of troops there was given as
eighty. Most of the Isthmian soldiers
have been sent to the place where the band
of supposed revolutionists landed, and as
it will take several weeks to get any con-
siderable military force from Bogota, the
Isthmian separatists have chosen the most
propitious moment for their outbreak.
There is no easy land communication be-
tween the interior of Colombia, where Bo-
gota js situated, and the Isthmus. Troops
must be sent overland to Buena Ventura,
on the coast, and thence to the Isthmus
by steamer. This journey takes more thaa
a month.

The Caribbean squadron, under Rear
Admiral Coghlan, whose flagship is the
famous Olympia, Capt. Henry W. Lyon,
has received orders to sail from Norfolk
for Guantanamo about Noy. 26. This
squadron was formed for the purpose of
protecting American interests in the West
Indies and along the east coast of Latin-
America as far south as Venezuela. The
orders for it to go to Guantanamo had
nothing to do with the Isthmian trouble.

PANAMA SECEDED ONCE BEFORE.

This is not the first time that Panama has
seceded. The republic of New Granada
was founded in 1831. Ten years later the
Prevince of Cartagena seceded, and was
followed by Panamyu and Veragua declaring
themselves independent, under the title
of the State of the Isthmus of Panama,
They soon returned totheunion. The Con-
stitution was reformed in 1853 and the right
granted to every province to declare itself
independent and to enter only into Federal
connection with the central government.
Panama quickly took advantage of this

 

permission. The republic was reorganized

under the name of United States of Colombia

in 1861.

OPEN POOLROOMS BY APRIL 1?

Jcrome Assistant Makes a Bet With Jimmy
Churchill.

Assistant District Attorney Lord, who
helped to get ex-Sergeant Jim Churchill
dismissed from the police force, walked
into Churchill's green light saloon on
Broadway, near Fortieth street, last night
after the election retuins had begun to come
in, and asked Churchill if he was satisfied
with the way things were going.

Churchill, who is 6 feet 8 inches, looked
down on Mr. Lord, who is 5 feet 4, and said
that Mr. Lord ought to be satisfied, too.

“I'll bet you this,” said Churchill—“that
there won’t be a poolroom open in New .
York city on Feb. 1. ‘here’s 300 of them
doing business to-day, know,”
added.

“I won't take that,” said Mr. Lord, “but
T will bet you a suit df clothes—and I'm |
giving long odds, at that, considering our |
comparative sizes—that there will be plenty
of poolrooms open on April 1.

Churchill took the bet.

OHIO GOES 120,000 REPUBLICAN

 

HERRICK ELECTED GOV ERNOR-
HANNA TO BE SENATOR.
Hamilton County Gives 30,000 Plurality

for Herrick—The UCLegislature Over-

whelmingly Republican—Democrats
Lose in All Doubtful Counties.
CoLtumBus, Ohlo, Nov. 8.—Myron T.

Herrick of Cleveland, the Republican
dandidate for Governor, was elected to-
day over the single tax Mayor, Tom L.
Johnson of Cleveland, by a plurality of
more than 129,000. In the districts that
have been considered doubtful by leaders
of both parties a steady Republican gain
over two years ago is shown by the
returns,

Franklin county, of which Columbus is
the county seat, shows the Johnson follow-
ers stronger than was believed. In the
face of this, however, the entire county
Republican ticket will be elected.

Hamilton county, in which Cincinnati is
situated, gives Herrick for Governor an
exceptionally large vote, with a plurality
of at least 25,000. Cuyahoga county this
time shows the Johnson-Bryan ticket far
behind, Ottawa county, which has been
a Democratic stronghold, shows a Repub-
lican gain in all parts.

Lucas county, the home of Mayor “Golden
Rule” Jones, shows the trips of Johnson
in his “Red Devil” in the northwestern part
of the State to have been a losing game.
Eastern Ohio has piled up an immense vote,
mainly Republican, Columbiana county,
which has been considered a doubtful county
because of the inroads made in municipal
elections by the Prohibitioniste, went for
the Republican State ticket.

The Legislature will be Republican by a
good majority. This insures Senator Hanna
another term in the United States Senate.

During the past fortnight the Johnson
element lost ground in many quarters, and
not until a few days ago did they recognize
this fact. This tells the story of 100,000
plurality for Herrick.

CINCINNATI, Nov. 8.—At 10 o'clock to-
night it appears to be only a question of
figures and speculation as to what
the Republican majority will be. Com-
plete returns have been received from 140
precincts, of which Johnson carries only
two. Those were in wards where popu-
listic sentiment has reigned for several
years. Jt was a solar plexus blow that the
electors of Hamilton county administered
to Johnson.

At Republican headquarters, where every-
thing is red fire and true blue enthusiasm,
estimates based on returns from two-thirds
of all the precincts of the city indicate that
Johnson will receive less than 15,000 votes
in the city proper, where Bigelow, who
led the ticket last spring, received 17,000.
It appears that Herrick has received a
greater average plurality than that ob-
tained by Mayor Fleischmazn last spring.
One-fifth of all the Cincinnati precir cts
show Flerrick's gain to be 1,100 over Fleisch-
mann's majority.

As early as 8 o'clock George B. Cox gave
out this statement over his signature:

“It appears from present indications
that Col. Myron T. Herrick has carried
Hamilton county by between 22,000 and
25 ,000.""

CLEVELAND, Ohio, Nov. 3.—Senator
Hanna, and Myron 'T. Herrick and Mavor
Tom L. Johnson, gubernatorial candidates,

| voted early here to-day about 9 o'clock
| Mayor Johnson voted at 8:50 o'clock and
; then huatied to his fish pond, where he re-

mained the rest of the day. Mr. Hanna was
accompanied to the election booth by Mrs.
Hanna.

“IT am in excellent physical condition,
notwithstanding the hard campaign just
closed, and I am feeling vigorous enough
to start all over again,” said the Senator
after he had voted the Republican ticket.

Prominent Republicans are declaring
to-night that Senator Hanna will be the
next President of the United States. They
are quite open in the assertion that Hanna
will be forced into the fight whether he
wants the nomination or not.

Old Cuyahoga county, Tom_ Johnson's
home, has deserted him and will give Col.
Ferrick a plurality of at least 5,000. The
State has gone Republican by more than
100,000. It is the worst defeat a Demo-
cratic candidate has ever experienced in
Ohio and is the greatest of personal vic-
tories for Senator nna,

 

LABOR MAYORS REELECTED.

Mulvihill] of Bridgeport and Charters of
Ansonia Have Reduced Maforities.

BRIDGEPORT, Conn., Nov. 8.—Denis Mul-
vihill, the stoker Mayor, was reelected to-
day for another term of two years by a
majority estimated at 2,000. Last year he
had 3,000. The Democrats swept the city
and only two Aldermen were elected by the
Republicans out of their entire ticket, ex-
cepting the minor offices, where nomina-
tions were equivalent to an election.

Mulvihill’s reelection is believed to he
due in a great measure to the mud-slinging
of certain independent newspapers which
heaped abuse and ridicule upon him
throughout the campaign, and roused the
workingmen to activity in his behalf.
“Rugged honesty” was again the slogan,
and on a platform of economy and home
rule he carried the day. The independent
voters and conservative Republicans as-
sisted in his election.

Ansontza4, Conn., Nov.3.—Mayor Stephen
Charters, the labor Mayor of the city, was
reelected to-day by a greatly reduced
majority. In a total vote of 2,370 his ma-
jority was 40. Last year, in about the
saine vote, his majority was 418. City
Treasurer Henry Jordan was reelected by

40 votes.

These are the only members of the labor
union administration reelected. The Re-
publicans elect all the other city officials
by majorities yang ie irom 100 to 250 and

control the Board of Aldermen.

 

REPUBLICAN LOSS IN IOWA,

Factional Fight Cuts Down Gov. Cummins’s
Plurality.

Drs Moines, Ia., Nov. 38.—Returns from
thirty-eight precincte in Iowa at 9 o'clock
give a net Democratic gain of 682, estab-
lishing a ratio of gain of 21 per cent. Should

this be maintained Gov, Cummins’s plur-
ality will be leas than 15,000, or less than

 

' 20 per cent of what it was two years ago,

The voting was light, but was fully as heavy
as Was expecte . * : :

Republicans attribute the falling off
in tLeir plurality to a factional fight against

Cummins, owing to his advocacy of tariff

reform. Polk county, Cummins's home,
shows even a heavier percentage of loss
than precincts from other parts of the
State

Gov. Cummins has been reelected by
approximately 40,000 plurality Republi-
cans, at 11 o'clock, estin ated the nlurality at
53,000, while the Democrais srid that it would
not exceed 8,000. They regata this as a
great victory for Sullivan, their nominee.
Cummins’s plurality two years ago "ves
83,000. ,

 

NEW YORK, WEDNESDAY, NOVEMBER

| MORMON VICTORY IN SALT LAKE.

 

|

 

 

Issue Plainly Drawn and Returns Indicate
Defeat for the Gentiles.

Sat LakkE, Utah, Nov. 3.—After early
returns had shown big gains for the gentile
ticket, returns began to pour in from the
Church districts, which showed — that
the Mormons, of both Democratic and
Republican affiliations alike, had voted
almost solidly for the Mormon ticket.

At 10 o'clock the returns point to a Mor-
mon victory in the hottest municipal elec-
tion in the history of Salt Lake City.

The issues were elearly defined. The
Republicans, led by Senator Thomas J.
Kearns, backed the gentile ticket, while
the Mormon Church supported the Demo-
cratic ticket, which was headed by a high
Mormon. Every Bishop and elder in the
Mormon Church hustled at the polls, More
than a quarter of a million dollars were
wagered on the result. One bet of $50,000
was posted by Martin Mulvey and taken by
the gentile crowd late this afternoon.

The Mormon Church made a desperate
fight to secure control of the city offices.
{t attempted, under the leadership of Sena-
tor Reed Smoot, to nominate the Repub-
lican ticket, but was defeated by Senator
Kearns, who nominated a Gentile ticket,
headed by Frank Knox, a banker. Then
the Mormons captured the Democratic
convention and succeeded in nominating
a Mormon ticket, headed by Richard P.
Morris.

Many leading Mormon Republicans, in-
eluding Gov. Wells, O.J. Salisbury, national
oommitteemnan; Collector of Internal Reve-
nue callister and even Senator Smoot are
charged with having knifed the Republican
ticket.

 

CLOSE NEBRASKA.

Republicans and Fustontsts Each Claim
the State by 8,000.

LINCOLN, Neb., Nov. 8. Nebraska prom-
isea to be very close on Supreme Court
Judge. The Republicans undoubtedly
carry the State for University Regents.
Barnes, the Republican candidate for
Judge, was knifed in many districts.

Owing to a big rainfall since the polls
closed, the returns are coming in very
slowly. At 10 o'clock only fifty precincts
outside of Lancaster and Douglass counties
had been heard from.

These gave Barnes a plurality of 100, a
Republican loss of about five to the pre-
cinct. A gain of eight to a precinct is
necessary to elect the Democratic candi-
date for Judge.

The Kepublicans and the fusionists each
claim the State by 5,000.

DEMOCRATIC.

MARYLAND IS

Warfield Probably Elected Governor by a
Plurality of 5,000.

BALTIMORE, Nov. 3.--The indications are
that the Democrats have not only carried
the Legislature, but have elected Warfield
Governor by a plurality of 5,000. Balti-
more went Democratic by 4,000.

Incomplete returns from the counties
indicate Democratic gains. The Demo-
crats placed their cash where it did the moat
good. Kent went Democratic by about
100, Hartford 200, Howard 500, Anne Arun-
del 100,

A Democrat will probably succeed
McComas in the United States Senate.

The Kepublicans do not concede the
State to the Democrats.

All reports up to midnight from scatter-
ing precincts in the city show that Warfield,
tlhe Democratic candidate for Governor,
will carry the city by about 2,000 majority.
The reports from these precincts are from
Democratic strongholds and a large num-
ber of ballots were thrown out on account
of defectiveness.

 

RHODE ISLAND DEMOCRATIC,

Indications Point to Gov. Garvin's Reelev-
tton by 2,000 Piurality.

PROVIDENCE, R. I, Nov. 3.—At 11 o'clock
to-night the vote for Goyernor in Rhode
Island was very close, with the indications
pointing to Gov. Garvin's reelection by a
plurality of 2,000. Miller, the Democratic
Mayor of Providence, is reelected by an in-
creased plurality. The Republicans elected
their Mayor in Woonsocket.

The general State ticket aside from Gov-
ernor is in doubt, with the chances favoring
the Republicans.

 

 

KENTUCKY IS DEMOCRATIC,

Gov. Beckham Reelected by an Eatimated
Plurality of 20,000.

FrankFort, Ky., Nov. 3.—Returns here
indicate Gov. Beckham's reelection by from
18,000 to 20,000 plurality and the election of
70 Democratic members of the House,
against 30 Republicans. The Senate will be
composed of 28 Democrats and 15 Republi-
cans.

Gov. Beckham's election will
tested by Col. Morris Belknap, the

Republican nominee, on the ground
of ineligibility. The State Constitution
provides that State officers may not be
reelected. Gov. Beckham, however, was
chosen to fill an unexpired term.

DENVER, Col., Nov. 3.—Colorado has
gone Republican, electing Campbell! Su-
preme Court Judge by a large majority.
The vote is light, particularly in Denver,
which has given Wilson, Democrat, for
Supreme Court Judge about 3,000 plurality.
Thiswill be Latte overcome by the vote of

Essex county, New Jersey, went Republi-
can by 12,000. Newark gave 5,000 Repub-
lican plurality and elected twelve Republi-
can Aldermen in the fifteen wards. Demo-
cratic Aldermen were elected in the Fifth,
Seventh and Twelfth wards. The School
Board vote was the same. Two Republican
street and Water Commissioners, Phillips
and Vinson, were elected.

BATES HAS 40,000 PLURALITY,

WINS MASSACHUSETTS BY 3,000
MORE THAN LAST’ YEAR.

 

Result a Great Surprise te the Hepublican
Managers—Democrats Made Gains in
Citles, but Republicans Gained More
in Towns — The Soctalisie Lose.

Boston, Nov. 8.—-John L. Bates, the
Republican candidate for Governor, was re-
elected to that office to-day by a plurality
of about 40,000 over Col. William A. Gaston,
the Democratic nominee. The entire Re-
publican State ticket won and the Legisla-
ture is heavily Republican, although the
Democrats made slight gains in both
branches,

The Socialists lose two of their three mem-
bers in the House. John Carey of Haver-
hill, the leader of the trio, was beaten by a
Republican. Drew, who was nominated
in Rockland to succeed the late Frederick
G. MacCartney, failed of election, but in
Erockton, Benden was reelected.

The result of the balloting surprised
even the most sanguine of the Republican
managers, none of whom looked for any-
thing better than 25,000 plurality for Bates.
The conservative men who had been in-
fluenced by the charges against Bates
were unable to see how the Governor could
beat Gaston by more than 6,000 and there
were a great many Republicans who really
thought the Democratic candidate would
be victorious.

In Boston, Gaston rolled up a plurality of
about 19,000 carrying nineteen of the twenty-
five wards, Including East Boston, (ov.
Bates'’s home ward. Even Dorchester swung
over to the Democratic column, but former
Congressman Fitzgerald moved out into
that Republican stronghold some time ago
for the express purpose of making it Demo-
cratic, and it appeared that he has suc-
ceeded.

Gaston received 47,252 votes in the entire
city and Bates 28,388. Last year Gaston
received 45,666 and Bates 82,127, so that
the Democratic candidate made a net gain
of 344 per cent., while Gov. Bates suffered
a loss of 1144 per cent. Last year Bates
carried the State by 37,120, his total vote
being 196,276, against 189,156 for Gaston.

The outside cities show a slight gain
for Gaston. Thus far, 808 towns out of
353 give Bates 99,3384 and Gaston 68,97,
a gain of about 74, per cent. for the former
and \% per cent. for the latter. The returns
from the sarne towns show a Joss in the
Bocialist vote.

Senator Lodge listened to the returns at
the Republican State committee's rooms.
He expressed hirnself as satisfied with the
result, saying that he was especially well
pleased over the victory because of the
attacks made personaily upon Gov. Bates.

Gov. Bates went home early and got the
atest returns by telephone. He said that
he considered his victory an indorsement
of President Roosevelt.

GETS A BIG MAJORITY.

to Want to Spend 8500,-
000,000.

Wherever local self-interest could be
convinced that the rebuilding of the Erie
Canel would advance its fortunes a big
vote was polled in favor of the creation of
a State debt of $101,000,000 to begin deep-
ening the bargeway to accommodate 1000,-
ton barges. The arguments of the elevator
men proved effective, and the debt was
authorized by an overwhelraing majority,
the exact size of which will not be known for
two or three days. Here aie the latest

MCLELLAN FOR PRESIDENT.

Henry Walker Presents Him to Indiana
Deniocrats as a Canitidate.
INDIANAPOLIS, Nov. 3.--News of the

election of McClellan as Mayor of New
York hed a magical effect on Democrats
here to-night, and there was much con-
gratulation among them when’ they as-
fembled at the hotels to hear the news.
Former Mayor Taggert was in the crowd
at the Grand Hotel and early this evening
received a telegram from Henry V. Welker,
one of McClellan's campaign managers,
which read:

“New York presents McClellan as Demo-
cratie candidate for President.”

“I told you so,”’ said Taggart to a friend.
“I knew it would come out that way.”

Commenting on McClellan as a possible
candidate he said

“McClellan would appeal strongly to a
large class of voters in the Democratic
party. He comes of old reliable Democra-
tic stock, has himself always been regular,

 

and there are many Democrats who remem- |
ber the splendid record of the father who
would delight in honoring the son.

“His candidacy has appealed

|

sterling qualities of (he man and general |
|

because of the

belief that he will govern the city in the
best interests of the whole people. ‘These
are qualities which appeal to voters in all
campaigns. Ido not doubt that McClellan
would make a good candidate forthe party,
as would several other Democrats who have
been mentioned in that connection.”

 

BALLOTS TOO BIG FOR BOXES.

Citizens of Covington, Ky., Had to Quit |

 

 

Voting Until More Receptacies Came.

CINCINNATI, Nov. 3.--Before 10 o'clock
this morning the election officials of
Covington, Ky., were confronted by a

situation which is probably without prec-
edent. At 9:50 long rows of electors stood
in front of six or seven polling places.
There was no voting being done.

“There is no legal place to put the ballots,”
was the explanation made by the election
judges to the citizens who were awaiting
a chance to vote. “The boxes are full, and
what extra there are we have no keys to.”

The official ballot in the home town of
John G. Carlisle, ex-Secretary of the Treas-
ury, this year resembles what is known in
bill posting parlance as a three-sheet poster.
It was fully one foot wide and three feet
long. When folded it looked something
like a bed sheet which had come home
from the laundry nicely creased and folded.
It did not take many of these to fill the |
legal receptacie for ballots.

Extra boxes belonging to the city were |

The town has voted Tammany back into

private estimates of Charles F. Murphy

Cromwell, is unanimous, every other fi-
sion candidate for Borough President

went to pieces and welcomed “the tiger”

that Grout and Fornes were running quite

WINERS VOTE REPUBLICAN.

 

Vote Goes Againat the Democrats Despite
Gov. Pennypacker's Vetoes.
SCRANTON, Pa., Nov. 8.—An effort was
made at the elections held throughout
the coal regions to-day to induce the United

Mine Workers to vote the Democratic | !

ticket, because of the labor bills that Gov |
Pennypacker vetoed at the last session |
of the Legislature,

The returns from all parts of the county
to-night indicate that the efforts of the
Democrats have failed and that the miners,
in recognition of the efforts of President
Roosevelt to settle the strike, have voted
the Republican ticket almost solidly.

FAGAN REELECTED MAYOR.

Mark M. Fagan, the Republican Mayor |
of Jersey City. was reelected for a term of |

Assemblyman James J. Murphy by a
plurality of 200. The contest was the

A remarkable feature of the election was
fact that the Democratic candidate

Fagan was elected two years ago by a |
majority of 5,058. ‘The normal Democratic |
majority in the city is 3,000 or more. Fa- |

WATERTOWN, N. Y., Nov. 3.—The Mayor-
